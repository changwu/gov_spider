    I congratulate the House of Representatives on the introduction of the "Affordable Health Care for America Act," another critical milestone in the effort to reform our health care system.
This legislation is the product of unprecedented cooperation and countless hours of hard work by Speaker Pelosi, Chairmen Waxman, Rangel, and Miller, Congressman Dingell, and scores of House Members who share my conviction that we can't wait another year for health insurance reform. They have forged a strong consensus that represents a historic step forward.
The House legislation includes critical reforms to the insurance industry so that Americans will no longer have to worry that they will be denied coverage or that their coverage will be dropped or watered down when they need it most. I'm also pleased that the bill includes a public option offered in an exchange. As I've said throughout this process, a public option that competes with private insurers is the best way to ensure choice and competition that are so badly needed in today's market. And the House bill clearly meets two of the fundamental criteria I have set out: It is fully paid for and will reduce the deficit in the long term.
While we know there will—may—more steps and much spirited debate before a bill reaches my desk, I congratulate the House on their work so far, and I'm confident that Members will continue to work together to deliver meaningful reform for America's families and businesses.
