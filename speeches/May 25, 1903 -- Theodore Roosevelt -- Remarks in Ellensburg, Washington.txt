    Let me greet those whom I know. Others will not grudge my specially greeting men of the Grand Army and the representatives of those who did even more than the men of the Civil Warâ€”the women. For, while the man went to battle, to the woman fell the hardest task of seeing husband or lover, father or brother, going to the war, she herself having to stay behind with the load of doubt, anxiety and uncertainty, and often the difficulty of making both ends meet in the household while the bread-winner was away.
