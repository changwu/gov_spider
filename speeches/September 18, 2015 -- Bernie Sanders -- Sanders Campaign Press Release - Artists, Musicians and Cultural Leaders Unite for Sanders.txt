    NEW YORK – U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign on Friday announced that over 125 major artists from all genres of music, comedy, acting, writing, and producing have all endorsed the Democratic Party presidential candidate.
The list includes 128 critically acclaimed men and women who want to see a more progressive America and are willing to work towards it. A small sampling of the names includes actors Will Ferrell and Mark Ruffalo, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, actor and musician Michael "Killer Mike" Render, Margaret Cho, and co-founder of Apple Computer, Steve Wozniak, just to name a few.
"As artists and citizens we believe it is time for government to once again represent the people and not just big money," said writer and director Adam McKay, who with Ferrell, co-wrote and directed the films "Anchorman" and "Step Brothers." "Bernie Sanders is the only candidate speaking against the wide spread legalized corruption that has handed our government to billionaires, large corporations and banks."
Today's massive endorsement list illustrates just how much the senator's message is resonating with people all across the country—from New York City to Los Angeles and everywhere in between.
"Bernie Sanders is a public servant who places people ahead of profit," said legendary guitarist Wayne Kramer. "He understands that, above all, leadership is necessary to move this country beyond its current retrogressive political condition."
Many of the artists on the list have never endorsed a candidate before.
"Right now there is a shift of the generations. Honesty and being in touch with the common man and woman is key," said rap artist and producer Lil B. "This is where Bernie Sanders comes to mind with his essence and truth."
