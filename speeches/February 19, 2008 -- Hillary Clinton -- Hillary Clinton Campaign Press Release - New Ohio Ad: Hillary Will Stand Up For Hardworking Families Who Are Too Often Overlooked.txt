Following is a script for "Night Shift."
[Announcer:] You pour coffee, fix hair, you work the night shift at the local hospital. You're often overworked, underpaid, and sometimes overlooked.
But not by everyone.
One candidate has put forth an American family agenda to make things easier for everyone who works so hard.
Universal healthcare.
Increased daycare.
And help with elder health care.
She understands. She's worked the night shift, too.
[HRC:] I'm Hillary Clinton and I approved this message
