    Q. Mr. President, does it look like you're still going to be going to Moscow at the end of the month?
The President. Well, a lot depends on this meeting that's coming up between the Secretary of State, Foreign Minister Bessmertnykh and Moiseyev -- General Moiseyev. And I've said before that what we want to do is to have a summit meeting with the Soviets. I've also said that I want this START agreement completed. And their coming in here is a good move; it was in response to an appeal I made to President Gorbachev.
So, it's a good thing that they're coming. And the time -- there's plenty of time to get this done so we can have a meeting at the end of July. But whether these last difficulties can be ironed out, we just don't know. But this should be seen as a good sign, whether we get it completed in time for a July summit or not. And I'll have a chance to talk to Gorbachev in London a week from -- well, it's in a few days, 8 days or 9 days.
Q. In other words, Mr. President, you want performance not conversation?
The President. He's got it. Walter, you summed it up far better than -- [laughter]. Thank you for that helpful -- [laughter].
Thank you all very much.
