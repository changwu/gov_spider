Looking like Nick Sandman & Covington Catholic students were treated unfairly with early judgements proving out to be false - smeared by media. Not good but making big comeback!

Nick Sandmann and the students of Covington have become symbols of Fake News and how evil it can be. They have captivated the attention of the world and I know they will use it for the good - maybe even to bring people together. It started off unpleasant but can end in a dream!Retweets: 38014Favorites: 162047

Without a Wall our Country can never have Border or National Security. With a powerful Wall or Steel Barrier Crime Rates (and Drugs) will go substantially down all over the U.S. The Dems know this but want to play political games. Must finally be done correctly.

FBI top lawyer confirms 'unusual steps.' They relied on the Clinton Campaign's Fake & Unverified 'Dossier' which is illegal. 'That has corrupted them. That has enabled them to gather evidence by UNCONSTITUTIONAL MEANS and that's what they did to the President.' Judge NapolitanoRetweets: 25856Favorites: 100625

Never seen @senatemajldr and Republicans so united on an issue as they are on the Humanitarian Crisis & Security on our Southern Border. If we create a Wall or Barrier which prevents Criminals and Drugs from flowing into our Country Crime will go down by record numbers!Retweets: 19978Favorites: 90789

Last time I went to Davos the Fake News said I should not go there. This year because of the Shutdown I decided not to go and the Fake News said I should be there. The fact is that the people understand the media better than the media understands them!Retweets: 25585Favorites: 109108

The reason Sarah Sanders does not go to the 'podium' much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely & inaccurately in particular certain members of the press. I told her not to bother the word gets out anyway! Most will never cover us fairly & hence the term Fake News!Retweets: 39118Favorites: 171367

Former FBI top lawyer James Baker just admitted involvement in FISA Warrant and further admitted there were IRREGULARITIES in the way the Russia probe was handled.

...big Crooked Hillary law firm represented by her lawyer Michael Sussmann (do you believe this?) who worked Baker hard & gave him Oppo Research for 'a Russia probe.' This meeting now exposed is the subject of Senate inquiries and much more. An Unconstitutional Hoax. @FoxNewsRetweets: 30691Favorites: 117932
