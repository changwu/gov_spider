Good morning from a rainy Washington D.C.
FYI: Pool's 9 a.m. call time has been moved back to 11 a.m.
All that is on POTUS' schedule today is a visit by him and FLOTUS to Children's National Hospital:
Here is background material on the visit from the White House:
Background from the White House: President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden Visit Children's National Hospital 
On Friday, December 23, the President and the First Lady will visit Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C. to meet with pediatric patients and their families and thank the doctors, nurses, and staff supporting patients this holiday season. The visit continues the annual tradition of First Ladies visiting Children's National to celebrate the holidays with children and their families. In December 2021, President Biden and Dr. Biden made a holiday visit to Children's National. Last year's visit by President Biden marked the first time a sitting President made a holiday visit to Children's National. Today marks Dr. Biden's third visit to Children's National as First Lady.
Upon arrival, the President and the First Lady will greet with hospital leadership and Emergency Department (ED) staff. This greet will be closed press.
After, the President and the First Lady will host a book reading of The Snowy Day with a group of pediatric patients. Patients will also participate virtually from their hospital room. This year marks the 60th anniversary of the publishing of Ezra Jack Keats's book The Snowy Day.
Finally, the President and the First Lady will visit children and families in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU), and thank staff. This portion of the visit will be closed press.

WH pool report #3 - POTUS spotting
As the pool headed to the vans on the South Lawn driveway at 3:49 pm, POTUS came out of the Oval Office and walked down the Rose Garden sidewalk with a man the pool could not immediately identify.
POTUS was not wearing a coat on this chilly day. He walked into the Palm Room as pool moved to South Lawn driveway.
Pool is now holding in the motorcade ahead of the Bidens' trip to Children's National Hospital.

WH pool report #7 - event details
POTUS and FLOTUS were escorted in the room at 4:51 pm by 5-year-old Miles Barnes (in a green suit) and 10-year-old Aubrey Klinger (in a green dress).
FLOTUS was seated on a red chair in front of a giant Christmas tree. POTUS was on a green cushion chair to her left. Presents and poinsettias surround them.
Both Bidens are wearing face masks as is everyone in the room.
Dr. Biden read The Snowy Day. POTUS helped hold the book up so the kids could see the pictures while Dr. Biden read from it.
"We had a little snow today," she noted before starting the reading.
After she read the story, Dr. Biden thanked everyone for coming and listening to her read while the president held the book.
"That's my job," POTUS said.
He told the crowd the Bidens have spent a lot of time in children's hospitals. "It's going to be okay," he said.
He also addressed a very young girl on her mom's lap (she is 21 months old her mom told your pooler later). "You are so cute, little tyke. You can tell she's working it," he said.
"See you guys," POTUS said as the Bidens left at 4:58 pm.
As always please check the transcript.
The room is festive with three Christmas trees, stacks of presents and rows of poinsettias.
There appear to be about 20 kids in the room and they have adults with them. Two of the children are in wheelchairs. There are also hospital staff present.
The program is being streamed into hospital rooms.

The President and the First Lady host a book reading of The Snowy Day by Ezra Jack Keats.
