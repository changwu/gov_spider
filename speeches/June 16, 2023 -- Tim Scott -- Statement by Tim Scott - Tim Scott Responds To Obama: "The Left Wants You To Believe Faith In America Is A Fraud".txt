    CHARLESTON, SC – Tim Scott responded to former President Barack Obama's comments about Tim, opportunity, and race in America: 
"Let us not forget we are a land of opportunity, not a land of oppression.
"Democrats deny our progress to protect their power. The Left wants you to believe faith in America is a fraud and progress in our nation is a myth.
"The truth of MY life disproves the lies of the radical Left.
"We live in a country where little Black and Brown boys and girls can be President of the United States. The truth is – we've had one and the good news is – we will have another."
Tim spoke at length Wednesday with Mark Levin about how Obama divided Americans, and how he and Biden missed an opportunity to unite the country: "President Biden ran as the great uniter, and he has been the great divider."
