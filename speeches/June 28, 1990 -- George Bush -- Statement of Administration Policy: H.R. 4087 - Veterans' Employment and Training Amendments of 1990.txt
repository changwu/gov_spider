    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Penny (D) MN and Smith (R) NJ)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 4087, which amends existing employment and training programs for veterans. The Administration will, however, seek amendments in the Senate to address the following concerns.
The Administration believes that it is premature to extend the definition of "veteran of the Vietnam era" from December 31, 1991, to December 31, 1996, for the purposes of eligibility for veterans' employment and training programs. It is not apparent at this time that a five-year extension is warranted.
In addition, the Administration does not believe that the statutory creation of a new Advisory Committee on Veterans Employment and Training within the Department of Labor is necessary. The Secretary of Labor already has an advisory Committee on Veterans Employment.
