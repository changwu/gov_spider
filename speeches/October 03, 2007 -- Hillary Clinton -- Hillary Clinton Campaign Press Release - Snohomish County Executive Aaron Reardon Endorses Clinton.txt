    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Snohomish County Executive Aaron Reardon.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to end the war in Iraq and bring our troops home safely," Reardon said. "She is uniquely qualified to hit the ground running on her first day in office and deliver the change this country needs."
Reardon was elected County Executive in 2004, after serving five years in the State Legislature. In his first term, Reardon has closed a $13.4 million deficit without raising taxes and increased the number of sheriff's deputies and prosecutors to combat meth labs and street level crime. His Focus on Farming initiative and Agriculture Action Plan have created new economic opportunities for area farmers while preserving farmlands.
"Aaron is a talented leader who's worked across the aisle to get results," Clinton said. "I'm honored to have his support and delighted he'll help lead our efforts in Washington."
