    Today I am signing H.J. Res. 281, a joint resolution relating to the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary. The Secretary of Commerce designated Cordell Bank as a sanctuary pursuant to a procedure established by the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 (MPRSA). That law allows the Congress 45 days of continuous session to disapprove any part of the designation. In the first section of H.J. Res. 281, the Congress attempted to disapprove the part of the designation allowing the regulation of oil and gas activities within the sanctuary, but it did not present the joint resolution to me until after the review period expired. Thus, that part of the designation was not "disapproved by enactment of a joint resolution of disapproval" within the time period permitted by the MPRSA.
Section 2 of the resolution, however, accomplishes essentially the same objective that the first section would have accomplished. Section 2 prohibits all oil, gas, and mineral activities within the sanctuary. That prohibition becomes law upon my approval of H.J. Res. 281, and it will now govern the management of the sanctuary.
