    Today, as families across Ohio continue to suffer in the face of the pandemic and the economic pain it has caused, Donald Trump is visiting Ohio, not to extend a hand to struggling families, but to try to paper over his record of broken promises to workers and raise money for his campaign. Donald Trump may not want to answer to Ohioans for his failed leadership, but he cannot escape the consequences of his horrific mismanagement of this crisis that has led to more than 90,000 COVID-19 cases in Ohio and left too many workers out of a job and unable to make ends meet.
Donald Trump is desperate to distract from his own failures. But Mr. President, Ohioans see through your attempts to divide us, and they are fed up with your empty promises to stand up for workers and families when all you've done is look out for the wealthy and well connected. It's time for a leader who will tell the truth, lead with integrity, and fight to make Ohioans' lives better every single day. As President, that's exactly what I will do.
