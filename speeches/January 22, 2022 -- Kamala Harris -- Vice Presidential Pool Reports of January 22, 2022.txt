VP travel pool report #1: COVID 
One-off travel pool report today (when the VP has no public events) just to relay the following:
From a White House official:
'On Friday night during the drive from the airport in Los Angeles to the hotel in Los Angeles several members of the vice president's staff were close contacts with a member of the advance team who has since tested positive for COVID.
'No members of the media were close contacts with this individual and the vice president was not a close contact with this individual. The staff members will not travel with the vice president on Monday.
'So her trip is still going forward but those staff members who were close contacts are not going to travel with her.'
