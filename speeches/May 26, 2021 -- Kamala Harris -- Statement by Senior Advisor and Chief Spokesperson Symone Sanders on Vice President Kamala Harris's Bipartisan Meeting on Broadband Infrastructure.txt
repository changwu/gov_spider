    Today, Vice President Harris had a productive conversation with Democratic and Republican members of Congress on the critical importance of investing in our nation's broadband infrastructure. These members have each led on broadband issues for a long time. They represent rural and urban areas and they spoke to the experience of Americans who struggle to access or afford high-speed internet. It was a substantive and informative meeting.
The President and the Vice President have had several meetings at the White House with bipartisan Congressional leaders to discuss addressing the country's infrastructure challenges. They will continue to engage with members of Congress from both sides of the aisle. By connecting every American to affordable and accessible high-speed Internet through investments in the American Jobs Plan, we can connect people to economic opportunity and keep our nation competitive.
