WH Pool Report 1
Good morning from the White House, where outside it is a lovely spring morning, and inside people avoid one another and eye anyone not wearing a mask with apprehension.
The president has on his schedule lunch with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at 1230 and a conference call with "Mental Health Leaders and Advocates" at 1430.
Both are closed press, or at least are closed right now.
There is the daily show at 1700, where the president has made a habit of showing up, at least for the first portion. This will be streamed on the White House web site and carried live by C-SPAN and possibly others.

WH Pool Report 2 -- Briefing room social distancing details
For those interested in the "social distancing" spacing of seats in the White House briefing room:
Before the pandemic, all 49 seats in the room (seven rows, seven seats per row) would be occupied during the rare briefings, with each person no more than a few inches from at least one person and within two feet of as many as eight people.
In the first round of "distancing," this was changed to every other seat, meaning that the typical seat was still barely two feet away from six others.
In this current round, with two occupied seats per row, those with seats are STILL within 3.5 feet of at least one person, and as many as four people for those with interior seats.
Also: A front row TV pool seat is barely six feet away from whoever happens to be standing at the lectern at that moment.
Two date, three journalists that we know of who spent time in the briefing room came down with coronavirus-like symptoms. One tested negative.
Here is the guidance from the CDC web site:
"Stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people"

Per the WH:
Today, President Donald J. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, First Lady Melania Trump, and Second Lady Karen Pence spoke by telephone with hundreds of American mental health professionals, leaders, and advocates to discuss the effects COVID-19 is having on the American people. Today's COVID-19 call was the first to bring these four influential leaders together on one issue.
