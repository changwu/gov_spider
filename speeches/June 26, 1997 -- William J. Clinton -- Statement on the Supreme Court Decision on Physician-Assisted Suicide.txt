    I am very pleased with today's Supreme Court decision which accepted my administration's position that States may ban physician-assisted suicide. The decision is a victory for all Americansâ€”it prevents us from going down a very dangerous and troubling path on this difficult and often agonizing issue.
With today's decision, the Court voices its concern that there is a significant distinction between assisting in death and allowing death to occur. Not only is this an important legal distinction, it is also a distinction of deep moral and ethical implications.
I have a great deal of sympathy and a profound respect for those who suffer from incurable illnesses and for their families. I have had a number of family members die from painful and protracted illnesses. Even so, I have always expressed my strong opposition to physician-assisted suicide. I believe that it is wrong and have always believed it to be wrong.
This issue is unavoidably heart-rendering, and we must never ignore the agony of terminally ill patients, but the Supreme Court made the right decision today. The risks and consequences of physician-assisted suicide are simply too great.
