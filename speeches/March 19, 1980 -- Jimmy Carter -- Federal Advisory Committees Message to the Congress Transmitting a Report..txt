    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the provisions of Section 6(c) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Public Law 92-463), I am transmitting the eighth annual report on the status of Federal advisory committees.
This report reflects a continuation of the efforts to achieve the objectives I set in 1977: to assure that unnecessary committees are terminated, and new committees are established only when they are essential to meet the responsibilities of the government. At the end of 1979:
—The total number of committees was 820;
—Although the number of committees required by statute increased (from 312 to 338), the number established under agency authority decreased (from 246 to 222); and
—Since the beginning of 1977 the total number of committees has been reduced by 339 (from 1,159).
