    Senator Orrin Hatch today made the following statement on President Obama's dismantling of bipartisan welfare reforms:
"Over the last three-and-a-half years, Barack Obama has done nothing to give middle-class Americans shelter from falling incomes, rising costs, or the ever-present fear of losing their jobs or their homes. Now, in another Washington power grab, President Obama has opted to gut the work requirements at the core of the bipartisan welfare reform passed in the 1990s. This is an insult to the American people. Americans will always be there to lend a hand to their fellow citizens in times of need, but a culture of dependency and reliance on government, like the one proposed by President Obama helps no one. Americans deserve a president like Mitt Romney, who has the right background and the right plan to stimulate job creation, encourage economic growth, and strengthen the middle class."
