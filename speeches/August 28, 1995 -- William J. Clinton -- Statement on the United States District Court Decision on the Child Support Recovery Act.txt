    On July 26, 1995, the United States District Court for the District of Arizona struck down the Child Support Recovery Act as an unconstitutional exercise of congressional power. I respectfully disagree with this decision. I asked the Justice Department to review this case, and the Department has filed a motion asking the court to reconsider its decision.
The Child Support Recovery Act gives us the power to punish deadbeat parents who cross State lines to avoid paying child support. It is essential for Federal law enforcement to have this authority because the States cannot bring these criminals to justice, especially the hardcore group of parents who flagrantly move from State to State to evade their obligations.
A child should be able to expect the most basic support from those who chose to bring that child into the world. Parental responsibility does not end at the State line. The taxpayers of America should be able to expect that the burden of caring for these children will be placed on the shoulders of the parents, where it rightfully belongs.
