    WASHINGTON, DC – On January 17, President Obama will convene a meeting at the White House with the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness to discuss initiatives and policies to strengthen the economy, promote and accelerate job growth and bolster America's competitiveness around the world. The President will hear from a variety of leaders and continue the discussion focused on identifying practical ways the government and business can work together to foster growth and create jobs.
The President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness was created to provide non-partisan advice to the President on ways to strengthen the economy and ensure the competitiveness of the United States. The Jobs Council is made up of representatives of various sectors of the economy who offer diverse perspectives from the private sector, employers, and workers on how the Federal Government can best foster growth, competitiveness, innovation, and job creation.
The Jobs Council held their first meeting at the White House on February 24th, focusing on finding new ways to promote growth, encouraging hiring, educate and train our workers to compete globally, and attract the best jobs and businesses to the United States. The Council has held two additional meetings – in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina in June and in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in September.
Additional details on the meeting will be forthcoming.
