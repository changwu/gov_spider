    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Sununu (R) New Hampshire)
The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 4614 which would convey Federal land to the town of New Castle, New Hampshire. H.R. 4614 would convey Federal land, which has not been declared excess, in a manner inconsistent with the process established under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 for the fair and efficient utilization and disposal of excess and surplus Federal property.
