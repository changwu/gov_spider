Recently, Hillary Clinton took some time to thank a group of supporters who've built an awesome community in an unexpected place: Reddit.

"Hello! This is my first time on Reddit -- as you probably could have guessed -- but I wanted to drop in and thank you so much for everything you're doing.
"I know it hasn't been easy, especially here. But people like you are the heart and soul of this campaign. I'm so grateful to have you with me. -H"

People were, of course, excited.


Some were overwhelmed.





But mostly, the comment section was filled with people sharing personal stories about why they support this campaign.











To every member of Team Hillary representing on Reddit (and to Hillary's supporters online and all over the place): We see you, we love you, tooâ€”and we're excited to work with you and help Hillary win the nomination!
