    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Sanford (D) North Carolina and 32 others)
The Administration has no objection to Senate passage of S. 100, which is generally consistent with Administration objectives for Central America. The Administration is already implementing a program in this area that reflects the principal purpose of S. 100 and has helped to create a coordinating mechanism for donors and recipients, i.e., the Partnership for Democracy and Development in Central America.
