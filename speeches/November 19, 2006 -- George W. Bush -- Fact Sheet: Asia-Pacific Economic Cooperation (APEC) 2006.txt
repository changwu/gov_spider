"America has helped contribute to the modern and confident Asia we see today â€“ a region where people's incomes and opportunities are rising, where businesses compete in a global economy, and where citizens know that a world growing in trade is a world expanding in opportunity. In this new century, America will remain engaged in Asia, because our interests depend on the expansion of freedom and opportunity in this region."
