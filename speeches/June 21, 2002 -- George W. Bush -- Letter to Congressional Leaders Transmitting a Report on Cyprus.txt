    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with section 620C(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, I am providing a report prepared by my Administration on progress toward a negotiated solution of the Cyprus question covering the period April 1, 2002, through May 31, 2002. The previous submission covered events from February 1, 2002, through March 31, 2002.
Direct talks on the island between Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash continue under U.N. auspices as they strive to meet their stated objective of a comprehensive settlement by the end of this month. As in past reporting periods, Special Cyprus Coordinator Thomas G. Weston and U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Donald K. Bandler provided diplomatic support to the process. The United States remains committed to the United Nations effort to find a just and lasting settlement to the Cyprus problem.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
