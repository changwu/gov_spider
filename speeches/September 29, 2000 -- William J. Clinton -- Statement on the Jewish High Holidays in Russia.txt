    On behalf of the American people, I want to wish the Jewish community in Russia a happy, enriching, and peaceful New Year. People across the United States are profoundly moved by the flowering of religious life for all faiths in Russia. Jewish life, in particular, is flourishing, with synagogues and Jewish cultural centers opening in regions all across the country.
Russia's support for democratic principles, religious freedom, and inter-ethnic tolerance will have a direct impact on its standing in the international community and our ability to support Russia's international integration.
The United States stands with Russia's Jewish community as it advances the cause of religious freedom, builds a more inclusive society, and counters the forces of hatred and bigotry. In our tightly interwoven world, the advance of freedom in one country strengthens freedom everywhere. Your community's efforts are truly historic. Our hopes and prayers are with you for the coming year. L'Shanah Tovah!
