    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Walgren (D) Pennsylvania)
The administration recommends the enactment of an authorization that would double the National Science Foundation's budget during the fiscal years 1988-1992 as proposed by the President in Title II of H.R. 1155, the "Trade, Employment and Productivity Act of 1987."
The administration would not object, however, to the enactment of H.R. 2330 if it is amended to include the five-year authorization in H.R. 1155 and amended further to eliminate other requirements that adversely restrict the execution of the President's programs. Specifically, H.R. 2330 should be further amended to:

— (1) increase the appropriation authorizations for the Antarctic Program by $25 million and research and related activities by $10 million and (2) concomitantly reduce the authorizations for Science and Engineering Education by $35 million.
— delete language that specifies the research disciplines or the types of academic institutions for which Engineering Research Centers and Science and Technology Centers are to be established, because this specification would preempt the merit review process normally used for establishing these Centers.
— delete the requirement for a special report by NSF to congressional committees detailing Soviet efforts to compromise and penetrate U.S. science research programs, because this requirement would duplicate on-going activities. The results of these activities are available to the Congress.
— delete the provisions providing that not less than specified amounts are authorized for Supercomputer Centers, Teacher Preparation and Enhancement activities, Materials Development and Informal Science Education, and the College Science Instrumentation Program. Such requirements would impede the efficient management of these programs.
