Said Reilly, "I enthusiastically endorse Gov. Kasich and support his campaign for the Presidency. His track record in Ohio as a successful Republican governor in a swing state — along with his tenure in Congress — assures me that he has the right skill set, temperament and ideas for our nation's highest office. It is also clear that he is the only candidate who can defeat Hillary Clinton. I look forward to working to spread his message in advance of Rhode Island's primary and beyond."

In 2014 Reilly was elected to the Rhode Island House of Representatives for the second time to represent State District 72, which includes Portsmouth and Middletown. As a member of the House Committee on Finance, he's played a key role in passing two state budgets and reforming the state's pension system. An attorney by profession, Reilly also serves as an emergency medical technician and as a volunteer for the Bristol Fire Department.
Said Kasich, "I'm grateful for the endorsement of State Rep. Dan Reilly, one of Rhode Island's finest public servants. This is a legislator who knows what it takes to balance a state budget and spend taxpayer money wisely. I have no doubt that he'll be a terrific addition to our team as we engage voters."
