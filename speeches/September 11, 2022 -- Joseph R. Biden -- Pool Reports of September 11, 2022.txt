A: "Yes, there is a plan for that."
Q: "Do you know what's going on in Ukraine right now? There's reports of Russia's like on the run in large parts."

The president walked slowly between two rows of members of the armed forces, a marine holding an umbrella over his head, making us way to a wreath that had been set up.
The president approached the wreath and stood for a few minutes looking at it. He then approached the wreath, put his hands on either side of it for a moment, before touching his hand to his heart as he stepped away.
Biden was introduced at this event along with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley.
The ceremony has begun. They are reading off the names of the men and women who died on Sept 11, 2001 at the Pentagon, with a single bell chime after each name.
