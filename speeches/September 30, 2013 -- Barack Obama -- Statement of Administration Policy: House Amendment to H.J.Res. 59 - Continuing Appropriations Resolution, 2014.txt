(House Rules)
(Rep. Rogers, R-Kentucky)
The Administration strongly opposes the House amendment to Senate-passed H.J. Res. 59, making continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2014, and for other purposes. The Senate acted in a responsible manner on a short-term funding measure to maintain Government functions and avoid a damaging Government shutdown. The House of Representatives should pass the Senate-passed H.J. Res 59, rather than propose an amendment that advances a narrow ideological agenda and threatens the Nationâ€™s economy. By including extraneous measures that have no place in a government funding bill and that the President and Senate already made clear are unacceptable, House Republicans are pushing the Government toward shutdown.
If the President was presented with H.J. Res 59, as amended by this amendment, he would veto the bill.
