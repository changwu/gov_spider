    The Rwandan people have taken an important step forward in the political transition and reconciliation of their nation by holding their first Presidential elections since the 1994 genocide. We congratulate President Paul Kagame on his victory, and look forward to building our relationship with the people of Rwanda, who have demonstrated their commitment to democracy by peacefully turning out in large numbers.
The United States will work cooperatively with the Government of Rwanda, all political parties, and civil society to ensure that Rwanda's political transition occurs peacefully, freely, and fairly.
