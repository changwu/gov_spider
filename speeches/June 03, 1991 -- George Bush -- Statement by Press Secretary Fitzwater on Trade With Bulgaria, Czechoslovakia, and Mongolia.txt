    The President submitted to the Congress his recommendation to extend the waiver authority granted under the Jackson-Vanik amendment (Section 402) to the 1974 Trade Act, as well as the separate waivers for Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Mongolia. These waivers will promote freedom of emigration in these three countries and ensure their continued eligibility for official credit programs such as those of the Export-Import Bank and Commodity Credit Corporation. The waviers are also required for the extension of most-favored-nation trade status.
The President's report to the Congress describes the dramatic surge toward democracy in Czechoslovakia and the complete freedom of emigration its citizens now enjoy. Czechoslovakia has benefited from most-favored-nation trade status since November 1990. Bulgaria and Mongolia have also made impressive progress toward democratization and free emigration. We anticipate according MFN status to both countries pending ratification by the respective legislatures of the bilateral commercial agreements signed in April 1991.
