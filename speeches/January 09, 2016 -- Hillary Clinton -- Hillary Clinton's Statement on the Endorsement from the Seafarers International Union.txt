    Hillary Clinton released the following statement about the recent news that the Seafarers International Union (SIU) has endorsed Hillary Clinton for President. Clinton now has the endorsement of 19 national labor unions or labor alliances representing nearly 11 million American workers.
"America's mariners have served our country since its founding, more than 200 years ago, and privately owned U.S.-flag commercial vessels with their American citizen crews have always responded quickly and effectively to answer our nation's call. The need for a strong, vibrant U.S.-flag Merchant Fleet crewed by well-trained, dedicated Americans remains just as important today as it has throughout our history.
"From carrying goods to those who are hurting to moving government-generated cargo, American mariners sailing aboard U.S.-flag vessels have made sure the job gets done, and they can count on me to be in your corner.
"In this election, we're going up against some powerful forces who are determined to turn back the clock and reverse our hard-won progress. We can't let that happen. The Seafarers Union has always fought for decent wages, good benefits, and safe working conditions for its members. I share their commitment to improving the lives of America's working families."
