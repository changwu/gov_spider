    Mayor Ward, and Charles:
I want to thank you for coming out here to meet us.
Charles, I have never been better welcomed, and I appreciate it very much. I want to thank whoever painted that beautiful sign. I don't think that in the six States that we have visited I have seen one that is more attractive.
I want to express my appreciation to the bands that have come out here to meet us.
Last night and all morning we have had a wonderful reception from the fine people of this State. And it warms our hearts and thrills us to know that we have good Americans like this who think so much of their country and of the office of the Presidency.
It has been a high honor to visit Georgia. We have received stimulation and inspiration from our contacts here. We will carry back to the Nation's Capital a message from all of you.
I know that you will join with us in our program that is dedicated and designed to give the greatest good to the greatest number of people, not only in his country but people everywhere in the world. We want a world that is filled with peace and prosperity.
Thank you very much.
