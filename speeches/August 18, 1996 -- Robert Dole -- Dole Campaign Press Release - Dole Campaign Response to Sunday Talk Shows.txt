    Dole/Kemp '96 Deputy Press Secretary Christina Martin released the following statement today:
"Putting the Clinton campaign's ugly scare tactics and meaningless props aside for a moment, let's focus on the heart of the tax cut debate.
"Cutting taxes and balancing the budget is a matter of presidential will. Bob Dole has the will -- and proved it last year with the tax-cutting, budget-balancing, Clinton vetoed Republican budget. And Bob Dole intends to exercise that will again as president with a plan that accomplishes both these goals and keeps Social Security and Medicare cuts off the table. Bill Clinton, on the hand, has to answer for his lack of will which resulted in the largest tax increase ever forced upon the American people."
