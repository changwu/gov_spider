    Below is a link to the President's plan for how the Federal Government will responsibly share and safeguard information that enhances national security and protects the safety of the American people. You can read the plan "National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding" here: http://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/2012sharing... National security depends on our ability to share the right information, with the right people, at the right time. Anchored on the 2010 National Security Strategy, the NSISS provides guidance for more effective integration and implementation of policies, processes, standards, and technologies that promote secure and responsible national security information sharing.
