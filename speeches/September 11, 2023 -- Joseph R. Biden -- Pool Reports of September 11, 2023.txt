The Vietnamese president opened. He spoke about cooperation between the Us and Vietnam. He said the countries have been working together on identifying missing Americans from the Vietnam war. Called the new relationship a model and spoke about building on efforts to grow the relationship. He cited Patrick Leahy and John Kerry for their efforts to improve the relationship.
The group then toasted to Biden's health.
Biden cited a Vietnamese poet. He said it was an honor to be there. He said it was a day that "may have seemed impossible not that long ago." And spoke about "boundless possibilities ahead.
Said this was a "Reminder of the hard work we all did to get here."
Said "As we trace this fifty year arc of progress" there was "One common denominator, you, our people."
He acknowledged John Kerry. He also spoke about John McCain and said he missed him.
"Where there was darkness you all found light"
"Testament to how far our countries have come"
