    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Coble (R) North Carolina and Berman (D) California)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 769. The bill would implement the Madrid Protocol concerning trademarks but would not become effective until the United States accedes to the Protocol. The Administration's policy is that the United States should not accede to the Protocol until it addresses our concern about concurrent voting by regional economic integration organizations, such as the European Community.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 769 would affect receipts and direct spending; therefore it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary PAYGO estimate is being developed.
