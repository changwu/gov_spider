    Newt Gingrich today announced the support of his initial team of 12 current and former conservative State Legislators in Kansas.
"I'm quite proud to have the support of this team of conservative legislators from the Sunflower State," said Newt Gingrich. "This shows widespread support for my platform of bold solutions found in the 21st Century Contract With America."
Announcing her support, former State Senator and former State Rep. Peggy Palmer said, "Newt Gingrich is a bold leader with a long history of enacting conservative solutions. At a time of enormous challenges, our country needs a President who will, from day one, work to return America into a nation that reduces the power of the federal government and increases the power of citizens."
