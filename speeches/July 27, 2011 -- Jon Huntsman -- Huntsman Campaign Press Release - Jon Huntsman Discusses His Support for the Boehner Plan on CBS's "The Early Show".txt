    Earlier this morning, Jon Huntsman appeared on CBS's "The Early Show" to discuss his campaign for President and his support for Speaker John Boehner's debt limit plan. Jon was the first Republican presidential candidate to support the plan and is the only Republican candidate standing in support of Speaker Boehner's plan.
But, he wasn't the only one discussing his support for the Boehner Plan this morning. The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board also came out in support of the plan, saying in an editorial that, "Republicans who oppose Boehner's debt deal are playing into Obama's hands."
