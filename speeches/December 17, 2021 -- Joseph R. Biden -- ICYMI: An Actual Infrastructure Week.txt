    Infrastructure week has begun -- and thanks to President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, infrastructure week will continue throughout the decade.
Weeks after signing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running to deliver for communities across the country. This week alone, infrastructure investments were directed towards replacing lead pipes, rebuilding highways, modernizing airports, cleaning up pollution, building electric vehicle chargers, and more.
As Vice President Harris announced two new action plans to accelerate EV charger installation and lead pipe replacement, Cabinet members traveled the nation to meet Americans where they are and showcase what the infrastructure law will do for them.
Here's what you may have missed this infrastructure week:
