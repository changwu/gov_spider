    Today the Salem Statesman Journal endorsed Hillary Clinton, saying she has a record of producing real results and will be the best candidate to represent Oregon in the White House.
Excerpts follow below:
"But Hillary Clinton does get things done.
"After leaving the White House, she handily won election in New York, where she proved that she's not simply an urban lawmaker. Rural New Yorkers speak highly of Clinton, praising her for paying attention to their parts of the state.
"In the Senate, she has achieved influence much greater than one would expect for her seven years on Capitol Hill.
"Clinton "gets" the concerns of the middle class that dominates the Mid-Willamette Valley.
She was the first candidate to offer Oregon a "compact" of campaign promises on state-specific issues such as restoring county timber payments and giving the state say about siting of liquefied-natural-gas terminals."
