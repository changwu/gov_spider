    The United States of America and the Russian Federation launched the U.S.â€“Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission (BPC) four years ago to reaffirm our commitment to cooperation and collaboration based on shared interests. Since its creation, the Commission has embraced a whole-of-government approach to advance this goal, finding common ground on arms control and international security; fostering closer defense ties; increasing bilateral trade and investment opportunities; countering terrorism and narcotics trafficking; promoting advances in science, technology, and energy; and enhancing people-to-people and cultural ties between our societies.
Today we received from Secretary of State John Kerry the submission of the 2013 BPC Joint Report, which comprehensively highlights the Commission's accomplishments since Spring 2012.
President Obama encourages the Commission's working groups to deepen and expand their engagement with Russia in order to remove barriers to trade and investment, increase security, and ensure that advances in science and innovation continue. By partnering with American and Russian civil society and private enterprise, the Commission's working groups can have an enduring impact that yields a brighter future for Russians, Americans, and people around the world.
The report can be found here.
