    Berman spearheaded Obama's 2008 delegate operation
(SAN FRANCISCO, CA, January 3, 2020) â€” Today, the Tom Steyer 2020 campaign announced that Jeff Berman is joining their team as a senior strategic adviser. One of the nation's foremost experts on the Democratic presidential nomination process, Berman spearheaded President Barack Obama's 2008 delegate operation. Berman also served in 2016 as a delegate strategist for Hillary Clinton, and most recently as a senior adviser for Beto O'Rourke's presidential campaign.
Berman was a key difference-maker for Obama's historic 2008 primary campaign, helping lead Obama's effort through the complex delegate landscape. Subsequently, Berman was elected to the Democratic National Committee and its important Rules Committee and two national DNC commissions to reform the Democratic presidential nominating process.
"Jeff is an instrumental force in presidential delegate strategy, and our campaign is very excited and fortunate to have him join our team," said Campaign Manager Heather Hargreaves. "I look forward to working with him as we build our campaign to win the 2020 nomination."
"Tom is an accomplished business leader, committed to growing the economy while protecting our climate, and ensuring that prosperity is shared by all Americans," said Jeff Berman. "As Tom campaigns on these powerful themes in the new year, voters and delegates will see him as the best candidate to take on Trump and beat him."
