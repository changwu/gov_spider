HOUSTON, Texas — U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement commemorating Labor Day:
"Today we celebrate American workers. Since the first days of the frontier, the virtue of work has enlivened our national spirit. It is the ingenuity and grit of countless Americans that has made this a land of opportunity. To the teacher, law enforcement officer, civil servant, factory worker, and countless others, I say thank you. Thank you for working daily to provide for your family, to contribute to our economy, and to keep America strong.
"We should foster a robust economy, and stop stifling growth and opportunity. Under the Obama economy, we have seen the lowest labor force participation since the late 1970s. Families, small businesses, minorities, and young people are being crushed by rising premiums and fewer good-paying jobs due to Obamacare, vast costs from new agency regulations, and a byzantine tax code. Manufacturing has steadily declined during Obama's presidency, and the industriousness that has empowered workers and pioneered innovation is fading under his watch.
"But with strong Presidential leadership, we can turn things around quickly: we can eliminate onerous regulations, repeal Obamacare, simplify the tax code, and welcome job creation in every sector – from energy to manufacturing to agriculture. We can champion hardworking Americans. If we stand together for working men and women, we will reignite the promise of America."
