    Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell made the following statement on President Obama's remarks to the Democratic National Convention:Â 
"Four years ago, Barack Obama made a promise to the American people that he would bring hope, change, jobs and opportunity. But after four years, we've witnessed a stunning lack of all of the above. Instead, 23 million people are struggling for work and household incomes have fallen, while gas prices have doubled and health care premiums have risen. A second term for Barack Obama would only yield four more years of the same failed policies. If Americans want a new direction for our country, then we must elect Mitt Romney, who possesses the bold ideas and the unwavering commitment to job creation it will take to jumpstart our economy, put our friends and family members back to work, and restore the promise of the American Dream."
