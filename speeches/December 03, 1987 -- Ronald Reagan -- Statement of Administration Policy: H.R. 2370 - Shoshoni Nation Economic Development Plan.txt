    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Reps. Owens (D) Utah and Hansen (R) Utah)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2370 because the bill is (1) unnecessary — the required economic development plan can be established under existing authority, consequently no special legislation is required; and (2) inappropriate — the tribe has not provided justification demonstrating it has a unique need for such a plan.
