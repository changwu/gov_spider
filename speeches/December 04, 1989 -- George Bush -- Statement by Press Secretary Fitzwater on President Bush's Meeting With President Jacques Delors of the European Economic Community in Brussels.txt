    President Bush discussed with European Economic Community President Jacques Delors the broad outlines of his conversations with Chairman Gorbachev, emphasizing particularly the economic and political developments in Eastern Europe. He complimented President Delors on the EC's coordination of Western aid to Hungary and Poland. This was the third meeting this year between President Bush and President Delors, an indication of the importance both sides attach to the U.S. - EC relationship.
The President underscored the United States commitment to Europe and noted his belief that a strong, vigorous European Community is a vital partner with NATO in preserving the freedom and democratic values of Western Europe -- those very values which are now sweeping eastward.
