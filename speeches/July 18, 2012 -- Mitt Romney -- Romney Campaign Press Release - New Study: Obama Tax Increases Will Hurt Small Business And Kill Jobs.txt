Both President Obama's Policies And His Rhetoric Are Hostile To Small Business Owners, Entrepreneurs, And Job Creators:
President Obama, At A Campaign Rally On Friday Night: "If You've Got A Business, You Didn't Build That. Somebody Else Made That Happen." OBAMA: "Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn't get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet."
