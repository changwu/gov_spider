    New poll shows Paul's continued rise in GOP field
LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” In the latest New Hampshire Journal poll, 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul remains a top three choice of likely New Hampshire primary voters with 16 percent.
"While others may rise and fall quickly, Congressman Paul's support is steady and rising," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton. "This is more proof that the American people are ready for real change, and Ron Paul is the only candidate who has the conviction to oppose the status quo of the elitist Washington establishment."
This latest New Hampshire poll comes on the heels of a Bloomberg News poll showing Paul in a statistical tie for first place in Iowa and a strong second place in New Hampshire, and a Public Policy Poll in which he was the only Republican candidate to best Obama among independent voters (48 to 39 percent). A late October CNN/Time poll also showed him in the top three in the key states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina.
