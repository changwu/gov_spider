    I am pleased today to sign into law S. 1215, the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978. This legislation authorizes additional Federal assistance to community colleges controlled by American Indians on their reservations.
This past summer, the "Longest Walk" brought attention to the special needs of Indian communities and their special relationship to the Federal Government. This act provides a needed base of stable funding for postsecondary education on our Indian reservations, and provides American Indians with greater educational opportunities near their families, their tribes, and their places of employment.
I appreciate the efforts of Senator Abourezk and Representative Blouin in securing passage of this legislation, which will enable American Indian citizens to make greater contributions to their communities and to their Nation.
