The New York Times will be out of business soon after I leave office hopefully in 6 years. They have Zero credibility and are losing a fortune even now especially after their massive unfunded liability. I'm fairly certain they'll endorse me just to keep it all going!Retweets: 21721Favorites: 104041

Anthony Scaramucci is a highly unstable 'nut job' who was with other candidates in the primary who got shellaced and then unfortunately wheedled his way into my campaign.

Great cohesion inside the Republican Party the best I have ever seen. Despite all of the Fake News my Poll Numbers are great. New internal polls show them to be the strongest we've had so far! Think what they'd be if I got fair media coverage!Retweets: 19631Favorites: 84188

Our Economy is very strong despite the horrendous lack of vision by Jay Powell and the Fed but the Democrats are trying to 'will' the Economy to be bad for purposes of the 2020 Election. Very Selfish! Our dollar is so strong that it is sadly hurting other parts of the world...Retweets: 20130Favorites: 89505

.....The Fed Rate over a fairly short period of time should be reduced by at least 100 basis points with perhaps some quantitative easing as well. If that happened our Economy would be even better and the World Economy would be greatly and quickly enhanced-good for everyone!Retweets: 15214Favorites: 69206

Wow Report Just Out! Google manipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 Election! This was put out by a Clinton supporter not a Trump Supporter! Google should be sued. My victory was even bigger than thought! @JudicialWatchRetweets: 61692Favorites: 176838
