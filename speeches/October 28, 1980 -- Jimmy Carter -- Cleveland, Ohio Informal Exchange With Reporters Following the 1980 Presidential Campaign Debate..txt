    Q. How do you think it went?
THE PRESIDENT. Very good. I thought the issues were discussed very thoroughly. I thought it was an excellent debate, and it drew the sharpest possible differences accurately between the basic commitments of Governor Reagan and myself. So, I thought the debate served a very useful purpose.
Q. Did you get in all of the points that you wanted to make?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, not all of them. I had a few more points I could have made, but we only had about 45 minutes for each one of us to talk. And within that time frame, I think I did pretty well in getting our points across.
Thank you.
