    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. de la Garza (D) Texas and 4 others)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2401. The Renewable Resources Extension Program has generally accomplished its objective of assisting States in the establishment of educational programs in the renewable resources area. Moreover, other general authority exists for conducting such programs. Accordingly, reauthorization of the program for an additional seven years at $12 million annually cannot be justified, given current budgetary constraints. Individual States may choose to increase their efforts in this area if they so desire.
