    Chicago, IL - Today, United States Congressman Pete Stark (D-CA) endorsed Barack Obama.
The endorsement brings Senator Obama's superdelegate total to 294.5. Obama is now 127.5 total delegates away from the nomination.
Congressman Stark said, "Senator Barack Obama has captured the imagination of Americans in a way we've not seen for decades. He's inspired millions of young people to register to vote and join the ranks of our Democratic Party, he's consistently opposed the war, he advocates universal health care, and he delivers a message that transcends party politics at the same time.
"I have the greatest respect for Senator Clinton and for her many years of service, but I believe the time has come to unify our party. The outcome we need in November is a Democratic President. To achieve that, we must turn our focus squarely on Senator McCain and his quest to continue another four years of the failed Bush agenda.
"Barack Obama is the person we need as the next President of the United States of America. I'm excited to help him achieve that goal."
Senator Obama said, "Congressman Pete Stark has been a powerful voice for the people of California for decades, and I am proud to accept his support today. He and I share a common goal of making universal health care a reality so every man, woman and child in this country has affordable, quality health care coverage they can count on. He has spoken out powerfully on the issues that matter in the lives of working families, like ending the war in Iraq, advocating for all of our children and protecting social security for our seniors. I look forward to working with Congressman Stark to continue to bring the kind of change that matters to working families â€” in California and across the country."
