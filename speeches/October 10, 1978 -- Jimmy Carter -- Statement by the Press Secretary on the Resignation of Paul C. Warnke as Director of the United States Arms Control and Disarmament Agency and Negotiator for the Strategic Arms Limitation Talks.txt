    The President has accepted with deep regret the resignation of Paul C. Warnke as Director of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and SALT negotiator, to be effective later this month.
In accepting the resignation, the President said that Mr. Warnke's service has enhanced the security of the United States and made a lasting contribution to world peace.
His courage and competence have helped to bring the United States within sight of a new SALT agreement as well as enabling us to make solid progress in many other arms control initiatives, the President said.
Mr. Warnke's resignation, which is for personal reasons, reflects the fact that when he undertook his present assignment, he informed the President that he could remain only for a limited period of time because of personal commitments.
Mr. Warnke will accompany Secretary Vance when he goes to Moscow for SALT talks later this month and will leave his position shortly thereafter.
