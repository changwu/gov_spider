    On the heels of Thursday's debate, in which Joe Biden admitted to supporting a radical anti-energy agenda, Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. hosted a press call with Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) to detail the devastating effect a Joe Biden presidency would have on the state of Wisconsin. President Trump has delivered on trade deals, like the historic USMCA, and catalyzed explosive job growth for Wisconsinites through his pro-growth tax and regulatory agenda. Meanwhile, Joe Biden has fully embraced the left's radical policies, which would devastate the hardworking people of Wisconsin and the state's economy. While Joe Biden continues to lie to Americans about his family's corrupt business deals, President Trump fights for the American people each and every day.
"Joe Biden's 47-year career has been filled with disastrous policies that shipped countless U.S. jobs overseas, killed American businesses, and a Joe Biden presidency would be no different. Biden has shifted significantly to the left throughout his most recent bid for president - remember this is the third time he's run for president - selling out to the radical left wing of the Democrat party," said Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 Director of Communications.
"Joe Biden, Kamala Harris - your policies would devastate, I mean devastate the Wisconsin economy and the American economy. We simply can't afford that risk and we certainly can't afford the counter intelligence and extortion risk that the Biden family financial entanglements represent to a Biden administration as well," said Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI).
