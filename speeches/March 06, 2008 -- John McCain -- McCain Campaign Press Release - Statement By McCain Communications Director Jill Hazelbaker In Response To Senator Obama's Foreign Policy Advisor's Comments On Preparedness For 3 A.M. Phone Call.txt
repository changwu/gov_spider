    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today released the following statement by Communications Director Jill Hazelbaker in response to the assertion by Susan Rice, Senator Obama's foreign policy advisor, that neither democratic candidate is ready for the 3:00 a.m. call:
"At a time when our country faces an unprecedented range of international challenges and opportunities, the American people want a president who is prepared to lead our country in a dangerous world. Senator Obama's foreign policy adviser said today that neither Senator Clinton nor Senator Obama is ready to answer a 3:00 a.m. phone call during an international crisis. We agree wholeheartedly that neither Senator Clinton nor Senator Obama have the experience or judgment necessary to lead the United States in the struggle against violent Islamic extremists who seek our destruction, or to address the complex global environment that our next president will face. Only Senator McCain is ready to serve as commander in chief from day one."
