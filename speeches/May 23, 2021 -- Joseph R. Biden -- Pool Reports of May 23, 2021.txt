WH in-town pool report #5/ No remarks and lid
POTUS, wearing suit and blue shirt and no tie, and carrying a black bag, disembarked Air Force One at 7.58pm. He took off a face mask and waited at the bottom of the steps to help FLOTUS, wearing white.
POTUS then walked back up the steps into the helicopter for a few seconds before returning back down, laughing as he rejoined FLOTUS.
He and FLOTUS walked across the grass and he waved to reporters but did not answer shouted questions. POTUS and FLOTUS waved again before climbing into a limousine that headed to the White House.
