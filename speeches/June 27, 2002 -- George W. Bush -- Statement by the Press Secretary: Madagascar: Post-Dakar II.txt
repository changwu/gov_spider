    The United States appreciates and supports the efforts of African Heads of State, particularly President Wade, in their facilitation of the Dakar II negotiations. We acknowledge the significant progress made in Dakar, and we encourage President Ravalomanana to complete the Dakar II commitments. We call on him to continue implementing steps that he has initiated toward national reconciliation. We call on all parties to act in a spirit of reconciliation and forego all violence.
