    To the Congress of the United States:
In my message on foreign affairs which was communicated to the Congress on the 10th day of this month, I spoke of the invitation which this Government has accepted to participate in the General Disarmament Conference which is to meet at Geneva on February 2, 1932. I spoke also in that message of the interest of this Government in supporting the efforts of this conference in accordance with the traditional policy of the American Nation to meet with the other nations of the world and to offer its cooperation in any endeavor which has in view the reduction of the huge burdens which result from unnecessarily heavy and costly armaments.
I am transmitting herewith and I commend to the favorable consideration of the Congress a report on the subject from the Secretary of State in which he requests that authorization be made for an appropriation to defray the expenses of sending an American delegation to Geneva for the purpose of representing the United States at the conference.
