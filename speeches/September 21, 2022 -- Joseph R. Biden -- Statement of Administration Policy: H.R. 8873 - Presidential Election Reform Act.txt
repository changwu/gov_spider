    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Lofgren, D-CA, and Rep. Cheney, R-WY)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 8873, the Presidential Election Reform Act. This bipartisan legislation seeks to improve the integrity of the process of appointing Presidential electors and of tallying those electors' votes.
The Administration shares the Congress' interest in safeguarding the electoral process to preserve the will of the people, as expressed through democratic procedures established by law. Since the Electoral Count Act was enacted in 1887, several close or contested elections have revealed the need for greater precision in the statutory structure. The proposed legislation is another important step in Congress' consideration of critically needed reform of the 135-year-old Electoral Count Act. Americans deserve greater clarity in the process by which their votes will result in the election of a President and Vice President.
As H.R. 8873 proceeds through the legislative process, the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure lasting reform consistent with Congress' constitutional authority to protect voting rights, tally electoral votes, and strengthen our democracy.
