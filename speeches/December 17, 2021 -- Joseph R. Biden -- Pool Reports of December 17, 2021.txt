Travel pool #1: JBA
Good morning from JBA, where there was a beautiful pink and orange sunrise. POTUS stepped off Marine One at 7:07.
He was greeted by Colonel Matthew Jones, Commander, 89th Airlift Wing.
POTUS boarded AF1 at 7:09. We're rolling toward takeoff at 7:14, en route to South Carolina. Jen Psaki is gaggling en route, so stay tuned to live stream.
POTUS plans to land at Columbia Metropolitan Airport, take Marine One to Orangeburg and motorcade to the commencement ceremony at South Carolina State University.

POTUS was greeted by:
Representative Jim Clyburn (SC-06)Columbia Mayor Stephen BenjaminWest Columbia Mayor Temus Miles, Jr.Cayce Mayor Elise Partin
Clyburn was wearing a SC State hat and mask. After they spoke for a minute, Clyburn motioned over to people waiting behind a metal barricade, and they went over to say hello.
POTUS spent several minutes shaking hands and taking photos. He bent over to speak with some little boys. Pool was too far away to hear any conversations.
After he was done, POTUS answered two questions.
How does it feel to be back in Carolina?
"It feels good!"
What are we going to hear in your speech?
"You'll hear when I make it!"
It's foggy, and there's a bad weather call. So we're all motorcading straight to the commencement ceremony rather than taking Marine One and Ospreys. It's a roughly 45 minute drive, so we expect to remain on schedule.
We're rolling at 9:01.

The motorcade arrived at South Carolina State at 9:42. Across the street, there was a "let's to Brandon" flag and a few demonstrators holding signs about Ethiopia.

We're waiting for the program to begin.
