    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Williams (D) MT and Goodling (R) PA)
The Administration opposes H.R. 1369, which would authorize appropriations of $741,000 for a special grant to the University of Montana for an international business education program. This bill would inappropriately earmark funds for a specific institution for activities that are already supported through competitive, merit-based grants. With respect to this special grant, the Federal Government has already recognized the important contributions of Maureen and Mike Mansfield through a one-time 1984 grant of $5,000,000 for the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Foundation.
