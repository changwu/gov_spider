Gingrich will begin his trip with a town hall forum at the Overlook Medical Center in Derry where he will discuss healthcare reform and its effects on the American economy and job creation.
In addition, Gingrich will visit the home of Ovide and Betty Lamontange to take part in Granite Oath PAC presidential house parties in Manchester as well as meet with the Seacoast Federation of Republican Women in Portsmouth.
