The Democrats are making a strong push to abolish ICE one of the smartest toughest and most spirited law enforcement groups of men and women that I have ever seen. I have watched ICE liberate towns from the grasp of MS-13 & clean out the toughest of situations. They are great!Retweets: 27356Favorites: 113034

To the great and brave men and women of ICE do not worry or lose your spirit. You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements. So brave! The radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police. Zero chance It will never happen!Retweets: 38646Favorites: 151149

A friend of mine and a man who has truly seen politics and life as few others ever will Sean Spicer has written a great new book 'The Briefing: Politics the Press and the President.' It is a story told with both heart and knowledge. Really good go get it!Retweets: 15514Favorites: 78272

I never pushed the Republicans in the House to vote for the Immigration Bill either GOODLATTE 1 or 2 because it could never have gotten enough Democrats as long as there is the 60 vote threshold. I released many prior to the vote knowing we need more Republicans to win in Nov.Retweets: 15407Favorites: 69000

Either we need to elect more Republicans in November or Republicans must end the ridiculous 60 vote or Filibuster rule - or better yet do both. Cryin' Chuck would do it on day one but we'll never give him the chance. Some great legislation awaits - be smart!Retweets: 23594Favorites: 95837

When people come into our Country illegally we must IMMEDIATELY escort them back out without going through years of legal maneuvering. Our laws are the dumbest anywhere in the world. Republicans want Strong Borders and no Crime. Dems want Open Borders and are weak on Crime!Retweets: 38990Favorites: 155402
