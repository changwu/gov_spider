    Thank you all very much forâ€”thank you very much for joining me and the Secretary of State. I find it really interesting that my first meeting in Ho Chi Minh City is at the stock exchange, and I'm meeting with entrepreneurs, people who have taken a look at the markets in Vietnam and have decided that this is a good place to invest.
I want to thank you all for coming to share some of your stories with me. I'm very interested in hearing what the opportunities are like and the obstacles you faceand how, perhaps, the United States can help foster the market economy that is growing here.
I must tell you, I am, first of all, unbelievably grateful for the welcome that Laura and I have been received with here in Ho Chi Minh City; I've never seen as many people line the streets with such a friendly attitude. Secondly, when I read about the recent economic history of Vietnam, I am amazed at the size of the growth and the fact that are people are beginning to realize dreams. I recognize that some of you here at the table were born in Vietnam, came to the United States in the midseventies, and have decided to return. And I'm really interested in hearing what that has been like and the contrast in lifestyles and why you made the decisions you made.
And I do want to hear from you all.
