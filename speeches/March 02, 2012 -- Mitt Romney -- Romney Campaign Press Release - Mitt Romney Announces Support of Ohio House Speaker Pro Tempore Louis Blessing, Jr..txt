    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Ohio House Speaker Pro Tempore Louis Blessing, Jr.
"I'm pleased to earn Louis' support," said Mitt Romney. "Louis is a conservative leader who shares my values of smaller government, lowering taxes, and reversing Obamacare. Ohio is a crucial state and I look forward to working with Louis to spread my message to all Buckeye State voters."
"Ohio voters are tired of President Obama's broken promises and failed record," said Speaker Pro Tempore Blessing. "Instead of more rhetoric, we are looking for a leader who can get results. Mitt Romney spent his life in the real world, balancing budgets and creating jobs. That's the type of leader we need in the White House. I urge my fellow conservatives to join me in standing with Mitt because we need a president with proven experience to turn our country around."
