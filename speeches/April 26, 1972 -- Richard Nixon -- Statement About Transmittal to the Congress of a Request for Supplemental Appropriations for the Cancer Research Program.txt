    I HAVE sent to the Congress a supplemental appropriation request for $40 million to expand the campaign against cancer. This brings the total amount requested in this fiscal year for the expanded attack on cancer to $378 million, a 100 percent increase over the amount requested in the 1970 budget. These additional funds would increase fellowship and training grants by $4 million and construction grants by $36 million.
This action follows the recommendation of 250 outstanding cancer scientists who are involved in the development of a total national cancer plan. As a result of numerous planning sessions, these men and women have urged that one of our first priorities in the development of the expanded cancer research program should be a rapid increase in training and construction funds.
The added training programs would assure that additional technical and professional staff are available to carry out the expanded cancer research program.
Additional funds for construction are required to strengthen the Cancer Research Centers Program. This program has been designed to promote the development of facilities throughout the Nation which would combine the fundamental research competence of the university medical schools with the long experience and special skills of the best cancer institutes. The goal is a system which will provide facilities for generating new research and development and for translating cancer research results into regular clinical and public health practices.
I urge the Congress to give these requests prompt and favorable attention so that we can continue to move forward as rapidly as possible in our campaign against cancer.
