    Secretary Castro calls for primary schedule that's reflective of our nation's and party's diversity
IOWA CITY, IOWA (November 10, 2019) – On Sunday, November 10 while campaigning in Iowa City, Iowa, presidential candidate, former Obama Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Mayor of San Antonio, Texas, Julián Castro called for a reordering of the Democratic primary schedule to reflect the diversity of our country.
Asked by guest host Ayman Mohyeldin on MSNBC's Kasie DC about the order of the Democratic primaries, Secretary Castro noted:
"I actually believe we do need to change the order of the states because I don't believe we're the same country we were in 1972. That's when Iowa first held its caucus first, and by the time we have the next presidential election in 2024, it'll have been more than 50 years since 1972. Our country's changed a lot in those 50 years.
"The Democratic Party's changed a lot. What I really appreciate about Iowans and the folks in New Hampshire is that they take this process very seriously. They vet the candidates, they show up at town halls, they give people a good hearing.
"At the same time, demographically it's not reflective of the United States as a whole, certainly not reflective of the Democratic Party, and I believe that other states should have their chance.
"So yes, of course, we need to find other states--and that doesn't mean that Iowa and New Hampshire still can't play an important role, but I don't believe that forever we should be married to Iowa and New Hampshire going first, and that's the truth of the way I see it."
