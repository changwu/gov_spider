    WASHINGTON- Today, U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan and U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood joined other top Administration officials, state and local officials and business and community leaders at a Clean Energy Economy Forum.
The group discussed the need for comprehensive energy and climate legislation and opportunities to create jobs, expand business opportunities, and drive innovation and economic development by building more efficient, more livable communities. Administration officials also participated in a constructive dialogue with the attendees about their efforts which are spearheading our transition to a clean energy economy.
"I am thrilled to join Secretary LaHood today to discuss the investments President Obama and this Administration are making to lay the foundation for a clean energy economy America needs," said Secretary Donovan. "Clean energy is the key to unlocking the potential of America's economy and our ability to create jobs and build the kind of strong, sustainable, inclusive communities our country needs to compete and prosper in the 21st century."
"Moving toward a cleaner, greener, and more sustainable America is an urgent priority for the Department of Transportation," said Secretary LaHood. "Our partnership with HUD and EPA will help us refocus our priorities on smart growth strategies that will help Americans lower their household transportation costs, improve air quality by lowering emissions, and reduce our dependence on oil. And we'll spur the kind of economic activity that flows into communities when they focus on transit riders, pedestrians, and cyclists alongside cars and trucks."
Top Obama Administration officials have held more than a dozen similar forums and the White House and around the country, including regional Clean Energy economy forums in Colorado, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington State.
