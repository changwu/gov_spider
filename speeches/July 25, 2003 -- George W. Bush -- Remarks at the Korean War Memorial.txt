    I'm here to honor those who served in Korea. There is a very profound statement here at this moving memorial. It says, "Freedom is not free." And today we honor those—this weekend we honor those who served in the cause of freedom in the Korean war.
This memorial is—and those who served in Korea also remind us of the challenges we face today, and it gives us a chance to reflect on the sacrifices that are being made on behalf of freedom today. And our Nation will be eternally grateful for the men and women who serve today, as we are for those who have served in the past.
