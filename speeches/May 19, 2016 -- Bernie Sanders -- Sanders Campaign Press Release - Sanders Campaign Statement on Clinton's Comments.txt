    PALM SPRINGS, Calif. - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' spokesman, Michael Briggs, on Thursday issued the following statement after Secretary Hillary Clinton told CNN she will be the Democratic Party's nominee for president:
"In the past three weeks voters in Indiana, West Virginia and Oregon respectfully disagreed with Secretary Clinton. We expect voters in the remaining nine contests also will disagree. And with almost every national and state poll showing Sen. Sanders doing much, much better than Secretary Clinton against Donald Trump, it is clear that millions of Americans have growing doubts about the Clinton campaign."
