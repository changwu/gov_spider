    Today, Second Lady Karen Pence visited the CreativeForces music therapy program at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Clinic in Anchorage, Alaska. She was joined by Mrs. Donna Walker, the wife of Alaska Governor, Bill Walker.
During the visit, Mrs. Pence met with music therapist, Danielle Kalseth and four service members who participated in a group music therapy session. Mrs. Pence observed a portion of the session, which is a part of a six-week progressive music therapy group that the music therapist has been leading with the service members. After observing the session, Mrs. Pence had the opportunity to talk to the service members to learn more about the role music therapy plays in addressing their health conditions. After the discussion with the service members, the Second Lady participated in a roundtable discussion with the music therapist and members of the hospital staff.
"Military service members and veterans deserve opportunities to heal from injuries sustained while fighting to protect our freedoms," said Mrs. Karen Pence. "I am encouraged to learn that through music therapy, service members are able to heal from their invisible wounds of war. I commend the hospital staff of the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Clinic for recognizing the important value of having creative arts therapy as a form of treatment for our beloved heroes."
Last week, Second Lady Karen Pence spoke at the Creative Forces Arts and Military Conference in Kileen, Texas. After delivering remarks, she traveled to Fort Hood where she met with people trained in art and music therapy.
