    The President has implemented his decision announced on May 27, 1991, to impose constraints on high technology trade with the People's Republic of China as a result of actions by entities in the P.R.C. to transfer missile technology to other countries. The President decided that the significant risks to U.S. security interests posed by these missile transfers require the imposition of limits on the sale of high performance computers. In addition, the President will not waive sanctions that prohibit the transfer of U.S. technology for satellites launched on Chinese rockets. Finally, we are taking steps to impose sanctions on certain firms in the P.R.C. that have contributed to missile proliferation.
