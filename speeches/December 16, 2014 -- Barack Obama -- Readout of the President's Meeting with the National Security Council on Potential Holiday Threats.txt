    The President convened a meeting with his National Security Council today to review potential threats to the U.S. homeland and U.S. personnel overseas ahead of the busy travel period and the large public gatherings expected during the upcoming holidays. He received an update on security preparations planned and underway throughout the country, and also reviewed ongoing efforts to monitor the potential for violent reactions overseas to the release of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's report on the CIA's former detention and interrogation program. The President also discussed the U.S. security posture in Pakistan in light of the horrific attack in Peshawar today that killed dozens of innocent students and children. The President thanked his national security team for their tireless work and directed departments and agencies to continue to do everything in their power and within their authority to identify and disrupt any potential threats both at home and abroad to protect the American people.
