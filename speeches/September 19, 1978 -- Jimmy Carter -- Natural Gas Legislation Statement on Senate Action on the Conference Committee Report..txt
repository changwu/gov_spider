    The Senate's vote today on the natural gas compromise is an important step toward putting in place a comprehensive national energy policy. The compromise is a good bill for the Nation, and it is vitally important that the Congress adopt it. I am confident the courage and determination shown by the Senate today will prevail in the week ahead, and I urge all the bill's supporters who made this vote possible today to redouble their efforts in both the Senate and the House so that enactment of the national energy act will not be delayed any further.
