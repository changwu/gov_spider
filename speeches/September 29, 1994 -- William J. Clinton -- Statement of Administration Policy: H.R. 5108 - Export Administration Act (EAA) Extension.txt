    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 10/3/94)(House)(Hamilton (D) IN and Gilman (R) NY)
The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 5108, which would extend the EAA until September 30, 1995.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 5108 would affect receipts and direct spending; therefore it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is that its enactment would be revenue neutral. Final scoring of this legislation may differ from this estimate.
