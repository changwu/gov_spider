    BURLINGTON, Vt. â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday released the following statement in reaction to the release of police footage of Laquan McDonald's shooting:
"All Americans should be sickened by the video of Laquan McDonald's murder. As a nation we must do more than just echo the phrase Black Lives Matter. We must put actions behind those words. Actions that will bring about the fundamental reform that is needed in the face of this crisis. Criminal justice reform must be the civil rights issue of the 21st century and the first piece must be putting an end to the killing of African Americans by police officers."
