    Today marks what would have been the 79th birthday celebration of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. As we commemorate his life and the legacy that continues to resound throughout our country, let us remember his wisdom and extraordinary mission to eliminate barriers and injustices for all Americans. His vision propelled the civil rights movement into an undeniable force that shaped our country. We honor Dr. King for his leadership, vision, and strength that helped to reshape America's moral conscience, making our country how we ought to be - stronger, better and united.
It was Dr. King who reminds us that we have the duty - and the power - to make a difference not only in our lives, but in the lives of others.
