    It has been a joy to watch Naomi grow, discover who she is, and carve out such an incredible life for herself. Now, we are filled with pride to see her choose Peter as her husband, and we're honored to welcome him to our family. We wish them days full of laughter and a love that grows deeper with every passing year.
