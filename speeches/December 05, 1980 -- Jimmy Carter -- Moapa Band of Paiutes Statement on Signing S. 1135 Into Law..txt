    I am pleased to sign into law S. 1135, which provides for approximately 70,500 acres of public land in Nevada to be held in trust for the Moapa Band of Paiutes.
The people of the Moapa Band have, with outstanding initiative and dedication, developed the resources of their small reservation and the knowledge and skills needed to sustain their community. Since 1968 the Moapa Band has established successful farming operations, including a greenhouse tomato-growing project; a leather manufacturing company; a construction company, which has built homes and a community center on the reservation; and a number of social and educational programs.
I congratulate the Moapa Band on these significant achievements and Senator Howard Cannon, who worked so hard for passage of this historic legislation. This bill will provide the Moapa Band with the increased land base it needs in order for its people to continue their economic and social growth. It is my hope that this land will serve as a foundation on which the people of the Moapa Band can build a community in which both economic development and the traditions of their tribal culture will continue to flourish.
