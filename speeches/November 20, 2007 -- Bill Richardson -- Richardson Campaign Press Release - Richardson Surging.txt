    MANCHESTER, NH-- A new CNN/WMUR poll released today shows New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson surging in New Hampshire, climbing six points to pull even with John Edwards and shrinking the gap with Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
"Voters are starting to look for an experienced candidate who has delivered real results and can bring change to Washington D.C., and they are finding that in Bill Richardson," said Dave Contarino, Richardson's campaign manager. "Richardson's message, his record of accomplishments and his bold policy ideas on Iraq, education, and energy are clearly resonating with voters."
Richardson has spent the past two days in New Hampshire unveiling his "New Hampshire Veterans and Military Families for Richardson" and discussing his agenda to protect veterans, active military, and their families.
"The momentum we are seeing in New Hampshire is happening in all of the early states," Contarino added. "Voters are looking for bold solutions, backed by a real track record of success, and more and more are supporting Bill Richardson."
According to the new CNN/WMUR poll:



Hillary Clinton
