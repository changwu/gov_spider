    Verona, PA - Governor Romney said he never advocated for a federal healthcare mandate, then videos and op-eds surfaced showing that wasn't true.
Governor Romney has also repeatedly said the people of Massachusetts are very happy with RomneyCare, but now polling shows that's not true either.
New Exit polling from the very birthplace of RomneyCare proves that even Massachusetts conservatives think RomneyCare goes too far.

Exit Poll Statistic of the Year

The Super Tuesday exit polls yielded a mountain of data in 10 states, but the most telling single statistic may have been in Massachusetts, which Mitt Romney won in a largely uncontested rout. Yet believe it or not, he still lost on health care.
The exit poll asked voters their opinion of the "Massachusetts Health Care Law," with the options of Did Not Go Far Enough, About Right and Went Too Far. Remarkably, 51% said the bill went too far, while only 37% said it was about right, and 6% said not far enough.
Granted these are GOP primary voters, who are largely conservatives. But the result reveals how unpopular government-mandated health care is, even in its Massachusetts birthplace...
