    As Commander in Chief, I am proud to join a grateful Nation in wishing the United States Air Force a happy 72d birthday.
Established after the conclusion of World War II and with the passing of the National Security Act of 1947, the United States Air Force is the world's most dominant fighting force in air, space, and cyberspace. For more than seven decades, America's airmen have been at the forefront of protecting our citizens and helping the United States promote global peace and prosperity. In their endeavor to always Aim High, these patriots use unrivaled technology and ingenuity to safeguard America's military installations and assets, support our operations in all environments, and defend our cherished freedoms.
Today, the United States Air Force continues to uphold this standard of excellence and readiness. Around the world, our aircraft—both manned and unmanned—dominate the skies, our satellite and cyber operations protect and secure the flow of information for our Armed Services and our intelligence community, and our innovative airmen find new and lasting ways to "Fly, Fight, and Win."
Earlier this year, I was honored to address the next generation of airmen graduating from the prestigious United States Air Force Academy during their commencement exercises in Colorado. It was my honor to shake the hand of the nearly 1,000 cadets who had bravely answered our Nation's call of duty, and I was moved by their fearless commitment to serving our country.
I am grateful to the men and women of the United States Air Force and all of our military personnel and their families for their immeasurable sacrifice. We salute you for your honorable service and your commitment to keeping America safe, strong, and free.
