    The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attacks in Puntland, Somalia. Today's cowardly attacks targeting Puntland security forces, government officials, and civilians are another attempt by terrorists to weaken Somalia ahead of its historic scheduled political transition this autumn toward greater representation.
We join international expressions of outrage against these brutal terrorist acts. The United States expresses our condolences to the families and other loved ones of those killed in these attacks. We will continue to stand by Somalia in its fight against terrorism and extremism and support Somalis in their quest for a peaceful, inclusive, and prosperous future.
