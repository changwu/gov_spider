    Vice President Kamala Harris met today with a bipartisan group of Mayors from across the country to discuss how the Build Back Better Framework will benefit families in the cities they represent. The Vice President thanked the Mayors for their leadership on the ground during a challenging period. She also thanked them for their support of the Build Back Better Framework and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, which will create jobs, lower costs for families, address the climate crisis, and make healthcare more affordable.
The Mayors shared their perspective with the Vice President, including how the Build Back Better Framework and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will make transformational investments to support children, improve our immigration system, and protect the planet while addressing environmental justice. They applauded provisions that will make housing and childcare more affordable, and fix supply chain issues through infrastructure upgrades. The Mayors emphasized the urgent need to pass both bills and also thanked the Vice President for the strong partnership between the Biden-Harris Administration and local leaders nationwide, as we work to solve problems and rebuild our economy.
