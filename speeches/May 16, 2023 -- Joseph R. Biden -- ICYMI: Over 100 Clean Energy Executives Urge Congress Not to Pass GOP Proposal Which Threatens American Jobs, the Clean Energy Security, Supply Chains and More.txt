    Today, 115 clean energy companies — including the CEOs of Ninedot, Terawatt, and First Solar — wrote a letter urging Congress not to pass the GOP Default on America Act, a wish list of extreme policies that will threaten American energy security and manufacturing jobs by repealing parts of the Inflation Reduction Act.
The energy executives noted that: "Since the Inflation Reduction Act became law, our industry has publicly announced more than 140,000 new clean energy jobs in communities across the country. Thousands more additional jobs will be created as our investments flow throughout the economy, building factories and clean energy infrastructure."
As the CEOs laid out, "Americans overwhelmingly support the clean energy tax credits passed in the Inflation Reduction Act; the law is creating jobs, lowering costs, encouraging domestic production, and building energy security. Our nation's clean energy boom is just getting started. H.R. 2811 would set our companies back and do terrible harm to American energy innovation."
MAGA Republicans in Congress are threatening our nation's economy with a catastrophic default unless we undo this progress — offshoring manufacturing, slashing funding for research and development, and endangering energy projects and thousands of good-paying American jobs.
Read the full letter below:
Dear President Biden, Speaker McCarthy, House Democratic Leader Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Schumer, and Senate Republican Leader McConnell:
As executives with American clean energy companies, we employ thousands of Americans in a fast-growing industry. The Limit, Save, Grow Act (H.R. 2811) threatens both our individual businesses and larger efforts to onshore our energy supply chain, supercharge innovation, and make our nation more energy independent than it's ever been.
Since the Inflation Reduction Act became law, our industry has publicly announced more than 140,000 new clean energy jobs in communities across the country. Thousands more additional jobs will be created as our investments flow throughout the economy, building factories and clean energy infrastructure.
It makes no sense to us that H.R. 2811 jeopardizes our nation's economy with a catastrophic default unless these jobs are eliminated. America's allies and rival nations alike are not threatening to wipe out their industries; instead, they are trying to outcompete us. The truth is that threats to our businesses aid foreign competitors against us in the innovation race to lead the world in the next generation of energy production.
We became executives in the growing field of clean energy production by looking forward and planning for the future. Americans overwhelmingly support the clean energy tax credits passed in the Inflation Reduction Act; the law is creating jobs, lowering costs, encouraging domestic production, and building energy security. Our nation's clean energy boom is just getting started. H.R. 2811 would set our companies back and do terrible harm to American energy innovation and security.
We urge you to reject efforts to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act and end the threats to our businesses and hundreds of thousands of American clean energy jobs.
Thank you,
