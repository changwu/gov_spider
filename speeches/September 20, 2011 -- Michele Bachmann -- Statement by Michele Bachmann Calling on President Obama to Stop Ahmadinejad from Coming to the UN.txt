    Bachmann: "The President must not continue to lead from behind on key issues of national and international security"
Urbandale, Iowa — Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann issued the following statement in response to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York City:
"By his own words, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has shown himself to be an enemy not only of Israel, but also of the United States. In his repeated statements wishing to see another sovereign nation 'wiped off the map,' he has proven that he is in violation of the United Nations charter, and of international law. He is, in the most literal sense, an outlaw and he should not be allowed in the United States.
"I call upon President Obama to stop Ahmadinejad from coming to the UN. This administration tried and failed to do 'outreach' to Iran, reminding us once again that appeasement of deadly dictators is never a wise or effective strategy. The President must not continue to lead from behind on key issues of national and international security. When madmen in positions of power make wild and genocidal threats — we should listen to them, and take the necessary counter-measures to stop them and their evil intents. Such threats are an affront to Israel, the United States, and all of the peace-loving peoples of the world. That's why I am committed to doing whatever is necessary to prevent the emergence of a nuclear Iran."
