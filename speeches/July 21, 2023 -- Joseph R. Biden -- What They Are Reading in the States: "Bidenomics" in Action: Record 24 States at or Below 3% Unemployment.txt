    Today, local new organizations are covering new record-setting state unemployment numbers for June. Last month, unemployment rates matched a series low in eight states, set a new series low in nine states, and 24 states had unemployment rates at or below 3 percent â€“ that's Bidenomics in action and further evidence that President Biden's plan is growing the economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down.
Since taking office, President Biden has created over 13 million new jobs nationwide, brought annual inflation down to 3% after falling for a year straight, and has sustained the longest period of national unemployment below 4% in over half a century.
