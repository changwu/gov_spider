    Mitt Romney today announced the support of North Carolina Senator Richard Burr.
"I am honored to have Senator Burr's support," said Mitt Romney. "Senator Burr has been a consistent conservative who is committed to lowering taxes, abolishing unnecessary regulations, and restoring our nation's fiscal health. With his help, I look forward to bringing my message of a 'Simpler, Smaller, and Smarter' federal government to voters in North Carolina and across the nation."
Announcing his support, Senator Richard Burr said, "Governor Romney's proven leadership and his track record on issues of vital importance such as reducing government spending and creating jobs are exactly what we need to put Americans back to work, reduce our spending and address our national debt, and put our nation on the path to economic prosperity."
"The lack of leadership from the current Administration has had a devastating effect on our nation, our economy, and on American families across the country," continued Senator Burr. "Governor Romney is a strong leader with a proven track record of addressing the most pressing issues of our time - growing the economy and creating jobs for American workers. I am proud to give him my support, and I am confident he will be our next president."
