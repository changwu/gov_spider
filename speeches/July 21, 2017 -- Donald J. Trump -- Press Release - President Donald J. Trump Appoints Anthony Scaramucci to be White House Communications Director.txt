    President Donald J. Trump will appoint Anthony Scaramucci, a successful entrepreneur, financier, and founder of SkyBridge Capital, to be White House Communications Director.
Scaramucci will oversee the entire communications operation, including message development and strategy. He will report directly to the President.
President Trump said, "Anthony is a person I have great respect for, and he will be an important addition to this Administration. He has been a great supporter and will now help implement key aspects of our agenda while leading the communications team. We have accomplished so much, and we are being given credit for so little. The good news is the people get it, even if the media doesn't."
Scaramucci added, "President Trump has accomplished an incredible amount in a short period of time, and I am proud to join his Administration as he continues to deliver for the American people."
Scaramucci, who is currently serving as the senior vice president and chief strategy officer at the Export-Import Bank, will officially begin his new role on August 15, 2017.
