    Today, former Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"I know Joe, and America knows Joe. He is a dedicated leader and public servant who has spent his professional life in public office working to improve our country and strengthen its future. His tenure as a United States Senator and as Vice President of the United States has prepared him to enter the office of the Presidency and execute America's priorities on day one.
"During my time in the United States Senate, I served on the Armed Services Committee, and I worked closely with President Obama and Vice President Biden on many of the most pressing national security issues facing our country. Joe Biden is the battle-tested leader we need at the helm of our country's military. He will be ready on day one to regain America's footing with our global partners and face our adversaries in a strategic way.
"We need to elect someone who understands how good governing has worked in the United States. We need a unifier, who has worked with members of both parties to get things done. We need a leader who advocates for all workers â€“ including those who bring their lunch to work in a lunch pail. That person is Joe Biden."
Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,600 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
