    I HAVE LEARNED with sorrow of the death of Chet Huntley. One of America's earliest and finest television newsmen, he will be remembered as a pioneer in electronic reporting and as a true professional who tried to present the news fairly and objectively.
Mrs. Nixon and I extend to Mrs. Huntley our heartfelt condolences.
