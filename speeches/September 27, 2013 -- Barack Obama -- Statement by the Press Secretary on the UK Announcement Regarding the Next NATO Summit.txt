    The United States welcomes the announcement by British Prime Minister Cameron, endorsed by NATO allies, that the United Kingdom will host the 2014 NATO Summit, when NATO Leaders will meet collectively for the first time since the President hosted the Chicago Summit in May 2012. As the President and NATO Secretary General Rasmussen discussed in May, the 2014 NATO Summit will be an opportunity to recognize the contributions of the International Security Assistance Force coalition since 2003 and review progress of Afghan forces as they assume responsibility for security across Afghanistan. The 2014 NATO Summit will also reinforce the importance of strengthening NATO and allied capabilities to address today's security challenges and continue to enhance NATO's partnerships across the globe. Additionally, Leaders will review implementation of the NATO Strategic Concept, which was agreed by the President and allied Leaders during the 2010 Lisbon Summit, and pursue NATO's further transformation to ensure it builds the capabilities required to address future challenges.
As the President has said, for more than 60 years, NATO has proven itself as the most successful alliance in history. The President looks forward to discussing the many security challenges we share with our NATO allies and partners next year in the United Kingdom.
