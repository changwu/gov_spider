    I applaud the leadership of Senator Baucus, along with Senator Burns and all Members of the United States Senate who have joined together to designate today as a national day to erase the hate and eliminate racism. America is the world's most diverse democracy, and the world looks to us for leadership in building on that diversity and showing that it is our greatest strength. Today's resolution shows that the Senate is determined to reach across party lines to help achieve that promise.
We must do all we can to fight bigotry and intolerance, in ugly words and awful violence, in burned churches and bombed buildings—including efforts such as today's resolution. The only way we can meet our challenges is by meeting them together—as one America—and giving all of our citizens, whatever their background, an opportunity to achieve their own greatness.
