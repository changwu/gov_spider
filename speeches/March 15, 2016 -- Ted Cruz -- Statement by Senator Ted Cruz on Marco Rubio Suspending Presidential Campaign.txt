    HOUSTON, Texas â€” Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today released the following statement in response to the announcement that Marco Rubio has suspended his campaign for President:
"Marco Rubio is a friend and a colleague who ran an optimistic campaign focused on the future of our party, conservative principles, and uplifting the American people. The Republican primary was stronger because of the ideas he brought forth. Marco's story embodies the promise of our great nation.
