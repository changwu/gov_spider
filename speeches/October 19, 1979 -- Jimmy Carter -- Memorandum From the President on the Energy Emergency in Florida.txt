    Memorandum for the Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency
Based on a request submitted to me by the Governor of the State of Florida to extend my July 6, 1979 determination that a regional energy emergency continues to exist in the State of Florida of such severity that a temporary suspension of certain air pollution control regulations which apply to fossil-fuel fired electric generating plants under the Florida Air Quality Implementation Plan may be necessary, and that other means of responding to the energy emergency may be inadequate, I hereby extend that determination from October 15, 1979, to and including December 31, 1979. This extension is limited by the same conditions as my July 6, 1979 determination.
If, during the extension, I find that a regional energy emergency no longer exists in Florida, I will direct that this extension be rescinded, and that all suspension orders issued by the Governor be terminated on the day of that rescission. Please continue to work with State officials to monitor carefully the residual oil supply in Florida and to inform me if the emergency should cease to exist. You will continue to retain full authority to disapprove temporary suspension of regulations in Florida and to exercise your emergency powers authority under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act, when and if necessary. It is important to keep suspensions to an absolute minimum since Section 110 (f) of the Clean Air Act limits each suspension to a maximum duration of 120 days.
While my determination permits the temporary suspension of certain emission limiting requirements, it in no way permits the suspension of any national ambient primary or secondary air quality standard. Protection of these national health and welfare protective standards is consistent with Governor Graham's petition, and I commend him for his past restraint in using the authority to suspend some air pollution requirements.
This determination shall be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER.
