    The United States strongly condemns the recent Boko Haram atrocities committed against innocent civilians in Nigeria as well as in Chad, Niger, and Cameroon. We offer our deepest condolences to the victims, their families, and to those who have been displaced by these cruel acts, and we reiterate our support for these countries' efforts to fight Boko Haram in a manner that respects human rights and the rule of law. We also applaud progress toward the establishment of a Multi-National Joint Task Force, which entails a promising regional approach to a regional challenge. We believe that swift action to support and operationalize such a task force will prove vital to protecting civilians and enhancing security throughout the region, and the United States will continue to support bilateral and multilateral initiatives to counter Boko Haram.
