(Senate)
(Sen. Isakson, R-Georgia, and 40 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of S.J. Res. 30, which would undermine a fundamental principle of fairness in union representation elections: that outcomes should be determined by a majority of the valid ballots cast. S.J. Res. 30 would prohibit workers in the airline and railroad industries from voting whether to join a union on the same basis - majority rules - as most other industries. The Administration is committed to help working Americans exercise their right to organize under a fair and free process and bargain for a fair share of the wealth their efforts help to create. The fairest and most effective way to determine the outcome of a union representation election is by the majority of votes cast. S.J. Res. 30 is contrary to this essential tenet of fair elections.
If the President is presented with a Resolution of Disapproval that would not safeguard the ability of railroad and airline workers to decide whether or not they would be represented by a union based upon a majority of the ballots cast in an election, his senior advisers would recommend he veto the resolution.
