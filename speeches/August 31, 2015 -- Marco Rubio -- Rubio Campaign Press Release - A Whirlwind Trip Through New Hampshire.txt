On Wednesday, he started off chatting with voters in Hanover, N.H., including members of Dartmouth's Students for Rubio chapter.

Later that morning, he stopped by the Orford Servicecenter in Orford, N.H., a bit north of Hanover, where he talked about the economy and his plans for education.
Senator Rubio speaking directly to the citizens of Orford. This is what the New Hampshire primary is all about. #nhpolitics #nhforrubio

Then he moved on to Littleton, where he got a great turnout for a talk at VFW Post 816.

He capped off the day with a town hall that night in Londonderry, where the house was packed.

He was asked what he wants to do about Planned Parenthood, and made it clear he doesn't think federal funding should be going to a group whose atrocious practices have now been exposed for all to see.
WMUR, a local TV station, had a nice report on Marco's trip through N.H.:

As the report noted, some fans waited half an hour after the Londonderry event to get the chance to meet Marco.
We were really pleased with the turnout on this trip, and can't wait to be back in New Hampshire!
