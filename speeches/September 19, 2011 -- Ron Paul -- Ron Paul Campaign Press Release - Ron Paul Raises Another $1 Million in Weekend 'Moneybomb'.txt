    Online Constitution Day event totals more than $1 million
LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” Over the weekend, 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul netted more than $1 million in yet another successful one day fundraising event.
The online fundraiser, consisted mostly of small individual donations, and marked the fifth time during the 2012 primary election cycle that Dr. Paul's campaign has passed the million-dollar mark for a single fundraising event.
"Our campaign continues to grow in strength and numbers, and the success of these truly grassroots events is a telling example of Dr. Paul's support," said Ron Paul 2012 Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
"Our rising poll numbers and successful fundraising demonstrate that Dr. Paul's strong message of Constitutionally-limited government, a traditionally Republican non-interventionist foreign policy and a return to sound money is clearly resonating with the American people."
