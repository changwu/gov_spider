    Former Ohio Attorney General Betty Montgomery made the following statement on the Supreme Court decision on President Obama's healthcare law:
"It is discouraging that the Supreme Court today upheld the President's healthcare reform legislation that discourages the general principles of freedom and personal responsibility on which our country was founded. Obamacare is nothing more than a big-government takeover that reduces patient choice, kills jobs, results in massive tax increases and comes with skyrocketing costs. Today's ruling is evidence of the dangerous direction our country is headed in if President Obama is elected for another term, and underscores the importance of electing a leader like Mitt Romney who understands that free markets and constitutional limits on government power are critical to ensure we are not faced with another federal government overreach like this one. Mitt Romney will empower states to craft their own solutions and empower the citizens of Ohio to make their own health care decisions."
