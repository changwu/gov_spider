    Mitt Romney today announced the support of business leaders in Iowa.
"These business leaders are at the heart of our country's economic engine," said Mitt Romney. "Along with new policies in Washington, a renewal of the entrepreneurial spirit, and the hard work of individuals like these Iowa business leaders, we can turn around our country's economy."
Announcing the Iowa business leaders supporting Mitt Romney, Jim Kurtenbach of Prairie Oak Capital said, "The policies of this administration have stifled business and hurt job growth. Mitt Romney is the one candidate with experience working in the real economy and different sectors of business. Job creators across the country know that they will have a leader in Mitt Romney who supports pro-growth policies, will lessen the regulatory burden, and will free the private sector to do what we do best: create jobs."
