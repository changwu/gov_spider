REP. JASON CHAFFETZ: "I hope so. I think so. I think Mitt Romney came across as very presidential and I feel like Rick Santorum showed some true colors when it came to earmarks and raising the debt ceiling, just saying, hey, you needed to go along to get along, it's a team sport, he had to sacrifice his principles and was willing to do so on No Child Left Behind. A lot of things that conservatives are concerned about, I think Rick Santorum was exposed—exposed himself last night."
