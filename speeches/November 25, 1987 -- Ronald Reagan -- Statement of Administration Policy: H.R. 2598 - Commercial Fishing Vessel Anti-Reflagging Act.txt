    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Lowry (D) Washington and 3 others)
The administration would support enactment of H.R. 2598 — as passed by the House — which would impose requirements with respect to commercial fishing vessels, only if it were amended to delete the provision making vessels owned by corporations with less than 51 percent American individual citizen ownership ineligible for American registry. The administration opposes this provision, and would oppose any other provision establishing such a limitation, because the American economy has realized significant benefits from foreign investment.
