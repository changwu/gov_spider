    President Bush will host Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa at the White House on Monday, July 10, 2006. Under Prime Minister Jansa's leadership, Slovenia has significantly increased its efforts bilaterally and within NATO and the European Union to support democracy and secure freedom in South Central Europe, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Slovenia is a key advocate of the integration of Western Balkan countries into the Euro-Atlantic community, and in 2008 will be the first of the new European Union member states to assume the EU Presidency. President Bush looks forward to discussing these and other issues on the transatlantic agenda.
