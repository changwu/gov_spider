    On this International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, the United States joins the international community in pledging to work toward the elimination of torture and all other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
As the President has made clear since the first days of the Administration, the United States rejects torture as unlawful, counter to our values, and inconsistent with the universal rights and freedoms that should be enjoyed by all men, women, and children wherever they live. Torture is abhorrent: we do not practice it, and we will not countenance it or transfer individuals to any country where they will be subjected to it.
In keeping with our laws, principles, and the Convention Against Torture, the United States continues to work with our international partners to end torture. With the development and enforcement of strong domestic laws, effective training of law enforcement and military personnel, and systematic review of interrogation, detention, and transfer practices, together we can turn over to our children a world in which no justification for torture is accepted. We will also continue to support efforts like the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture.
We know that much work needs to be done as the international community moves toward its goal of eliminating torture. Until then, the United States will continue to seek an end to cruel and inhuman treatment.
