    Chicago, IL - With energy prices skyrocketing, middle class Americans are feeling more strained than ever. The Washington politicians are embracing a gas tax holiday-a short term measure that would only save consumers about 30 cents a day, without addressing the long-term problem. In fact, USA Today calls the proposal "political pandering." [USA Today, 4/29/08]
Barack Obama knows that working people aren't looking for gimmicks-they're looking for solutions that work for them. That's why he's the candidate proposing the most tax relief for the middle class: providing tax credits for college, health care, retirement, and expending the dependent child tax credit, the child care tax credit and the earned income tax credit, and providing a mortgage interest tax credit for homeowners who don't itemize their taxes. And Barack Obama is the only candidate offering a broad-based tax cut for the middle class. He'll enact a Making Work Pay tax credit worth $500 per individual or $1,000 per family. And he'll eliminate income taxes for seniors making less than $50,000.
Here's a side-by-side chart to help you compare the candidates' plans.
