    Dear Mr. Speaker:
On September 2nd, I signed into law Public Law 109-61, the "Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act to Meet Immediate Needs Arising From the Consequences of Hurricane Katrina, 2005," which provided $10.5 billion in emergency supplemental funds for hurricane-related disaster relief.
Due to the catastrophic nature of Hurricane Katrina, I am asking the Congress to consider the enclosed request, for an additional $51.8 billion, for emergency FY 2005 supplemental resources for the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security and the Army Corps of Engineers.
I hereby designate this proposal in the amount requested herein as an emergency requirement. This request responds to urgent needs associated with immediate response and recovery efforts associated with Hurricane Katrina in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and other affected areas.
I urge the Congress to act expeditiously on this request to ensure that the Federal response to this disaster continues uninterrupted. I anticipate making a further request that will provide for additional response and recovery efforts after further assessing the impact of the hurricane.
The details of this request are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
