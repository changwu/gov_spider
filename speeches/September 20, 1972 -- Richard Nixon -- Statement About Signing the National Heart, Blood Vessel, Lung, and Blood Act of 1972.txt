    DISEASES of the heart, blood vessels, blood, and lungs are among the major causes of death and disability in America. They are among the most feared diseases in our country. Their cost in human suffering is intolerable, and they also result in extensive economic losses---in terms both of medical care costs and of lost wages.
In my State of the Union Message this year, I indicated that this Administration would give increased attention to the fight against diseases of the heart, blood vessels, and lungs. I also stated my intention, which I reaffirmed in my message to the Congress on health care of March 2, to form a panel of distinguished experts to help determine how best to combat these diseases. I have appointed a group of distinguished citizens to serve on this panel, and, in addition, I have made a budget request of more than $250 million for 1973 to support the fight against these diseases.
Today I welcome the opportunity to strengthen the attack on heart, blood vessel, and lung diseases by signing S. 3323, the National Heart, Blood Vessel, Lung, and Blood Act of 1972.
Substantial progress has already been achieved in our battle against this enemy, much of it under the auspices of the National Heart and Lung Institute, which has been charged with the responsibility for developing an intensified program. I am confident that with the added impetus of this new legislation, our Nation's scientists will continue that progress and hasten the day when the threat of this devastating health menace will be significantly diminished.
