"Palin power: Cool under fire, in command"
Editorial, New Hampshire Union LeaderOctober 5, 2008
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin clearly and convincingly won last Thursday night's vice presidential forum with U.S. Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware.
She exhibited a remarkable grace and coolness under fire and a superb grasp of the facts, especially on world affairs. Funny, but aren't those exactly the qualities one looks for in the person who may be "a heartbeat away?"
But Gov. Palin did much more than that, and it is what ought to worry the Democratic ticket that claims to be the agent of "change."
She showed that a fresh face from outside Washington can bring to the table a truly new perspective, one that understands what changes the average American expects and one that approaches the problem from outside the beltway.
But combine Sarah Palin's native common sense and quick study with John McCain's unshakable integrity and grit, and there is hope for America yet.
