Script for "Nightmare":
Voiceover: MoveOn.org is the most powerful left wing group in the country. They spent millions electing anti-war liberals. And publicly brag how the Democratic Party is theirs â€“ bought and paid for.
Why is MoveOn attacking Rudy Giuliani?
Because he's their worst nightmare.
They know Rudy is a Republican who can beat the Democrats. And they know, no matter what they say- Rudy will never, ever back down.
Rudy Giuliani: I'm Rudy Giuliani, and I approve this message.
Voiceover: Paid for by the Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee, Incorporated. joinrudy2008.com.
