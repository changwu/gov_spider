    Hillary Clinton made the following statement in honor of Passover:
"I wish to extend my best wishes to everyone celebrating the holiday of Passover, commemorating the story of the Israelites' escape from slavery and reminding us all of the blessing of freedom. The Passover Seder is a wonderful tradition, bringing friends and family together to tell this important story to each generation.
As we honor the celebration of Passover this week, let us also keep in mind those who are still struggling to escape from persecution throughout the world. We wish for them too the ability to live in peace and freedom with their families.
