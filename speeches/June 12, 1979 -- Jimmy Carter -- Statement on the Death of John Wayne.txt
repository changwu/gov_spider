    John Wayne was bigger than life. In an age of few heroes, he was the genuine article. But he was more than just a hero—he was a symbol of many of the most basic qualities that made America great. The ruggedness, the tough independence, the sense of personal conviction and courage—on and off the screen—reflected the best of our national character.
It was because of what John Wayne said about what we are and what we can be that his great and deep love of America was returned in full measure.
Rosalynn and I extend our deepest sympathies to his family.
