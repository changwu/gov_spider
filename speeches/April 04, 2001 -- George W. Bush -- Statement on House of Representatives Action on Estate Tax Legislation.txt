    The House of Representatives action on eliminating the death tax is a victory for fairness and a vote for economic growth. I applaud the spirit of cooperation in both parties that led to today's result.
The death tax lacks common sense and thwarts free enterprise. It is unfair to families who have devoted their lives to building family farms and small businesses. Today's vote is an important step toward restoring fairness in the Tax Code by eliminating the double and triple taxation that results from the death tax.
I look forward to continuing to work with Members of Congress from both parties to enact real and meaningful tax relief for the American people.
