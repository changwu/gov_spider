    To the Congress of the United States:
On May 13, 2008, I transmitted a message to the Congress transmitting the text of a proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Russian Federation for Cooperation in the Field of Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy (the "proposed Agreement"), pursuant to sections 123 b. and 123 d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2153(b), (d)) (the "Act").
In view of recent actions by the Government of the Russian Federation incompatible with peaceful relations with its sovereign and democratic neighbor Georgia, I have determined that the determination regarding the proposed Agreement in Presidential Determination 2008-19 is no longer effective. Accordingly, a statutory prerequisite for the proposed Agreement to become effective, as required by section 123 b. of the Act, is no longer satisfied. If circumstances should permit future reconsideration of the proposed Agreement, a new determination will be made and the proposed Agreement will be submitted for congressional review pursuant to section 123 of the Act.
GEORGE W. BUSH
The White House, September 8, 2008.
