In-Town Pool Report 17 — Quotes from CHC gaggle
Here are some quotes from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus gaggle. I've also attached an otter recording for anyone who wants the full gaggle
Raul Ruiz said the CHC spoke with POTUS on immigration, infrastructure, Hispanic students and healthcare.
He said they presented POTUS with executive orders on immigration reform
"The executive orders and actions presented will inspire younger generations to engage with us and the Biden administration, empower them and send a clear message they are not forgotten," he said.
Nanette Diaz Barragan said the caucus received "very positive feedback" from the president on the orders
Adriano Espaillat says they presented orders on Temporary Protective Status and reuniting 4 million people with their families
"United families are stronger and when families are united our country is stronger as well so we are hopeful that two executive orders will begin the TPS designation and the process to petition families, four million on them waiting to come into the United States is fast tracked," he said.
