    "This is the least impressive, lamest political 'reveal' of all time. I worked with DHS officials while I was in the White House, and even I had to research who Miles Taylor was. He's just another standard-issue arrogant, Washington, DC swamp bro who loved President Trump until he figured out he could try to make money by attacking him. He lied to Anderson Cooper on CNN in August when he denied being 'Anonymous,' proving that all he ever wanted to do was try and extend his fleeting 15 minutes of fame and squeeze a few more book sales out of the deal. By contrast, U.S. Navy veteran Tony Bobulinksi is not anonymous and is publicly pointing the finger at a real corrupt politician, Joe Biden, who schemed with his family to make millions from foreign business investors. The very fact that the Beltway media cared about and hyped up 'Anonymous' just emphasizes how derelict they are when they totally ignore the readily visible Biden pay-to-play scandal unfolding before their eyes."
- Hogan Gidley, Trump 2020 national press secretary
