    We have a long way to go on the road to recovery, but I am encouraged by the news today that consumer confidence has continued to improve, spending rose last month, and Recovery Act benefits – like the $250 relief payments and the tax credits – boosted disposable personal income by $17 billion in May. We won't be satisfied until we begin to see job growth, but these are early signs that the Recovery Act is beginning to do exactly what it should – provide stability for hard-hit families and businesses and create the conditions necessary for our economic recovery.
