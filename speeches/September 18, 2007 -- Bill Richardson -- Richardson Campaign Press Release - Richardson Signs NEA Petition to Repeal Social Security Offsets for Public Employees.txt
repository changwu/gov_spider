    WASHINGTON, DC-- New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson today signed a petition sponsored by the National Education Association (NEA) to repeal the Government Pension Offset (GPO) and Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP). These two laws deny earned Social Security benefits to educators, support professionals, police officers, fire fighters, and other public employees in fifteen states around the country.
"After talking to teachers and support professionals throughout Nevada, I came to understand the serious threat that GPO and WEP pose in fifteen states around the country," Governor Richardson said. "These two laws threaten both the well-being of our teachers, support professionals, and public employees and efforts to find qualified officials."
"Social Security is not a gift from the government; it is a promise that our country makes to every citizen. GPO and WEP hurt hardworking Americans who have devoted their lives to public service. I am proud to have signed this petition, and I urge Congress to do away with these offsets and keep America's promise to provide our teachers, support professionals, police officers, fire fighters, and public employees with all of the benefits they have earned."
Governor Richardson signed the petition while meeting with NEA President Reg Weaver in Washington, D.C. As President, Richardson pledges to protect Social Security benefits for every American by balancing the budget, passing laws to prevent the Social Security trust fund from being raided by other programs, and financing the trust fund. As Governor of New Mexico, he has shored up the state's teachers' pension system and has increased salaries for teachers and support professionals.
