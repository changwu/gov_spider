    ARLINGTON, VA -- Governor Mitt Romney today issued the following statement to voters in Michigan on joining "Citizens for McCain," a new grassroots effort headed by Senator Joe Lieberman (I-CT) to rally Americans of all political parties to support John McCain's candidacy:
"I was humbled by the support I received from Michiganders on both sides of the aisle during my run for the Republican nomination. Through my father's leadership as governor of the great state of Michigan and during my time spent in business, government and running the Olympics, I learned the important lesson of working with different stakeholders to accomplish great things. I know Michigan voters want a president who is willing to reach across the political aisle to accomplish the goals of protecting our country, growing our economy and reforming our government.
"John McCain has proven that, as president, he will put our nation's interests first. Michigan voters who have grown tired of lofty rhetoric and want a real record of reform should visit John McCain's website, www.johnmccain.com , to learn more about his extraordinary record of leadership. I know what it will take to successfully lead our country, and I am asking you to learn a little more about John McCain, a new kind of candidate at a time when we need real leadership." 
Letter from U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman on "Citizens for McCain": 
To: Fellow McCain Supporters
From: Senator Joe Lieberman
Date: June 5th, 2008
Today, I asked Senator McCain if I could create and chair a new grassroots organization, "Citizens for McCain."
Citizens for McCain is an organization within the McCain campaign for people who put country before political party and support the candidate for President who has a proven record of bipartisanship.
As you know, I caucus with the Democrats as a United States Senator and was the Democrat Party's nominee for Vice-President of the United States against President Bush and Vice President Cheney.
But first and foremost, I am an American. I have an obligation to do what I think is best for our nation regardless of political party. My love for this country and strong belief in John McCain's character, judgment, and willingness to work with leaders of both parties has convinced me to support him for President.
I have worked with John McCain for many years in the U.S. Senate and know from experience that he can unite Democrats, Republicans and Independents like no one else in this country. He did it in the United States Senate and he can do it as President of the United States.
But we need help from McCain supporters such as you to reach out to Americans who are not currently involved in the campaign. Will you help us by recruiting your friends, family, and co-workers who may not consider themselves members of the Republican Party and ask them to join the Citizens for McCain organization?
I am confident we will find many Democrats and Independents who, like John McCain and me, put country before political party and will support a leader with a real record of bipartisanship.
Time and time again John McCain has put his country first. He refused early release when he was held captive in Vietnam. He continued to put his country first as a national leader in the U.S. Senate. He put country before party when he fought to pass campaign finance reform, sought a bi-partisan solution to the immigration problem, and consistently supported pro-environment policies. His courage to stand up to the failed Iraq war plan of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and lead the fight for a new strategy in Iraq will go down in history, and it saved American lives. These were not always the easy things to do. In fact, they were usually very difficult, and often threatened his political career. But John McCain did what was right.
He said it best in his speech in New Orleans on Tuesday night: 
"(The American people) know I have a long record of bipartisan problem solving. They've seen me put our country before any President -- before any party -- before any special interest -- before my own interest. They might think me an imperfect servant of our country, which I surely am. But I am her servant first, last and always."
The phones at the campaign headquarters have been ringing with disaffected Democrats calling to say they believe Senator McCain has the experience, judgment, and bipartisanship necessary to lead our country in these difficult times. Many of these supporters are former supporters of Senator Clinton.
Senator McCain has had a very good working relationship with Senator Clinton and will continue to do so in the future. In the same New Orleans speech he said: 
"Senator Clinton has earned great respect for her tenacity and courage. The media often overlooked how compassionately she spoke to the concerns and dreams of millions of Americans, and she deserves a lot more appreciation than she sometimes received. As the father of three daughters, I owe her a debt for inspiring millions of women to believe there is no opportunity in this great country beyond their reach. I am proud to call her my friend."
I am proud to call John McCain my friend and ask you to help our friend become the next President of the United States.
Please forward this email to your lists today and ask your friends, family, and coworkers who do not consider themselves Republicans to join me in filling out the Citizens for McCain form today.
Thank you for your willingness to help me expand this new organization. Together, we will make history.
