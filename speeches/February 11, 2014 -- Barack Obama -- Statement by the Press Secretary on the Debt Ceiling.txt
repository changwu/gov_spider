    Tonight's vote is a positive step in moving away from the political brinkmanship that's a needless drag on our economy. The American economy is moving forward, but there is much more to do to ensure that more middle class Americans - and those striving to get into it - can get ahead. Congress can start by raising the minimum wage so that no one who works full time raises their family in poverty, restoring emergency unemployment insurance for the 1.7 million Americans searching every day for a job who need this vital lifeline to support their families, and taking additional steps to strengthen our economy and restore opportunity for all Americans. The President looks forward to working with both sides to get that done.
