    President Bush, following his meeting with Prime Minister Thaksin, announced today his intention to launch negotiations for a comprehensive free trade agreement (FTA) with Thailand, in accordance with the procedures specified by Congress. Thailand is the United States' 18th largest trading partner and an FTA will provide increased access to its large and growing market for U.S. farmers, manufacturers and service industries. This action builds on the historic FTA with Singapore, which the President signed earlier this year, and on his Enterprise for ASEAN Initiative.
The Administration will consult formally with Congress on a U.S.-Thailand FTA in the coming weeks, pursuant to U.S. Trade Promotion Authority enacted in 2002. After these consultations, the Administration will formally notify Congress of its intent to launch FTA negotiations and outline objectives for the negotiations.
