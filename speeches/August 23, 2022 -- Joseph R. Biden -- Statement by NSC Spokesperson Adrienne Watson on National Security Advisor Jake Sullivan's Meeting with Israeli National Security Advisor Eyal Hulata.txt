Mr. Sullivan underscored President Biden's steadfast commitment to preserve and strengthen Israel's capability to deter its enemies and to defend itself by itself against any threat or combination of threats, including from Iran and Iranian-backed proxies; and our commitment to ensure Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon. Following up on President Biden's mid-July trip to Israel and Saudi Arabia, they exchanged views on advancing regional integration and normalization with the Arab world. They discussed plans for the upcoming U.S.-Israel Strategic High-Level Dialogue on Technology, and ways to expand and enhance bilateral cooperation on critical and emerging technologies to further solutions to address global challenges.
