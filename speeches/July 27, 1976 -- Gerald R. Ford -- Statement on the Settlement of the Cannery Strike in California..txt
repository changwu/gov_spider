    I AM pleased that an agreement has been reached between the 29 canners of California's fruits and vegetables and the Council of Cannery and Food Processing Unions, ending the 8-day strike.
This dispute has been the most costly, in terms of crops lost, in the history of the California food processing industry. Each passing day is critical. I am hopeful that workers will return to their jobs as soon as possible.
I appreciate the efforts of all of those who contributed to the successful conclusion of this dispute. Secretary Usery, Secretary Butz, and James Scearce, Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, have again demonstrated exemplary public service.
