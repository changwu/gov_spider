    My most solemn duty as President is to protect the lives of the American people, and I have worked consistently for the largest defense buildup in a generation. America continues to be at war, and the legislation passed today by the Congress delivers the funding necessary to ensure that our troops are the best paid, the best equipped, and the best trained in the world.
I also commend the Congress for continuing to provide the resources necessary to support the critical missions of our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. As I have said repeatedly, our troops will have what they need to do their job, and I am pleased that a bipartisan majority in the Congress continues to stand with me to support our military.
I look forward to signing this legislation into law.
