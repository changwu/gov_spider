    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I have today, pursuant to section 673 of title 10, United States Code, authorized the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service within the Department of the Navy, to order to active duty units and individual members not assigned to units of the Ready Reserve. The continued deployment of United States forces in and around the Arabian Peninsula necessitates this action.
A copy of the Executive order implementing this action is attached.
Sincerely,
George Bush
