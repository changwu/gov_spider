    Yesterday, at a ceremony marking the 100th day since the September 11 terrorist attacks, I detailed actions the United States Government has taken in response to terrorist attacks here and abroad.
At the same time, I announced that the U.S. Government had blocked the assets of two more terrorist organizations:

Umma Tameer-e-Nau (UTN), an organization that claimed to feed the hungry and needy of Afghanistan but that in fact provided information about nuclear weapons to Al Qaida; and
Lashkar-e-Taiba, a stateless sponsor of terrorism that has conducted operations against Indian troops and civilian targets.

I also condemned the terrorist attacks against the Indian Parliament and the Kashmir Legislature and extended condolences to the Indian Government and the families of the victims.
These attacks were meant to strike at India's democracy and kill its leaders but were also intended to undermine Pakistan, harm the rapidly improving U.S.-Pakistan relationship, and to destabilize the global coalition against terrorism.
I have strongly condemned the attacks. I call upon President Musharraf to take decisive action against Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, and other terrorist organizations, their leaders, finances, and activities.
President Musharraf has condemned the terrorist attacks on the Legislature in Srinagar and on the Indian Parliament. He has said that he would move against those involved in the attacks. As President Musharraf does so, he will have our full support.
