    Laura and I are saddened by the death of Hamilton Jordan. Hamilton Jordan was a man whose love for American politics and his country took him at a young age from the State capitol in Georgia to the White House. As President Carter's close adviser, Hamilton played an important role in shaping our Nation's policies. We value his service to our country.
Hamilton Jordan was also a great community leader, using lessons learned during his personal struggle against cancer to encourage other cancer survivors to remain optimistic and embrace the blessings of each day. Through their work with Camp Sunshine, he and his wife Dorothy have helped thousands of children enjoy life as they cope with the challenges of cancer.
Our thoughts and prayers are with the Jordan family.
