    New Endorsements Build Upon Edwards' Strong Base of Support in His Home State
Columbia, South Carolina â€“ Today, with just eight days to go until the Palmetto State's Democratic Presidential Primary, Senator John Edwards' campaign announced three new endorsements from local community leaders, including State Representative Walton J. McLeod III from Little Mountain. The endorsements come shortly after the campaign released a list of more than 80 South Carolina endorsements from some of the state's most respected leaders. Also endorsing Senator Edwards as the best choice to win back the White House in November 2008 include former Newberry County Councilman Curtis Shealy and Folly Beach City Councilwoman Laura Beck.
Tomorrow, Senator John Edwards will return to the Palmetto State for a four-day "Achieving the Dream for Hard-Working Americans" tour, including a stop in Newberry on Sunday. During the trip, Edwards will call for bold action to ensure that all South Carolinians - regardless of their background - have equal opportunity to get a great education, find a good paying job, support their families and have a secure retirement.
Edwards has seen firsthand how far America has come towards the goal of equality, but still sees how far we have to go before all Americans have the same chances to get ahead. A radio actuality of Edwards' recent remarks in South Carolina about the legacy of Dr. King and our shared responsibility to fight for One America can be found online at: www.johnedwards.com/realchange.
