    "Today we remember Paul Wellstone with a heavy heart and a hopeful spirit. A man of conviction and conscience, Paul was a champion of the disadvantaged and the voiceless.
"We also remember Paul's wife, Sheila, their daughter Marcia, and the two pilots and three staff who lost their lives five years ago in that tragic crash.
"At times a lone voice on the floor of the Senate, even those that adamantly disagreed with Paul had great respect for him. From championing mental health coverage to his principled stand against the war in Iraq, Paul was beholden to no one but the people of Minnesota.
"As we strive to live up to his standard of public service and fulfill his vision for a more just and equitable nation, Paul's work continues on."
