    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Williams (D) MO)
The Administration supports H.R. 2351 as reported by the House Committee on Education and Labor. That bill authorizes appropriations for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and the Institute of Museum Services (IMS) for fiscal years 1994 and 1995 at levels consistent with the President's Budget. The Administration opposes amendments made in order by the Rules Committee that would abolish the NEA entirely or reduce the authorization levels for the NEA, the NEH, and the IMS.
