    Barbara Cubin has been a principled public servant for nearly two decades. She has stood firm for low taxes, limited government, individual rights, and a strong national defense - and Wyoming and the nation have benefited greatly from her service. As a colleague and as a constituent, I appreciate Barbara's long record in public life, and I admire the great energy and devotion she has shown throughout her career. I've enjoyed working with her and I'm proud to call her a friend. As Barbara prepares for new challenges, Lynne and I join all the people of Wyoming in saluting our Congresswoman. We'll always be grateful to Barbara Cubin, and we wish her and Fritz and all their family the very best in the years ahead.
