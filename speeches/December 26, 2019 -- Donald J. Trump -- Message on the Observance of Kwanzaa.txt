    Melania and I send season's greetings to those observing Kwanzaa both in the United States and around the world.
For more than 50 years, this weeklong celebration has been used to honor the heritage and culture African Americans share around the country and worldwide. Every aspect of American life has been enriched by the countless contributions of African Americans. Kwanzaa is an opportunity to foster deeper cultural understanding and build stronger bonds of mutual respect and friendship between all Americans.
We hope the light of the kinara fills your homes with hope and joy, and we send our best wishes for a new year filled with good health and much happiness.
