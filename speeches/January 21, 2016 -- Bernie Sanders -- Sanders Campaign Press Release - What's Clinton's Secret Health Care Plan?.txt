"Eleven days before the Iowa caucuses, only one candidate in this race has detailed a plan to provide better health care for all Americans at less cost for middle-class families. It's not Secretary Clinton.
"How exactly would Secretary Clinton, as she vaguely put it, 'get us the rest of the way?' She hasn't told us. Her website promises she'll 'expand affordable coverage, slow the growth of overall health care costs and make it possible for providers to deliver the very best care to patients.' How exactly? Does she have a plan to improve Medicare or Medicaid? Does she have a plan to provide insurance for 29 million Americans who still lack coverage and more who are underinsured?
"If she does have a plan to achieve universal health care, voters deserve to see it. If she does not have one, voters in Iowa and New Hampshire deserve to know that too."
