    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced its New Hampshire Taxpayers for Rudy Leadership Team.
This diverse group includes families, small business owners, senior citizens and young professionals. The group has united behind Rudy because, based on the strength of his record, they know he is the candidate in the race who will keep taxes low when he gets to Washington.
"New Hampshire voters expect more than talk when it comes to taxes. They expect someone who has had real success as a tax cutter," said Giuliani's New Hampshire Chairman Wayne Semprini, of New Castle. "Rudy cut taxes 23 times when he was Mayor of New York City. He overcame Democrat opposition and delivered meaningful tax relief to New Yorkers. That's real leadership on taxes, not just bluster."
Mayor Giuliani kicked off his "Rudy Makes Cents" tour last week, highlighting his record as a fiscal conservative leader in New York City. During his eight years as Mayor, Giuliani helped stimulate the local economy by cutting taxes 23 times and turning a $2.3 billion deficit into a multi-billion dollar surplus. As part of Rudy's 12 Commitments to the American People, the Mayor pledges to cut taxes and reform the tax code as President.
