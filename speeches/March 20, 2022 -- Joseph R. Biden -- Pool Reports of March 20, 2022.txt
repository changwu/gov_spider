Out of Town Pool Report 2: Bike ride
President Biden and the First Lady went for a Sunday morning bike ride, rolling past the press pool assembled at Gordons Pond at Cape Henlopen State Park at 10:51 a.m. The First Lady was riding faster than the president, and greeted the press as she rode by.
President Biden, who was wearing an Airpod in his right ear, did not respond to a question about whether China was helping Russia.

Out of Town Pool Report 3: Circling back
The Bidens rode back past the pool at Gordons Pond at 11:35 a.m., completing a loop on the park's bike path. This time, the President was riding slightly ahead of the First Lady, who wished the press pool "Happy Spring." The President did not respond to a request from a reporter to stop and chat.
While the pool was waiting for the Bidens, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki tweeted that the President will not be visiting Ukraine when he is in Europe next week.
