Governor Brian Krolicki, Congressman Mark Amodei, Speaker John Hambrick, Majority Leader Paul Anderson, Assemblyman Pat Hickey, State Senator Greg Brower, Asssemblyman Lynn Stewart, Assemblywoman Missy Woodbury, Assemblyman David Gardner, Assemblyman P.K. O'Neill and the Nevada Hispanic Leadership Committee to help promote Jeb's conservative record as Governor of Florida and his strong commitment to every American's right to rise.
"Jeb Bush is a man with a proven record of getting things done. Jeb's conservative reforms resulted in the creation of 1.3 million new jobs in Florida. As president, Jeb would bring economic success to Nevada through high-sustained 4% growth. I'm proud to support Jeb for president," said Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo.
"Jeb Bush was a strong, conservative governor, and I believe we need his strong, successful experience to disrupt the broken Washington culture. Jeb can take on the big issues facing America and achieve true success, whether it's through his tax proposal that would save money for the middle class or his energy plan that would unleash the energy revolution and help all Americans rise," said former Clark County Sheriff Bill Young.
