    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Czech Republic on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, signed at Washington on February 4, 1998. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.
The Treaty is one of a series of modern mutual legal assistance treaties being negotiated by the United States in order to counter criminal activities more effectively. The Treaty should be an effective tool to assist in the prosecution of a wide variety of crimes, including terrorism, other violent crimes, drug trafficking, money laundering, and other "white-collar" crime. The Treaty is self-executing.
The Treaty provides for a broad range of cooperation in criminal matters. Mutual assistance available under the Treaty includes: locating or identifying persons or items; serving documents; taking testimony or statements of persons; transferring persons in custody for testimony or other purposes; providing documents, records, and articles of evidence; executing requests for searches and seizures; immobilizing assets; assisting in proceedings related to forfeiture of assets, restitution, and criminal fines; and providing any other assistance consistent with the laws of the Requested State.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, May 22, 1998.
