Out-of-town pool report #2 - POTUS call in to Macy's parade
While holding, pool listened to Biden's call in to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. He said he was going to stop at a fire department today to spend time with first responders.
"I want to say thanks to the firefighters and police officers, first responders. They never take a break," he said.
"And by the way, we're going to be talking to some of our troops later in the day, both here and abroad. We remember them every single day. God bless our troops."
The FLOTUS said they will probably take a walk on the beach after their family dinner.
POTUS said coming to Nantucket for Thanksgiving has been a family tradition since they got married.

Out-of-town pool report #4 - firehouse remarks including gaggle
Pool arrived at a firehouse at 9:58 am
Few onlookers on the route. (We were not close to the harbor where the annual turkey plunge was happening.)
About 10 firefighters were lined up outside to greet the president. POTUS & FLOTUS - holding the hand of the youngest grandchild, Beau - arrived with pumpkin pies.
"How are you guys?" Biden said.
Pool was too far away to hear more of the conversation.
POTUS & FLOTUS posed for photos.
Beau was given a miniature fire hat. Firefighters took photos of Beau with FLOTUS, who was wearing a brown suede jacket, dark pants and black suede boots.
He briefly answered some questions.
On latest shooting, he said the idea that we're not enforcing red flags law is ridiculous. The idea we still allow semiautomatic weapons is just sick.
On banning assault weapons, he said:
" I'm going to try."
On Ukraine, he thinks there's still sufficient congressional support.
No time to walk away from Ukraine.
On rail strike, he said he can't talk about details but has not directly engaged though his team has been in touch with the parties.
Asked when he's getting his physical, he said: "Do you think I need it?"
He said he's had part of it done & will get the rest later this year.
Pool left at about 10:15.
Will send fuller quotes soon.

Out-of-town pool report #7 -- fuller quotes
As always, please check against transcript.
On mass shootings:
"The idea that we're not enforcing red flag laws…is ridiculous."
"The idea we still allow semi- automatic weapons to be purchased is sick. Just sick. It has no, no social redeeming value. Zero. None. Not a single solitary rationale for it except profit for the gun manufacturers."
Q. Can you do anything about gun laws during the lame duck?
"I'm going to try?"
Q. What will you try and do?
"I'm going to try to get rid of assault weapons. "
Q. During the lame duck?
"I'm going to do it whenever - I've got to make that assessment as I get in and start counting votes."
On Ukraine:
"This is no time to walk away from Ukraine, not at all. Now, we had a lot of talk in this last election about whether the other team is going to continue to support Ukraine. I still believe there's enough support there."
On the railroad strike:
Q. Can you talk about what the holdup is?
"I can't because it's the middle of the negotiations."
Q. Are you involved?
"My team has been in touch with all the parties…I have not directly engaged yet because they're still talking."
On annual physical:
Q. When will you get your annual physical?
"Do you think I need it?"
"Part of my physical is already done and I'll be getting it before the end of the year."
On oil price cap
Q. Has Yellen talk to you about an oil price cap?
"Yes, and it's in play.
