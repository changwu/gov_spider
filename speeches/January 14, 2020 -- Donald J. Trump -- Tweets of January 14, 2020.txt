We are helping Apple all of the time on TRADE and so many other issues, and yet they refuse to unlock phones used by killers, drug dealers and other violent criminal elements. They will have to step up to the plate and help our great Country, NOW! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.Retweets: 35983Favorites: 175572

Cryin' Chuck Schumer just said, "The American people want a fair trial in the Senate." True, but why didn't Nervous Nancy and Corrupt politician Adam "Shifty" Schiff give us a fair trial in the House. It was the most lopsided & unfair basement hearing in the history of Congress!Retweets: 43255Favorites: 196611
