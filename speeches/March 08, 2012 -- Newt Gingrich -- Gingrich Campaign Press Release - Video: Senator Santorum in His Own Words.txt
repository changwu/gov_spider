    Atlanta, GA - Newt 2012 released a new web video today using Senator Santorum's own words to highlight how his leadership in the Senate helped contribute to the abandonment by the Republican Party of core conservative principles.
The video begins with Senator Santorum saying "somewhere before 2008 conservatives lost their way," and then goes on to make the case that Santorum was a big part of the problem.
During the time Santorum was in the Senate leadership from 2001-2007, his big spending ways amounted to $1.6 trillion in budget deficits, added trillions more to an exploding federal debt, and produced zero balanced budgets.
Whether it was endorsing Arlen Specter, being a proud earmarker, or voting for Davis-Bacon to appease big labor, Santorum was always willing to be, as he put it, a good "team player."
"Senator Santorum poses as fiscally responsible, but he's the one who broke the bank while in Senate leadership," said Joe DeSantis, Communications Director for Newt 2012. "During his six years in Senate leadership, Senator Santorum repeatedly comprised his principles and played the Washington game.Â  As the poster child of the big government Republican Party that the American people rejected in 2006 and 2008, Senator Santorum is a comprised candidate who cannot offer the stark choice we need between President Obama's big spending record."
