    I applaud the Congress for today's passage of an energy bill that will help secure our energy future and reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy. The energy bill will increase conservation and efficiency, diversify our energy supply with alternative and renewable sources, expand domestic energy production in environmentally sensitive ways, and modernize our electricity infrastructure. Four years ago, I called for a national energy plan to address our Nation's energy needs for the 21st century. The bipartisan energy bill passed today will give America a comprehensive national energy strategy for the first time in more than a decade and is critically important to our long-term national and economic security. I look forward to signing it into law.
