    The White House announced today its selection of 30 national finalists who will compete for the 2002-2003 White House Fellowships, America's most prestigious fellowship for leadership and public service. This year's national finalists represent a diverse candidate group including: finalists from each branch of the military, two finalists from the non-profit sector, three from the business sector, two from the management consulting sector, one from the corporate finance sector, a policeman, a firefighter, two professors, two teachers, four physicians, and two attorneys.
The mission of the non-partisan White House Fellows program, as established by President Johnson in 1964, is to develop our nation's future leaders by giving Fellows first hand, high-level experience with the workings of the Federal government and increasing their sense of participation in national affairs. Every year, between 11 and 19 Fellows are selected to serve for one year as full-time, paid assistants to members of the Cabinet and senior White House staff. In return for the privilege of participating in the Fellowship year, Fellows are expected to apply what they have learned by contributing to the nation as greater leaders in their respective communities, professions, and in public service.
Selection as a White House Fellow is based on a record of remarkable professional achievement early in a career, evidence of leadership potential, a proven commitment to public service, and the knowledge and skills necessary to contribute successfully at the highest levels of the federal government. In its 38-year history, the program has fostered leaders in many fields, including Secretary of State Colin Powell, Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao, Wall Street Journal Editor Paul Gigot, former Chairman and CEO of CNN Tom Johnson, Senator Samuel D. Brownback (R-KS), U.S. Army General Wesley K. Clark, former Chairman and CEO of Tenneco Dana Mead, former Senator Tim Wirth (D-CO), U.S. Navy Admiral Dennis Blair, and many others.
