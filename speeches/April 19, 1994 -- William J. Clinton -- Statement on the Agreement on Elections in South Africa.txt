    I warmly welcome today's agreement among the South African Government, the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party to renounce violence and to bring Inkatha into the nation's first non-racial elections next week. Throughout the historic process of change in South Africa, the leaders of that country have shown great courage and a capacity for compromise. Today's bold action by Chief Buthelezi, Nelson Mandela, and F.W. de Klerk is one more act of collective statesmanship that bodes well for the prospect of free and fair elections in South Africa and for the success of the future Government of National Unity.
What happens in South Africa is of vital importance to us all. South Africa has the potential to alter the world trend toward greater ethnic division and establish a powerful model for democratic reform and national reconciliation. We will remain steadfast in our support for South Africa as it makes this difficult and historic transition to nonracial democracy.
