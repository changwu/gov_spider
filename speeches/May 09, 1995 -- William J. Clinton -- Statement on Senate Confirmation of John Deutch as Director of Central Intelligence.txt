    I am very pleased with the Senate's overwhelming 98-0 vote to confirm John Deutch as Director of Central Intelligence. The Senate's action is further affirmation of the outstanding leadership and management skills John Deutch will bring to the intelligence community and the CIA. I have the greatest confidence that he will bring a renewed sense of purpose, direction, and spirit to the CIA and the intelligence community.
