    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Pell (D) Rhode Island and 18 others)
The Administration is working actively to secure international cooperation to stem the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons (CBW). The Administration supports discretionary authority for the President to sanction countries that use CBW in violation of international law. However, it strongly opposes S. 195 because the bill would, regardless of the circumstances, mandate the imposition of CBW sanctions, subject only to a nine month waiver in the case of country sanctions. If S. 195 were presented to the President in its current form, his senior advisers would recommend that it be vetoed.
Mandatory sanctions fail to provide necessary Presidential discretion and flexibility for imposing or waiving sanctions. As a result, Administration CBW non-proliferation objectives would be impeded. In addition, mandatory sanctions and elaborate reporting requirements could inimically affect our foreign policy and trade interests, as well as jeopardize intelligence sources and activities. Finally, several provisions in the bill micromanage or unconstitutionally constrain the President's authority to conduct the Nation's foreign affairs or provide for exercise of legislative power outside the constitutionally prescribed manner.
