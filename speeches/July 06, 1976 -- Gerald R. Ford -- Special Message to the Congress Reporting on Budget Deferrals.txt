    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report two new deferrals totaling $4.6 million in budget authority. In addition, I am transmitting 27 supplementary deferrals that have a net effect of decreasing the total amount of deferred funds previously transmitted by $1,462.5 million.
The two new deferrals are routine actions and involve $135,938 for the Special foreign currency program of the Department of Labor and $4.4 million for the National Commission for the Observance of International Women's Year. Eighteen of the supplementary reports extend deferrals into the transition quarter while the remaining nine reflect increases to the amounts originally reported.
The details of the revised and new deferrals are contained in the attached reports.
