    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Bates (D) California and 50 others)
The Administration believes that broad block grant programs are far superior to prescriptive new Federal categorical authorities. It therefore does not favor enactment of H.R. 1602, which would create an unnecessary State grant program with strict planning requirements subject to Federal scrutiny.
The Administration strongly supports further development, expansion, and improvement of life-saving trauma care and emergency medical services throughout the Nation. Under the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant enacted in 1981, States were given broad authority and flexibility to use Federal grant funds to tailor health services programs to best meet the needs of their own citizens and communities. States have been supporting their trauma and emergency medical programs under that Block Grant.
