    Charleston, WV - Hillary Clinton honored Workers' Memorial Day today by pledging to continue fighting to improve workplace safety and protect all working Americans.
"Today, as we remember those who have lost their lives in the line of work, we must honor our responsibility to all working Americans by improving safety in the workplace. As president, I will continue fighting to protect our working men and women," said Senator Clinton.
Steven Perdue, a business representative with the Sheet Metal Workers also advocated improving workplace safety and praised Hillary Clinton's commitment to working families.
"We have come a long way in improving workplace safety and workers' rights, but we still have a long way to go. Hillary Clinton has a strong record of fighting for working families and the right of every American to a safe work environment. I am confident that as president, Hillary will continue fighting for the working men and women in West Virginia and across the country who are looking for a President who will make working Americans and their families a top priority once again," said Perdue.
After the tragedies at the Sago and Alma mines in 2006, Sen. Clinton co-sponsored the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act to strengthen protections for our nation's miners.
Sen. Clinton is an original co-sponsor of the Protecting America's Workers Act, which would expand OSHA protection, clarify the safety protections that employers must provide, expand civil and criminal penalties for OSHA violators, increase transparency in the OSHA citation process, and strengthen protections for OSHA whistleblowers.
