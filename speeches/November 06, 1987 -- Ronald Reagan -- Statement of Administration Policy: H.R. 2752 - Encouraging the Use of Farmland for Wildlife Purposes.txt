    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Marlenee (R) Montana and 11 others)
The administration opposes H.R. 2752 because the bill is technically flawed and would be subject to abuse. Many producers who find it impossible to use portions of their base acreage for whatever reason could, under H.R. 2752, redefine that land as a wildlife sanctuary and continue to receive certain agricultural program benefits that, absent this bill, they would not receive. This would increase Federal expenditures for price support programs, and could create a new disaster relief program under the guise of increasing wildlife habitat.
