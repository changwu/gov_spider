    The President. You know, it's a remarkable place. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be with the Pettys and the champion race car drivers who have heard a call to help people who need help. And I wish our fellow citizens could see the physical layout here. And if you were here, you'd also feel a great sense of compassion. And, you know, the Petty family has been well known for a long time in America. And they've been known as great athletesâ€” now they will be known as great humanitarians as well.
And so we really thank you.
Kyle Petty. Thank you, sir.
The President. This is a place that's in honor of their son, Adam. They have made a conscious decision to turn a tragic event into a loving event, and that's what I feel here. And you guys did a good job. Thanks for having me.
