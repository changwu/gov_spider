    From his courageous service in Vietnam to his tireless work in the United States Senate, Jim Webb has dedicated his life to serving our Nation and those who defend it. Jim has been a relentless advocate for our veterans who helped to pass the post-9/11 GI bill, a strong voice for American leadership in the world who strengthened our relationships in Southeast Asia, and a leading reformer who is improving our criminal justice system. Michelle and I thank Senator Webb for his distinguished service, and I look forward to working with Jim over the next 2 years on behalf of Virginians and the American people.
