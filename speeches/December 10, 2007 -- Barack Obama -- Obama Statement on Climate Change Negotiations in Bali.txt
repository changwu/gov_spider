    Chicago, IL -- U.S. Senator Barack Obama released the following statement today on the climate change negotiations in Bali.
"The post-Kyoto climate negotiations that have kicked off in Bali offer an important opportunity for America to re-engage with the rest of the world in taking on one of the greatest challenges of this generation. But we must start by showing the world that we are serious about tackling the climate crisis here at home, which is why I've put forth a bold energy plan that would reduce our carbon emissions 80% by 2050. As President, I will also personally reach out to the leaders of the biggest carbon emitting nations and ask them to join America in creating a new Global Energy Forum that can continue the work begun in Bali and lay the foundation for the next generation of climate protocols."
