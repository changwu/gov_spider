    THE PRESIDENT is extremely disappointed with the House vote to override his veto of House Joint Resolution 542.
He feels the action seriously undermines this Nation's ability to act decisively and convincingly in times of international crisis.
The confidence of our allies in our ability to assist them will be diminished by the House's action. Our potential adversaries may be encouraged to engage in future acts of international mischief because of this blow to our deterrent posture.
