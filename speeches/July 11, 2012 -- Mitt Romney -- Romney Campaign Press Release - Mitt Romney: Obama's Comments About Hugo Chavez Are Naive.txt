Hezbollah, of course, being a surrogate and a proxy for Iran would potentially have access to weapons that could be used against us. ... The idea that this nation, this president doesn't pose a national security threat to this country is simply naïve.

MITT ROMNEY: "I was stunned by his comments, and shocked by them. This is Hugo Chavez, this is Venezuela. This is Chavez who has invited Iran in, who has invited Hezbollah. Hezbollah, of course, being a surrogate and a proxy for Iran would potentially have access to weapons that could be used against us. This is Chavez who champions the Bolivarian Revolution movement and is spreading dictatorships and tyranny throughout Latin America. This is Chavez who supports FARC and other terrorist activity in nations like Colombia, that are our friends. The idea that this nation, this president doesn't pose a national security threat to this country is simply naïve. It's an extraordinary admission on the part of this president to be completely out of touch with what's happened in Latin America. Latin America is critical to America, United States of America. And the President needs to focus on what's happening there, what Chavez is doing, what the Castros are doing. These are people who call for terrible acts against America and to suggest that somehow this is isn't important is, I think, a very misguided and misdirected thought on the part of our President."
