    In Plains, Ga., Mr. Carter announced:
I received a personal call from President Ford this morning at 11:05 A.M. Because of the condition of his voice, his chief of staff, Richard Cheney, then read a telegram from the President to me.
I deeply appreciate the President's call and his gracious expression of congratulations and cooperation. I expressed my admiration for him and for the strong, well planned and effective campaign that he ran. I am particularly grateful for his offer of close cooperation during this transition period, and during the next administration Senator Mondale and I will take full advantage of that offer. Our staffs are already beginning to make transition arrangements this afternoon.
One of the first tasks facing any new President is the unification of our country after a close and hard fought election. President Ford's characteristically gracious statement today will make that job much easier for me. I look forward to working with President Ford and others like him who even though divided by partisan affiliation are united by common devotion to this country and the well being of our people.
