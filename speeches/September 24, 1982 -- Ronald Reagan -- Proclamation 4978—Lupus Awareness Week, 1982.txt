  A Proclamation

Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) is a serious disorder that can affect many different parts of the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys, heart, central nervous system, and other internal organs. While no one person has all symptoms, and they may occur in varying combinations, there are recognizable patterns of illness that identify patients with lupus.
It is estimated that 500,000 Americans have lupusâ€”most of them young women. Fortunately, because of the progress that has been made in recent years toward better understanding and increased public awareness of the disease, there is more hope for its victims. Although research has yet to find the cure for lupus, the outlook for patients has improved greatly. Through advances in medical research, including better diagnosis and more effective drug treatment and medical management, many patients with lupus can now look forward to living more productive and happier lives. It is my fervent hope that continuing advances in medical research will improve the quality of life for all lupus patients and eventually lead to the prevention and cure of this serious and distressing disease.
By Senate Joint Resolution 183, the Congress of the United States has requested the President to designate the week beginning October 17, 1982, as Lupus Awareness Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning October 17, 1982, as Lupus Awareness Week, and I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week by learning more about this disease.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 24th day of Sept., in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightytwo, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.

RONALD REAGAN
