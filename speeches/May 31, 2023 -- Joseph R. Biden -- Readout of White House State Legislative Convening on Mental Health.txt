    In recognition of Mental Health Awareness Month, today, officials from the White House Domestic Policy Council, the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, and the Department of Health and Human Services convened 19 state legislators from 10 states across the country working to advance legislation to improve mental health care. This legislative convening follows a White House forum held earlier this month with county officials on mental health as well as a convening with state legislators held in September 2022.
The Biden-Harris Administration has made mental health a top priority by investing unprecedented resources in tackling the mental health crisis, particularly among our youth. In March 2022, the White House released a comprehensive mental health strategy designed to strengthen system capacity, connect more Americans to care, and create healthy environments to transform how we address mental health.
Throughout this Mental Health Awareness Month, the Administration has announced a series of actions and investments, including more than $95 million in awards across 35 states to increase access to school-based mental health services and more than $200 million for states, territories, and tribal organizations to support "988" services and help respond to crises. These investments are part of billions of dollars the Administration has committed to expanding access to mental health services through President Biden's American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.
During the convening, legislators discussed steps they are taking at the state level to address the mental health crisis, including improving access to mental health care in schools and universities, funding and expanding "988" services, and boosting the mental health workforce. Senior White House officials thanked the leaders for their efforts and ongoing partnership with the Biden-Harris Administration to improve mental health care for all Americans.
