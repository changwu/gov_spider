    The United States strongly condemns today's terrorist attack against Abha in Saudi Arabia, which injured at least a dozen innocent civilians. The Houthis have claimed responsibility for this attack, and we will work with our Saudi and international partners to hold them accountable. As the President told His Majesty King Salman yesterday, we are committed to supporting Saudi Arabia in the defense of its people and territory from these attacks. America will have the backs of our friends in the region.
