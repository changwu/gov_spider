    The President has consistently urged the release by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence of its report on the Iran matter and the alleged diversion of funds to the anti-Sandinista forces and is pleased that this has now occurred. The committee's report is an important step toward getting to the bottom of this matter, as the President has promised. Toward this end, the President will continue to work with the select committees in Congress, the Tower board, and the Independent Counsel.
