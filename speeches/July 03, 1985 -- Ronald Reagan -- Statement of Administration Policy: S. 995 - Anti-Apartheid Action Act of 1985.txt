    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Senators Lugar (R) Indiana, Mathias (R) Maryland, and Dole (R) Kansas)
The Administration opposes enactment of S. 995. While we support the constructive elements in the bill, the punitive measures it proposes against the Government and people of South Africa and the threat of additional economic sanctions within eighteen months are inconsistent with our approach of supporting constructive internal reform and regional security. The bill's measures are unlikely to produce the kind of results we all seek. The Administration believes that the best way to achieve peaceful change in South Africa is to use the resources available to the United States, including those of the private sector, in a positive rather than negative manner.
