Bill Hemmer: I don't know how it works out, but South Carolina's first in the barrel. And we'll see whether or not that sticks. He's gonna talk about Bidenomics today. He's gonna talk about the infrastructure deal. He's gonna talk about the Inflation Reduction Act, whatever that is. How's that working out for the people in the Palmetto State?
Tim Scott: Well, I hope he is gonna start his apology tour here in South Carolina because what the president wants the American people to do is to believe what he says and not what we see with our own eyes. What we see with our own eyes, Bill, is a loss of $10,000 of spending power. Since President Biden has taken office, we've seen a 40% increase in gas prices, 20% increase in food. And unfortunately, Bill, $2,000 more is what it costs for electricity coming to your home.
But worse of all, every single month since he's been in office, except for one, inflation is outpacing increases in wages. We've done better. We can do better. And when I'm president of the United States, we're gonna continue what we did before: cutting taxes, putting more dollars in the pockets of the average family, and increasing an incentive-based economy like my opportunity zones, where within those zones, wages went up 8% while inflation was only 2%. We can do better by trusting the American people with their own money.
