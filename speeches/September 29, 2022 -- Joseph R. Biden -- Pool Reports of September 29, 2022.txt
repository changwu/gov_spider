WH pool report 1
Good morning from the White House on a glorious fall day, where our thoughts are with those struggling to recover from Ian, and those still in its path. The now tropical storm is also on President Biden's mind/schedule.
Call time is at 11:00 for an 11:35 departure to FEMA HQ for an Ian briefing, the first of two scheduled off-campus movements, followed by a 6:40 family photo on the North Portico with leaders from the U.S. - Pacific Island Country Summit. Between, Biden will visit the state department as part of the summit.
Given the busy news cycle, there has been a request for a briefing, but there are no updates, yet, to the schedule below.
h
And yes (you know who you are), I'll ask for a wine and dinner menu for tonight's event.

"We may," he answered, when asked by a celebrated wire reporter about the need for Congress to provide additional funding, as Biden was walking away from lectern.
He did not answer if he held Russia responsible for the Nordstream pipeline rupture in the Baltic, insisting that it was off topic.

WH pool report 14: two minute warning to North Portico spray
[APP Note: No additional text was included in this report.]



September 29, 202219:03

WH pool report 15: Spray is over. President did not respond to shouted questions on Russia and Nord Stream
President Biden did, however, engage on tonight's repast. Answering a question on what was on the menu, Biden joked that he "worked all day on it."
You had the opportunity to watch the scene live, but if not, I'll try and paint it. POTUS emerged from the North Portico doors slightly after 6:41 and took his place just atop the steps, standing center on a red carpet, with his fellow leaders spread out to the left and right. Fourteen flags, from the represented Pacific Island nations, were arrayed behind the group. Fading evening light, with plenty of artificial tungsten hitting them as well. Easy shot for the stills.
The president clearly heard the shouted questions -- "Can you now say Putin was behind the damage to the Nord Stream pipeline?" .... "What consequences will Russia face?" -- turned his back and walked into the residence.
And we have a travel photo lid. I bid you a good evening.

Foreign Press Pool Report #1 Pacific Leader Photos
Good afternoon, I am Scott Stewart with the Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun and am serving as your Foreign Press Group pooler today.
For the benefit of those who will be covering the President's participation in the U.S.-Pacific Islands Summit this afternoon, I am attaching photos of several of the Pacific Island leaders who may be in attendance. Unfortunately, a confirmed list was not available from the NSC or State Department. As reported by my colleague yesterday, the leaders of Republic of Nauru and Vanuatu have sent representatives in their stead. Nauru just elected a new president yesterday, Russ Kun.
