Verona, PA - After Tuesday's landslide wins in Minnesota and Missouri, and his victory in the Romney strong-hold of Colorado, Rick Santorum's momentum continues nationally with several polls showing him surging to a lead over Mitt Romney.
In a new Public Policy Polling survey, Rick Santorum surges to a 15-point lead nationally over Mitt Romney. When former Speaker Newt Gingrich is removed, Santorum's lead grows to 22-points.
Public Policy Polling:
National Poll (including Gingrich):
Santorum: 38%
Romney: 23%
Gingrich: 17%
National Poll (excluding Gingrich):
Santorum: 50%
Romney: 28%
A new FOX News poll show similar momentum for Santorum, with a surge of 13-points in the two days following Tuesday night election contests.

National Poll (two-days following Tuesday's elections):
Santorum: 30%
Romney: 30%
Gingrich: 16%
Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said: "So much of American politics can be summed up by the three questions, "Do I know you?," "Do I like you?," and "Do I trust you?" By this time, voters have gotten a chance to know all these candidates, and they now know Rick Santorum is the only true conservative in the race that they like and who they can trust."
As the Public Policy Polling survey notes:
Part of the reason for Santorum's surge is his own high level of popularity. 64% of voters see him favorably to only 22% with a negative one. But the other, and maybe more important, reason is that Republicans are significantly souring on both Romney and Gingrich. Romney's favorability is barely above water at 44/43, representing a 23 point net decline from our December national poll when he was +24 (55/31). Gingrich has fallen even further. A 44% plurality of GOP voters now hold a negative opinion of him to only 42% with a positive one. That's a 34 point drop from 2 months ago when he was at +32 (60/28).
Santorum is now completely dominating with several key segments of the electorate, especially the most right leaning parts of the party. With those describing themselves as 'very conservative,' he's now winning a majority of voters at 53% to 20% for Gingrich and 15% for Romney. Santorum gets a majority with Tea Party voters as well at 51% to 24% for Gingrich and 12% for Romney. And with Evangelicals he falls just short of a majority with 45% to 21% for Gingrich and 18% for Romney.
