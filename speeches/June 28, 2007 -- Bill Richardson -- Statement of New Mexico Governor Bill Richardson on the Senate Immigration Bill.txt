    SANTA FE, NM -- Democratic Presidential candidate Governor Bill Richardson released the following statement today on the failure of the Senate to push the immigration bill forward:
"I am deeply disappointed. You can't solve a problem by ignoring it. We have got to find a way to bridge the divide and bring people together to address the critical problems facing our nation -- immigration, energy, healthcare, education.
"This is the price America pays for divisive leadership. Congress should continue to work on passing immigration reform."
