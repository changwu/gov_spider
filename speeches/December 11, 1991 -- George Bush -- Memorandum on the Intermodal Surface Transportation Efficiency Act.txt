    Memorandum for the Secretary of Transportation
I have just received, and will soon sign, H.R. 2950, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. I direct you to mobilize immediately the Department to expedite release of highway, highway safety, and mass transit funds. Further, you should assist State and local transportation officials in the expeditious implementation of this Act. Timely action is essential to provide construction industry jobs and to stimulate our overall economy as well as to begin renewing our investment in the soundness and safety of the Nation's surface transportation system.
George Bush
