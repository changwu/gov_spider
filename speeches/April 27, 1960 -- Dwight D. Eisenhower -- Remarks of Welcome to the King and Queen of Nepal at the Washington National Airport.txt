    Your Majesties:
It is indeed a great honor to welcome you here to the United States. The American people are delighted that you have found it possible to lay down your own responsibilities long enough to come and make this visit to our country.
It is truly an historic occasion. This is the first time that a reigning monarch of Nepal has set foot on this continent, and we are indeed proud that you have found it possible to do so.
The friendly relations between your country and ours are a matter of common knowledge. They have long existed. They have been strong and cordial, and we are confident that your visit here will do much to strengthen them and sustain them.
So, sir, and to you, Your Majesty, we--the people, the Government, and I--join in saying welcome, and we hope that you find our country interesting, and that every minute of your stay here will be enjoyable.
