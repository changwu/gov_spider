    The small-business jobs bill passed today will help provide loans and cut taxes for millions of small-business owners without adding a dime to our Nation's deficit. After months of partisan obstruction and needless delay, I'm grateful that Democrats and a few Republicans came together to support this commonsense plan to put Americans back to work. I look forward to signing the bill on Monday.
