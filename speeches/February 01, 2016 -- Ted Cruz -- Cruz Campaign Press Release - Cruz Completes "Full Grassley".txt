HOUSTON, Texas â€“ Today, Presidential candidate Ted Cruz is set to complete the "Full Grassley" when he visits the Greene County Community Center in Jefferson, Iowa. Cruz will have held at least one event in every one of Iowa's 99 counties. Over the final push leading up to the Caucus, Cruz has been barnstorming the Hawkeye state in advance of the Iowa Caucuses by holding over 30 events across 22 counties.
"It has been incredible to travel across the state of Iowa and meet thousands of Iowans who come out to our events," said Cruz. "This would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work of the men and women on this campaign. Conservatives in Iowa and all over this country are coalescing behind our campaign. We are seeing amazing momentum because America is ready for an honest and principled conservative that will stand up and lead the fight for the values that are important to this country."
The completion of the "Full Grassley" is one of the final milestones in Cruz's impressive Iowa organization. The campaign has put together an unmatched ground game throughout the Hawkeye state. It has named a county chair for each of Iowa's 99 counties and has recruited 247 notable activists, pastors, and lawmakers including Congressman Steve King, Bob Vander Plaats, Steve Deace, and Cruz's chairman Matt Schultz, former Iowa Secretary of State.
Cruz has met thousands of Iowans who have come out to his events. He has made it a point to spend time listening to and getting to know the people of Iowa face to face. The campaign previously announced it has 1,573 caucus captains across the state. Thousands of volunteers have been working to identify and turn out caucus goers for Cruz. Volunteers, on average, are making over 20,000 phone calls and knocking on 2,000 doors every day.
The event in Jefferson today begins at 1 p.m. CT at the Greene County Community Center, 204 West Harrison Street, Jefferson, IA 50129.
