    WASHINGTON, DC -- President Obama today named 108 mathematics and science teachers as recipients of the prestigious Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching. This year's awardees represent all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, U.S. Territories, and the Department of Defense Education Activity schools. The educators will receive their awards at a Washington, DC, event later this summer.
The Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching is awarded annually to outstanding K-12 science and mathematics teachers from across the country. The winners are selected by a panel of distinguished scientists, mathematicians, and educators following an initial selection process done at the state level. Each year the award alternates between teachers teaching kindergarten through 6th grade and those teaching 7th through 12th grades. The awardees named today teach 7th through 12th grade.
Winners of this Presidential honor receive a $10,000 award from the National Science Foundation to be used at their discretion. They also are invited to Washington, DC, for an awards ceremony, as well educational and celebratory events, and visits with members of the Administration.
"These teachers are shaping America's success through their passion for math and science," President Obama said. "Their leadership and commitment empower our children to think critically and creatively about science, technology, engineering, and math. The work these teachers are doing in our classrooms today will help ensure that America stays on the cutting edge tomorrow."
President Obama is strengthening education in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields in order to fully harness the promise our Nation's students. Investing in exemplary teachers like these awardees is vital to inspiring the next generation of explorers and innovators. That's why President Obama launched the "Educate to Innovate" campaign, which has garnered more than $1 billion in financial and in-kind support for STEM programs. It is also why the President has called for preparing 100,000 excellent science and mathematics teachers over the next decade, leading to the creation of "100kin10," a coalition of leading corporations, philanthropies, universities, service organizations, and others working to train and retain STEM teachers across the Nation. In addition, the President's proposed STEM Master Teacher Corps aims to leverage the expertise of some of our nation's best and brightest teachers in science and mathematics to elevate the teaching of these subjects nationwide.
The recipients of the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching are listed below, by state.
