We're out there every single day on the campaign. We're answering questions of voters. So it helps a lot. That's real preparation in the real world, in real time. I do think you want to be up-to-date on what's been in the news lately. If some issues come up that you think might come up during the debate, you want to be prepared to answer that. But, by and large, what's made it easier for us — not easy, but easier — is I know what I believe in. We have a well-structured, well-outlined policy document, both foreign policy, domestic policy we've talked about extensively. And so, when you have clear ideas about the issues before our country, I think it helps a lot in that preparation. But I think the main thing we do is just be up-to-date on them."
