    Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell today made the following statement on the strike by the Chicago Teachers Union:
"Yet again, President Obama is allowing special interests to put their agenda ahead of serving our nation's students. This is Chicago-style politics at its worst. Even the President's former chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, recognizes that this strike is wrong. It's disappointing that the President has decided to stand idly by as the Chicago Teachers Union walks out on thousands of schoolchildren."
