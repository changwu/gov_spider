    As we continue to face the COVID-19 pandemic, President Trump is trying to get the U.S. Supreme Court to eliminate the life-saving Affordable Care Act and continues to stand with his Republican colleagues like Governor DeSantis who refuse to expand Medicaid, denying more than 800,000 Floridians access to quality, affordable health care. If President Trump succeeds, everyone who today has health insurance thanks to the Affordable Care Act could see their coverage ripped away. In Miami-Dade County, 36% of those enrolled in coverage through the ACA are Hispanic, the highest percentage of enrollment for any ethnic group.
Fighting to rip away health care during a pandemic isn't leadership. It's weak and it's cruel. My promise to you is simple: health care is a right, not a privilege, and a Biden-Harris Administration will work every day to expand access to quality health care for all Americans.
