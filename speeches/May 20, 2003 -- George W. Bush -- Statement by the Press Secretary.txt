    President Bush met today with President Mejia of the Dominican Republic. They discussed cooperation in the fight against terrorism, bilateral relations broadly, and deepening of our trade relationship specifically. U.S. Trade Representative Zoellick also met today with President Mejia. Both agreed to intensify, in consultation with Congress, our joint efforts to determine the best way to connect our ongoing U.S.-Dominican trade dialogue with the U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) talks so that all countries can move toward freer trade together.
