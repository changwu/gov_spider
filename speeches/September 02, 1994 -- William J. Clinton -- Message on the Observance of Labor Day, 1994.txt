    As Americans celebrate our nation's 100th Labor Day holiday, we take time out of our busy schedules to recognize and to appreciate the importance of America's working men and women. We as a people strive to put our talents and interests to use every day. We find joy in learning new skills and in making new discoveries. It is in no small measure the many rewards we find in labor that make America's workers the finest in the world.
As our country faces an increasingly competitive international marketplace, America's tradition of innovation and progress is more important than ever. Today's world demands that we reinvent the compact between labor and management, guided by a firm commitment to ongoing dialogue and cooperation. It requires that our nation make use of the tools at hand: our abundant land, our diverse and determined people, and our shared belief in the values of hard work and fair play.
Working together, we have the power to build a new partnership for prosperity. We know how to improve quality and efficiency, to reduce production costs and to increase profitsâ€”knowledge that will serve to benefit employer and worker alike. With a renewed dedication to providing education and re-training, we can craft a work force ready to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century and beyond.
This year, we resolve to press forward in our efforts to promote new growth and opportunities, creating safe and healthy working conditions that enable our citizens to be good workers and good parents. For at the heart of the American Dream is the American family. And our goal must be to make the Dream a reality for all of our families. Indeed, as we celebrate Labor Day this centennial year, that common vision inspires us still.
Best wishes to all for a memorable holiday.
BILL CLINTON
