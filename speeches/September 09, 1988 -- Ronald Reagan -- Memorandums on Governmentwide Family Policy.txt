Memorandum for the Secretary of the Treasury
I have approved the recommendations contained in the first 11 sections of the Family Report directed by the Executive Order on the Family. These recommendations address two issues that fall within the purview of your Department.
Would you please ensure that the following recommendations are carried out:
1. A study of methods whereby tax changes can be directed toward families with dependent children, either through an increase in the personal exemption for dependent children, targeted tax credits, or other methods.

The study should be submitted for further analysis to the Economic Policy Council within 120 days.
2. A study of the idea of allowing spouses without earned income to contribute the same amount to an IRA ($2,000) as those who work outside the home. A report should be submitted to the Economic Policy Council, within 120 days, containing budget-neutral options for achieving this reform.
