    I wish to express my appreciation for the House Government Operations Committee's vote today on the civil service reorganization plan. I especially want to thank Committee Chairman Jack Brooks for his leadership. The 31-0 committee vote count reflects the strong bipartisan support for my civil service reforms.
I look forward to the reorganization plan's becoming effective, and to the passage by Congress of the companion civil service legislation.
