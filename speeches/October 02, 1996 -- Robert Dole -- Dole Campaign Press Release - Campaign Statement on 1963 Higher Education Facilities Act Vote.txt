    "Once again, the Clinton-Gore campaign seems to have confused speed with accuracy. In their most recent vapid reaction, the Clinton-Gore campaign notes Bob Dole's opposition to the conference report on the 1963 Higher Education Facilities Act. Clinton-Gore neglects to mention, however, that the bipartisan opposition to the Higher Education Facilities Act included at least one prominent Democrat -- Al Gore, Sr. With the first debate coming up this weekend, they might want to check their facts a little more carefully."
