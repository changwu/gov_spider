    Washington, DC — Tulsi Gabbard, 2020 Presidential candidate and Congresswoman, today, released an op-ed entitled Religious Bigotry is Un-American, published by Religion News Service.
Gabbard writes: "Our country was established on the basis of freedom of religion, and the Constitution states there would never be any religious test for any public office. It is a freedom enshrined in our Constitution, and that every member of Congress takes an oath to protect — a freedom that many heroes have given their lives to defend. Nothing is more important to our democracy than this freedom.
"Those who are trying to foment anti-Hindu sentiment expose the dark underbelly of religious bigotry in politics, and must be called out. To advocate voting for or against someone based on their religion, race, or gender is simply un-American." Read full op-ed here.
