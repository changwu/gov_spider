 In-Town Pool Report #1: WH Departure 
?The motorcade left the White House at 10:08, and we are now rolling, presumably, to Trump National for a few rounds of golf.
The president has one event on his schedule, a Thanksgiving teleconference with members of the military. It is scheduled for 3:00 pm and listed as closed press.
Earlier this morning, the pool received COVID tests and received no news which is good news. Otherwise, nothing to report.
Happy Thanksgiving.

 In-Town Pool Report #2: Arrival at Trump National 
?The motorcade arrived at Trump National at 10:46. Shortly after, the president tweeted "Happy Thanksgiving" in response to news that the Supreme Court had blocked New York Gov. Cuomo from enforcing attendance limits at religious services.
Pool has since split off and will be holding nearby, I'm told, at a local IHOP.

 In-Town Pool Report #6B: More Teleconference 
?The president spoke to representatives of each of the armed forces, including Space Force.
Asked about his plans for his last Thanksgiving in the White House, he said you "can't say what's first or last." He added that it might be the "first one of a second term."
"No one wants to see the kind of fraud this election has come to represent," he said.
"The Biden administration," he said "wants to get rid of America first."
"I know one thing, Joe Biden didn't get 80 million votes," he adds before saying that Biden didn't beat Obama's vote total with black voters.

Earlier he thanked each branch for their service, talked about increased funding for the military over the past four years, and seemed to be in good spirits.
When a member of the Coast Guard mentioned his golf game, Trump promised to keep driving the ball "straight and long."
"Only form of exercise," he quipped about his game.
"Don't eat too much turkey," he told the troops joking.
