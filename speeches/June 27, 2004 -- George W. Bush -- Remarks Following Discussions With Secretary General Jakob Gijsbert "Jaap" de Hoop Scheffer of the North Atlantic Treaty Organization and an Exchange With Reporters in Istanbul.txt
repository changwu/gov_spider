    President Bush. This man is doing a great job, and we're proud to call him friend. He believes in freedom and peace. And I really appreciate what you've done, sir.
Secretary General de Hoop Scheffer. Thank you. It's a challenge, but NATO is worth it.
President Bush. It is worth it.
Secretary General de Hoop Scheffer. NATO is worth it, and the transatlantic relationship is worth it, more than just in words but all in deeds.
President Bush. Right. I was hoping to change the mission of NATO so it meets the threats of the 21st century, and we're going to work together to help make sure NATO is configured militarily to meet the threats of the 21st century as well. But you're the right man for the job, and we're honored you took it. I really appreciate working with you.
Secretary General de Hoop Scheffer.
We're defending values, and values never come out. And I think they should be defended every single day and every single hour. We see examples of that everywhere around that NATO isâ€”it's about values, has always been about values, and it's still about values. But Turkey has changed. We have terrorism everywhere. There's fights everywhere, be it here in this city, be it in New York, Uzbekistan, Mombasa, Yemen, you name it. This Alliance has to participate in fighting it first and winning it.
President Bush. Thank you.
Kidnaping of Turks
Q. Does the kidnaping of the Turks cast a pall over this meeting?
[President Bush responded to the question by shaking his head to indicate no.]
