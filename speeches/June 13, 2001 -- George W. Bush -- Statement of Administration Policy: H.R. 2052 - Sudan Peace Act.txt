    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Tancredo (R) CO and 26 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2052, and strongly supports U.S. condemnation of the actions of the Government of Sudan and efforts to promote and encourage a peace process in Sudan. However, the Administration opposes Section 8 because of the potential to damage U.S. and international capital markets and to undermine the independence and prerogative of the Securities and Exchange Commission to determine the nature and definition of information that is material to the investor.
