    Less then two weeks away from the Iowa caucuses, Kasich for America announced the expansion of its Iowa state leadership team to include six former Iowa officials who are endorsing Governor John Kasich for president.
The new additions to Governor Kasich's team include the following:
Former State Senator Bob Brunkhorst: Former member of the Iowa House, Iowa Senate and former Mayor of Waverly, Iowa.
Former State Representative Doug Struyk: Represented Council Bluffs in the Iowa House serving as assistant minority leader.
Former State Representative John Clark: Represented Lee County in the Iowa House.
Former State Representative Darrell Hanson: Represented Delaware County in the Iowa House, served on the Iowa Utilities Board.
Former State Representative George Eichhorn: Representative from Hamilton County and 2008 candidate for U.S. Senate.
Joan Bolin Betts: Former Assistant State Treasurer and candidate for Iowa Treasurer.
The Leadership Team will work under the direction of State Rep. Mary Ann Hanusa, Kasich for America's Iowa State Campaign Chair, and former Speaker of the Iowa House Brent Siegrist.
"Governor Kasich stands for the the conservative, common-sense values that resonate with the people of Iowa," said Joan Bolin Betts. "He's a true budget hawk, having led the effort to balance the federal budget for the first time in a generation, and he understands that we have to shrink the size of the federal government to grow as a nation. There is no one I trust more to turn our economy around and keep our country safe, and we are working hard to spread his message to Iowans."
Said Kasich, "With the addition of these talented individuals, our team in Iowa is stronger and better-equipped to reach voters leading up to the Iowa caucuses next month. Each one of these public servants knows the people of Iowa well and will be a tremendous asset to us."
