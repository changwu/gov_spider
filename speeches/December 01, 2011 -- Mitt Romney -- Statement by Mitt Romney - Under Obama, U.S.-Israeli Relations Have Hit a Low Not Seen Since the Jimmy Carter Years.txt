    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on President Obama's comments about Israel:
"President Obama, in New York to raise campaign cash, told a group of prospective donors that 'We don't compromise when it comes to Israel's security.' That would be great news, if it were true. Unfortunately, under the Obama Administration, U.S.-Israeli relations have hit a low not seen since the Jimmy Carter years. It is not merely the way that President Obama has disparaged Israel's prime minister in public and private. U.S. policy itself is at issue. Whether the question is peace talks with the Palestinians, or defining Israel's borders, or keeping Iran from getting nuclear weapons, the administration has repeatedly scanted Israel's interests. Words uttered behind closed doors in a campaign fundraiser in New York are one thing. Actions that have repeatedly thrown Israel under the bus are another."
