Pool Report #1
Good morning! I'll be your print pooler at the White House today.
As is now the new norm, officials were set up in a white tent outside the northwest gate taking the temperatures for White House visitors, including reporters, prior to their entry.
Nothing is on POTUS' public schedule other than a Fox News tele town hall from the White House at 12:30. No briefing is scheduled. Will let you know if anything changes.

No major news, but here's some quotes:
On Phase 3 stimulus package: "I will say this: If we get this package, we'll be setting the stage for a good rebound in the second half of the year. That's our thinking. This package will undergird workers and families, Main Street, small businesses. The banks are in good shape, gratefully. So we'll see. That's why we just got to keep those payrolls up and keep the small business in place to the best of our ability. My message is please just vote on it. Get it through."
On predictions for GDP growth: "I've avoided that. I'll continue to avoid it. It's going to be rough. We know that it's a big challenge. I've been saying that for weeks and weeks. We will see. But I'm going to leave it be."
On why stimulus is necessary if plans is to reopen economy: "I want to be careful here because the president is put this out there, talked to a bunch of us. We can target zones where the virus is less prevalent. Things are safe. We're not abandoning the health professionals' advice, but there is a clamor to try to reopen the economy, and perhaps I'll call it less of a shut in. And so that's one piece that's yet to be determined, but it's one piece is being looked at. We still need the assistance because in the next week or two or three, you're still gonna have a lot of hot zones, you still got a lot of shut ins. There's no miracle here. We're not just flipping a switch. The assistance is so vital."
On whether it's worth opening up the economy at the expense of public health: "I don't see it that way. I think that public health includes economic health. That's the key point. It's not either-or. It's not either-or. And that's why we're taking a fresh look at it."

Pool Report #3 - S. Korea call
From White House Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere:
"Today, President Donald J. Trump and President Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea discussed their nations' respective efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic. President Trump reiterated his commitment to employ the full weight of the United States Government and work with global leaders to save lives and restore economic growth."

The White House called at 12:28 for restricted in-house pool to gather at the Palm Room Doors. See POTUS tweet he'll be on Fox News at 1 pm for a virtual note.
Note: Pooler doesn't intend to pool POTUS quotes from town hall because they'll be on live TV, but will send off-camera color if warranted.

Pool Report #4a
The temperature was taken once again within the Palm Room for each member of the restricted in-house pool. Everyone got the OK.
Judd Deere informed pool audio and video coverage from pool is not allowed during town hall because Fox News has the exclusive.
