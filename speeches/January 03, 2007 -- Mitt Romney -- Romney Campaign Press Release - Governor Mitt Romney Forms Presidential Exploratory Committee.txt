Washington, D.C. - Today at 4 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, National Counsel Ben Ginsberg filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) announcing the formation of Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney's presidential campaign exploratory committee.
"After talking to my family, I have decided to take this initial step of forming an exploratory committee in order to raise the resources and build the campaign organization required to pursue the highest office in our country," Governor Romney said. "I look forward to continuing to talk with the American people to determine the best way we can meet a new generation of challenges."
Immediately after the filing, the Romney for President Exploratory Committee launched its official website: www.MittRomney.com.
