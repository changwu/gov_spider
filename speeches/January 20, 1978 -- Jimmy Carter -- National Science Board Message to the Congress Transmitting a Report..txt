    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to submit to the Congress the Ninth Annual Report of the National Science Board, entitled Science Indicators-1976. This report is the third in a series of reports describing key aspects of the status of American science and technology.
The data and indicators presented herein should prove useful to anyone needing an authoritative source of information on various aspects of the scientific enterprise in this country.
Many of these indicators show that the United States continues to rank high in most areas of science. It is particularly important to maintain this strength through an adequate level of national investment in basic, long-term research because that type of research precedes and underlies advances in many areas of national interest such as health, energy, defense, agriculture, and industrial productivity.
I commend Science Indicatorsâ€”1976 to the attention of the Congress.
JIMMY CARTER
The White House,
