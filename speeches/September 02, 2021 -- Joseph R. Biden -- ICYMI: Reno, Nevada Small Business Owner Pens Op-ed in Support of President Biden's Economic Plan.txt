    Reno, NV local pizzeria owner Walter Gloshinski wrote an op-ed in the Reno Gazette Journal arguing that President Biden's economic plan will benefit small businesses across the country.
Gloshinski writes, "[President Biden's] Build Back Better agenda will help small businesses to recover from this pandemic by investing $20 billion in the Small Business Administration's loan and investment programs, as well as coordinating a national network of small business incubators."
He adds that the President's economic plan "can easily be paid for by making big corporations pay their fair share in taxes â€” just like every small business owner does."
"When you invest in small businesses," Gloshinski concludes, "you're investing in working families and local communities."
