    "Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) can say he's the only governor who actually reduced the tax burden for his constituents." — Morning Consult, July 10, 2015

It's not an accident either. The politicians in Washington say we can't actually reduce the size of government, we can only control the rate of growth. They say we can't actually cut taxes, we can only reduce how quickly they go up.
Bobby Jindal proved them wrong.
As Governor, he signed the largest single tax cut in Louisiana history — estimated to save taxpayers more than $1.1 billion over five years and lowering income tax rates. He's cut taxes dozens of times, totaling more than $2 billion in savings.
They said you couldn't do it in Louisiana. With Bobby Jindal as Governor, we did. They said you can't do it in Washington. We can, and we will.
