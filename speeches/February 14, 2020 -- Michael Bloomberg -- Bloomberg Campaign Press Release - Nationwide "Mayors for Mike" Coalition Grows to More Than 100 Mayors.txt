    Growing list of mayors from around the country show their support for Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg ahead of Super Tuesday
NEW YORK — Since launching his campaign, Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg has now been endorsed by more than 100 mayors from across the country. "Mayors for Mike" is the broadest and most diverse coalition of endorsing mayors this cycle, and represents small towns, cities, and post-industrial communities across the country with challenges that require thoughtful and steady leadership. This groundswell of support from mayors demonstrates that Mike is the only candidate who can build the coalition necessary to beat Donald Trump in November.
"Mayors from America's small towns and cities of every size are united around our vision for achieving progress on America's biggest challenges," said Mike Bloomberg. "I'm honored to have the support of so many mayors from so many different parts of the country. Their endorsements show the hunger local leaders have for real leadership in the White House — and that starts with defeating this president. As president, I will work closely with them to reunite and rebuild America, and to empower them to drive change in their local communities."
Three of the mayors who announced their support for Mike today are: Mayor Don Hardy of Kinston, North Carolina; Mayor Malinda Miles of Mount Rainier, Maryland; and former Mayor William Bell of Birmingham, Alabama.
Don Hardy, Mayor of Kinston, North Carolina: "I scanned the field and originally thought that Joe Biden was the candidate who most closely represented my beliefs. But, after hearing what Mike Bloomberg has to say — on gun safety, economic justice, equity, the environment, health care, the planet, I changed my mind. Mike is special. He's the most qualified person to run the country and he has the funding and the capacity to defeat Donald Trump. Mike was a terrific mayor for New York and he's a very successful guy. He's a team player, and if there's one thing I believe, it's that the power of "we" is more powerful than one person alone could ever be."
Malinda Miles, Mayor of Mount Rainier, Maryland: "There's no substitute for experience and Mike Bloomberg has it in spades. His successes as mayor of New York City and in business are second-to-none. Mike believes that we are stronger when we work together and he wants every American to have a shot at financial and personal success. His Greenwood Initiative is bold and could foster significant gains in intergenerational wealth for African Americans. Mike is progressive on gun violence, health care, the climate, and jobs. He won't let us down."
William Bell, Former Mayor of Birmingham, Alabama: "Mike Bloomberg succeeded in business and in politics. He's got experience in both that no other candidate can match. He knows that cities prosper when businesses thrive and he has always championed small business successes. When local businesses thrive, jobs follow. Mike supports this and he will get the job done."
