    I am deeply saddened by the loss of my friend Floyd Spence. He was a leader of great courage and determination, especially since his double-lung transplant surgery 13 years ago. As a Congressman, he will be remembered as a true friend of the men and women in our armed services and a steadfast servant of his fellow South Carolinians. Laura and I send our prayers to his wife, Debbie, and Floyd's children and grandchildren.
