    Romney for President today released a new web video titled "Arlen and Rick." In 1996 and 2004, Rick Santorum supported Arlen Specter over conservative candidates. Arlen Specter was a liberal, pro-choice Republican who became a Democrat and was the deciding vote on Obamacare. Specter and Santorum voted together in favor of Judge Sotomayor and together against right-to-work legislation.
