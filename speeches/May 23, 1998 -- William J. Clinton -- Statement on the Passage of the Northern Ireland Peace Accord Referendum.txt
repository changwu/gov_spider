    Today history truly joined with hope in Ireland as the people of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic cast their ballots decisively in favor of the April 10 peace accord and a new political arrangement for Northern Ireland. I join all Americans in congratulating the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland for seizing this unique opportunity for a lasting peace.
I pledge that my administration will work with Northern Ireland's leaders as they seek to transform the promise of the accord into a reality, with new democratic institutions and new economic opportunities for all of Northern Ireland's people. Working through the International Fund for Ireland and the private sector, we will help the people seize the opportunities that peace will bring to attract new investment to create new factories, workplaces, and jobs, and establish new centers of learning to prepare for the 21st century.
Today's vote is a beacon to peoples around the globe in places where strife prevails and peace seems remote. You have set an example for the world and established a strong foundation for a future of lasting peace.
