Pool report #4/abortion remarks underway
President Biden denounced the Dobbs ruling and sought to rebut the conservative majority's reasoning and rationales for overturning Roe v. Wade.
The Supreme Court in Dobbs made a "terrible, extreme and I think totally wrong-headed decision to overturn Rov v. Wade... This was not a decision driven by the Constitution [...or] by history."
He criticized the majority for reading the Constitution as frozen in the mindset of the 1800s, when women didn't even have the right to vote.
He predicted record turnout by women voters to reclaim rights taken from them by the Supreme Court.
The fastest way to restore reproductive rights is for Congress to codify those rights, he said.
Cites rape of a 10 year old girl who had to go to another state "already traumatized" to obtain an abortion. "Ten years old!...A 10 year old girl should be forced to give birth to a rapist's child?" What could be more extreme, he said.
He warned that extremist Republicans even want to impose a national ban on abortion. As long as he's president such a bill would be vetoed, he said.
Biden's prepared remarks still underway at 12:17p. He is now describing his executive order.
