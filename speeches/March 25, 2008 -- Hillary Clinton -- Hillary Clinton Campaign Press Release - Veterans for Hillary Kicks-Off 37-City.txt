    (PHILADELPHIA, PA) - Veterans for Hillary will kick-off a 37 city month-long tour across Pennsylvania with two stops in Philadelphia today. Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy William Cassidy will begin the tour with stops at the Penrose and Melrose Diners in Philadelphia.
During the tour Veterans for Hillary members, including retired military personnel who served at the highest levels of the military as well as veterans returning from the front lines in Iraq and Afghanistan, will visit veterans' facilities and hold public conversations about veterans' issues in communities across the state. The tour will serve both to inform Pennsylvanians about Hillary's record of support for veterans and to assess conditions at Pennsylvania's veterans' facilities.
"When it comes to serving our veterans, Hillary Clinton does not only talk about how much she appreciates their sacrifice â€“ she follows through with real support," said Deputy Assistant Secretary Cassidy. "Thanks to her efforts, the nearly 20,000 members of the Pennsylvania National Guard now have access to federal health benefits and hundreds of thousands of military personnel are now screened for traumatic brain injury. She has had a real impact on the lives of the men and women in our armed forces, and she will continue to fight for them as President."
