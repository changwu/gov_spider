    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the storms that struck the South and Midwest:
"My heart goes out to the victims of this week's tornadoes. Ann and I want the people of the South and Midwest to know that our thoughts and prayers are with them after so much destruction and loss of life. Were it not for so many brave first responders, the tragedy might have been even worse. They are what is best in our country. I am hopeful that Americans will give what they can to help the injured, to help the families of those who perished, and to help the communities that were destroyed, by contributing to the Red Cross."
