    Nashua Mayor Don Davidson today announced his support for Bob Dole's bid for the White House. A coveted endorsement by all the GOP candidates, Davidson stated his support simply: "while others talk, Bob Dole leads." Currently in his first term as Mayor, Davidson was recently elected to office in a sweeping victory in December.
"I can sum up why I'm supporting Bob Dole in one word: leadership. He is a tested and proven conservative leader with the experience necessary to lead our nation into the next century. We need someone who is willing and ready to make the tough decisions. Whether it's cutting taxes and bringing real tax relief to millions of American families or fighting for a balanced budget, I truly believe that Bob Dole is the only GOP candidate with the courage and commitment to change America," said Mayor Davidson.
"I'm pleased Mayor Davidson has joined our mission to bring Bob Dole's message of positive, conservative change to America. We need to return a Republican to the White House, but it can't be just any Republican. It must be someone who's ready for the job. Someone who will protect our freedoms and build our economic strength without liberal tax-and-spend policies that will harm hard-working Americans. There's one candidate who has the vision and confidence to lead our nation and that man is Bob Dole," said Governor Steve Merrill, General Chairman of the Dole campaign.
Dole has assembled a formidable campaign organization in the first primary state and has won the support of many of New Hampshire's prominent GOP leader and activists. Davidson joins Gov. Merrill, Sen. Judd Gregg, Congressman Bill Zeliff, Congressman Charlie Bass, Executive Counsel members Ruth Griffin and Peter Spaulding, Senate President Joe Delahunty, State Speaker Harold Burns, Manchester Mayor Ray Wiezorck and numerous state legislators.
