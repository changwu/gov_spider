    During National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, I join my fellow Americans in supporting those who battle prostate cancer and reaffirm our Nation's commitment to making this a world free from cancer.
We have good reason to be hopeful about overcoming prostate cancer. The rate of new prostate cancer cases in the United States has fallen nearly 6 percent on average each year over the past decade. During this same time, the rate of deaths due to prostate cancer has also fallen by more than 3 percent on average each year. Men diagnosed with prostate cancer are living longer lives than ever thanks to innovative research and improvements in cancer treatment. Our Nation applauds these ongoing efforts to enhance the lives of Americans and provide comfort and support in the fight against cancer.
Nonetheless, in fighting prostate cancer, we are still mindful that it remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men. My Administration remains dedicated to finding better diagnostic and treatment options through the 21st Century Cures Act, as well as research collaborations between the Department of Health and Human Services, private industry, and the academic community. In addition, the National Institutes of Health is investing in research that will improve upon current approaches to combatting prostate cancer. Through these efforts and others, American men can experience a healthier future.
This month, I encourage men to talk with their healthcare providers about their risk for prostate cancer. I also call upon all Americans to do their part in raising awareness of this disease. We pray for Americans currently fighting prostate cancer and recognize the progress yet to be made in finding its cure.
