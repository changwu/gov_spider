    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Brooks (D) Texas and Smith (R) Texas)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 5316 and will continue to support the Judicial Conference's iequest for additional judgeships.
H.R. 5316 would create 11 new judgeships for the courts of appeals and 48 for the district courts. These judgeships will fill some of the clear needs in the Judicial branch. The bill, however, does not meet the needs expressed in the Judicial Conference recommendations of June 22, 1990, for 96 additional judgeships â€” 20 for the courts of appeals and 76 for the district courts.
The Administration supports the Judicial Conference recommendations and believes that these additional resources are needed to meet current caseload requirements. Furthermore, the Administration supports additional judgeships to hear the many new drug trafficking and money laundering cases, and savings-and' loan and other financial institution cases (criminal and civil fraud, tax, and bankruptcy), that it is pursuing.
