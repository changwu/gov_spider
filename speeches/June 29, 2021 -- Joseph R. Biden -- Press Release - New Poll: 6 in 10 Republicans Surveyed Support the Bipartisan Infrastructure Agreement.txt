    After President Biden and bipartisan leaders at all levels of government announced their support of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Agreement, we now have a poll that shows the American people – of both parties – support the agreement as well.
According to a new Yahoo/YouGov poll:

60% of Republicans surveyed support the Bipartisan Infrastructure Agreement
54% of Independents surveyed support the Bipartisan Infrastructure Agreement
51% of US Adults surveyed support the Bipartisan Infrastructure Agreement

Also, of note:

Both Republicans (57%) and Democrats (74%) agree that infrastructure improvements should be subsidized by "closing loopholes that allow multinational corporations to avoid paying U.S. taxes"
President Biden's proposal to fund public-works investments by "raising taxes on corporations and Americans making more than $400,000," is favored by 59% of Americans — including 78% of Democrats and 60% of independents.

It's clear – bipartisan Members of Congress, bipartisan governors and mayors, and bipartisan American people support the bipartisan infrastructure agreement. You can read more here.
