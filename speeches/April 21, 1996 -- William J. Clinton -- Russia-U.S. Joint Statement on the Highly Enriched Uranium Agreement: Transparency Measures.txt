    The United States and Russia have agreed on transparency measures that provide assurances that the sides are fulfilling the obligations undertaken under the HEU Agreement to transform "megatons into megawatts."
The transparency measures that have been developed are the culmination of two years of negotiations between official U.S. and Russian delegations and are evidence that irreversible nuclear disarmament is achievable if we work together. By blending-down HEU derived from nuclear weapons to low-enriched uranium that can only be used as fuel in commercial nuclear power reactors, we ensure that this material can never again be used in nuclear weapons.
