Des Moines, IA -- Today, U.S. Senator Barack Obama continues his "Stand for Change" Tour throughout Iowa. Obama will ask Iowans across the state to "Stand for Change" by caucusing for him on January 3rd and taking the first step towards bringing to Washington, D.C. the kind of change we can believe in. Obama will be joined on the campaign trail by the only Iraq War veteran in Congress, Representative Patrick Murphy.
Tim Kaine was elected Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia after serving one term as Lieutenant Governor. A graduate of University of Missouri and Harvard Law School, Kaine also worked as a missionary in Honduras, taught legal ethics at the University of Richmond Law School and served as Mayor of the City of Richmond.
