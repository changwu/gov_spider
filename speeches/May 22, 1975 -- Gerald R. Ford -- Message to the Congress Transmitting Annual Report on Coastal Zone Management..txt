    To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting herewith the second annual report prepared by the Secretary of Commerce dealing with the first year of actual operation under the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972. The report covers Fiscal Year 1974 during which time the initial funding for the program became available.
With the critical need to increase our domestic supplies of energy and other resources from the areas off our coasts, a high priority is attached to the necessity of carrying out these activities in a safe and orderly manner. For many States and localities, the existence of the coastal zone management program provides a means for assessing and preparing for the effects of new or increased developmental activity in their coastal areas.
This program also seeks to establish a partnership between the States and the Federal government in managing our coastal resources in a way that balances development and environmental concerns.
