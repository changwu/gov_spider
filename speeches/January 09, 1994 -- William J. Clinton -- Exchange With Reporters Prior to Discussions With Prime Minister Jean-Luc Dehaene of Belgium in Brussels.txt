    Bosnia
Q. Mr. President, do you think that Bosnia should be at the top of the agenda for the NATO consideration?
The President. Well, we'll discuss that and a number of other things. We have a lot of issues to discuss. But the Prime Minister and I will discuss that and several other issues. As you know, he's just ended a tour of 6 months in the presidency of the EU, and in my judgment, he and Belgium did a superb job. They were very instrumental in the successes we had last summer in the G-7 meeting, which laid the foundation for the adoption of the GATT round. So we're going to talk a little about that, too.
Death of President's Mother
Q. Mr. President, are you finding it difficult to engage in diplomacy after your personal loss?
The President. No, I'm glad to be here. My family and my friends and my mother's friends, we had a wonderful day yesterday, and I'm doing what I should be doing. I'm glad to have the opportunity to be here and go back to work.
