    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Dymally (D) California and 30 others)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 348 because it is unnecessary, as existing law and regulations already provide an adequate and workable appeals mechanism for non-veteran Postal Service managerial and supervisory employees that provides protections similar to those proposed by the bill.
