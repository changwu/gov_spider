    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Convention concerning the Protection of the World Gultural and Natural Heritage, done at Paris on November 23, 1972. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report from the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
This Convention creates international machinery for the identification and protection of natural and cultural areas of outstanding universal value which constitute the common heritage of mankind. For this purpose, the Convention establishes a World Heritage Committee to develop and maintain lists of areas of outstanding importance and a World Heritage Fund to provide international assistance for the protection and conservation of these areas.
While the Convention places basic reliance on the resources and efforts of the States within whose territory these natural and cultural sites are located, it would also provide a means of assisting States which have insufficient resources or expertise in the protection of areas for the benefit of all mankind.
I therefore recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Convention submitted herewith and give its advice and consent subject to a declaration for which provision is made under Article 16(2), as explained in the report from the Department of State.
