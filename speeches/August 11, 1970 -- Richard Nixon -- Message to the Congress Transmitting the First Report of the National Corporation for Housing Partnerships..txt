    To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting the first Report of the National Corporation for Housing partnerships for the period December 16, 1968 to June 30, 1970.
The Corporation was created under Title IX of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 as a private organization to work in partnership with local sponsors and builders, helping to produce housing responsive to local needs. The past year has demonstrated the possibilities of the Corporation. We should be particularly proud of the success of the initial financing program, which raised more than $42 million in risk capital. These funds will enable the Corporation to assist in the production of more than 100,000 units of low and moderate income housing over the next few years.
It is my belief that the National Corporation for Housing Partnerships will make an important contribution to solving our Nation's housing problems. I commend this Report to your attention.
