    To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting today the third annual report on the location of new Federal offices and other facilities in rural areas of America.
The enactment of the Rural Development Act of 1972 has further strengthened the Federal Government's commitment toward raising the economic level of rural America. This Administration strongly supports this objective of making rural America a better place to work and enjoy life by providing financial and technical assistance to rural communities.
This report reflects the efforts of all executive departments and agencies in giving first priority to locating their new offices and other facilities in rural areas as required by the Agricultural Act of 1970.
Our efforts this past fiscal year have resulted in the placing of 51.8 percent of the newly located offices and other facilities in rural areas. This accomplishment substantiates the support of this Administration in attaining this Nation's objective of balanced and beneficial growth.
