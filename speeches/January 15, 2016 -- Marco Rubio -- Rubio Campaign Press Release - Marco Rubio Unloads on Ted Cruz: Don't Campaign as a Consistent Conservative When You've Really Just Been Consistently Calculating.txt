Here's Marco's key point:
I like Ted, we're friends. But he campaigns as a consistent conservative, and basically says he's the only consistent conservative on the stage.
That is not his record.
Then, Marco went on to lay out the wrinkles in Cruz's record:
He has flipped his position on birthright citizenship, on legalization of illegal immigrants. He wanted a 500% increase in guest workers. He wanted a doubling of the number of green cards. He did change his position on [Trade Promotion Authority] — he wrote an article with Paul Ryan, before Paul Ryan was speaker, praising TPA.
He used to lobby members to support TPA, and then four months later all of a sudden he flips on it. And we saw him flip his vote on crop insurance on the Senate floor. I mean I was standing right there. And then last week, he [flip-flopped on] ethanol again in iowa.
So my point is, the only thing consistent is the consistent political calculation that I'm going to change my position if it helps me politically in a given moment.
And so don't run as a consistent conservative if, in fact, you have consistently calculated your positions. That's what he's done. Again, it came up because he launched into an attack. and so i responded with his record — not with an oppo dump, with his record.
