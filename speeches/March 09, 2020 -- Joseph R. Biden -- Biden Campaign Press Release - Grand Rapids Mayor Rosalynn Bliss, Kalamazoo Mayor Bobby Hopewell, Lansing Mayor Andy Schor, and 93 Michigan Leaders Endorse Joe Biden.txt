    Today, Grand Rapids Mayor Rosalynn Bliss, Kalamazoo Mayor Bobby Hopewell, Lansing Mayor Andy Schor, and 93 Michigan Leaders announced their endorsements for Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"Every day in Grand Rapids and throughout our state, we're building, we're innovating and we're working hard for everyone in our communities. We've been through challenging times, but we've never given up or lost hope," said Grand Rapids Mayor Rosalynn Bliss. "Joe Biden understands us because working America isn't just where he comes from — it's who he is. That's why when President Obama tasked him with handling the auto bailout, he never gave up on us and together, we got back on our feet. It's time for us to fight for Joe Biden like he fought for us, and just like he will when he's our next President of the United States."
"We need a president who doesn't just promise a brighter future, but knows what it means to deliver, just like we do in Kalamazoo every day," said Kalamazoo Mayor Bobby Hopewell. "Our communities deserve leadership that understands that the foundation of stronger generations is built on prosperity. That makes sure every child has the opportunity to access quality health care and education — no matter where they come from — is critical. We deserve a president who's not only dedicated himself to results, but who served our first African American president, supporting and encouraging policies to bring our kids and our nation forward. That's Joe Biden — and I'm proud to support him as our next president of the United States."
"Lansing isn't just the seat of our democracy in Michigan — it's a place where manufacturers to health care providers to those who manufacture life-saving vaccines work hard every day, helping our families thrive and our communities prosper. Joe Biden understands the challenges working people in Lansing face, and what they need to continue propelling our country forward," said Lansing Mayor Andy Schor. "I believe in Joe Biden because he's never turned his focus from the people of Lansing and he'll never stop fighting for the opportunities and future we deserve."
