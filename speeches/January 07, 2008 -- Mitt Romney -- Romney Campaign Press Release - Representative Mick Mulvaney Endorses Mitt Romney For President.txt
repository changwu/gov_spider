Columbia, SC â€“ Today, State Representative Mick Mulvaney officially endorsed Mitt Romney for President. Representative Mulvaney was first elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 2006. Shocking political pundits at the time, Mulvaney became the first Republican ever to win his House seat (District 45). He now represents two of the fastest growing and economically vibrant areas of the Palmetto State: Lancaster and York counties.
Representative Mulvaney is a successful real estate developer who knows firsthand the importance of economic development. He said, "Mitt Romney is a businessman. He understands how hard it can be sometimes to meet a payroll and what it really takes to create and keep new jobs. Governor Romney appreciates the importance of a strong economy and he knows how to get things done and when you have to turn things around. I am really excited about being a small part of the building grassroots momentum for Governor Romney's South Carolina campaign."
Announcing the support of Representative Mulvaney, Governor Romney said, "Mick is a great state representative. He understands the impact government can have on the economy. Representative Mulvaney is a man of character and I really appreciate his support. He is another great addition to my South Carolina team."
Representative Mulvaney joins an already strong Romney for President South Carolina team that includes United States Senator Jim DeMint and numerous other leaders across the state.
