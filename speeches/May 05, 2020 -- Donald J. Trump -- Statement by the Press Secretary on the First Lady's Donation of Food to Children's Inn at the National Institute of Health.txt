    Today, First Lady Melania Trump donated 150 boxed lunches to the patients and staff of Children's Inn at the National Institute of Health. Supporting those impacted by the effects of COVID-19 is something the First Lady cares deeply about, and as we navigate these unique times she will continue to reach out to people in a variety of ways. In accordance with social distancing guidelines, and in order to protect everyone's safety at the medical facility, the food was sent securely with a contact-free delivery.
