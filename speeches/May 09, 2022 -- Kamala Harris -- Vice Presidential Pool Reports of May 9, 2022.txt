VP pool report #1 — gathering for swearing in ceremony
Good afternoon on a truly fantastic Monday at the White House.
Pool is gathering for the swearing in ceremony for Ambassador to Jamaica, Nick Perry. The event is taking place in Vice President Kamala Harris' office, and pool will send relevant details as they arise. Feel free to ping me with any questions.

VP pool report #2 — slight delay
Pool preset in Harris’ ceremonial office at 3:20pm. VP and Perry will be standing on the North side of the room facing the conference table… will send a photo of the scene in a future report
The event was originally scheduled to start at 3:20, but we’re in a holding pattern until VP returns from POTUS’ bill signing ceremony
