    Nancy and I were saddened to learn of the passing of Congressman Stewart McKinney. For the past 16 years he has served the people of Connecticut's 4th District with effectiveness and dedication. He was a forceful advocate for the causes in which he believed, and he will be sorely missed by all who knew him. We send our deepest sympathy to his wife, Lucie, and to their children and grandchildren.
