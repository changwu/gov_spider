    "Today's agreement in Bali is an important step in a world effort to solve the growing crisis of global warming. The Bush Administration again sought to block progress, but ultimately could not resist the weight of the scientific and political consensus for action on climate change. It's a step forward, but the United States needs to lead again if we are going to reach a new deal, and that's what I am ready to do as President. In January of 2009, I will immediately lead the process to develop a new treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol. My administration will engage in high level meetings with leaders around the world every three months, if that's what it takes, to hammer out a new agreement."
