    "President Obama had a clear message today for the 23 million Americans who are struggling for work: you're 'absolutely better off' in the Obama economy. But the President's out-of-touch comments won't change reality for Americans facing declining incomes, chronic unemployment, skyrocketing prices, and poverty on track to hit fifty-year highs. Mitt Romney's policies will finally deliver relief for the middle class by creating new jobs and higher take-home pay for American workers." – Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
Today, President Obama Claimed Americans Are "Absolutely Better Off" Than They Were When He Was Sworn Into Office:
President Obama, Today: "We Are Absolutely Better Off Than We Were When I Was Sworn In..." "'Are we better off than we were four years ago?' I asked. The president responded quickly. 'We are absolutely better off than we were when I was sworn in and we were losing 800 thousand jobs in a month,' he said."
