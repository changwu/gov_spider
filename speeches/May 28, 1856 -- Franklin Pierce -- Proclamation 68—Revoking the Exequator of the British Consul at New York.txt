    
  Franklin Pierce, President of the United States of America

To all whom it may concern:
Whereas by letters patent under the seal of the United States bearing date the 2d day of March, A. D. 1843, the President recognized Anthony Barclay as consul of Her Britannic Majesty at New York and declared him free to exercise and enjoy such functions, powers, and privileges as are allowed to the consuls of the most favored nations, but, for good and sufficient reasons, it is deemed proper that he should no longer exercise the said functions within the United States:
Now, therefore, be it known that I, Franklin Pierce, President of the United States of America, do hereby declare that the powers and privileges conferred as aforesaid on the said Anthony Barclay are revoked and annulled.
In testimony whereof I have caused these letters to be made patent and the seal of the United States to be hereunto affixed.
Given under my hand, at the city of Washington, the 28th day of May, A. D. 1856, and of the Independence of the United States of America the eightieth.
FRANKLIN PIERCE.
By the President:
W. L. MARCY,
Secretary of State.
