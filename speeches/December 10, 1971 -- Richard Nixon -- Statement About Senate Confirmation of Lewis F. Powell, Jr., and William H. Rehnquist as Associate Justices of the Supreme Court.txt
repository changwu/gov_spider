    I AM extremely gratified that the Senate has now confirmed both Lewis Powell and William Rehnquist as Associate Justices of the Supreme Court.
These two men have undergone intensive scrutiny by the legislative and executive branches of the Federal Government and, as reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee, have been found "thoroughly qualified." Indeed, I believe that they bring to the bench such an exceptional degree of integrity and intellect and so keen an understanding of the judicial process that the quality of the Court decisions should be enhanced for years to Come.
They take the place of two men-Justice Harlan and the late Justice Black--who were among the giants of modern Court history.
I am confident that they will fill those vacancies with a distinction worthy of the Court, and worthy of the men whose seats they fill.
