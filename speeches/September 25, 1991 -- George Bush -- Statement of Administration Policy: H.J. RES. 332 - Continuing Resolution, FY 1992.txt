    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate Floor)(Sponsor: Byrd (D), West Virginia)
The Administration believes that providing for the operation of the government through Continuing Resolutions is an undesirable practice. If a Continuing Resolution is unavoidable, however, the Administration believes that it should contain only a simple, temporary extension of normal government operations. The House-passed Continuing Resolution meets this test. The Administration has no objection to H.J. Res. 332, as passed by the House.
It is our understanding that an amendment may be offered to extend the Continuing Resolution through October 29, 1991. The Administration has no objection to this date change. If Congress approves a continuing resolution that provides funds through October 29, 1991, the Administration believes that it is reasonable to expect that the ordinary appropriations process should have been completed by that date.
The Administration would oppose changes to the Continuing Resolution that are inconsistent with providing for a simple, temporary extension of funding and urges the Senate to oppose any extraneous amendments.
