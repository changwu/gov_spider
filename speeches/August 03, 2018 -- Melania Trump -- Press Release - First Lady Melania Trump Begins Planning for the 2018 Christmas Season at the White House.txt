    The initial planning for the 2018 Christmas season is underway at the White House. First Lady Melania Trump and President Donald J. Trump are opening the people's house up to the public for the traditional Christmas decorating of the White House.
This year, the White House invites local musicians including high school bands, choirs, and Christmas-themed entertainers to apply for the opportunity to perform during the Holiday Open Houses throughout the month of December. Anyone interested in volunteering to decorate or perform can find additional details below. Confirmed volunteers and entertainers will receive notification later this fall.
