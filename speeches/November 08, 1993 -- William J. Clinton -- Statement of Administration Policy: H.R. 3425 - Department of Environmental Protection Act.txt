    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Conyers (D) Michigan and 41 others)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 3425. Elevation of the Environmental Protection Agency to Cabinet status will ensure that environmental issues are an integral part of the domestic policy process. The consideration of environmental concerns is imperative for the sustained success of our Nation's economic, social, and trade policy.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 3425 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. This Office estimates the pay-as-you-go effect is zero.
