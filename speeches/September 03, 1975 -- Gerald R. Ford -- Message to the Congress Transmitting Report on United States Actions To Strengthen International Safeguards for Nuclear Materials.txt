    To the Congress of the United States:
As required by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1974, I am submitting the following report concerning actions to be taken by the United States to strengthen international procedures of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to prevent the unauthorized dissemination or use of nuclear materials.
The Act requires that a reasonable amount of the funds authorized for the IAEA as technical assistance should be used to improve such safeguards. The $200,000 program outlined in this report in conjunction with other U.S. programs, will support the task of assessing, influencing and strengthening these preventive procedures.
