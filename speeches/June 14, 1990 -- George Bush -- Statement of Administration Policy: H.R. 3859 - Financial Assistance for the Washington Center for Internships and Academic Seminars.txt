    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Ford (D) MI and 10 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 3859. If H.R. 3859 were presented to the President, the Secretary of Education would recommend that it be vetoed.
H.R. 3859 would authorize the Secretary of Education to grant up to $12 million to the Washington Center for Internships and Academic Seminars. The funds would be for construction and related costs of a student residence and classroom building in Washington, D.C. Financing for construction of these private facilities is not an appropriate role for the Federal Government. Furthermore, it is inequitable to earmark funds for the Washington Center on a non-competitive basis.

(Not to be Distributed Outside Executive Office of the President)
This draft of a position was developed by LRD (Jeffrey Weinberg/Suzanne Duval) in consultation with LVE (Bernie Martin, Barry White, and Lisa Fairhall). The Department of Education (per Jack Kristy, Office of the General Counsel) concurs.
We have not seen the Committee report on H.R. 3859. Department of Education staff advise that the bill was reported as introduced.
Administration Position to Date
The draft position is the same as the one taken in a letter of March 8, 1990, from Secretary Cavazos to Chairman Hawkins of the House Education and Labor Committee.
Description of H.R. 3859
H.R. 3859 would authorize appropriations for FYs 1991 through 1993 totaling $12 million for construction of facilities for the Washington Center. During each of those years a grant could be made by the Secretary of Education to match the amount of private contributions for the project received in cash or in kind.
