    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the Obama Administration's action to fundamentally undermine the bipartisan 1996 welfare reforms:
"President Obama now wants to strip the established work requirements from welfare. The success of bipartisan welfare reform, passed under President Clinton, has rested on the obligation of work. The President's action is completely misdirected. Work is a dignified endeavor, and the linkage of work and welfare is essential to prevent welfare from becoming a way of life."
