    THE death of Charles Teague represents a significant loss to the United States Congress, to his home State of California, and to the Nation he served so long and so well. He will be remembered most especially for his interest in American agriculture and for his many years of devoted service on the House Agriculture Committee. Mrs. Nixon and I were deeply saddened to hear of his passing, and we extend our sincere sympathy to his family.
