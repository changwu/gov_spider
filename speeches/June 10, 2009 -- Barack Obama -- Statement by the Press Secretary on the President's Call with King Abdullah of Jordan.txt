    The President called King Abdullah of Jordan today to discuss his recent visits to Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The President reiterated his commitment to work hard to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through a two-state solution, as he underscored in his speech in Cairo. They discussed ways of ensuring that all parties fulfill their obligations and responsibilities to ensure that negotiations toward a two-state solution have the best chance to succeed, and promised to continue close coordination in this regard, as demonstrated by the upcoming meeting on June 11 between King Abdullah and the Presidentâ€™s Special Envoy for Middle East Peace, George Mitchell, in Amman.
