    SANTA FE -- Governor Bill Richardson was today awarded a Grade "A" by Conservation Voters New Mexico (CVNM). CVNM today published their 2007 Legislative Scorecard, which gives Governor Richardson "a solid "A" for his commitment to protecting the environment.
"In addition to increasing the renewable energy standard, an impressive package of clean energy policies was enacted (this session) -- a result of the importance that Governor Richardson places on making New Mexico the "Clean Energy State," said Sandy Buffett, Executive Director of Conservation Voters New Mexico. "We would like to especially commend Governor Richardson for his courage and principle when exercising his veto on behalf of the environment-- his vetoes protected New Mexico's last free-flowing river, blocked a $6.9 million de facto subsidy to the coal industry and upheld strong campaign finance reporting rules."
"We have worked closely with all those who seek to conserve our water, air and public lands and establish New Mexico as the clean energy state -- and this grade shows we've worked well together," Governor Richardson said. "Having enacted 23 pro-conservation bills this year, this legislative session was an unprecedented success with significant increases to our renewable energy portfolio standard, passage of the surface owner's protection act and the Renewable Energy Transmission Authority. Our budget included monies for land and wildlife conservation and clean energy projects, but I remain committed to finding a dedicated source of revenue for conservation projects around the state."
CVNM is a nonpartisan, non-profit environmental group that works to make sensible conservation policies a top-priority for elected officials, political candidates and voters across the state. For more information, please visit www.CVNM.org.
