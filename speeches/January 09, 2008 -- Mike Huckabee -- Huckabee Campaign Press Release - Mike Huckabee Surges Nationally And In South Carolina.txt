"We're in a great position entering the final stretch to Primary Day," said Huckabee. "I'm pleased that my optimistic message and vision for America's future is resonating throughout the Palmetto State."
Huckabee South Carolina Chairman Mike Campbell agreed: "South Carolinians, like all Americans, are looking for a President who will do the right thing regardless or political pressure, consequences, or calculations. Mike Huckabee will be that President."
