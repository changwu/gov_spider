VP travel pool report #4/remarks
Quotes from VP's discussion on abortion rights in Des Moines with Jennifer Palmieri:

"This is an agenda that has been a long time in the making. â€¦ I do believe that we are witnessing a national agenda that is about a full on attack on hard won freedoms and hard won rights."
"How dare these supposed leaders decide they're in a better position to tell (a woman) what's in her best interest than she is to know."
"One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree that the government should not be telling women what they can do." VP received standing ovation for this line.
Urging states to extend Medicaid coverage for months post-pregnancy: "Expand medicaid coverage for postpartum care. Put your money where your mouth is."
