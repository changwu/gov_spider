    Jill and I are looking forward to the White House's commemoration of Eid this Sunday. We were heartened to see Eid celebrations around the world, but we know that this year, the situation in the Holy Land is weighing heavily on Muslims everywhere, including our Muslim communities here in the United States.
Palestinians—including in Gaza—and Israelis equally deserve to live in dignity, safety and security. No family should have to fear for their safety within their own home or place of worship. We think most about the children in these societies who face trauma from a conflict far beyond their control.
My administration will continue to engage Palestinians, Israelis, and other regional partners to work towards a sustainable calm.
