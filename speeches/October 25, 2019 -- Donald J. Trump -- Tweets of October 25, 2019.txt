Where is the Whistleblower and why did he or she write such a fictitious and incorrect account of my phone call with the Ukrainian President? Why did the IG allow this to happen? Who is the so-called Informant (Schiff?) who was so inaccurate? A giant Scam!Retweets: 32627Favorites: 134301

Another big dropout of the Presidential race was along with 0% Tim Ryan 0% @RepSwalwell. Such talk and bravado from both and nothing to show. They stood for nothing and the voters couldn't stand by them. Obnoxious and greedy politicians never make it in the end!Retweets: 16047Favorites: 70126

So Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio has finally dropped out of the race for President registering ZERO in the polls & unable to even qualify for the debate stage. See Tim it's not so easy out there if you don't know what you're doing. He wasn't effective for USA workers just talk!Retweets: 12965Favorites: 60462
