Team Marco just announced a coalition of South Carolina veterans supporting his campaign.
Marco has shown the knowledge, experience, and vision to strengthen America's military, give veterans the care they deserve, and keep our country safe. Veterans know Marco is the right person to be the next commander-in-chief.
The South Carolina Veterans for Marco Chairman and both Co-Chairs released a joint statement:
Marco Rubio's superior judgment on national security matters makes him the right choice for commander-in-chief. As a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence, Marco has a deep understanding of the threats we face. He knows the world is a safer place when America has the strongest military and the knowledge of how and when to best use it. After 7 years of Barack Obama weakening our national security, we do not need a Republican president who brags about voting to cut defense spending. We need Marco Rubio in the Oval Office to rebuild our armed forces and restore America's leadership in an increasingly troubled world.
Here's the full list of South Carolina veterans in the coalition.
