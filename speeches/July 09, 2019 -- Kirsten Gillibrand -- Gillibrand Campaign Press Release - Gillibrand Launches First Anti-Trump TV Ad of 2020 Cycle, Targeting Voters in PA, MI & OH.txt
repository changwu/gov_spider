    Gillibrand Ad - "I Promise" - Highlights Trump's Broken Promises on Jobs, Rx Drug Costs & Infrastructure
TV & Digital Ads Will Target Obama-Trump Voters Along Bus Route from Pittsburgh to Lansing
Today, the Gillibrand campaign announced the first anti-Trump television attack ad of the 2020 presidential cycle, called "I Promise". The ad will target Obama-Trump voters along her two-day "Trump Broken Promises Tour" through Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan this week.
The ads will run on cable and digital platforms in Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Youngstown, Detroit, Lansing and Flint media markets, which mirrors Gillibrand's route through these states that President Trump won in 2016. The ad highlights Donald Trump's broken promises related to manufacturing jobs, prescription drug prices and infrastructure, which Gillibrand will highlight on her tour.
"Democrats are assessing this primary based on who is tough and smart enough to beat Donald Trump - and the only way to do that is by both exciting the base with a bold vision for the country and earning back the trust of voters who still feel left behind in places like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan," said Meredith Kelly, Gillibrand 2020 Communications Director. "Senator Gillibrand can do both, by going to Trump's backyard and calling out his lies and his failures on key kitchen table issues, while also highlighting her plans to take on the big fights facing families, and actually get results."
The senator, staff and media will tour on a distinctly-branded bus that will travel to Pittsburgh, PA, Mahoning Valley and Cleveland, OH (July 11th) and Oakland County, Flint and Lansing, MI (July 12th)
