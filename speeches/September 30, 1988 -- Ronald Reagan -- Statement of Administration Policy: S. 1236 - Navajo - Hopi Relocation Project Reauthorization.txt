    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Inouye (D) Hawaii)
Although the Administration supports efforts to expedite the Navajo-Hopi relocation, it opposes enactment of S. 1236 in its current form. The Administration urges that S. 1236 not be considered under suspension of the rules, and that it be amended to delete provisions which would:

—    replace the three member Navajo-Hopi Relocation Commission with a new single Commissioner. Such a major personnel change is likely to slow down the relocation process rather than expedite it;
—    allow the new Commissioner to appoint personnel and fix their salary without regard to the Federal personnel regulations;
—    require a Federal contribution (in effect an "interest-free loan") of up to $10,000,000 for each of FYs 1990-1995 to a Navajo Rehabilitation Trust Fund;
—    authorize $250,000 to pay legal costs of the San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe, a tribe not yet recognized by the Federal Government. This provision is unjustified and could result in an undesirable precedent requiring the Federal taxpayer to pay legal costs for other such groups;
—    prohibit Commission contractors from lobbying to influence Federal legislation on any issue relating to relocation, thus violating their First Amendment rights; and
—    require the Commissioner to report to Congress on agencies that have failed to provide reasonable assistance, which would interfere with the President's power to supervise the Executive branch. 
The Administration also urges that S. 1236 be amended to limit Navajo and Hopi attorneys' fees, which are ultimately paid by the Federal Government, thus saving the U.S. taxpayer millions of dollars a year.
