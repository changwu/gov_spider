    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 10/25/91)(House)(Gephardt (D) Missouri and Michel (R) Illinois)
The Administration supports enactment of H.J. Res. 281.
SCORING FOR THE PURPOSE OF PAYGO AND DISCRETIONARY CAPS
H.J. Res. 281 is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's current estimate, after review of trade and tariff data, is that enactment of this resolution would be revenue neutral. Final scoring of this proposal may deviate from this estimate. If H.J. Res. 281 is enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within five days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all legislation on direct spending and revenue will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to Congress.
