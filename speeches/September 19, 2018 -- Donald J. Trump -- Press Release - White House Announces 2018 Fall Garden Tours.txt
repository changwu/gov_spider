    This fall, the White House will open its gardens and grounds to visitors. The grounds will be open on Saturday, October 20, from 10:00 AM to 4:30 PM, and Sunday, October 21, from 10:00 AM to 2:30 PM. On these days, visitors can discover the beauty of the South Lawn of the White House. The Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, Rose Garden, and the White House Kitchen Garden will also be accessible to guests.
