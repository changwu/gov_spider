    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Mrazek (D) New York and 154 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 987. The bill's requirement for unilateral modifications to the two existing long-term timber sale contracts would pose a substantial risk of financial exposure to the United States to compensate the contract holders. Moreover, the Department of Agriculture has already renegotiated one of the contracts, and is currently negotiating to revise the other.
The Administration strongly opposes title IV of H.R. 987 as currently drafted. Title IV would amend current land exchange authority to allow the Haida Native Corporation to obtain Federal land worth far more that the land the Corporation would convey to the United States. The Administration would not object to title IV if it were amended to ensure that the exchange will be implemented on an equal value basis. The Corporation has already received virtually its full entitlement under the Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act. Moreover, the Corporation was the recipient of special relief legislation in 1986 when it was experiencing financial difficulties. That relief was provided on the condition that it would be the last such relief for the Corporation.
