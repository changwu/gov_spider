    Officials with over 330 years of combined public service to the state of South Dakota endorse Hillary
The Clinton campaign today announced the endorsement of 41 former South Dakota state legislators and constitutional officers. These officials, with over 330 years of combined experience in public service to the state of South Dakota, endorsed Hillary because of her readiness to serve on day one and her plans to jumpstart the economy and help consumers struggling with rising gas prices.
"After seven years of an Administration that favored the special interests at every turn, South Dakotans need a President who will stand with them," said former State Representative Al Waltman. "Hillary Clinton has real solutions to our economic problems, to skyrocketing energy prices and to ending the war in Iraq, and she has the experience and resolve to make those plans a reality. Hillary is the candidate who can beat John McCain in the fall and start turning this country around on day one in the White House."
The announcement came on the heels of visits to South Dakota from both Hillary and Former President Clinton over the past several days.
"Hillary Clinton has done more than give speeches - she has been achieving real results for working families for the past 35 years," said former State Senator Judy Olson Duhamel. "Given the challenges we face, we need a President who is ready to hit the ground running and begin to turn our economy around and restore our standing in the world, and Hillary Clinton has the experience to do just that."
"I am honored to receive the support of such a talented group of people who have dedicated their lives to public service," Senator Clinton said. "These South Dakotans know what it takes to stand up for working families and I am proud they think I am best qualified for the job."
