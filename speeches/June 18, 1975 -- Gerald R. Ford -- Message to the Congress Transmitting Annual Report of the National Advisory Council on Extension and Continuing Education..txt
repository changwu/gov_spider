    To the Congress of the United States:
I herewith transmit the Ninth Annual Report of the National Advisory Council on Extension and Continuing Education. The Council is authorized by P.L. 89-329.
The Council this year recommends a number of legislative changes in Title I and Title IV of the Higher Education Act. I know that the Congress will want to discuss these recommendations further with the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and the Commissioner of Education who would have responsibility for implementing any changes in the statute.
This report provides a perspective and recommendations which are, of course, limited to the particular field of Title I of the Higher Education Act and the subject of continuing education. They do not reflect the Administration's policies which must be formed in the context of a comprehensive review of the total Federal role in education and other competing fields.
I appreciate the Council's concern with its special responsibility in helping to relate better the world of education to the world of work. I shall await with interest the Council's further thoughts in that regard.
