    President Bush today completed a routine physical examination at Bethesda Naval Hospital and is in excellent health. The President's examination lasted approximately 4 hours. The physical was conducted under the direction of Dr. Burton Lee, the President's personal physician.
"President Bush is in truly excellent health," Dr. Lee said. "He continues to keep extremely fit through vigorous physical activities."
An early glaucoma of his left eye was detected. Extensive visual testing revealed no loss of any aspect of his visual acuity. He will receive betagan eye drops, 1 drop every 12 hours, and will continue this medication permanently. He has had a stye in his right eye for the past week, which is almost resolved as the result of treatments with soaks and antibiotics.
Among his test results are: chest x-ray, normal; x-rays of hips and neck, mild degenerative osteoarthritis; electrocardiogram (EKG) and stress tests, normal; urinalysis, no abnormalities; blood tests, completely normal, including cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoprotein levels; dermatology, no significant problem or change; and his allergy problems remain minimal and unchanged.
Assisting Dr. Lee from the physician staff at Bethesda Naval Hospital were Comdr. Steven Fagan, radiologist; Comdr. Boyd Robinson, dentist; Capt. Bruce Lloyd, cardiologist; Capt. Kevin O'Connell, urologist; Capt. Ralph Sawyer, ophthalmologist; Capt. Ted Parlette, dermatologist; Comdr. Tom Jamison, rheumatologist; and Capt. William Ebbeling, allergist.
