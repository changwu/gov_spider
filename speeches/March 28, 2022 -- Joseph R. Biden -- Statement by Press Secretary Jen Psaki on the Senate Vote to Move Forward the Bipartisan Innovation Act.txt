    The Senate took another step forward today in delivering on the President's vision to strengthen our supply chains, make more in America, and outcompete China and the rest of the world for decades to come. We look forward to the House of Representatives moving quickly to start the formal conference process as well.
Today's vote demonstrates there is clear bipartisan support for the sorts of investments the President has long championed â€” like boosting domestic manufacturing, supporting our innovators and helping them take their ideas from the lab to the factory floor, as well as addressing supply chain bottlenecks like semiconductors that are raising prices on the middle class. The events of the last two years, including the pandemic and Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, have underscored just how important it is to our economic and national security to make more of these critical components here in America.
We've made remarkable progress over the last year in rebuilding our industrial base, including by creating more manufacturing jobs last year than in any year in almost three decades, and by making a historic and long-overdue investment in our nation's infrastructure. Competitiveness legislation like the Bipartisan Innovation Act is our chance to build on that success and create good-paying jobs, make more in America, and lower prices for working families.
