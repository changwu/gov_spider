    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Walden (R) OR and 147 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 4200, the Forest Emergency Recovery and Research Act, which would expedite the response of Federal land management agencies to catastrophic events on national forests and other public lands.
Natural catastrophes such as tornadoes, wind storms, severe wildfires, and insect epidemics impact our forests and rangelands. While restoration of forests and rangelands can take many years, rapid assessment of damage and quick action are vital to restore landscapes following catastrophic events. This bill expedites prudent and proven forest restoration projects after catastrophic events. The bill replicates the model of the President's Healthy Forests Initiative and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act, which gave land managers the tools to expedite hazardous fuels reduction projects, preventing catastrophic wildfires, protecting communities, and restoring forest health.
The Administration urges the Senate to begin work on a bill that provides the Administration the needed flexibility to restore our national forests and other public lands in a timely manner following catastrophic events.
