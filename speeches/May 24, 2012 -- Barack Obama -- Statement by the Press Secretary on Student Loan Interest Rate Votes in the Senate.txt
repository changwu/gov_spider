    With only 37 days left to stop student loan interest rates from doubling on July 1, Senate Republicans still have not proven that they're serious about resolving this problem. For the second time this month, they voted to ask millions of students to pay an average of $1,000 each rather than close a loophole that allows the very wealthy to avoid paying their fair share. Now is not the time to refight old political battles, and certainly not the time to cut preventive health care measures. With only a few days left until student loan interest rates double, it's time to get this done so hard working students get a fair shot at an affordable education.
