    Cyber threats are a concern for every American, every business regardless of size, and every community. Since the earliest days of my administration, cybersecurity has been a core priority as we have marshaled a comprehensive national effort, as well as broad international coordination, to protect our people and critical infrastructure, our allies, and our interests. I commend the Department of Justice, and the FBI, the Department of State, and Department of the Treasury for their efforts to counter cyber threats.
When I met with President Putin in June, I made clear that the United States would take action to hold cyber criminals accountable. That's what we have done today. We are bringing the full strength of the Federal Government to disrupt malicious cyber activity and actors, bolster resilience at home, address the abuse of virtual currency to launder ransom payments, and leverage international cooperation to disrupt the ransomware ecosystem and address safe harbors for ransomware criminals. While much work remains to be done, we have taken important steps to harden our critical infrastructure against cyber attacks, hold accountable those that threaten our security, and work together with our allies and partners around the world to disrupt ransomware networks, and my administration will continue to use every tool available to us to protect the American people and American interests against cyber threats.
