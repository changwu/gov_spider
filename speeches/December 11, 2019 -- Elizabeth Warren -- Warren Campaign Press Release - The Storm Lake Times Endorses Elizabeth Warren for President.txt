    West Des Moines, IAâ€”The Storm Lake Times, the Pulitzer Prize-winning northwest Iowa newspaper, has endorsed Elizabeth Warren for president.
"Warren shows a real feeling for places left behind because she comes from there," the newspaper wrote in an editorial today. "Elizabeth Warren is fighting on principle like nobody else to give us a chance."
The Times called Warren's plans to invest in rural America and to create a new farm economy "the most extensive agenda for rural America built around regenerative agriculture, open and transparent markets, restoring labor rights and reversing the hegemony on the working class in place for the last 50 years."
Art Cullen, the editor of the Storm Lake Times, is known as "the voice of rural Iowa" for his outspoken coverage of issues facing rural communities. He won a Pulitzer Prize in 2017 for his powerful editorials challenging corporate agricultural interests in Iowa. Cullen is a contributor to the Washington Post and The Guardian and regularly appears on national news programs to discuss rural issues.
"We need bold, structural change. Going back to the good old days is impossible, and it's not good enough," the Times wrote. "Warren knows this is a fight that's been waged since the Gilded Age that now replays itself with no regard for Council Bluffs, Sioux City or Storm Lake. She has no illusions. She knows the stakes. And she knows what is right."
