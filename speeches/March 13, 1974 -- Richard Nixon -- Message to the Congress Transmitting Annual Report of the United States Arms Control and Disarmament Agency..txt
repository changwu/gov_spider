    To the Congress of the United States:
Technology in the Nuclear Age has become capable of virtually global devastation. We are thus called upon as never before in the history of American diplomacy-both by our traditions and by unprecedented responsibilities--to assume a role of leadership in seeking international arms restraints. This is a most important element of that structure of peace which is the broader goal of our foreign policy.
The coordinating instrument for this effort within our Government is the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, now entering its fourteenth year. It has been the policy of my Administration to strengthen this Agency and to equip it for the essential role it must play in promoting our national security.
The year 1973 was a time of sustained effort and continued progress in arms control, building upon earlier achievements and laying the ground for future agreements which will be of utmost importance for our security and well-being.
It is with deep satisfaction in our continuing progress that I transmit to the Congress this thirteenth annual report of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
