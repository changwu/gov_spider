    Hello. I want to thank you so much for coming out to see us. It's wonderful to be home. We're looking forward just to spending some personal time visiting with our friends, saying hello to people, driving around the State a little bit. And I'm even going to have a few hours tomorrow where I have nothing on the schedule, for the first time in years and years, to go off——

So what, I didn't want to give a speech anyway. Hello. [Laughter]
