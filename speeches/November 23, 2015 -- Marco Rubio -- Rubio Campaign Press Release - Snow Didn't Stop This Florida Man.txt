Marco is in the middle of a five-day Iowa campaign swing. Despite the frigid weather, he's been getting a warm reception.
On Friday night, he participated in the Family Leader Forum, where he talked about what America means to him:
Despite the snow on Saturday, Marco made it to Oskaloosa to fire up a crowd:

Cruz canceled all of his scheduled events Saturday after a night of snow; Rubio, however, stepped onto a stage inside an Oskaloosa coffee shop an hour's drive away for the first of three events Saturday, part of a tour that will keep him in front of Iowa voters through Tuesday.
"I'm more impressed than ever," said Robert Auld, after hearing Rubio in Oskaloosa. "I've been impressed with what I've seen in the media, but I'm especially impressed with what I heard today."  (Politico)
This morning in Carroll, Marco packed another town hall event:
