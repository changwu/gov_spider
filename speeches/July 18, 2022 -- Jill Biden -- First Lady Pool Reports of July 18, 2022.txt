FLOTUS pool report #1 - Equality PAC fundraiser
FLOTUS at 12:48 entered the main room of the Longview Gallery, where she was set to deliver remakes at a fundraiser for the Equality PAC.

Guess included men and women in suits, dresses and other business attire. Appetizers included mini-sandwiches and selections from a fruit tray.
"Progress isn't a line," FLOTUS said. "It sometimes feels like an ocean, pushing forward and pulling back. But with time and persistence, the shore of injustice does wear away."
FLOTUS touted POTUS, pointing out he signed an executive order against anti-LGBT discrimination, ended the transgender military ban and appointed LGBTQ federal officials.
Also ticked off by FLOTUS was an executive order POTUS signed in June, including new prohibitions on widely discredited conversion therapy.
"I was so proud he stood against the practice of dangerous and discredited conversion therapy," FLOTUS said.
FLOTUS closed the event urging action and expressing solidarity, although she monetarily tripped over the LGBTQ acronym.
"I want you to know that I will be there beside you every step of the way. It won't be easy," FLOTUS said. "For me, the LGD - the LGBTQI community is a hope that has never been crushed."
FLOTUS exited the event promptly at 12:55.
The Equality PAC is a congressional political action committee led by the openly gay and lesbian members of the U.S. House. Among the notables seen in attendance were Reps. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) and David Cicilline (D-R.I.), co-chairs of the PAC.
Cicilline introduced FLOTUS at the event, saying she brings "warmth, dignify and a sense of compassion" to the position.
Takano also spoke and said Equality PAC raised a total of $217,000 at the event and more $10.8 million this cycle.
"We need a trans member of Congress," Takano said, pointing out a first not yet achieved.
"We our going to keep our majority and I dare say we're going to expand it," Takano said.
