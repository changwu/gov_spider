    Ad argues that Paul and his 'Plan to Restore America' will remedy Washington's ills
LAKE JACKSON, Texas — The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign unveiled an updated version of its path-breaking television ad "The One," this time arguing that a Paul presidency and its fiscal plan will counteract Washington afflictions while ushering in economic prosperity.
The 60-second ad, presented in a movie trailer style, will run on broadcast and cable television in Iowa and New Hampshire beginning today. The ad points the finger of blame at Washington — "a lost city" — focusing on "failed policies, failed leadership…smooth talking politicians, insider deals, games of he said-she said, rhetoric, and division."
The ad then presents Ron Paul as the only Republican presidential candidate that stands tall against such a poisonous atmosphere, instead "voting against every tax increase, every unbalanced budget, every time." The ad touts provisions of Ron Paul's "Plan to Restore America" including cutting $1 trillion in year one of a Paul presidency, eliminating government waste, and achieving a balanced federal budget.
"With the U.S. economy in shambles, Americans are demanding leaders that are knowledgeable about how the economy works and how to ensure that Washington creates the proper climate for sustainable growth and lasting prosperity. This updated ad shows Ron Paul as the sole candidate with an economic plan to restore America, and at the same time singles him out for his unimpeachable integrity," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
