    CCEA represents 19,000 Nevada educators
LAS VEGAS, Nev. â€“ The Clark County Education Association (CCEA) announced today their endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders' candidacy for president of the United States. CCEA is the largest educator union in Nevada and the largest independent educator union in the nation, representing 19,000 teachers and other licensed professionals across the Clark County School District (CCSD). CCSD is the fifth largest school district in the nation.
"I thank the Clark County Education Association for their support and look forward to their partnership in transforming our country and defeating the most dangerous president in modern history," Sanders said. "We're proud to have teachers as our top donors by occupation because they hold the key to a more prosperous future for younger generations. Together, we will finally give teachers a much-deserved raise, reinvest in public education and create an education system that benefits students no matter their background or socioeconomic status."
"The CCEA is proud to have endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for president," said CCEA President Vikki Courtney. "Senator Sanders has a stellar record of supporting educators. His position on public education issues is second to none. He has always been a champion for educators and working class people. He has our support. He has spent time with our members and has made a firm commitment to advance public education in our country."
In May 2019, Sanders unveiled his Thurgood Marshall Plan for Public Education, which will reinvest in our nation's schools and modernize our education system.
