    Vice President Kamala Harris spoke today with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Following up on their meeting in Munich, Germany, last month, the leaders discussed coordinated U.S. and EU actions in response to Russia's unjustified, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. In particular, they discussed the severe economic consequences imposed on Russia and those complicit in the invasion and next steps to ensure Russia continues to incur high costs for its aggression. The leaders also discussed the increasing numbers of those fleeing the violence in Ukraine, and the Vice President underscored the U.S. commitment to surge humanitarian assistance to those in need, both in Ukraine and throughout the region. The leaders agreed to continue to work together to provide life-saving assistance to the vulnerable. The Vice President welcomed the generosity and kindness demonstrated by EU leaders and the European people.
