    On behalf of the American people, I send my heartfelt congratulations to His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej and the people of the Kingdom of Thailand as they celebrate the 70th anniversary of the King's accession to the throne. On this historic occasion, I want to express my admiration for His Majesty's leadership and his many contributions to deepening the enduring bonds between our peoples.
As I saw firsthand during my visit to Bangkok in 2012, His Majesty's leadership has helped our two countries promote peace and prosperity throughout the Asia-Pacific region. His Majesty has served as a source of strength and inspiration for many in our two countries over the past seven decades. As the only reigning monarch born in the United States, His Majesty shares a special connection with the American people. King Bhumibol Adulyadej Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, his birthplace, serves as a testament to the close ties between our two countries.
We look forward to continuing to strengthen the relationship between the people of the U.S. and Thailand in order to further increase mutual prosperity and address regional and global challenges together.
