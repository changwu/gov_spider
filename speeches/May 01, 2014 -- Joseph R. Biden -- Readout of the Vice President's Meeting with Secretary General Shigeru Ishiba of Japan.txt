    Today, Vice President Biden met with Liberal Democratic Party of Japan Secretary General Shigeru Ishiba at the White House. The two leaders underscored the importance of the U.S.-Japan Alliance to regional and global security. They discussed Russia's violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and steps that both countries have recently taken to impose costs on Russia. The Vice President emphasized the need to keep building strong support for the alliance, to include ensuring the successful conclusion of Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations that provide meaningful economic benefits to the people of both countries. The Vice President and Secretary General Ishiba also agreed to cooperate on the realignment of U.S. forces in Japan in order to reduce the impact of U.S. bases in Okinawa, while enhancing the deterrent value of the Alliance.
