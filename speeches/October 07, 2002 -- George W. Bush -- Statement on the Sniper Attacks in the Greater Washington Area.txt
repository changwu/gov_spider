    In recent days we have witnessed a series of cowardly and senseless acts of violence in the greater Washington area. I have committed Federal resources to support the local law enforcement agencies that are in charge of the investigation, including FBI profiling experts and ballistics analysts from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
I have also directed the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services to assist the students, teachers, and families affected by the violence by providing counseling and other community health services.
I applaud the State and local law enforcement officials who are working around the clock to help solve these heinous crimes and protect our citizens. Laura and I send our thoughts and prayers to the victims and their families.
