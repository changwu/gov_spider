    Council Bluffs, Iowa — Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann announced today that she has received the endorsement of former Iowa Family Leader Chairman Danny Carroll.
"I'm honored to have the support of Representative Carroll," Bachmann said. "He has been a strong leader on issues that we hold near to our hearts — strong families, pro-life, and fiscal responsibility."
Carroll is a former Iowa legislator from Grinnell who served in the Iowa House of Representatives from 1994-2006, including two terms as Speaker Pro Tempore. He was also the Iowa co-chair for Mike Huckabee's campaign in 2008.
"I have admired and respected Michele ever since I first met her back in the legislative session," Carroll said. "The fact that she stood strong on the debt ceiling issue was a clincher for me. She was correct in her position on the debt limit and I appreciate the leadership she has demonstrated throughout the process."
