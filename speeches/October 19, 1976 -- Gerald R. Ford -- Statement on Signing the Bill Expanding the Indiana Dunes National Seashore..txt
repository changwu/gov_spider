    SINCE ITS establishment almost a decade ago, the Indiana Dunes National Seashore has provided a wide range of recreational opportunities for people and an excellent habitat for plants and wildlife along the southeastern shore of Lake Michigan.
Yet, the Indiana Dunes has also been a point of controversy, because many people recognized that in preserving the unique qualities of the area, many lands nearby also needed protection.
I am pleased to sign into law special legislation that will expand the acreage of Indiana Dunes by over one-third. This is a welcome step in our efforts to increase the recreational opportunities and improve the quality of life for the American people.
