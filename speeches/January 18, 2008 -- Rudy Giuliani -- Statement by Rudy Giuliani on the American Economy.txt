    Mayor Rudy Giuliani released the following statement on the American economy:
"President Bush's stimulus package is a positive step toward re-energizing the American economy. In times like this it is important to ease the burden on American families by creating an environment where businesses can thrive and jobs can grow.
"It's the reason why my tax plan to strengthen the economy is the largest tax cut in American history, saving families thousands of dollars a year. I will extend the current tax rates immediately and go even further â€“ calling for lower rates, while also dramatically simplifying the tax code. It's the pro-growth plan that can get our country moving again."
