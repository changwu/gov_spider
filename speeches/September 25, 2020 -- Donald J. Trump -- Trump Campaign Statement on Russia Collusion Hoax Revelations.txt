    "These new revelations about the FBI's pervasive corruption and extreme politicization on Joe Biden's watch should send shockwaves through our country and the mainstream media. Newly revealed text messages show that FBI agents knew in 2016 what their superiors were doing to Donald Trump and his team was wrong and potentially criminal. Newly declassified information shows that FBI leadership knew in 2016 they were using a bogus dossier manufactured by a former British spy and a suspected Russian agent, but they went ahead with their politically motivated operation to frame the president for collusion anyway. Joe Biden was at the center of this plot, and it appears he directed the FBI to target decorated veteran Michael Flynn with the Logan Act. An unmasking request targeting Flynn was also made in Biden's name on January 12, 2017, the same day that information was illegally leaked to The Washington Post. Biden has never been forced to explain these facts and answer for his role in ensuring President Trump did not enjoy a peaceful transition of power in 2017. Reporters who spent years pushing Russian disinformation should do their job and make Biden answer for what his administration did, which amounts to the biggest abuse of power in American political history."
