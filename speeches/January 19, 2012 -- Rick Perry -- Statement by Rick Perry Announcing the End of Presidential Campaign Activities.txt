    Today I am suspending my campaign for President.
Anita and I have been blessed by the many supporters who have believed in our conservative vision for the country.
Although I will no longer be on the campaign trail, I will continue to champion conservative principles: a Washington that is humbler with a federal government that is smaller, real tax reform that can spur economic growth, and a renewed commitment to fiscal discipline so the future of this country is not mortgaged on a mountain of debt.
As we return to Austin and the Texas I love, I am proud to continue as governor of this great state and will work every day to make Texas a better place to do business and create jobs for all Texans.
We cannot thank you enough for your generous support which enabled our campaign to champion these conservative values.
God bless.
Rick Perry
