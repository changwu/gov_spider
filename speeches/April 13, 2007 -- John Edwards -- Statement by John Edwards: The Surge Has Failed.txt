    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement today in response to criticism from the McCain campaign about his policy on ending the war in Iraq.
"The McCain Doctrine of escalation has failed, and the bombing of the Iraqi parliament within the green zone makes that all too clear.
"John McCain is just wrong; it is time for America to start leaving Iraq.
"But he's right about one thing - Congress should use its funding authority to end this war and bring our troops home."
