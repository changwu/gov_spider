    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Minetta (D) California and 59 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4838 because it would eliminate the discretion which the Secretary of Transportation now has to consider the need for labor protective provisions in airline mergers on a case-by-case basis.
