    President Trump is keeping his promise to develop and provide a safe, effective coronavirus vaccine—and he's doing it in record time.

The Trump Administration is acting at record speed to create, manufacture, and distribute a coronavirus vaccine to the American people. As Dr. Fauci testified, "on January 10th, the sequence was known. On January the 11th, the Vaccine Research Center met to develop a plan. And on the 14th of January, we officially started the vaccine development."
Thanks to President Trump's Operation Warp Speed, the American people are first in line for a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine—at no cost—as soon as one is developed.
Last week, President Trump announced a historic deal with Pfizer to produce at least 100 million doses of a vaccine. The Trump Administration invested in a portfolio of potential vaccines, and three have already shown positive results. As the Trump campaign's latest video makes clear, working together with medical professionals, scientists, and manufacturers, the mass production of a successful vaccine is on track to arrive at record speed.
