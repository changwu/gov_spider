    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Conyers (D) MI and 32 others)
Although the Administration favors increasing the death benefit for, the Federal, State, and local public safety officer benefit (PSOB) program from $50,000 to $100,000, it opposes enactment of H.R. 4758 because this bill would also allow non-dependent parents to receive the PSOB death benefit. Dependency is a requirement for benefits to surviving parentis in all Federal beriefit programs that provide parental benefits. The exception proposed in H.R. 4758 is unjustified and could create a costly and wide-ranging precedent for other Federal programs. Therefore, the Administration urges that H.R. 4758 not be considered under suspension of the rules, and that it be amended to.delete this objectionable provision.
