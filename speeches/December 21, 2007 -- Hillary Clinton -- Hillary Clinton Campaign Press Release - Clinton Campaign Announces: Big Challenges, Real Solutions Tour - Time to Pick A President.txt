    Final Swing Through Iowa Before The Caucuses To Focus On Hillary's Ability to Deliver Meaningful Change For Americans
Hillary Clinton will return to Iowa on December 26th to launch her final campaign tour through Iowa before the caucuses. During the "Big Challenges, Real Solutions Tour - Time To Pick A President," Hillary will articulate what is at stake for caucus goers in this election. Citing her experience as an agent for positive change for 35 years, Hillary will outline the challenges that Americans face at home and around the world and how her unique background makes her the most qualified person to be the next President of the United States.
While many candidates talk about change, Hillary Clinton is the only one with the record, strength, and experience that demonstrates that she is able to deliver. From providing universal health care to strengthening the economy to ending the war in Iraq, Hillary Clinton is the only candidate who knows how to produce real results for Americans.
She will kick-off the tour in Mt. Pleasant. Hillary will be joined by President Bill Clinton, Governor Tom Vilsack, and Christie Vilsack.
"As Iowans know, picking a President is an awesome responsibility and our nation faces unprecedented challenges. We need someone with tested strength, experience and leadership to get the job done," said Governor Vilsack. "Some people say you can demand change. Others say we can hope for change. Hillary believes that you have to work for change. That's what she has been doing for 35 years and that's exactly what she'll do as our next president."
