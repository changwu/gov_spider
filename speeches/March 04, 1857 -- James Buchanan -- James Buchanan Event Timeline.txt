03/04/1857


Inaugural Address. “ it [slavery in the territories] is a judicial question, which legitimately belongs to the Supreme Court of the United States, before whom it is now pending, and will, it is understood, be speedily and finally settled. To their decision, in common with all good citizens, I shall cheerfully submit . . . “ Buchanan knew about the substance of the forthcoming Court decision and had worked to shape it, mistakenly believing it could reduce national division over the issue of slavery. Buchanan pledges that he will not become a candidate for reelection.




03/06/1857


Supreme Court decides Dred Scott v. Sanford, in which the Supreme Court determined that “A free negro of the African race, whose ancestors were brought to this country and sold as slaves, is not a ‘citizen’ within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States.” As non-citizens, they have no right to sue in Federal Court.

Still, it is proper to observe that these events, however bad and cruel in themselves, derive their chief importance from the apprehension that they are but symptoms of an incurable disease in the public mind, which may break out in still more dangerous outrages and terminate at last in an open war by the North to abolish slavery in the South.”
