    I am just now leaving the Supreme Court where I joined other conservatives rallying against Obamacare and expressed my unequivocal support for the overturn of this awful law.
With its big government mandates, Obamacare is nothing short of a direct assault on our Constitution, and an insult to every freedom loving American. And if it is not overturned or repealed, it will have fundamentally changed our country forever, and will lead to even more erosion of the basic freedoms and rights we have cherished since the birth of our nation.
That is why I protested and that is why I have made full repeal of Obamacare a key agenda item for my campaign for President. We have a chance for the Supreme Court to right a massive wrong, but let me be clear, if the Supreme Court doesn't strike Obamacare down, repealing this law will be the first thing I do when I am sworn in as President next year.
Let me finish by saying the most tragic part of all is that a member of our own party, Mitt Romney, is considered the architect of Obamacare. In my opinion, this disqualifies Romney from being our nominee, because it shows him to be a proponent of the type of freedom killing legislation our Party is against and it completely takes off the table one of the most potent issues we have to defeat Barack Obama.
