(Senate)
(Sen. Murray, D-Washington, and 4 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of Amendment 4567 to H.R. 1586, which would provide much-needed relief to teachers and critical assistance to hard-pressed States. Since teachers are essential to the quality of education that the Nation affords its children and to America's long-term strength and security, the Administration strongly supports the $10 billion Education Jobs Fund to avert the layoff of hundreds of thousands of public school teachers as students return to school in the coming months. The Administration strongly supports the extension of the temporary increase in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for six months through June 2011, which will provide critical assistance to States to help them maintain their Medicaid programs during a period of high enrollment growth and reduced State revenue. In addition, to provide this assistance in a fiscally responsible way, the amendment includes revenue-raising provisions similar to those included in the President's Budget, including proposals to close international tax loopholes that currently allow multinational corporations to inappropriately lower their U.S. taxes.
