Marco outlined why he refused to "wait in line" to run for Senate and why American can't afford to wait to tackle the challenges of the 21st Century.
Despite being told by his party's establishment wing he was too young or not ready to run for president, Republican hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio said Saturday he couldn't afford to be patient.
Talking to a crowd of around 1,500 people at the Hilton Head Island High School gymnasium, Rubio, 44, said he bucked the GOP establishment in 2010 when he decided to run for the U.S. Senate and again last year when he opted to dive into the presidential race.
"They told me 'You have to wait,' and my answer is 'Wait for what?'" the Florida senator said. "After seven years of (President) Barack Obama, this is no time for patience. If we get this election wrong, there will be no turning back for America.

Following the huge Hilton Head rally, Marco attended a packed meet and greet in Lexington.

Marco is currently continuing his early state swing with stops today in New Hampshire and Iowa.
