    The President today declared a major disaster exists for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and ordered federal aid to supplement the Tribe's efforts in the area affected by severe storms and flooding during the period of May 25 to June 1, 2013.
Federal funding is available to state and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms and flooding on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.
W. Craig Fugate, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Gary R. Stanley as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
FEMA said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the Tribe and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
