    (SOUTH CAROLINA, December 12, 2019) –– Today, presidential candidate for the Democratic nomination Tom Steyer released a statement on local efforts to make South Carolina the 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment:
"My wife Kat Taylor and I proudly stand with Representative Cobb-Hunter and her colleagues in bringing back the Equal Rights Amendment to the South Carolina State House. Now more than ever, our laws must reflect and embolden our values as a nation. That means ensuring that our government safeguards justice and equality for women and revitalizes the historic strides of the ERA from 47 years ago.
"Rep. Cobb-Hunter's leadership in South Carolina is more than just a call on our local and federal government to empower women under the law –– it is a call on South Carolina and those who haven't stepped forward to be stewards of American values. As president, I will fight tirelessly to ensure that every person in our country is treated with equality, justice, and decency."
