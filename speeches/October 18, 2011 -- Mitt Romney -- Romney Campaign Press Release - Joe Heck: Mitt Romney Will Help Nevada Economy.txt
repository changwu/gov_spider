    Nevada Congressman Joe Heck issued the following statement on tonight's debate in Las Vegas:
"Mitt Romney won tonight's debate by again clearly showing that he is the best candidate to revitalize America. On the economy and jobs, there is no other candidate with his economic know-how, experience in the private sector, or proven leadership. Nevada has suffered more than any other state under this President and Nevadans are looking for a leader with a plan to grow the economy. Tonight, Mitt Romney presented his plan to put Nevada on a path to prosperity once again."
