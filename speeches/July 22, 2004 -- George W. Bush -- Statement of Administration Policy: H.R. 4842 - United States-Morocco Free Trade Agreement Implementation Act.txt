    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. DeLay (R) TX and Rep. Rangel (D) NY)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 4842, which will approve and implement the U.S.-Morocco Free Trade Agreement (FTA or Agreement), as signed by the United States and Morocco on June 15, 2004.
The U.S.-Morocco FTA advances U.S. economic interests and meets the negotiating principles and objectives set out by the Congress in the Trade Act of 2002. The FTA will benefit the people of the United States and Morocco and illustrate to other developing countries the advantages of more open markets for trade and investment.
The FTA provides for increased access for American farmers, workers, and businesses to Morocco's markets. Pursuant to the Agreement, Morocco will provide strong protection for intellectual property, ensure that rules on electronic commerce are non-discriminatory, and provide U.S. firms access to covered government procurement opportunities on the same basis that Moroccan firms enjoy.
The U.S.-Morocco FTA provides a significant opportunity to encourage economic reform and development in a moderate Muslim nation and is an important step in implementing the President's plan for a broader U.S.-Middle East Free Trade Area. It also sets a strong example of the benefits of open trade and democracy. Opening markets is part of the President's six-point plan for continuing to strengthen America's economy and to create more opportunities for American farmers, workers, and businesses.
