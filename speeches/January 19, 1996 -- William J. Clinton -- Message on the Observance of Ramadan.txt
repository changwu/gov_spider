    Greetings to everyone observing the holy month of Ramadan.
As the crescent moon signals the approach of this most sacred time in the Islamic year, Muslims the world over commemorate the revelation of the Koran to Muhammad. For Muslims, this marks a time of quiet reflection and religious devotion through fasting, self-examination, and intensive study of the teachings of Islam. Encouraging gratitude for our blessings and compassion for those in need, Ramadan cleanses the heart and lifts the soul.
During this time of unprecedented movement toward peace in the Middle East, Muslims and people of all faiths have the opportunity to join together in creating a new world of harmony. Ramadan, with its promise of renewal, helps to nourish the spirit of brotherhood in us all. In this season of hope, let us resolve to work together for a better, brighter futureâ€”a future in which children of every religion can live together in peace.
Hillary and I offer best wishes to Muslims everywhere for a memorable observance.
