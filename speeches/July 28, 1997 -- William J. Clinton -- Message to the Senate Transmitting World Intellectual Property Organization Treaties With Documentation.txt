    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty and the World Intellectual Property Organization Performances and Phonograms Treaty, done at Geneva on December 20, 1996, and signed by the United States on April 12, 1997. Also transmitted is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaties.
These Treaties are in the best interests of the United States. They ensure that international copyright rules will keep pace with technological change, thus affording important protection against piracy for U.S. rightsholders in the areas of music, film, computer software, and information products. The terms of the Treaties are thus consistent with the United States policy of encouraging other countries to provide adequate and effective intellectual property protection.
Legislation is required to implement certain provisions of the Treaties. Legislation is also required to ensure that parties to the Treaties are granted, under U.S. copyright law, the rights to which they are entitled under the Treaties. That legislation is being prepared and is expected to be submitted shortly.
I recommend, therefore, that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty, and give its advice and consent to ratification, subject to a declaration under Article 15(3) of the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty described in the accompanying State Department report.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
