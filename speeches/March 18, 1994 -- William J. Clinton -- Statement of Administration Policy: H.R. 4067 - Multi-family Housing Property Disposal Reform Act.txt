    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Gonzalez (D) TX)
The Administration supports H.R. 4067. The bill would provide the Department of Housing and Urban Development with tools to address its most pressing management problem — the explosive growth of the Federal Housing Administration's multi-family inventory. In addition, H.R. 4067 would protect those tenants in need of affordable housing and provide critically needed deficit reduction.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 4067 would increase receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA).
OMB's preliminary scoring estimates for this bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If H.R. 4067 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published five days after enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending will be reported monthly to Congress.
