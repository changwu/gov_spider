    THE PRESIDENT. Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping and I will meet again tomorrow afternoon to conclude the signing of agreements that will be worked out between now and then. Our discussions yesterday and today have been far-reaching. They have been very frank and honest. They've been very cordial and harmonious, and they've been extremely beneficial and constructive.
We have, I think, established a relationship for future routine consultation which will bring great benefits to the people of the United States of America and to the People's Republic of China.
Again, we consider this visit one of the most historic events in our Nation's history, and we are grateful for the progress that has been made already and for the prospects of even greater benefits in the future.
THE VICE PREMIER. As for myself, I agree to every word that the President has just said. And I also believe that through these discussions and through this visit, we have enhanced our mutual understanding and friendship. And through this visit, I am even more convinced that China and the United States and the Chinese people and the American people have broad prospects in various fieldsâ€”politically, economically, in the science and technological fields, and in the cultural field, et cetera.
Of course, the reception which is being accorded to me and my party by the American Government and people has not yet concluded. But up to the present, I would still like to express our sincere thanks and appreciation for the kind reception given to us and given to me personally by the President, Mrs. Carter, and the American Government and people, and for their friendship which they expressed to us.
Let us shake hands once again, a handshake between the two peoples.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you again. Thank you very much.
