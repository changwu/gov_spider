    The United States strongly condemns this terrorist act. On behalf of the American people, I want to express my condolences to the families of the innocent victims killed on Israel's day of remembrance for those who fell in war. This action, like those before it, is a further attempt by extremists to derail the peace process. They must not be allowed to succeed.
We strongly support Prime Minister Rabin's pledge that he will continue the peace negotiations regardless of such terrorist acts. We also welcome Chairman Arafat's rejection of attacks on innocent Israeli civilians intended to strike at the peace process. We believe the best response to the enemies of peace is to demonstrate that negotiations can change realities on the ground and give hope to Israelis and Palestinians for a peaceful future.
