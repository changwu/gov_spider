    Holds 3 town hall meetings, will attend Story GOP event
ANKENY, Iowa â€” 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul received a warm reception during today's daylong tour of Iowa. The 12-term Congressman from Texas held town hall meetings in Dubuque, Clinton and Muscatine and was set to attend the Story County Republican Chili Supper.
"With each visit to Iowa, Ron Paul attracts large crowds of supporters whose interest in his candidacy is intensifying. At the town hall meetings, Iowans appreciated Dr. Paul's knowledge of the issues, his candor and the gracious manner in which he tries to greet as many voters as possible," said Ron Paul Iowa Campaign Chairman Drew Ivers.
At least 150 voters attended Dr. Paul's Dubuque town hall, 165 at his Clinton town hall and more than 150 at his Muscatine town hall. The campaign's Iowa Vice Chairman David Fischer described the crowd yields as "strong to extraordinarily competitive," especially in the smaller settings of Clinton and Muscatine.
"These numbers are evidence of something special happening in Iowa and America, and they are proof of Dr. Paul's steadily rising competitiveness," said Mr. Fischer.
In addition, all members of the Iowa team who staffed today's events noted that Dr. Paul was particularly engaging during the question and answer portion of his town hall gatherings. At the conclusion of his Muscatine town hall, Dr. Paul was set to travel to the Story County Republican Chili Supper.
