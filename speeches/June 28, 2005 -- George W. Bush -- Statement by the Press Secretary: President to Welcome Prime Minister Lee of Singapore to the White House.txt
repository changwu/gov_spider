    President Bush will welcome Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore to the White House on July 12. This will be Prime Minister Lee's first visit to Washington since becoming Prime Minister last August, though the two leaders met last November on the margins of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Santiago. The President looks forward to discussing our close strategic and trade cooperation with the Prime Minister, in addition to other issues of mutual interest.
