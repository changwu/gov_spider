    Christina Martin, Deputy Press Secretary today released the following statement:
"What American businesswomen need is a tax cut, not a web site. Bob Dole will cut personal income taxes by 15%, eliminate the IRS as we know it, reduce by half the capital gains tax, restore a meaningful home office tax deduction, and reform the estate tax system. And as every businessperson knows, the major obstacle to starting a new business is the burdensome regulations of big government -- a government that has only gotten bigger under Bill Clinton."
