    Today, Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"This is the most important presidential election of my lifetime, and Joe Biden is the nominee we need leading the Democratic ticket if we're going to beat Donald Trump, protect the House, and win the Senate. I proudly served in the Obama-Biden administration and saw firsthand how President Obama and Vice President Biden led America with honor and grace, delivering healthcare to millions, saving the American economy, and representing our values on the world stage. Joe Biden is the only candidate who can bring our country together to defeat the Trumpism that has infected our politics, and I'm proud to support him for President of the United States."
Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
