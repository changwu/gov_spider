    Laura and I were saddened to learn of the passing of Jim McKay. For a generation of Americans, Jim was more than the much-honored host of "Wide World of Sports" and ABC's Olympic coverage. He was a talented and eloquent newsman and storyteller whose special gift was his ability to make the viewers at home genuinely care about more than just who won or lost.
Jim was at his best during what had to be his most difficult assignment, hosting with skill and sensitivity ABC's blanket coverage of the 1972 Munich Olympics hostage crisis.
Off camera, he was a compassionate and generous person and devoted family man.
We are also grateful for Jim's service to his country as a naval officer aboard a minesweeper during World War II.
Our thoughts and prayers are with Jim's wife Margaret, his children Sean and Mary, and all of his family and friends.
