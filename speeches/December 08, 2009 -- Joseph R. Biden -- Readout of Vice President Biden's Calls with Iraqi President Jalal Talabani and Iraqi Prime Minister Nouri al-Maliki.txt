    The Vice President spoke to both Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki earlier today. The Vice President conveyed the condolences of the American people to those Iraqis killed and injured in today's bombings in Baghdad. The United States strongly condemns these attacks on the Iraqi people and their elected government. The perpetrators of today's bombings will not succeed. The Iraqi people have repeatedly made clear they embrace a future of promise and progress and reject extremism and destruction. The United States will stand with the Iraqis and their government as a partner and a friend as they build national unity.
