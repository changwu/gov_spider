    Mel Martinez has served his party with the same distinction he serves his country. When Mel accepted the position as general chairman of the Republican National Committee, his goal was to ensure our party had the structure and resources in place for all Republican candidates in the 2008 elections to be successful. He has more than fulfilled that mission.
As general chairman of the Republican National Committee, Mel has effectively communicated our party's commitment to addressing the issues most important to all Americans. His message of hope and opportunity has resonated throughout America and strengthened support for our agenda. Because of his leadership, more Americans understand the Republican Party's efforts to grow our economy, support our troops, strengthen our schools, and protect our country.
As his tenure at the RNC ends, Mel should be proud that he has represented the best of the Republican Party and its core values. I am grateful for his leadership at the RNC, his service in my Cabinet, and his continued service as a Member of the United States Senate.
Mike Duncan has demonstrated that he is an effective chairman who will help our party win in the next election. I have confidence in Mike's leadership and look forward to continuing to work with him.
