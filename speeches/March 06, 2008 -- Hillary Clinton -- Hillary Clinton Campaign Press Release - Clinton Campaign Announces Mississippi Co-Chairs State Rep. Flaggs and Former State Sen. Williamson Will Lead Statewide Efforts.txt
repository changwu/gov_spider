    The Clinton campaign today announced State Representative George Flaggs and Former State Senator Gloria Williamson will co-chair the campaign's efforts in the Magnolia State. Flaggs and Williamson will mobilize grassroots support for Hillary leading up to Mississippi's March 11 primary.
Representative Flaggs was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1988, and has been a tireless advocate for educational opportunities for all of Mississippi's youth, and common sense juvenile justice reforms. As Chairman of the House Juvenile Justice Committee, Rep. Flaggs instituted the most comprehensive juvenile justice reform in Mississippi history.
"I'm very proud to stand up and support Hillary. I know she will stand up and deliver real changes for Mississippi families each day as president," said Rep. Flaggs. "Hillary Clinton is a fighter, and our country needs someone to fight for quality, affordable health care, to rebuild our middle class, and to bring our troops home from Iraq."
Former State Senator Gloria Williamson served in the Mississippi House of Representatives, representing Leake, Neshoba and Winston Counties.
"I'm thrilled to have this kind of support throughout Mississippi, and look forward to harnessing our grassroots momentum to bring out our support next week," Clinton said. "I believe Mississippi voters want someone who can help deliver affordable health care to everyone who needs it, jump start the economy, and be a strong commander in chief, and I intend to be a president for all of Mississippi."
