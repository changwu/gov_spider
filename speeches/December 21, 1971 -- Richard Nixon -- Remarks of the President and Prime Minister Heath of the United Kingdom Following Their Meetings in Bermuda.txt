    Mr. Prime Minister :
I want to express my appreciation for the very warm welcome you have given us here in Bermuda on this historic occasion, and to say first that the remarks that you have just made are ones that I can subscribe to completely.
As you have pointed out, we are entering a new era in the relations between our two countries, and a new era in the history of the world. That is exemplified by the fact that Britain will be going into Europe. It is also exemplified by the reference that you made to the fact that I will be visiting Peking and Moscow during the next year.
As we look at those changes in the world, as we look at what is really a new world, we also realize, however, that there are some things that have not changed. One thing that has not changed, and that will not change, is the friendship, the communication, the fact that our two countries, and the leaders of our two countries, have met here on, now, four occasions and, despite some tactical differences, find that on the great issues we see the problems of the world in exactly the same way.
I would put it very briefly in this way: As Britain goes into Europe, there will be a new Europe. The United States is, at the present time, embarked on creating what is really a new America, and we do live at a time when because of the fast changing events in the world, we live in a new world. It is essential that the new Europe and the new America, together with the other nations in the world, and particularly in Asia, Japan, the other great economic power in the world--it is essential that we work together.
It is inevitable that as free nations, believing in competition, we will compete, but it is also indispensable that that competition be constructive and not destructive, and I think that our talks have contributed toward that goal.
Thank you.
