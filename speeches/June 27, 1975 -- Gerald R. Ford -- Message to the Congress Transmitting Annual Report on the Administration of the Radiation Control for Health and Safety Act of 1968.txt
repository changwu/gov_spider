    To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith the 1974 annual report on the administration of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act (Public Law 90-602), as prepared by the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.
The report's only recommendation is that the requirement for the report itself, as contained in P.L. 90-602, be repealed. All of the information found in the report is available to Congress on a more immediate basis through congressional committee oversight and budget hearings. The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare has concluded that this annual report serves little useful purpose and diverts agency resources from more productive activities.
