    The President has authorized the deployment to the U.S. Virgin Islands of such Department of Defense forces as are necessary, including military police units, to help restore order in the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo. The President's decision was based on a thorough assessment of the situation by appropriate Federal authorities and followed a request this afternoon from Governor Farrelly of the U.S. Virgin Islands requesting Federal assistance.
In addition, the President has directed the Attorney General to deploy in excess of 100 U.S. marshals and FBI agents, who are scheduled to arrive in St. Croix early tomorrow morning. They have been ordered to take all necessary steps to protect Federal property and personnel in the Virgin Islands and to exercise all lawful authority necessary to enforce Federal law in the Virgin Islands.
