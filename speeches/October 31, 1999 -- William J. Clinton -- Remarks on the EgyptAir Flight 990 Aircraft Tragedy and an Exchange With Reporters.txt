    The President. Like all Americans, Hillary and I are very saddened by the crash of the EgyptAir flight off the coast of Massachusetts. We are working on the recovery efforts. We know there has been an extensive loss of life, and we don't yet know what caused the accident. So I really think I can't say any more now, except——
Q. Have you talked with anyone, sir?
The President. Only our people. They've briefed me. But we don't know, we don't know what the cause of the accident is. We'll keep working until we find out.
Q. Concerns about foul play, sir?
The President. We don't know. We have no evidence of that at this time, and I think it's better if people draw no conclusions until we know something.
Thank you.
