    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Forbes (R) NY)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2005.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring 
H.R. 2005 could affect direct spending; it therefore is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is zero. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
