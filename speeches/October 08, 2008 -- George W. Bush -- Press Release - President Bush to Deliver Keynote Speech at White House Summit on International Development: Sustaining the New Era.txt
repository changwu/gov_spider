    The President will deliver the keynote speech at the White House Summit on International Development: Sustaining the New Era, which will be held on October 21st in the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center. Secretary Rice will also give opening remarks.
This Summit, being coordinated in conjunction with USAID, the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator at the Department of State (OGAC), the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), will bring together a wide range of country beneficiaries, faith-based organizations, and other stakeholders in the international development community, including public, private, and nongovernmental leaders from the United States and the developing world.
Given the slowdown in the global economy, and the impact of the financial crisis around the world, it is even more important that we and our partners continue to pursue our shared development agenda: to lift people from poverty, fight disease, and increase educational opportunities.
This Summit will focus on the Administration's core principles in transforming international development: country ownership, good governance, results-based programs and accountability, and the importance of economic growth.
