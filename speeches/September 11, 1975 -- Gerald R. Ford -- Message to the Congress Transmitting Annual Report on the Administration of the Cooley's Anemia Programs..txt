    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to send to the Congress the Third Annual Report on the Administration of the Cooley's Anemia Programs in accordance with the requirements of Section 1115 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended.
The Report describes the activities of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Health Services Administration (HSA), and the Center for Disease Control (CDC). Research and development are underway at NIH in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Cooley's anemia. High priority is being given to the development and evaluation of effective, nontoxic iron chelating agents to reduce iron buildup which occurs in the bodies of patients treated for Cooley's anemia with periodic blood transfusions.
High priority also is being given to pilot programs in screening, education, and counseling in coordination with NIH and HSA. In addition, HSA is evaluating the information gained from the extensive screening, treatment, and counseling studies in sickle cell anemia (which is also a genetic blood disease) as a means to plan more effectively the Cooley's anemia screening programs. CDC is involved in a number of activities concerned with the laboratory detection of Cooley's anemia, including screening techniques and educational programs.
