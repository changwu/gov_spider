    The President has accepted with deep regret the resignation of Carlton E. Turner, Ph.D., as Deputy Assistant to the President for Drug Abuse Policy, effective December 31, 1986. The President and Mrs. Reagan are grateful for Dr. Turner's loyal service and his special contribution in the administration's crusade against drug abuse. Dr. Turner accompanied Mrs. Reagan on many of her trips to drug treatment centers, and he played a key role in the development of the administration's policy against drug abuse. A successor to Dr. Turner will be named in the near future.
