VP Pool Report - Blinken Swearing-In 
No news here; event lasted 90 seconds if that much and began at 11:59 am.
It took place in the VPOTUS' ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building?, one of the most attractive rooms in the WH complex. It has a nautical motif, with ship models and portraits of former secretaries up of the navy.
The VP walked in with Antony Blinken and his wife, Evan Ryan, the President's cabinet secretary. She held something which didn't appear to be a Bible and in fact was a copy of the US Constitution.
After Blinken swore the oath the VP said earnestly: "Congratulations, Mr. Secretary, congratulations!"The trio then exited stage left.
