The issue is personal for him, he said, because his brother Mario, a Vietnam vet, has to fight on a regular basis for the benefits he earned from the VA.

Earlier this year, Marco laid out his principles for VA reform at an event with Mario. Watch this interview of the two brothers: 

Here are the principles:

Marco has led on veterans issues in the Senate: He ensured that the VA reform bill that passed in 2014 will allow the VA secretary to fire senior VA executives who aren't doing their jobs.
Great VA reform answer from @marcorubio. He led fight to pass #VAaccountability bill & is 100% correct on need for vets healthcare choices.

He had to overcome the opposition of Bernie Sanders and other government-union-friendly Democrats to make it happen, and as President, he'll fight to ensure that any VA employee not doing his job can be fired — vets like his brother deserve no less.
