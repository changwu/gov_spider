    Staples founder Tom Stemberg today made the following statement on the report on second quarter growth: Â 
"Today's news about the second-quarter GDP numbers confirms what the American people already know: our economy is struggling and President Obama's policies aren't working. Anemic economic growth of 1.3 percent does not offer hope to the 23 million Americans who cannot find the jobs they need or the middle-class families who have seen their incomes decline. This report is the latest indication that the Obama presidency amounts to nothing more than downturns, debt, downgrades, and disappointments. Our nation cannot sustain another four years down this same path. Mitt Romney will lead our country down a very different course. He will implement pro-growth economic policies to lift our economy out of the doldrums, provide a real recovery, and create prosperity for all Americans."
