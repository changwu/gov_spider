    PORTLAND, OR - The Clinton Campaign today announced the official launch of the Oregon Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Leadership Council. These leaders will work with the campaign to help organize the AAPI community for Hillary.
"Oregon and Asian American and Pacific Islanders have a very real chance of playing a significant role in this election," said Christine Chin Ryan. "Hillary Clinton has shown that she has the strength and experience to take on the many challenges this country is facing and I am looking forward to helping elect Hillary."
According to the Census Bureau, the AAPI community is the fastest growing ethnic group in the country and currently represents 3.7% of the population of Oregon.
In addition to person-to-person outreach, the AAPI Steering Committee will host a dedicated weekly phone bank every Wednesday night until the May 20th primary out of the campaign's Beaverton office.
"I am very grateful for the friendship of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community over the many years," said Senator Hillary Clinton. "We are going to continue to talk to Oregonians about the issues impacting the state and continuing to earn every vote."
