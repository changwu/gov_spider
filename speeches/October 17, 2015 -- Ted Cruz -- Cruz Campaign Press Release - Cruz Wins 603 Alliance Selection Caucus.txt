Contoocook, NH â€” Presidential candidate Ted Cruz won the 603 Alliance Selection Caucus today, receiving a whopping 72.3% of the vote. The 603 Alliance is New Hampshire's largest gathering of conservative activists, comprised of a broad coalition of Tea Party, Liberty, faith-based, and Republican women groups from all over the state.
The 603 Alliance grew out of conservatives' concern that various factions were splitting the conservative vote and allowing establishment moderates to win in New Hampshire. Determined to give the conservative coalition a stronger voice, the 603 Alliance decided to coalesce behind and endorse one conservative candidate. Today's lopsided vote clearly shows that New Hampshire conservatives overwhelmingly support Ted Cruz.
"I am inspired by the number of New Hampshire conservatives who believe that our campaign can win," said Cruz. "Working together, we can win the Granite State, beat the establishment, and take on the Washington Cartel."
By winning the 603 Alliance Straw Poll, Ted Cruz has earned the support of a broad spectrum of conservatives who agree that he is the best candidate to beat the Democrat nominee in November 2016.
