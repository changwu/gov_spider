    Bill Simpson of my staff is finalizing a report on the flood conditions in Mississippi following his visit to Jackson.
The people of Mississippi have met this disaster—and the tragedy it has wrought—with strength, resolve and faith. My prayers are with them, and I am confident that their spirit will prevail over this unprecedented flood as it has over previous natural disasters.
While I am concerned about the scope of the flooding and the suffering inflicted on our citizens, I am heartened to know that an effective working partnership has already been achieved among all levels of government and the private sector to relieve the situation.
This partnership, which reaches from the White House through the Governor's office into every county and community involved in this catastrophe, insures we will succeed in our efforts to rebuild homes, businesses and livelihoods in every afflicted area of the state.
