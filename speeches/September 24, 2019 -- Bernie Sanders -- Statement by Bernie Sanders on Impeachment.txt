    Here's a transcript of Bernie Sanders' statement from earlier today on impeachment:
"Three months ago, I called for an impeachment inquiry by the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives into the actions and behavior of President Trump.
"I believed then and I believe now that in Donald Trump we have the most corrupt president in the modern history of this country.
"I believed then and I believe now that Trump likely engaged in obstruction of justice with regard to the Mueller investigation.
"I believed then and I believe now that Trump is likely in violation of the emolument clause of the U.S. Constitution and that every single day, unbelievably, he is working to enrich himself at the expense of the taxpayers of this country.
"And most recently, of course, we appear to have a president who unbelievably may have used security funds, funds designed to protect the security of the people of the United States, as a means to gain political dirt on an opponent.
"These are just some of the issues and there are more that the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives must investigate as part of an impeachment inquiry.
"And today, I call upon on the Judiciary Committee to demand all of the information that they need from the Trump administration, so that they can go forward.
"But I think all over this country, we have people, including Republicans, who are sick and tired of a president who believes that he does not have to obey the Constitution of the United States, and that he is above the law.
"Enough is enough."
