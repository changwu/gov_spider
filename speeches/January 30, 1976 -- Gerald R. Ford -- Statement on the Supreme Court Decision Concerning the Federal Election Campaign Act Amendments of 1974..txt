    TODAY'S decision by the Supreme Court calls for quick action by political leaders of this country, as well as by candidates for high office, to ensure that our elections remain free from the undue influence of excessive spending.
As President, I will ask leaders of Congress to meet with me to discuss the need for legislation to reconstitute the Commission or to assure by other mechanisms enforcement of the Federal Election Act as modified by the Supreme Court's decision.
I have asked the Attorney General to review the opinion and to advise me on what steps, if any, should be taken to ensure that our elections remain free from any abuses.
As a candidate for the Presidency, I am calling on others who seek this office to join with me in adhering to the spending limit that had been established under the 1974 law.
I am directing the President Ford Committee to limit its expenditures to that level.
