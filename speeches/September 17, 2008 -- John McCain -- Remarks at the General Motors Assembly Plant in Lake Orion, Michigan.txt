    It's great to be here today with the assembly workers of this GM plant. I'm here to send a message to Washington and Wall Street: We are not going to leave the workers here in Michigan hung out to dry while we give billions in taxpayer dollars to Wall Street. It is time to get our auto industry back on its feet. It's time for a new generation of cars and for loans to build the facilities that will make them.
These workers here are the best in the world. They are the backbone and foundation of our economy. One of our great Presidents, Franklin Roosevelt expressed this optimism even at the height of the Great Depression. He said: "Plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply." My friends, that is true again today. I reject the doom and gloom that says our nation is in decline. America's best days are ahead.
We are going to fight the special interests and corruption in Washington. We are going to fight the greed and irresponsibility on Wall Street. And we are going to create prosperity for our people.
Now is the time to grow our economy. My plan does that. Senator Obama's does not. He has said in recent days that he may delay his economic plan because of the adverse impact of his tax increases. Even Senator Obama admits that the agenda he has been pushing for would hurt our economy.
That is exactly the wrong approach. I am going to create jobs and get our economy back on its feet. I am going to lead our nation to energy independence with new technologies here in Michigan and additional drilling here at home. As President, I am going to fight for the people and workers of Michigan, and bring this economy back.
