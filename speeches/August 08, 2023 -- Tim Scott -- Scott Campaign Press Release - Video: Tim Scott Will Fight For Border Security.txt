    "I will use the power of the presidency to stop the cartels in their tracks." – Tim Scott
CHARLESTON, SC – Following his visit to the southern border last week, Tim Scott released a new video pledging to secure the border and save American lives.
Tim's plan to combat the border crisis includes finishing the border wall, deploying military-grade technology at our border and ports of entry to stop illegal drugs and human trafficking, and designating cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.

TRANSCRIPT:
South Carolina Senator Tim Scott visited the southern border today.
TIM SCOTT: The devastation is felt throughout the entire country. Because of fentanyl, every county is a border county.
The Biden administration continues to tell the American people, "believe what we say and not what you see with your own eyes."
I will be the president that finishes the wall and takes seriously the opportunity to save tens of thousands of Americans from the drug of fentanyl.
I will use the power of the presidency to stop the cartels in their tracks.
