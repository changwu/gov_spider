That's the goal Jeb stated at his campaign announcement in June. And it's a goal he's repeated at campaign stops in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada and across the nation.
Immediately, the pessimistic Left said four percent growth wasn't possible — that anemic two percent economic growth was the "new normal." Yet those who dismissed Jeb's positive vision are the same Hillary Clinton allies calling for more of the same failed policies that have led to falling incomes and the lowest labor force participation rate since the 1970's.
So why has Jeb insisted we set the bar at a level that would lift families out of poverty, create rising incomes and give middle class families their first pay raise in 15 years?

Employment growth when Governor Jeb Bush was in office, for instance, tended to be about 4 percent higher per year than one would have predicted if the average Florida governor had been in office."
