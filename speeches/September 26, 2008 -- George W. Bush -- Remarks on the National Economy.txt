    Good morning. My administration continues to work with the Congress on a rescue plan. And we need a rescue plan. This isâ€”it's hard work. Our proposal is a big proposal, and the reason it's big and substantial is because we got a big problem.
We also need to move quickly. Now, any time you have a plan this big, that is moving this quickly, that requires legislative approval, it creates challenges. Members want to be heard. They want to be able to express their opinions, and they should be allowed to express their opinions.
There are disagreements over aspects of the rescue plan, but there is no disagreement that something substantial must be done. The legislative process is sometimes not very pretty, but we are going to get a package passed. We will rise to the occasion. Republicans and Democrats will come together and pass a substantial rescue plan.
Thank you very much.
