    After receiving the first-ever presidential endorsement from the NCLR Action PAC, Hillary Clinton released the following statement:
"For nearly five decades, the National Council of La Raza has lifted up the Latino community and celebrated its diversity. NCLR's investments in training workers, empowering the next generation of students and leaders, and supporting families are a model for the work we need to do across America.
"As President, I'll proudly work alongside organizations like NCLR to take on the issues that keep Latino families up at night â€“ from creating good jobs with rising incomes in every zip code to passing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. Together, we'll reject the hateful rhetoric that has been directed at Latinos and too many others throughout this election, and open doors of opportunity for Latinos in every corner of our country.
"The stakes have never been higher, and I'm humbled to receive this historic endorsement from NCLR PAC. As voters head to the polls in states across the country, it's critical that Latinos make their voices heard in this election. With so much on the line, now is the time for people from all walks of life to stand up and vote for the kind of country we want to be: a country where we build bridges, not walls; where we're stronger together; and where every child can live up to his or her God-given potential."
