    Starting immediately, the Congressman will receive the daily intelligence briefings--this is what I have in my hand here--and will participate in meetings of the National Security Council, meetings of the Cabinet, and other meetings that the Vice President would participate in once he is confirmed.
Also, we are making arrangements for Congressman Ford to have an office in the EOB so that he can get his work prepared for the day when he moves from the House down here to the White House in terms of his operations here, and of course over in the Senate they give you an office, too.
We have had here--the fact of the matter is, I was talking to Dr. Kissinger at 8 o'clock this morning on the Mideast. We met for a half hour or so, and we have had just another hour now, and the Congressman has been briefed on the Mideast situation 'because he is going to be leaving the city. He had engagements that he made before he knew he was going to have his new assignment, so he is going to where--Grand Rapids?
VICE PRESIDENT-DESIGNATE FORD. Grand Rapids. I am coming back for church tomorrow, and then going---
THE PRESIDENT. Oh, you are going to make that?
VICE PRESIDENT-DESIGNATE FORD. Yes.
THE PRESIDENT. Oh, good. Well, I told Hudnut he wouldn't have to pray for you tomorrow, he could just pray for me. So now he will pray for both of us.
Then you are going to see your boy in Denver?
VICE PRESIDENT-DESIGNATE FORD. In Utah.
THE PRESIDENT. Utah.
VICE PRESIDENT-DESIGNATE FORD. And on to Portland for a speech that I have planned for about 6 months, and then coming back Monday.
THE PRESIDENT. Fine. Well, this is our first official meeting since he was nominated, and I thought you would kind of like to cover it.
