    HENDERSON, Nev. â€“ Thanking the non-partisan group No Labels for "a serious discussion on serious issues," U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday was among eight 2016 Democratic and Republican presidential candidates slated to address the gathering in Manchester, New Hampshire.
Sanders spoke by satellite from here in Nevada, where he is preparing for Tuesday night's Democratic debate.
"Let's treat each other respectfully and let's not demagogue those we have differences with," Sanders said in remarks that focused on the importance of creating jobs by investing in rebuilding the nation's crumbling roads and bridges and other projects, raising the "totally inadequate" minimum wage, expanding Social Security, strengthening Medicare and promoting trade policies that help American workers instead of multi-national corporations.
Headed by former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman and former U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, No Labels bills itself as a national movement of Democrats, Republicans and independents dedicated to solving problems in a non-partisan way.
