    Christie Todd Whitman is a trusted friend and adviser who has worked closely with me to achieve real and meaningful results to improve our environment.
Christie Todd has been a dedicated and tireless fighter for new and innovative policies for cleaner air, purer water, and better protected land.
In just over 2 years, we have acted in a comprehensive way to reduce pollution from diesel fuel sources and implemented an innovative initiative to better protect our water quality and watersheds. We are cleaning up abandoned industrial sites and turning them into assets for the communities in which they are located. We are also making great progress on the Clear Skies Initiative that I outlined to significantly reduce pollution from powerplants by 70 percent.
Christie Todd Whitman has served my administration exceptionally well. I thank her for her outstanding service to our Nation and wish her well as she returns home to New Jersey.
