    Former Senator and National Co-Chairman of the Romney Jewish Coalition Norm Coleman made the following statement on the comments made by California Democratic Party Chairman John Burton:
"President Obama promised to lift up American politics. Unfortunately, some of his supporters, by employing rhetoric that has no place in our political system, are bringing it down to the gutter.Â  The comments by California Democratic Chair John Burton likening the Republican Party to Nazis and Joseph Goebbels are just such an instance. All people of good will should repudiate such disgraceful words."
