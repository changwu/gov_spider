    Chicago, IL - Today, on the third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina devastating the Gulf Coast, Senator Obama released the following statement on the importance of following through with our commitment to the region.
"On the third anniversary of Katrina, we can look back on a city and region whose citizens have bravely cleaned up and rebuilt. Today is a day to celebrate their resilience and pledge to help them finish the job. It is also a day to remember the disastrously inadequate response from the federal government and pledge that never again will we let bureaucratic incompetence leave disaster victims stranded and alone."
