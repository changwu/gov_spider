    Hooley will serve as a Co-Chair of Rural Americans for Hillary
The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Oregon Congresswoman Darlene Hooley and named her a Co-Chair of Rural Americans for Hillary.
"Hillary Clinton is the experienced leader we need to tackle the great challenges facing our nation," Hooley said. "She is the one candidate who can hit the ground running on her first day in the White House."
Hooley was elected to Congress in 1996 and has become a leading advocate for our men and women in uniform, fighting to get them the equipment they need on the battlefield and the healthcare they deserve when they return home. Strongly committed to preserving the quality of life in rural America, Hooley has pushed for measures to level the playing field for American farmers and combat the spread of methamphetamine use.
Prior to her election to Congress, Hooley served four terms in the Oregon Legislature and more than two terms as a Clackamas County Commissioner, helping to reform the state's welfare system, authoring the state's first recycling laws, rewriting Oregon's land-use laws, and writing and passing equal pay laws.
"Darlene never lets partisanship get in the way of progress for her constituents and the American people," Clinton said. "I'm delighted that she will play a role in my campaign in Oregon and nationally."
