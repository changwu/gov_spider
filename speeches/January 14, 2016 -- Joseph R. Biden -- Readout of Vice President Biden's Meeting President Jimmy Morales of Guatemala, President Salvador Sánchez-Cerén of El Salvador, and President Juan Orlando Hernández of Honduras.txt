    The Vice President met today with President Jimmy Morales of Guatemala, President Salvador Sánchez-Cerén of El Salvador, and President Juan Orlando Hernández of Honduras. The leaders discussed their commitments to accelerate the implementation of the Plan for the Alliance of Prosperity in the Northern Triangle of Central America. They also discussed deepening U.S. partnership with Central America in the areas of anti-corruption, economic livelihood, citizen security, and effective and accountable government institutions. This meeting built on the commitments previously made in the Vice President's March 2015 meeting with the Northern Triangle leaders in Guatemala and President Obama's April 2015 discussion with the leaders of the Central America Integration System member states on the margins of the Summit of the Americas in Panama.
The leaders affirmed their continued cooperation and praised the recent decision by the United States Congress to appropriate up to $750 million in Fiscal Year 2016 funding to support the United States Strategy for Engagement in Central America, which promotes the goal of an economically integrated region that provides economic opportunities to its people, enjoys more accountable, transparent, and effective public institutions, and ensures a safe environment for its citizens. They agreed that Central America's prosperity and security, as well as its opportunities and challenges, are inextricably linked and have a direct impact on the rest of the hemisphere. The leaders also pledged to work cooperatively to stem the flow of undocumented migration from Central America to the United States, especially with regard to unaccompanied minors and families who face significant risk in making this dangerous journey.
