    We commend the Senate for passing its Amendment to H.R. 6, the Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018. This critical bipartisan legislation is a major step forward in the whole-of-government approach to combating drug demand and the opioid crisis. This bill would help reduce the amount of illicit fentanyl entering the United States, improve treatment for infants suffering from neonatal abstinence syndrome, create job training programs for those in recovery, and reauthorize the Office of National Drug Control Policy to continue overseeing Federal drug control efforts, including public awareness initiatives targeted to individuals of all age groups. The President and his Administration continue to work toward and implement effective policies to address the opioid crisis and save lives. The Administration looks forward to working with both chambers as the legislative process continues to get a bill to the President's desk to mitigate this crisis next door.
