    I strongly condemn the tragic assassination of Archbishop Oscar A. Romero of San Salvador yesterday. It is a shocking and unconscionable act.
Archbishop Romero spoke for the poor of El Salvador, where their voices had been ignored for too long. He spoke for change and for social justice, which his nation so desperately needs. Terrorism cannot silence the archbishop's message of compassion. It cannot and should not intimidate those who seek social justice and democracy.
The United States trusts that the Government of El Salvador will move swiftly and effectively to bring the archbishop's assassins to justice.
