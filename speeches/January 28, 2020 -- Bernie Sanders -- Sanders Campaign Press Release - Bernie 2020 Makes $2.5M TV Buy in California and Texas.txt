    WASHINGTON – Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign on Tuesday announced it will this week launch a $2.5 million television ad campaign in California and Texas – the first buy the campaign has made in Super Tuesday states.
"Across the country, millions of Americans have chipped in $10, $18, $27, to our campaign because they trust that Bernie will always fight for them," Sanders' Campaign Manager Faiz Shakir said. "It is thanks to our grassroots donors that we can make big investments in the vital states of California and Texas. We have the strength and the enthusiasm to fund a campaign to not only win the Democratic nomination but to defeat Donald Trump and create a political revolution that transforms this country."
Further details on the buy are forthcoming.
