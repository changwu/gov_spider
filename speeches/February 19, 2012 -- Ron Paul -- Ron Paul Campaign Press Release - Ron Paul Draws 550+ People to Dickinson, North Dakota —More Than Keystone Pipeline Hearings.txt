BISMARCK, North Dakota — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul attracted more than 550 supporters and undecided voters to his Dickinson, North Dakota town hall meeting this afternoon. The event took place at 3:00 p.m. MST at the Ramada — Grand Dakota Lodge, located at 532 15th Street West, Dickinson, ND 58601.
Crowds numbering in the high hundreds are uncommon in this city, the county seat of Stark County, although campaign organizers noted that Dr. Paul's platform of constitutionally-limited government resonates quite well among North Dakotans. A local reporter even commented that the crowd assembled expressly to engage the 12-term Congressman from Texas dwarfed that of a recently-held TransCanada Keystone XL Pipeline public hearing.

Ron Paul speaks to over 550 voters in Dickinson, where crowds this size are rare.
