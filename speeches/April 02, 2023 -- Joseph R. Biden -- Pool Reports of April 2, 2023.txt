Out of town pool report #3 leaving church
The president exited church at 6:12 PM. He was holding multiple palm branches. As he stepped into the Beast, the president turned to the left to wave to cheering residents crowded on a porch across the street. They wished him a Happy Palm Sunday.
While the president was in church, some spectators across the street appeared to engage in heated debate. They included a woman with a "choose life" sign hanging on her front window and others standing in front of a "bans off our bodies" sign placed in a front yard.
The resident with the "choose life" sign eventually hung up a green poster-board on her window with a message written in marker: "Trump 2024 MAGA." She also appeared to shout something at the president as he stepped into his motorcade.
