The Democrats now realize that there is a National Emergency at the Border and that if we work together it can be immediately fixed. We need Democrat votes and all will be well!Retweets: 15635Favorites: 70004

Border Patrol is apprehending record numbers of people at the Southern Border. The bad 'hombres' of which there are many are being detained & will be sent home. Those which we release under the ridiculous Catch & Telease loophole are being registered and will be removed later!Retweets: 15756Favorites: 65359

All people that are illegally coming into the United States now will be removed from our Country at a later date as we build up our removal forces and as the laws are changed. Please do not make yourselves too comfortable you will be leaving soon!Retweets: 45974Favorites: 177312

My Campaign for President was conclusively spied on. Nothing like this has ever happened in American Politics. A really bad situation. TREASON means long jail sentences and this was TREASON!Retweets: 39493Favorites: 136810

Will Jerry Nadler ever look into the fact that Crooked Hillary deleted and acid washed 33000 emails AFTER getting a most powerful demand notice for them from Congress?Retweets: 30525Favorites: 110801

The Fake News Media is hurting our Country with its fraudulent and highly inaccurate coverage of Iran. It is scattershot poorly sourced (made up) and DANGEROUS. At least Iran doesn't know what to think which at this point may very well be a good thing!Retweets: 19915Favorites: 77548

It now seems the General Flynn was under investigation long before was common knowledge. It would have been impossible for me to know this but if that was the case and with me being one of two people who would become president why was I not told so that I could make a change?Retweets: 31253Favorites: 128024
