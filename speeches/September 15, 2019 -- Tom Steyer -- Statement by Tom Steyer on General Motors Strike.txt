    (SAN FRANCISCO, September 15, 2019) â€” Today, presidential candidate for the Democratic nomination Tom Steyer released the following statement after the United Automobile Workers (UAW) announced its plans to go on strike following failed negotiations with General Motors:
"My work has always been with labor as a partner, and that is why I stand with UAW members who have spent their careers working tirelessly to ensure General Motors produces quality automobiles at a profit. Last year those workers enabled GM to turn a profit of $8.1 billion. In return, GM should put the welfare of its workers above perks for its top executives, and provide fair wages, affordable health care, and secure jobs.
Two weeks ago I called on GM CEO Mary Barra to do the right thing by the planet and join her fellow automotive executives in adhering to California's stringent emissions standards, over opposition from the Trump administration. Today, I ask her to do the right thing by her own workers."
