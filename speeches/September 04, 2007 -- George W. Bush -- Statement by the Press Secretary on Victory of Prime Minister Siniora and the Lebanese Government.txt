    We congratulate Prime Minister Siniora and the Lebanese Government on its victory over the terrorist organization Fatah al-Islam in the battle for Nahr al-Bared camp in Northern Lebanon. We especially commend the bravery of the Lebanese Armed Forces who fought courageously for over three months to defeat this dangerous enemy. We extend our deepest condolences to the families of the 163 Lebanese soldiers who sacrificed their lives to ensure the continued freedom and security of their country.
The United States is pleased to have been able to satisfy the Lebanese Government's request to provide supplies and training to the Lebanese Armed Forces to aid in the defeat of this terrorist threat. We remain committed to assisting the Lebanese Government in building the capacity of the Lebanese Armed Forces to take on challenges critical to the stability of Lebanon and the region.
