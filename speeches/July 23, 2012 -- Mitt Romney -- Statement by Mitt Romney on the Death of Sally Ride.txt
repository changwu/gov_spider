    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the death of Sally Ride:
"Today, America lost one of its greatest pioneers. The first American woman in space, Sally Ride inspired millions of Americans with her determination to break the mold of her time. She wasÂ a profile in courage, and while she will be missed, her accomplishments will never be forgotten."
