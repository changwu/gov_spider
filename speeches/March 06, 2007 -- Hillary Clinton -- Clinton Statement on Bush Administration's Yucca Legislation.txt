    In response to the Bush Administration's recent announcement that it would reintroduce legislation on Yucca Mountain, Senator Hillary Clinton issued the following statement.
"The Bush Administration's latest announcement that it will continue to pursue its misguided policy on Yucca Mountain is very disappointing.
"I've long opposed using Yucca as a site for nuclear waste. Yucca mountain is not a suitable place for long-term storage of our nuclear waste. There are too many unanswered questions about both the geology of the site and integrity of the science done to support the decision to store waste there.
"It's past time to start exploring alternatives to Yucca mountain, because we need to find a safe, secure long-term waste storage solution. As President, I would work with the scientific community to address this problem and come up with alternative solutions."
