    Hillary and I are deeply saddened to learn of the death of Dr. Hector P. Garcia. The founder of the American GI Forum, Dr. Garcia fought for half a century for the civil and educational rights of Mexican-Americans. A national hero and decorated Army veteran, Dr. Garcia became the first Hispanic-American to be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian honor.
Recently, Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi, his hometown, dedicated the Hector P. Garcia Plaza and established the Hector P. Garcia Scholarship Endowment. It is a fitting tribute to a man who fought for the rights of Hispanic-Americans, veterans, and all Americans throughout his life. Hillary and I extend our deepest condolences to his family and to all the Latino community.
