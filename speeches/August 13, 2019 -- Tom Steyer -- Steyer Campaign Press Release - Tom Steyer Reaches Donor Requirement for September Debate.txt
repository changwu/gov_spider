    Just five weeks after announcing his candidacy, Steyer surpasses the DNC donor threshold and is only one qualifying poll away from September debate stage in Houston
(SAN FRANCISCO, August 13, 2019) â€” Today, candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Tom Steyer hit the 130,000 individual donor threshold required to reach the Democratic National Committee September debate stage. Steyer met the donor requirement within just five weeks of entering the race, averaging over 26,000 donors a week.
"Since entering the race five weeks ago, our priority has been getting Tom's message out to the American people," said Campaign Manager Heather Hargreaves. "Tom reaching this milestone just five weeks into his campaign is proof that his message is resonating with people across the country."
As the American people learn more about Tom, support for his campaign has rapidly increased, including gaining over 48,800 donors in the last week alone. The campaign has invested in a strong digital program to reach voters, and the strategy is working.
Steyer is now just one qualifying poll away from making it onto the September DNC debate stage in Houston, TX. In only a few weeks, Steyer has surpassed candidates who have been in the race much longer, in polling from Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. Steyer has been steadily gaining traction in early primary states, as indicated by three qualifying polls in Iowa and South Carolina, the most recent of which, from Monmouth University, had the candidate polling at 3%. Other non-DNC sanctioned polls show Steyer joining the top tier of Democratic contenders. Last week, Morning Consult had Steyer polling at 6% in early states, beating Pete Buttigieg and within striking distance of Kamala Harris. A new Change Research Poll has Steyer at 3% in Nevada, besting Beto O'Rourke.
