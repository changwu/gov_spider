    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Sponsors: Livingston (R), Louisiana; Vucanovich (R), Nevada)
This Statement of Administration Policy expresses the Administration's views on H.R. 1817, the Military Construction appropriations Bill, FY 1996, as reported by the House Appropriations Committee.
The Administration would support the bill as reported by the Committee if it were modified to respond to the concerns discussed below. The Administration appreciates the Committee's support of the request for the base closure and realignment program, the operation and maintenance portion of the family housing program, and requested construction projects. However, the Administration objects to the Committee's adjustments that would:

Provide $647 million in funding for 84 unrequested military and family housing construction projects. This funding is partially offset by reductions to requested projects. The total appropriation is $5OO million more than requested for programs funded in this bill. With the nation facing serious budget constraints, such a spending increase is neither affordable nor militarily necessary.   
Provide only incremental funding for several military construction projects for which full funding was requested. The need to fund completion of these projects in FY 1997 would reduce funding available for other projects, including readiness and quality of life programs supported by the Administration and the Appropriations Committee. 

The Administration urges the Committee to approve the transfer authority requested for Military Construction and Family Housing appropriations. This authority would increase the Department's ability to direct resources to emerging readiness and quality of life requirements.
