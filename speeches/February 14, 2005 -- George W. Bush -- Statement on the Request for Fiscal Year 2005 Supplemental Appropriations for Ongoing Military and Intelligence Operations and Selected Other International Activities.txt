    With the help of the United States and coalition partners, the Iraqi and Afghan people have set their countries on the path of democracy and freedom. As both nations work to cement this great progress, our troops and assistance will continue to play a critical role.
The majority of this request will ensure that our troops continue to get what they need to protect themselves and complete their mission. It also provides for the continued pursuit of Al Qaida and other terrorist elements in Afghanistan and elsewhere. And it reflects our core mission in Iraq and Afghanistan by providing funding to accelerate efforts to train and equip Iraqi and Afghan forces, so they can assume greater responsibility for their own security, and our troops can return home with the honor they have earned.
Other important funding in this emergency request includes resources to seize the opportunity to build peace and democracy in the Middle East, to continue helping nations affected by the tsunamis, and to address other unforeseen needs.
I urge the Congress to move quickly so our troops and diplomats have the tools they need to succeed.
