    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. Derrick (D) South Carolina and 243 others)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1154. The President's senior advisors will recommend disapproval of this bill if it is presented to the President.
While H.R. 1154 is somewhat different from the version of the bill the President vetoed last Congress, it still would hurt consumers, particularly lower income consumers, provoke retaliation against U.S. exports, violate our international obligations, and undermine our efforts to obtain a more open trading system for U.S. exports.
H.R. 1154 is pure protectionism for an industry which already enjoys the highest level of protection of any industry in the United States and for which additional protection is not necessary.
