    TWO WEEKS ago, I announced to the Nation a comprehensive program to strengthen the foreign intelligence agencies of the United States Government. My actions were designed to achieve two basic objectives:
--First to ensure that we have the best possible information on which to base our policies toward other nations;
--And second, to ensure that our foreign intelligence agencies do not infringe on the rights of American citizens.
Today, as an additional part of this effort, I am announcing the expansion of my Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. This Board was set up in 1956 in order to provide independent, nonpartisan advice on the effectiveness of the intelligence community in meeting the intelligence needs of the President. Since 1974, the Board has been composed of 10 members, all of whom are private citizens.
I am announcing today that I am expanding the Board to 17 members, and I am appointing the following members to the Board:
STEPHEN AILES
LESLIE C. ARENDS
ADM. GEORGE W. ANDERSON
WILLIAM O. BAITER WILLIAM J. CASEY
LEO CHERNE
JOHN B. CONNALLY JOHN S. FOSTER, JR. ROBOT W. GALVIN
GORDON GRAY
MELVIN LAIRD
EDWIN H. LAND
GEN. LYMAN L. LEMNITZER CLARE BOOTHE LUCE ROBERT MURPHY
EDWARD TELLER
EDWARD BENNETT WILLIAMS
I am announcing my decision to have Leo Cherne serve as the new Chairman of the Board.
The intelligence needs of the '70's and beyond require the use of highly sophisticated technology. Furthermore, there are new areas of concern which demand our attention. No longer does this country face only military threats. New threats are presented in such areas as economic reprisal and international terrorism. The combined experience and expertise of the members of this Board will be an invaluable resource as we seek solutions to the foreign intelligence problems of today and the future.
In developing the Nation's offensive and defensive strategy to conduct foreign policy and provide for the national security, we must be able to deal with problems covering the broadest spectrum of activities.
By strengthening the Board as I have done today, and by giving the Board my full personal support, I fully anticipate that the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board will continue its indispensable role in advising me on the effectiveness of our foreign intelligence efforts.
