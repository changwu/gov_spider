    Don Evans is one of my most trusted friends and advisers. He has been a valuable member of my economic team. Don has worked to advance economic security and prosperity for all Americans. He has worked steadfastly to make sure America continues to be the best place in the world to do business.
To encourage job creation here at home, Don has worked closely with me to reduce taxes, open markets for American goods and services, and promote a level playing field abroad.
Don shares my belief that the promise of America means our best days lie ahead. Together, we have worked to make that a reality.
I thank Don for his outstanding service to our Nation and wish him and Susie all the best as they return home to Texas.
