    Team Bachmann launches new web ads featuring tour supporters
 Urbandale, Iowa — With less than two weeks until the all-important Iowa caucuses, Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann soars past the halfway mark of her 99 county, 10-day tour across the Hawkeye State.  In the ambitious effort never accomplished by another candidate, Bachmann has met with thousands of Iowans, sharing her message as the consistent conservative in the race. 
"I've met the greatest people across Iowa. I've listened to the issues that concern them most, and I've shared my solutions to put our country back on the track in the right direction, instilling confidence that I'm the candidate that will take their voices to the White House," Bachmann said.  "Many voters don't have the time or resources to make it to larger cities to see the candidates speak, that's why we are coming to them in their hometown, in every county of the state."
