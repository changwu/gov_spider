Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement on the nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick:
"Qualified judicial nominees like Judge Leslie Southwick deserve an up or down vote by the full United States Senate. Instead of playing typical Washington games with nominees, Democrats must act to give Judge Southwick a fair up or down vote. The Senate should not abdicate its responsibilities in favor of partisan loyalties. Politics should not stand in the way of giving a qualified nominee a fair hearing and full Senate vote, just like the Constitution envisions."
