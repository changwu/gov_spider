    Senator Bob Dole today won a landslide victory in the Californian Republican Party Straw Poll. The Presidential candidate won 36 percent of the more than 21,000 ballots cast in the poll, 11 points ahead of his nearest rival.
"We welcome this significant victory in California," said Dole Campaign Manager Scott Reed. "Winning the largest state is crucial to winning the Presidency, and Bob Dole has shown that he can win California. California's diverse economy is battered by the taxes and regulations of President Clinton. They support Dole because he'll rein in big government and return hope and opportunity to the hard- pressed workers and businesses of this great state."
Dole remains an overwhelming favorite among Republican Presidential candidates in every national survey. In a recent Time/CNN poll of potential GOP primary voters, Dole garnered 47 percent of the voters, 30 percentage points ahead of the entire field.
