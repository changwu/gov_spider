    THE AMERICAN spirit reflects contributions from every nation. But the charm of Irish culture has particularly warmed the hearts and hearths of this land.
Common ancestry and genuine fondness for the traditions of the Emerald Isle have long joined the Nixons and the Ryans in heartfelt appreciation of all that is Irish.
On this St. Patrick's Day, Mrs. Nixon and I join with all our fellow Americans of Irish descent--and all those who claim they are--in celebration of one of the happiest observances on our calendar.
