ANN ARBOR, Michigan — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul engaged voters in Detroit's North End at an intimate town hall meeting where he discussed the rule of law and macroeconomic reforms that promise to renew Motor City, Michigan, and the nation.
The 12-term Congressman from Texas held his "Solving Detroit's Crises" Town Hall Meeting at 11:00 a.m. EST at Little Rock Baptist Church, located at 8801 Woodward Avenue, Detroit, MI 48202. More than 300 church congregants and community members attended the event, which was far more intimate than the rallies held around that nation that typically draw more than 1,000 persons. A picture of the "Solving Detroit's Crises" Town Hall Meeting follows.
