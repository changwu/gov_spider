    I am pleased to announce that I have invited the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Bill Burns, to serve as a member of my Cabinet.
As Bill says: "Good intelligence, delivered with honesty and integrity, is America's first line of defense." Since his first day on the job, Bill has demonstrated the meaning behind those words. Working in lockstep with Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, Bill has harnessed intelligence to give our country a critical strategic advantage. Under his leadership, the CIA is delivering a clear-eyed, long-term approach to our Nation's top national security challengesâ€”from tackling Russia's brutal aggression against Ukraine, to managing responsible competition with the People's Republic of China, to addressing the opportunities and risks of emerging technology.
Bill has always given me clear, straightforward analysis that prioritizes the safety and security of the American people, reflecting the integral role the CIA plays in our national security decisionmaking at this critical time.
With quiet courage, deep humility, and extensive expertise, Bill has earned the respect of the brave women and men of the CIA. He leads with dignity and represents the very best of America, and I look forward to continuing to work with him in the years ahead.
