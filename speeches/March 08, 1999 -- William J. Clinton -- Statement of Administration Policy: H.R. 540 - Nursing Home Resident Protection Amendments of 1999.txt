    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Davis (D) FL and 54 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports enactment of H.R. 540, which would prevent nursing homes from transferring or evicting Medicaid residents when the facility chooses to withdraw from participation in the Medicaid program. America's nursing home residents must not live in fear that they will be evicted solely because they rely on Medicaid to pay for their care.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 540 would affect direct spending; therefore it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is that it would increase direct spending by less than $25 million over the next five years.
