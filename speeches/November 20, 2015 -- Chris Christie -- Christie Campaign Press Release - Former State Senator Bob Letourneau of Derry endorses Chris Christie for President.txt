MORRISTOWN, NJ - As Governor Chris Christie heads back to New Hampshire for his 34th and 35th town hall meetings, conservative leader and respected Derry icon Bob Letourneau has announced his endorsement of Chris Christie for President. Letourneau, a former state Senator and former House Assistant Majority Leader, will join Governor Christie at his town hall meeting in Windham on Saturday to personally offer his endorsement.
"Governor Christie has demonstrated that he is the best prepared to provide the strong leadership we need in our next commander-in-chief," said Letourneau. "The times demand a tough and tested leader. As a former U.S. Attorney, Chris Christie worked with the Department of Homeland Security to protect our country from attacks and to prosecute terrorists. We need a President with Governor Christie's clear, decisive and experienced voice to lead the world in this fight against evil."
Letourneau also praised Governor Christie for following the New Hampshire tradition of holding town hall meetings where he outlines his vision for the country's future, answers every question, and works to earn every vote.
"Having seen Governor Christie in town hall meetings, I am impressed by his conservative record of accomplishment in New Jersey and his detailed proposals to rebuild our military strength, grow our economy, and help foster a better environment for businesses to create jobs. Our current president has grown the size of government and eroded our personal liberties- Governor Christie believes in a limited federal government and will protect our liberties."
Letourneau represented Derry, Hampstead, and Windham in the state Senate from 2005 to 2010, where he served as Chairman of the Senate Transportation and Interstate Cooperation Committee. Prior to his election to the Senate, Letourneau served for four terms in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, where he was elected Assistant Majority Leader. Letourneau also served on the state Motorcycle Rider Education Advisory Board and the Governor's Motorcycle Safety Task Force. He is the former Chairman of the New Hampshire Civil War Memorial Commission.
Letourneau will join Christie at Jonathon's Lounge at Park Place Lanes in Windham on Saturday, November 21st at 2:30pm for a community town hall meeting.
