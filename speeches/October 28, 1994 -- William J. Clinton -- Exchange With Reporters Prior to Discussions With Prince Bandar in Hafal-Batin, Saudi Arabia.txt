    King Abdul-Aziz Medal
Q. Your Majesty, would you care to tell us what the decoration was, what its purpose was, Prince Bandar?
Prince Bandar. This is the highest medal in the kingdom, that His Majesty awarded the President for his gratitude for the President of the United States of America and the people of the United States.
The President. You all are holding up well?
Q. No, are you?
Q. What are you going to do with all your medals now? Put them in your library?
The President. No, I'm going to wear them to my press conference and hope that I'll get more respect. [Laughter] I'll just wait until a difficult question arises, and I will put it on and hope it serves as a shield.
