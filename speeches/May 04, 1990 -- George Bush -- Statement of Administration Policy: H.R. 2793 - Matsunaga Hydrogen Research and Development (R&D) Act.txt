    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
FINAL
(House)(Brown (D) California and 8 others)
The Administration supports the general intent of H.R. 2793 which is consistent with existing Department of Energy and NASA programs. The Administration, however, opposes the enactment of H.R. 2793 because the bill would require greatly expanded Federal hydrogen research programs and new demonstration programs. In addition, the bill contains numerous unnecessary, burdensome, and objectionable requirements. For example, H.R. 2793 would require five separate comprehensive multi-year plans, establish two new narrowly-focused advisory groups, and impose "Buy-America" requirements.
The Administration is already conducting preliminary research aimed at improving the economics of hydrogen production and use. The Department of Energy is currently spending approximately $19 million per year on this research, and no additional authorization is necessary. NASA is examining all aspects of hydrogen relevant to the National Aerospace Plane Program, and has already studied the application of hydrogen as fuel for other aircraft. NASA has concluded that the prospects for hydrogen aviation fuels do not justify further research at this time.
The Department of Energy will be addressing hydrogen's potential as a fuel along with other energy technologies in its comprehensive National Energy Strategy. Targeting any particular energy technology for accelerated R&D and demonstrations prior to the completion of the National Energy Strategy this year would be premature and could result in the misapplication of Federal resources.
