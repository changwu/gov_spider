Please check transcript against video:
The president: "Forty-five days ago, many of you joined me in the RoseGarden to launch a new partnership with the private sector todramatically increase and accelerate America's capacity to test forthe coronavirus. We made such strides like you wouldn't even believeit. We just had a call with the governors. And I guess they were justabout all on the call, and everybody was very happy, and the testingis going really well."
"Since then, what we've achieved is really nothing short of amazing, the United States now holds the world record for testing and by a lot. We've conducted more than 5.4 million tests, more than any other country anywhere in the world."
"Today we're releasing our blueprint for state testing plans and rapid response programs, together we're accelerating testing for Americans and retail locations across the country, and especially in our African American and Hispanic communities, we're going very very strong in those communities. There are currently 73 retail sites testing sites in 25 states in those specific areas, and we're increasing it very substantially. A lot of progress has been made for African American testing, Hispanic American testing and Asian American testing. So I look forward to hearing from each of these incredible business people who have worked so strongly with us right from the beginning."
