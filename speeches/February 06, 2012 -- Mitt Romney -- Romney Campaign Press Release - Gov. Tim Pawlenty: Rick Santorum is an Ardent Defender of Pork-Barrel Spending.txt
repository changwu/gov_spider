    Romney for President Campaign Co-Chair, former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty released the following statement today on Rick Santorum's record as an ardent defender of pork-barrel spending:
"Rick Santorum is a nice guy, but he is simply not ready to be President. Plus, he wants Minnesota conservatives to believe he's as conservative as they are, but he's not. As a U.S. Senator, he was a leading earmarker and pork-barrel spender. He described himself as 'very proud' of the billions of dollars in pork-barrel projects he championed, and promised to defend the wasteful spending. Even in the face of crushing federal debt, Rick Santorum voted for the infamous 'Bridge to Nowhere.' That type of leadership will not help us rein in government and slash the unprecedented federal debt."
