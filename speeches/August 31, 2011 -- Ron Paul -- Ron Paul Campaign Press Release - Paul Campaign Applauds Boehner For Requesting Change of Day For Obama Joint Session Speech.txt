    Paul initiated talk of objecting to President's call for a joint session
LAKE JACKSON, Texas — Today, the campaign of 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul released a statement applauding Speaker of the House John Boehner for requesting that President Obama change his plans for a joint session of Congress in order to give a speech laying out his economic plan on the same day as a Republican presidential debate. See comments from Paul campaign spokesman below."Speaker Boehner did the right thing, and we thank him for it," said Ron Paul 2012 Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton. "When this subject initially came up, it was Congressman Paul's campaign who initiated talk of objecting to the President's plan calling a joint session at this time and we are glad to see the Speaker of the House seize the initiative." 
"We needed an economic plan from the President two years ago, but he has waited far too long to assert any sort of true leadership. Instead President Obama has continued to play politics and not deal with the real issues this country faces."
