    Justice Marshall has rendered extraordinary and distinguished service to his country as a pioneering civil rights lawyer, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, as Solicitor General, and in his tenure on the Supreme Court. His career is an inspiring example for all Americans. He grew up under segregation to achieve the highest office to which a lawyer can aspire. His accomplishments on the Bench will long be remembered. We wish him the best in his retirement. I intend to nominate a successor very soon.
