    Memorandum for the Secretary of the Interior 
Subject: African Burial Ground, New York City
The African Burial Ground, located in New York City, is a National Historic Landmark administered by the General Services Administration (GSA). This site includes objects of historic and scientific significance that may be appropriate for Federal protection through designation as a National Monument under the Antiquities Act of 1906 (16 U.S.C. 431).
The GSA's archaeological research has identified over 400 human remains, along with associated artifacts dating back to the 18th century. Further exploration at the discovered site may provide research on the experience of the African population in Colonial New York.
Accordingly, please provide me with an assessment of the historic and scientific significance of the African Burial Ground and whether it may warrant permanent Federal protection through designation as a National Monument.
GEORGE W. BUSH
