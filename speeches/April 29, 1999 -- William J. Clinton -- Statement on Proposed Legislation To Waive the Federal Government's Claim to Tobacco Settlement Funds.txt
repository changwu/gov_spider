    I am disappointed that so few States are devoting tobacco settlement funds to reducing youth smoking, as shown by the new report from the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids and the American Heart Association. This new report underscores why I strongly oppose any legislation waiving the Federal Government's claim to tobacco settlement funds without a commitment from the States to fund youth tobacco prevention efforts. In the absence of such a commitment, States won't have to spend a single penny of the $246 billion tobacco settlement to reduce youth smoking. We must act now: Every day, 3,000 children become regular smokers, and 1,000 will have their lives cut short as a result.
