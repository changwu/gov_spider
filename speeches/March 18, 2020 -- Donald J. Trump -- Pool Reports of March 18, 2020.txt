In-Town Pool Report #1
I made it through the medical tent that guards the northwest gate, past the aide with the thermometer, and onto White House grounds with a temperature of 95.3 degrees. Temps are being taken, as is now protocol. But there were no delays and, while it is quieter and more sparse than usual, plenty of our colleagues are already present.
It is bright outside. It is Wednesday. I am your in-town print pooler.
The coronavirus briefing is set for 11:30AM. It will be live-streamed and on cable. I will do my best to pass along color, if any, that's not already visible on your television screen.
The president does not have any public events on his agenda. He has a phone call with airline executives (10AM), a business roundtable teleconference (10:45AM), a call with physicians (1:30PM), and a briefing with nurses (3:30PM).

In-Town Pool Report #3 / Conway Gaggle
Kellyanne Conway took questions for more than 15 minutes in the driveway from reporters who did their best to keep the gaggle spread out. It was, at times, hard to hear. Overall, she seemed optimistic about legislation making its way through Congress and about White House efforts to combat the coronavirus.
Asked about POTUS referring to coronavirus as "Chinese virus" on Twitter, Conway said "I think what the President is saying is that is where it was first started."
Asked about allegations that a White House staffer had called the coronavirus the "Kung Fu virus," Conway said that the journalist who reported that quote should name the aide--"Why don't we go to the source?" That alleged remark, she added "is highly offensive."
"I'm married to an Asian," she continued, before saying that she wasn't going to engage in hypotheticals when the source was not known. Her own children, she noted, are of Asian descent.
Asked how long the proposed direct payments to adults affected by coronavirus might last, she referred reporters back to Treasury Sec. Mnuchin's remarks from yesterday. She said that the payments "would be means-tested."
Asked about restrictions on travel between the US and Canada, she said calling it a closed border was "charged language." The action was, instead, she said, the result of "a mutual agreement between Canada and the US to stop non-essential travel."
These types of restrictions, she said, should not be thought of as "a punishment to any country."
Asked about POTUS highlighting West Virginia's lack of coronavirus cases, Conway said that "there is an acceleration of testability testing going on in this country." She was careful to note that as more testing begins, as the task force has said, more cases will be discovered.
I can send the audio to any reporter who requests it, after the briefing concludes.

In-Town Pool Report #6A / Quotes from Brief Nurses Event
The president spoke briefly about combatting "the Chinese virus," before going around the room for introductions. He repeated many of his earlier sentiments about national preparedness.
POTUS teased the FDA press conference that he tweeted about earlier today. He said that it "will be very interesting," that it will happen tomorrow, and that "the FDA will be working very very hard, and I appreciate what they're doing."
POTUS also said that "it has been amazing to see the way that countries come together--its tremendous spirit. Even Republicans and Democrats are getting together, for the most part, but they're getting together. So that's a good thing to see."
Vice president Pence made brief remarks as well, telling the assembled healthcare providers that their service in combatting the coronavirus is appreciated and that their safety is "in the forefront of the president's mind."
Shouted questions went unanswered.

White House passes along the following:
Today, President Donald J. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force spoke by telephone with American physicians, and later in person with American nurses, about the response to COVID-19. President Trump thanked them for their tireless work on the front lines. The President reiterated that American medical professionals are the heroes we trust to save lives during this pandemic. The physicians and nurses thanked the President for his decisive action to cut regulation on Medicare telehealth, and for empowering States and the private sector to develop testing, treatments, and vaccines. All participants agreed that no resource should be spared to protect American patients. The Administration is doing everything possible to ensure the full weight of the Federal Government is behind the response to this pandemic, but also underscored that health providers need to work closely with State and local leaders to ensure their needs are met and noresources are spared.
