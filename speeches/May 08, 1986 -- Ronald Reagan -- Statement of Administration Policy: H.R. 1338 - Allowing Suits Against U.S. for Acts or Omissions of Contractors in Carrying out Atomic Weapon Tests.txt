    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Boucher (D) Virginia)
The Administration strongly opposes enactment of H.R. 1338 because it would (1) set a precedent for removing important defenses under the Federal Tort Claims Act which serve overriding governmental and societal interests, (2) result in preferential treatment for a limited class of plaintiffs and, (3) adversely affect implementation of the nation's atomic weapons testing program.
