    The President declared his intention today to nominate Jim Jones, the CEO of the American Stock Exchange and former House Budget Committee chairman, to the position of Ambassador to Mexico.
"A great deal of our economic future," said the President, "is bound up in our relationships in this hemisphere, particularly our relationship with Mexico. That is why I have chosen an Ambassador who is seasoned by years of economic leadership in both the private and public sectors. Jim Jones brings a unique perspective and uncommon talents to the continuing dialog with our Mexican neighbors."
