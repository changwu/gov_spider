    Good morning. As we gather to celebrate Thanksgiving, let us remember to share our blessings and make this holiday season a time for giving to those in need. By helping a neighbor, we serve our Nation, and we serve a cause greater than self-interest. Everyone can do something. And through the USA Freedom Corps, you can find ways to help at a school, a food pantry, or any other organization near you.
Macy's and NBC join me in wishing you a happy Thanksgiving, and we ask you to make this holiday the start of a season of service.
Thank you very much.
