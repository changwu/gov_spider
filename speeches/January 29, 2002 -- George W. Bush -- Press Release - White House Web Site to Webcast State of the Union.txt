    White House Web Site Offers First Live State of the Union Webcast and Historic Look at Annual Address
The first-ever White House webcast of the State of the Union will occur on the White House home page (www.whitehouse.gov) on Tuesday at 9pm.
Visitors to the web site can view the State of the Union live or visit the site later for viewing on demand. Close-captioning of the address and the transcript will be posted as soon as possible following delivery.
In addition to the webcast, the web site features a historic look at the State of the Union -- a message delivered by the President every year since George Washington first delivered it in 1790.
The State of the Union section of the site (www.whitehouse.gov/stateoftheunion) also features State of the Union trivia quizzes (one designed for children and two for adults), photographs of the President preparing for the speech and a letter from the President to children.
Launched in August, 2001, the new White House web site offers many new features such as a site designed for children (www.whitehousekids.gov), a site dedicated to the War on Terrorism (www.whitehouse.gov/response), a Homeland Security page (www.whitehouse.gov/homeland), video webcasts of the President's remarks (with close-captioning for the hearing-impaired), 360 degree photographic tours and frequent updates to the history section of the web site.
