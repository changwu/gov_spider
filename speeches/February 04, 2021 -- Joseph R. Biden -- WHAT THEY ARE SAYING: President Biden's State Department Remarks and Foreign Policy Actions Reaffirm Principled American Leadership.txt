    Today, President Biden delivered remarks at the State Department and took actions to revitalize American leadership rooted in the democratic values that constitute our greatest strength. The Biden-Harris administration is sending a clear message that diplomacy is at the center of our national security strategy, enabling the United States to restore the leadership and alliances needed to face our greatest global challenges from a position of strength.
Here's what they are saying about President Biden's remarks and actions to advance principled American engagement in the world:
Senator Bob Casey: Today, President Biden outlined a vision for U.S. foreign policy that will keep our Nation safe, promote our values and further our interests across the world. His plan will restore America as a global leader. [Tweet, 02/04/21]
Senator Dick Durbin: I applaud President Biden's decision to keep US troops in Germany and to reverse the Trump Administration's support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. We have a lot of damage to undo from the last four years of failed foreign policy and this is a great start. washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/... [Tweet, 02/04/21]
Sen. Chris Murphy: Thank you @POTUS. This makes America safer. Plain and simple. Peace will come more quickly without unconditional U.S. support for the bombing of Yemen, and - just as importantly - we end our complicity in the savage humanitarian nightmare in Yemen. [Tweet, 02/04/21]
Sen. Bernie Sanders: "Today's announcement by President Biden that the United States will end support for offensive operations in the Yemen war, and his naming of a Special Envoy to help resolve this conflict and bring aid and reconstruction to Yemen, are important steps, and a tribute to the work of so many activists over the years." [Tweet, 02/04/21]
Sen. Jeanne Shaheen: The Saudi-led coalition had every chance to take the necessary precautions to protect civilians in Yemen. The U.S. has an obligation to show moral leadership & end operations. I've long pushed to prioritize human rights & democratic values, I'm glad @POTUS is seeing this through. [Tweet, 02/04/21]
Rep. Joaquin Castro: From welcoming refugees and protecting LGBTQ rights to ending support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, @POTUS makes clear that our diplomacy will be centered on our values. For generations, the United States has been a North Star in the world — and we can be that light once more. [Tweet, 02/04/21]
Rep. Judy Chu: I applaud @POTUS for lifting the refugee cap. Refugees are proven to be more law abiding & help grow our economy. The anti-refugee polices of the last administration were built on lies that radicalized his followers. [Tweet, 02/04/21]
Rep. Veronica Escobar: "America is back. Diplomacy is back" Finally, a @POTUS interested in protecting LGBTQ+ rights, rebuilding our relationship with our allies and partners, and ensuring our nation's foreign policy is centered in democratic values and diversity. [Tweet, 02/04/21]
Rep. Ro Khanna: Today marks the beginning of a new era in our foreign policy - one that prioritizes human rights and diplomatic solutions. Even when @SenSanders & I passed our bipartisan War Powers Resolution, Trump still vetoed it. Biden is prioritizing human life over military might. [Tweet, 02/04/21]
Rep. Frank Pallone: .@POTUS and @SecBlinken have committed to championing American leadership & defending American values. We will repair alliances & reengage with the world to collaborate on our shared goals - defeating the virus, addressing climate change & promoting democracy. America is back. [Tweet, 02/04/21]
Rep. Abigail Spanberger: As someone who worked overseas to protect our national security, it's wonderful to again have a Commander in Chief who recognizes how the critical work of our career diplomats and public servants keeps us safe. Looking forward to U.S. global leadership's comeback. [Tweet, 02/04/21]
Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus Chairman David Cicilline: "President Biden just let the world know that America is back. After four years of turning a blind eye to human rights abuses, the United States will once again lead the world towards a kinder, more compassionate future. The United States will hold regimes from every corner of the globe accountable if they violate the basic rights of LGBTQ+ people living under their jurisdiction. This is a good day for our country. The Equality Caucus looks forward to working with President Biden, Secretary of State Blinken, and the entire administration to build on this achievement and continue to advance the rights of LGBTQ+ people here at home and around the world." [Statement, 02/04/21]
CARE: CARE applauds the Biden Administration's decision to raise the refugee admissions cap to 125,000 in fiscal year 2022.

David Miliband, President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee: "President Biden promised that he would reverse failed policies in Yemen and today he has delivered ... The end of US support for offensive operations, alongside the pause in arms sales, and the appointment of a new Envoy, are necessary and welcome." [Statement, 02/04/21]
Liz Schrayer U.S. Global Leadership Coalition President and CEO: The President's decision to make his first visit to a cabinet agency at the State Department sends a clear signal that renewing America's partnerships and engagement with the world is at the heart of our nation's economic and health recovery and the wellbeing of every American family. America's investments in diplomacy and development will help our country "do big things," as the President said today, especially as new variants of COVID-19 reach our shores. Everyone knows that our citizens are not safe as long as this virus is anywhere in the world. Clearly, U.S. diplomacy and American aid are indispensable ingredients for containing the deadly virus and countering its catastrophic impact on hunger and poverty around the world. [Statement, 02/04/21]

We commend the Biden administration for following through on its campaign promise." [Statement, 02/04/21]
Nicholas Burns, Former Undersecretary of State: Such an important message to the career Foreign and Civil Service from President Biden—The work you do matters. Diplomacy matters. @POTUS [Tweet, 02/04/21]
Jennifer Rubin, Washington Post: "Instead of divining what irks or pleases a narcissistic president, allies and foes will be presented with coherent policies framed as defending U.S. interests. "America First" over the past four years was too often "America Alone" or "The Narcissist First." That proved to be an invitation for foes to manipulate the ego of the commander in chief. It often baffled allies, whose futile efforts to inform Biden's predecessor about basic concepts (e.g., how we fund NATO) went nowhere. Now they can expect U.S. policy based on rational analysis." [Column, 02/04/21]
Ellen Nakashima, Washington Post: The President of the United States says: A free press isn't an adversary. A free press is essential to the health of a democracy. [Tweet, 02/04/21]
Max Boot, Washington Post: Biden made clear that Russia isn't the only dictatorship that is no longer going to receive a blank check from Washington: He announced that the United States will no longer support Saudi Arabia's offensive operations in Yemen, which have produced a humanitarian catastrophe.
