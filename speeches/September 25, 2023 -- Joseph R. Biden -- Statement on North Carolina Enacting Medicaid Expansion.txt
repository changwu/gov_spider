    Every American deserves high-quality affordable health care. Period. So I applaud Governor Cooper and the bipartisan elected officials who have made North Carolina the 40th state to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Thanks to their leadership, 600,000 North Carolinians will finally have access to affordable, quality coverage under Medicaid â€“ many for the first time in their lives. The expansion will also benefit rural hospitals across the state and invest in critical mental health resources. I commend Governor Cooper for his years of leadership fighting to get this monumental step forward for North Carolina families done. Every day my Administration works to bring down the cost of health care for all Americans, and I'll continue to urge leaders, especially those in states who have not yet expanded Medicaid, to join our efforts.
