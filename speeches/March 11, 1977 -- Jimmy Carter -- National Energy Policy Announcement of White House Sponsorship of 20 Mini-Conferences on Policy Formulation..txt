    The White House has announced that it will sponsor a series of 20 mini-conferences over the next 2 weeks to gather information on national energy policy by April 20.
The mini-conferences are part of a broad effort to give all segments of the public a voice in the making of that policy. The White House last week announced a mailing seeking the opinions of 450,000 Americans, and the Federal Energy Administration will hold a series of citizen town hall meetings in 10 cities beginning March 14.
The mini-conferences will take place in Washington and will be conducted by the staff of the White House Energy Policy and Planning Office.
Each session will last 3 hours and will concentrate on airing the opinions of one segment of the public.
The series begins Monday, March 14, with a morning mini-conference with consumer group representatives and an afternoon meeting with auto industry officials. It concludes March 25.
Included in the series will be mini-conferences with union leaders; builders, architects and planners; various energy producers; public and privately owned utilities; agricultural interests; State and local officials; low-income representatives; environmentalists; and others.
The meetings will be open to the press.
