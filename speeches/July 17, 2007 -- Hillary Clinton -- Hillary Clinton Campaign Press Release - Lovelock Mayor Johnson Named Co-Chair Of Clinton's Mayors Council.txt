    Lovelock Mayor Lena Johnson today was named a national co-chair of Hillary Clinton's newly-formed Mayors Council, made up of more than 100 current and former mayors from across the country who will advise the campaign on policy and outreach.
The council represents a broad cross-section of America, including urban, rural and suburban cities and towns that reflect the nation's diversity.
"I am demonstrating my support for Senator Clinton's presidential bid by serving on the National Mayors Council," said Mayor Johnson, who will serve as one of 11 council co-chairs. "I am a firm believer that Senator Clinton's experience, intelligence and compassion will serve as galvanizing forces to change course and lead our country in the right direction. As president, Senator Clinton will fight to ensure that Americans living in rural communities like Lovelock, have equal access to affordable healthcare, good education and other programs to make the United States and its citizens the strongest they can be."
"I am honored that Mayor Johnson will play an important role in our Nevada and national campaigns," Clinton said. "With her help, we can bring our message of change across the Silver State and the nation."
Johnson has served as mayor for four years, and prior to that was a city councilwoman. As an elected official, Johnson has been instrumental in restoring the historical depot, adding new welcome signs to Lovelock's borders and revitalizing the town's skate park.
