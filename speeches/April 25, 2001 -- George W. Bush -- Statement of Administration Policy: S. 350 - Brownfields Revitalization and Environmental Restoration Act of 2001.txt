    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Chafee (R) RI and 49 cosponsors)
The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 350, which would authorize appropriations to assess and clean up certain abandoned industrial sites, known as "brownfields", and provide protection from liability for certain landowners. By removing barriers to brownfield cleanup and redevelopment, S. 350 would allow communities to reduce environmental and health risks, capitalize on existing infrastructure, attract new businesses and jobs, and improve their tax base. As the legislative process moves forward, the Administration will work with Congress to make any refinements necessary to ensure that the final brownfield cleanup legislation is consistent with the Administration's principles and budget.
