    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with Section 109 of Public Law 98-373, the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984, I transmit herewith the United States Arctic Research Plan. It is submitted on behalf of the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee, which is chaired by the National Science Foundation. The Plan was developed in consultation with the Arctic Research Commission, the Governor of the State of Alaska, residents of the Arctic, the private sector, and public interest groups. It is a comprehensive statement of national needs and priorities in the areas of national security, rational resource development, and acquisition of new scientific knowledge in the Arctic. As noted in the report, the Plan is intended to serve as a guide to the Federal agencies as they plan and perform their Arctic programs and missions; it is not intended to be a commitment by the Administration.
