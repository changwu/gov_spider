    I was deeply grieved to learn of the death of His Majesty King Khalid of Saudi Arabia, who ruled his country with honor, dignity, and wisdom, and whose goodness and understanding commanded the respect of all. I extend my personal condolences and sympathy, as well as those of the American people, to His Majesty King Fahd, the Royal Family, and the people of Saudi Arabia, a country with which we have enjoyed more than a half-century of warm, constructive, and mutually beneficial relations.
