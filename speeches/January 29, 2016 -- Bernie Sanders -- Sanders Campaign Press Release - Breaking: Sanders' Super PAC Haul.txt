    DAVENPORT, Iowa â€“ Bernie Sanders raised no money last year for a super PAC, his campaign announced on Friday.
He won't raise any money for a super PAC this year either, a spokesman added.
"Bernie doesn't want billionaires' money. He doesn't have a super PAC. He believes you can't fix a rigged economy by taking part in the corrupt campaign finance system in which politicians take unlimited sums of money from Wall Street and other powerful special interests and then pretend it doesn't influence them," said spokesman Michael Briggs.
Sanders instead has made American political history by running a presidential campaign supported by just short of 3 million donations from more than 1 million individuals averaging about $27 apiece.
The announcement by Sanders' campaign that he raised no money for a super PAC came as reports began to emerge on the colossal cash hordes amassed by other candidate's super PACs.
A committee backing Hillary Clinton, for example, claimed to have nearly $45 million cash in the bank. It boasted on Friday that it raised more than $25 million during the last half of last year plus another $10 million this month alone. That big haul would give Priorities USA Action a bigger war chest than any Democratic super PAC ever before.
