· Giuliani Faced Fiscal Crisis When He Took Office In 1994. "Of all the problems Giuliani will face, none will loom larger – or sooner – than the question of what to do about the city's finances. Under a tough law passed after the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970s, he will be required to explain in January how he plans to close the gap in the current year's budget, estimated at about $ 400 million. Soon after, he will be required to come up with the outline of his budget for the fiscal year starting next summer, which currently contains a projected $1.5-billion deficit." (Karen Rothmyer, "Giuliani Seen As Good For Business," Newsday, 11/4/93)
In 1997, There Was A Terrorist Plot To Bomb New York Subway Station And Commuter Bus. "Two men with Jordanian passports were arrested yesterday morning in a Brooklyn apartment, where police officers found components of one or more pipe bombs — evidence of what the authorities say was a terrorist plot to detonate bombs in the busy Atlantic Avenue subway station and on a commuter bus. The two suspects were shot after a team of New York City police officers, acting on a tip from a man who lived with the two, burst into the Park Slope apartment an hour before dawn." (Dan Barry, "Bombs In Brooklyn: The Overview," The New York Times, 8/1/97)
Giuliani Served As U.S. Attorney For The Southern District Of New York From 1983-1989. "U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, who successfully prosecuted stock traders, corrupt politicians and the Mafia, announced his resignation Tuesday … Giuliani – who served as associate attorney general in the Justice Department before becoming U.S. attorney in 1983 …" (Vera Haller, "Famous Prosecutor Steps Down, Leaves Political Door Open," The Associated Press, 1/11/89)

New York City Had A Drug Crisis. Right after coming into office, Giuliani announced a Federal 'sweep' to rid Manhattan's Lower East Side streets of small-time drug dealers. Most Federal prosecutors believe their limited resources for drug enforcement should be concentrated on international cases. They leave the $40 'busts' to local authorities. Not Giuliani. He said his office could do both." (Michael Winerip, "High-Profile Prosecutor," The New York Times, 6/9/85)
New York City Had Corrupt Politicians Undermining Public Trust. Frontline's Mark Obenhaus: "The revelation that officials as powerful as Donald Manes and Stanley Freidman were corrupt has shaken public confidence in New York City government. The scandal has spawned a wrath of other investigations. During 1986 and 1987, the Commissioners of Hospitals, Taxis, Transportation, Cultural Affairs, Business Development, two members of the City Planning Commission, a borough president and a United States Congressman all resigned or were under indictment."

("President Hit In Chest," St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 3/30/81; Office of the Associate Attorney General, "Hinckley Sequence Of Events," U.S. Department of Justice)
Narcotics Trafficking Was Prevalent When Giuliani Became Associate Attorney General. "At the Justice Department, Mr. Giuliani has been highly visible, particularly as one of the chief strategists of the Reagan Administration's stepped-up effort to combat narcotics trafficking. He was instrumental in devising the Reagan budget request of $130 million granted by Congress last year to finance 12 new investigative drug task forces across the nation." (Jane Perlez, "Giuliani Willing To Accept U.S. Attorney Job In State," The New York Times, 3/10/83)
There Were Over 1.1 Million Violent Crimes Reported In The United States When Reagan Appointed Giuliani To Justice Department Position. "The federal government brings 35,000 criminal cases a year, the majority for property rather than violent crimes. In 1979, the last full year for which the FBI has figures, there were 1,178,540 violent crimes reported to police in the United States. The overwhelming majority of these violent crimes of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault did not violate federal law. In addition, the federal government has reliable evidence that for each violent crime reported to the police in the United States, two others go unreported." (Michael J. Sniffen, "Top Justice Official Says Rehabilitation Key To Reducing Violent Crime," The Associated Press, 8/19/81)

New York Was Known As Welfare Capital Of The World. "At least a few New Yorkers have long despaired of making non-New Yorkers grasp the gargantuan perversity of the city's welfare system. Help has arrived. 'Hands to Work,' by Columbia journalism Prof. LynNell Hancock, purports to be an expose of welfare reform under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. It is far more profitably read as a breathtaking tour of the mindset — supplied by the author and by those she writes about — that for decades made New York the welfare capital of the world." (Heather MacDonald, Op-Ed, "When Bad Habits Met A Mayor Who Wouldn't Put Up With Them," The Wall Street Journal, 1/23/02)

Giuliani Turned Welfare Into Workfare
Newt Gingrich Called Giuliani An "Absolute Revolutionary" On Welfare Reform. "[O]ur moral critique — if anything, I feel, in retrospect, I was not bold enough in Washington, DC. Our moral critique of the welfare state is going to accelerate, and the place it's happening is at the state and local governments. I mean, Giuliani, in his real reform of welfare, is in fact, behaving as an absolute revolutionary." (Newt Gingrich, Remarks At Progress And Freedom Foundation Conference, Washington, DC, 1/22/96)
While Washington Was Held Back By Endless Discussion, Giuliani "Raced Ahead" To Create Nation's Most Successful Welfare-To-Work Program. "The Giuliani administration, which created the nation's largest and most successful workfare program among single adults in the Home Relief program, is now extending the work requirement to recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children i.e., single mothers. The program continues the city's ambitious efforts at reform, one based on action. While Washington and Albany talk endlessly … Mayor Giuliani has raced ahead by going back to basics: work."

"That is precisely why Mayor Giuliani said the city wants to commit to 40-block swaths of the Morrisania and Bed-Stuy neighborhoods, pushing out drug dealers while adding even more housing units to the area. The new program also will work with landlords to help them repair their properties. 'When drugs are the problem, a stable, thriving community is the solution,' Giuliani said. … Looking out at an audience that included neighborhood leaders and dozens of pre-schoolers, Giuliani noted, 'We're all in this together, and to the extent that we can reduce the influence of drugs and remove it, we give each one of these children a much greater chance of having a successful life.'" (Frank Lombardi And Bob Kappstatter, "Iniative Aids Nabe's Comeback," Daily News, 8/31/98)
Giuliani Worked To Move Sex Shops From Areas And Neighborhoods Where People Were Living With Their Children. "Appearing before an adult video store in Queens, where new shops have met vociferous protests for more than a year, Mr. Giuliani said the city needed 'reasonable regulations' to halt the spread of 'sex shops' in places where New Yorkers and their children live. The stores 'have deteriorated the quality of life in the city,' said Mr. Giuliani, who made 'quality of life' a mantra of his two campaigns. 'They hurt the economy of the city. They cost us jobs. They cost us money.'" (Steve Lee Myers, "Giuliani Proposes Toughening Laws On X-Rated Shops," The New York Times, 9/11/94)

'Keeping children safe is a huge responsibility,' Mayor Giuliani said. 'The Administration for Children's Services works hard every day to protect the children of New York City. And we're very grateful to the United Way for their help in this vital effort. The Kinderprint Child Identification Kit helps parents to protect their children in the case of an emergency. And it helps the police reunite missing children with relieved and joyous parents.'"

His Words Were Full Of Grief And Iron, Inspiring New York To Inspire The Nation." (Eric Pooley, "Mayor Of The World," Time, 12/31/01)
Pooley Said Mayor Giuliani Took On "Half A Dozen Critical Roles" And Performed Each One "Masterfully." "When the day of infamy came, Giuliani seized it as if he had been waiting for it all his life, taking on half a dozen critical roles and performing each masterfully. Improvising on the fly, he became America's homeland-security boss, giving calm, informative briefings about the attacks and the extraordinary response."

San Francisco Chronicle Described Giuliani In The Wake Of 9/11 As "Calm, Soothing, And Omnipresent." "Calm, soothing and omnipresent, [Giuliani] gracefully embodies his city's power to endure.

He became a stand-in leader for every corner of America dazed by the terrorist attacks." (Editorial, "Rudy To The Rescue," San Francisco Chronicle, 9/23/01)
Chicago Tribune Called Giuliani's Leadership In The Immediate Aftermath Of The Attack "Inspiring." "Giuliani deserves all the praise and then some. His instant leadership reflex immediately after the crisis--in an age when some politicians are afraid to come out on the street or in front of a microphone without professional prepping or prompting--was inspiring. He was able to bark orders one moment, console victims the next, empathize publicly to the point of sobbing in front of the television cameras, and preach optimism, all the while reassuring New Yorkers that everything was under control. Or at least as much under control as humanly possible." (Editorial, "Rudy, New York's Rock," Chicago Tribune, 9/24/01)
Washington Times Said That Giuliani Set A "Modern Benchmark for Leadership." "If it could be said that New York got any kind of a break on September 11, it came from the fact that Rudy Giuliani was mayor.

Daily News Called Giuliani "Our Tower" And "The Leader We Needed In Our Terrible Hour." "If ever a man had his destiny, Sept. 11 was Giuliani's. The twin towers lay in ruins, the mayor who had returned an "ungovernable" city to its rightful place as capital of the world had nearly perished. Yet here he was, our tower – solid, steady, the leader we needed in our terrible hour. Thank you, Rudy. We will never forget." (Editorial, "The Mayor's Finest Hour," Daily News, 12/27/01)
