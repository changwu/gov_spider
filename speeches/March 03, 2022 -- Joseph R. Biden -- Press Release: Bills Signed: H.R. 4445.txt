    On Thursday, March 3, 2022, the President signed into law:
H.R. 4445, the "Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021," which invalidates predispute arbitration agreements that preclude a party from filing a lawsuit in court involving sexual assault or sexual harassment, at the election of the party alleging such conduct.
