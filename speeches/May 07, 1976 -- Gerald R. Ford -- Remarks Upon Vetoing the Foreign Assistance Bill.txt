    I am returning herewith, without my approval, S. 2662, which authorizes foreign aid for the fiscal year, because the bill would seriously obstruct the exercise of the President's constitutional responsibilities for the conduct of foreign affairs.
In addition to raising fundamental constitutional problems, this bill includes a number of unwise restrictions that would seriously inhibit my ability to implement a coherent and consistent foreign policy. While I encourage increased congressional involvement in the formulation of foreign policy, the pattern of unprecedented restrictions contained in this bill requires that I reject such congressional encroachment on the executive branch's constitutional authority to implement that policy.
