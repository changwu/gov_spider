In Colombia, art therapy is an established practice with an association of Colombian art therapists in the country. In Argentina and Chile, there are schools to train art therapists and well-established art therapy programs. In Panama, art therapy is an emerging profession.
"I look forward to the opportunity to highlight art therapy and bring more awareness of the profession's existence and benefits to the countries in Central and South America," said Karen Pence. "Each time I visit with art therapists and observe their sessions, I walk away with new information and insight into the benefits of the unique treatment. Through the stories shared, it's evident that art therapy makes a difference."

About Art Therapy
According to the American Art Therapy Association, art therapy is a mental health profession that uses the creative process of art making to improve and enhance the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of individuals of all ages. Art therapists use art media, the creative process, and the resulting artwork to explore a person's feelings, reconcile emotional conflicts, foster self-awareness, manage behavior and addictions, develop social skills, improve reality orientation, reduce anxiety, and increase self-esteem.
