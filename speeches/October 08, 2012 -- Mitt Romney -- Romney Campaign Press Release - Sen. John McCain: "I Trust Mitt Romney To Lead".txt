    Arizona Senator John McCain today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's foreign policy speech:
"I trust Mitt Romney to do what's right for our national security and the success of our values in the world.  I trust him to stand by our friends and allies and prevent our enemies from threatening the peace we seek.  And I trust him to make the necessary, prudent investments in our military to ensure that America in this century, just as in the last century, is able to defend our nation, support our friends and allies, defeat our enemies, and remain the greatest hope for peace and freedom the world has ever known.  I trust Mitt Romney to lead.  That is what America needs now in our next president."
