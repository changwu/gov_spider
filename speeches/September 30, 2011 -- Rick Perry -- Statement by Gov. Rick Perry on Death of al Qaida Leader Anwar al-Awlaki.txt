    ATLANTA — Texas Gov. Rick Perry today made the following statement regarding the death of al Qaida leader Anwar al-Awlaki:
I want to congratulate the United States military and intelligence communities — and President Obama for sticking with the government's longstanding and aggressive anti-terror policies — for getting another key international terrorist.
The death of American-raised al Qaida leader Anwar al-Awlaki is an important victory in the war on terror.
Ten years after 9/11 the brave men and women of our military and intelligence services continue to take the fight to the enemy.
Al-Awlaki was the next generation of al Qaida who spread his message of violence and hate over the Internet. His death will be a serious setback for their organization.
Al-Awlaki was instrumental in the radicalization of Major Nidal Hasan, the Fort Hood shooter, as well as other domestic terror plots. We must remain vigilant, and make sure we bring every resource and tool to bear in the fight to keep Americans safe.
