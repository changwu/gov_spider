    COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are on the rise in communities across North Carolina, including Cumberland County, and more than 4,200 North Carolinians have died of the virus since the pandemic started. Yet, President Trump still refuses to level with North Carolinians about the dangers of COVID-19 and ignores the worsening health and economic conditions in the state — leaving struggling families, schools, and small business owners to fend for themselves.
North Carolinians deserve a President who understands the sacrifice North Carolinians have made during the pandemic. As President, I will tackle this pandemic and build our economy back better.
