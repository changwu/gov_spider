Advancing the rights of women and girls has been a central cause of Hillary Clinton's life—and she'll continue that fight as president.
Here's a look back at nine ways Hillary Clinton has changed the world for women and girls.
1. Leading the U.S. delegation to the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, then-First Lady Hillary Clinton proudly declared that "women's rights are human rights." She called out human rights abuses by the Chinese government against women and girls, helped to cast a global spotlight on gender-based violence, and issued a call to action heard around the world.
2. As first lady, she worked to increase funding for child care, and she fought for family leave for new parents and families caring for a sick loved one.
3. As senator from New York, she and Senator Patty Murray of Washington waged a fight to protect women's health and make emergency contraception available over the counter.
4. She championed the Paycheck Fairness Act and co-sponsored the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to help ensure equal pay for women's work.

5. And she proposed national paid sick leave as well as paid parental leave to all federal employees.

6. As secretary of state, she championed programs to advance women's economic participation, address gender-based violence, and elevate the status of women and girls around the world.
7. She created the role of ambassador-at-large for global women's issues to ensure women's rights would be a core priority of U.S. foreign policy.
8. She spearheaded a U.N. resolution to fight against sexual assault in conflict zones. 
9. Along with advancing gender equality abroad, she championed the needs of women and families within the State Department by instituting family-friendly work policies.
Hillary has been fighting for women and girls her entire career—and she's just getting started.
