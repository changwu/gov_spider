Just like I was right on Ventilators (our Country is now the "King of Ventilators", other countries are calling asking for help-we will!), I am right on testing. Governors must be able to step up and get the job done. We will be with you ALL THE WAY!Retweets: 33356Favorites: 189900

Nervous Nancy is an inherently "dumb" person. She wasted all of her time on the Impeachment Hoax. She will be overthrown, either by inside or out, just like her last time as "Speaker". Wallace & @FoxNews are on a bad path, watch! https://t.co/nkEj5YeRjbRetweets: 26036Favorites: 91318

.@FoxNews "Dems say President Trump is trying to open the United States Economy too quickly", but, if I took even a little more time, they would loudly chant that I am moving too slowly. Just political talking points for them. For me it's about lives & the future of our Country!Retweets: 37913Favorites: 176940
