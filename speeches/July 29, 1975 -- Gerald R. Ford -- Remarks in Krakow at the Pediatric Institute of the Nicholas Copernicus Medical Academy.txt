    Your Honor, the members of the faculty, the members of the staff, and those that are being cared/or here, and the young people that we all have a very great interest in:
May I thank you for your very warm welcome and the honors that you have given me on this occasion. I accept the warm welcome and the honors, not only for myself but on behalf of the American people. It is the American people, their Congress, their President, who have great dedication to the children's clinic, which is 600 years old when we are only 200 years old.
It is the feeling of the American people that if we can contribute our skill and our experience and our funds to help improve the health and the future of young people, that it is the best expression we can make as an illustration of the close friendship between the Polish people and the American people.
Young people are the prized possession of all people. We love young Polish people, as I am sure you love young American people.
I thank you for the opportunity of being here and the honors that you have given me and my people.
[The President spoke at 10:47 a.m. Following a tour of the Institute, he made the following remarks at 11:02 a.m, before departing:]
Let me thank all of you for the very warm welcome and the opportunity to see the wonderful work that you are doing for children. It makes me feel very good, as an American, that we have made a contribution to this wonderful facility, and I will report to my fellow Americans that they have made a valuable contribution to the good health and the improvement of Polish children.
May I say that this kind of exchange in science and health is the best way to make sure and certain of a greater and greater friendship between the Polish and the American people.
Thank you very much.
