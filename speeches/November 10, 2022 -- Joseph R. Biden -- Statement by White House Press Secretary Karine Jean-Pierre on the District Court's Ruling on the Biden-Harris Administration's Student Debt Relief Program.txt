    We strongly disagree with the District Court's ruling on our student debt relief program and the Department of Justice has filed an appeal.
The President and this Administration are determined to help working and middle-class Americans get back on their feet, while our opponents – backed by extreme Republican special interests – sued to block millions of Americans from getting much-needed relief.
For the 26 million borrowers who have already given the Department of Education the necessary information to be considered for debt relief - 16 million of whom have already been approved for relief – the Department will hold onto their information so it can quickly process their relief once we prevail in court.
We will never stop fighting for hardworking Americans most in need – no matter how many roadblocks our opponents and special interests try to put in our way.
