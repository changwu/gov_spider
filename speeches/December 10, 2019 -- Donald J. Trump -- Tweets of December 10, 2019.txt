'You have to look at the 17 instances of misconduct cited in the Report they are very bad. The FISA Court was clearly taken for a ride on this a failure of the FBI up and fown the chain of command. It's about as strong a medicine as I've seen in a report of this kind...Retweets: 19559Favorites: 71045

....in a very long time. The FBI has had some dark day in its past but nothing like this. This was VERY SERIOUS MISCONDUCT ON THE PART OF THE FBI.' @brithume @BretBaier Are you listening Comey McCabe lovers Lisa & Peter the beautiful Ohr family Brennan Clapper & many more?Retweets: 14913Favorites: 50448

I don't know what report current Director of the FBI Christopher Wray was reading but it sure wasn't the one given to me. With that kind of attitude he will never be able to fix the FBI which is badly broken despite having some of the greatest men & women working there!Retweets: 33605Favorites: 130591

To Impeach a President who has proven through results including producing perhaps the strongest economy in our country's history to have one of the most successful presidencies ever and most importantly who has done NOTHING wrong is sheer Political Madness! #2020ElectionRetweets: 28255Favorites: 110275

America's great USMCA Trade Bill is looking good. It will be the best and most important trade deal ever made by the USA. Good for everybody - Farmers Manufacturers Energy Unions - tremendous support. Importantly we will finally end our Country's worst Trade Deal NAFTA!Retweets: 21002Favorites: 86074

Nadler just said that I 'pressured Ukraine to interfere in our 2020 Election.' Ridiculous and he knows that is not true. Both the President & Foreign Minister of Ukraine said many times that there 'WAS NO PRESSURE.' Nadler and the Dems know this but refuse to acknowledge!Retweets: 21946Favorites: 84143

Shifty Schiff a totally corrupt politician made up a horrible and fraudulent statement read it to Congress and said those words came from me. He got caught was very embarrassed yet nothing happened to him for committing this fraud. He'll eventually have to answer for this!Retweets: 35246Favorites: 141736
