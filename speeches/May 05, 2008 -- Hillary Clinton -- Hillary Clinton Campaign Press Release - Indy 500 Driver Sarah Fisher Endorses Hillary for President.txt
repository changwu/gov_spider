    INDIANAPOLIS, IN - Hoosiers for Hillary today announced the endorsement of groundbreaking IndyCar Series driver and team owner Sarah Fisher.
"We need a president who will stand up for us and be a fighter for Hoosiers and all Americans," said Fisher, who will qualify for her seventh Indianapolis 500 this month. "Hillary will be a president who steers our country in the right direction and puts our economy back on track. Something Hillary and I have in common is our commitment to achieving our goals, leaving roadblocks behind and refusing to be knocked down. Hillary is a doer and a fighter who keeps getting out there, going for the checkered flag."
"I'm honored to have Sarah's support. Not only has she broken down barriers in her sport, but she continues to be a role model for young people aspiring to realize their dreams," Clinton said. "Trailblazers like Sarah prove that with hard work and determination, anything is possible in our country."
Fisher, 27, of Indianapolis, has competed in six Indianapolis 500s. She is the first woman to earn a pole position at an IndyCar Series event. Fisher is also the youngest woman ever to compete in the Indianapolis 500 at age 19 and the fastest female to qualify for the world's greatest race, with a four-lap average of 229.439 mph in 2003. She is the first female owner/driver of an IndyCar Series team and will compete in the 92nd Indianapolis 500 on May 25.
