    I commend the House and Senate for passing a foreign operations bill today that supports our efforts to promote peace and stability around the world, in turn helping to make our Nation more safe and secure.
I am particularly pleased that this legislation funds our landmark initiative to provide debt relief to the poorest of the world's nations. Our commitment to debt relief gives these poorest countries a critical opportunity to combine reform with funds to reduce poverty and provide basic health care and education for their people. I applaud the efforts of all those across the political spectrum who joined forces to secure this vital funding.
I also am pleased that this legislation increases funding to fight HIV/AIDS. In nations around the world, HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of death and is undermining decades of effort to reduce mortality, improve health, expand educational opportunities, and lift people out of poverty.
This legislation also helps strengthen our efforts to support democracy and stability in southeastern Europe, the Newly Independent States, and other key regions. It includes additional resources to combat terrorism and nuclear proliferation. It also provides increases for our Peace Corps volunteers around the world and for the Export-Import Bank, which supports the export of American products overseas.
Finally, I am pleased that this legislation commits additional critical funding for international family planning organizations and lifts the restrictions hampering their work that I have strongly opposed in the past.
