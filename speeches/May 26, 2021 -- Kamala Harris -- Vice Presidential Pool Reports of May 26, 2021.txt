VP pool 3
Pool was ushered into VP's ceremonial office at 4 pm. She spoke for about two minutes before pool was taken back out.
Harris on the meeting:
"We truly believe that, as it relates to infrastructure as a general matter and broadband as the subject of today's conversation, frankly the subject is not only bipartisan but the way Americans experience it is nonpartisan."
She said she expected the meeting would be a "candid and honest exchange of ideas and perspectives."

VP Pool 4 -- San Jose comments
VP Harris responded to a shouted question from the pool about the San Jose shooting.
"It's absolutely tragic."
She noted she has family that lives in San Jose, without elaborating.
"My prayers and thoughts are with all of those families affected."
And with that, my pooler duties have come to an end.
Have a good afternoon, all!
