    As a former Governor, I know how important it is for the American people that the Federal Government and State and local governments work together as partners. The Executive order on federalism I signed will strengthen our partnership with State and local governments and ensure that executive branch agencies are able to do their work on behalf of the American people. I want to thank the representatives of State and local governments who worked with my administration in developing an Executive order that enables us to better serve all of the American people.
