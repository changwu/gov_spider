My dear President Hibben:
I have heard with interest of the proposal to establish at Princeton a School of Public and International Affairs. I congratulate the University upon this further evidence of its ambition to share in the training of men for intelligent citizenship and interest and participation in public affairs.
The need for good men in Government does not grow less and in the hands of inspiring teachers the work of this school should leave a lasting impression upon the lives of promising young men at the critical time when they are engaged in shaping their future careers. Even though many may not actually enter public life, it would be strange if they did not benefit from a thorough understanding of the problems of government and of our relation to other peoples.
We have a right to look to our universities for the training of leadership and I sincerely hope that the School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton, reared as it is upon the historic background of a University which has played a vital part in the Nation's service, will fulfill the high hopes of its founders and make a definite contribution to the public life of the Nation.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
