    The President today announced his intention to nominate Fred L. Hartley, of California, for the rank of Ambassador during the tenure of his service as Commissioner General of the United States Exhibition for the International Exposition, Vancouver, BC, Canada, 1986.

Mr. Hartley was appointed earlier this year as Commissioner General of the United States Exhibition for the International Exposition in Vancouver by Director Wick of the United States Information Agency.
Mr. Hartley received his bachelor of applied science in chemical engineering at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver in 1939. He is married to the former Margaret Alice Murphy, and they have two children. He was born January 16, 1917, in Vancouver, BC, Canada.
