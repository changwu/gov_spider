    At a time when continued U.S. leadership in addressing humanitarian crises around the globe is a matter of the greatest urgency, it is critically important that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) be led by an Administrator of the best possible qualifications. That is why we are so pleased that Senators of both parties came together today to confirm Gayle Smith as Administrator of USAID. In Gayle, the dedicated professionals at USAID gain a humanitarian and a leader of the highest caliber, with a track record of success to lead them as they continue their crucial work. Whether through her longstanding commitment to shaping global development policy, to her leadership in promoting food security and improving global health, to her work on the Administration's Power Africa initiative and the Ebola response, Gayle has already transformed the lives of many of the world's most vulnerable. As the Administrator of USAID, I am certain Gayle will build on her remarkable record to tackle global challenges and move us closer to a world where all people can reach their full potential.
