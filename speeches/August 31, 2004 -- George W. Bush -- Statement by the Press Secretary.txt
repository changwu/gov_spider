    The United States condemns in the strongest terms the recent terrorist attacks in Russia: the downing of two airliners on August 24 and the suicide bombing near a metro station in Moscow on August 31. The American people grieve for the victims of these horrible attacks and extend condolences to their families. No cause ever justifies terrorism.
As we approach the third anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States, these attacks in Russia remind us of the common cause we share with Russia, and our other friends and allies, in combating this scourge and bringing the terrorists themselves to justice. These attacks will only strengthen the U.S.-Russian partnership in the war on terror.
