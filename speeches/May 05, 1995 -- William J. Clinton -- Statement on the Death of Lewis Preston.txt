    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn today of the death of Lewis Preston.
As President, Lewis Preston brought strong management to the World Bank. During a time of monumental change in the international arena, including the entry of the former Soviet Union into the free market and the emergence of a democratic South Africa, Lewis Preston provided steady leadership and helped to make the World Bank a more open and effective institution.
Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends.
