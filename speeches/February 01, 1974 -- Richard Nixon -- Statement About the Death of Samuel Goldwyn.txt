    SAMUEL GOLDWYN was one of the finest examples of what an energetic and talented individual can do in America. He came to our shores from the Warsaw Ghetto and early grasped the potential of the moving picture. Assembling gifted writers, performers, and directors, he made more than 70 movies which transported movie viewers to faraway, romantic places and gave them fresh and insightful glimpses within their world. Truly it can be said that he helped to elevate moving pictures from the level of nickelodeon melodrama to enduring art.
Mrs. Nixon and I extend our heartfelt sympathy to his family.
