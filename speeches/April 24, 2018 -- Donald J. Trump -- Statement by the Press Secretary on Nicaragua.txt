    The repugnant political violence by police and pro-government thugs against the people of Nicaragua, particularly university students, has shocked the democratic international community. As a Nation that supports free speech as a human and civil right, the United States condemns the violence and repression propagated by the Government of Nicaragua and any closing of media. The Administration joins the international community in calls for broad-based dialogue and support for the people of Nicaragua, who yearn for the political freedom of expression and true democratic reforms they so richly deserve.
