    The President spoke by phone with President Park Geun-hye of the Republic of Korea last night to discuss North Korea's recent launch using ballistic missile technology. The two leaders condemned the launch, and they agreed that it represents yet another destabilizing and provocative action by North Korea in flagrant violation of numerous United Nations Security Council resolutions. The President assured President Park that the United States stands in solidarity with the ROK and will take the necessary steps to fulfill our ironclad commitment to defend the ROK and our other allies in the region. The two leaders underscored the importance of a strong and united international response to North Korea's provocations, including through a robust UN Security Council Resolution.
