    I am saddened by the news of the earthquake centered in Iran this morning. I extend my condolences and those of the American people to the families of the many victims in the cities and villages affected by this tragic event. Human suffering knows no political boundaries: We stand ready to assist the people of Iran as needed and as desired.
