State Chairman J.C.

Newt echoed that sentiment praising the group "for their commitment to the cause of conservativism.  We need bold solutions and strong leadership to lower the price of gasoline to $2.50 per gallon, create jobs and defend America. I am honored that these leaders have joined in the fight."
