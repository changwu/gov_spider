Sanders' campaign renewed its request for the national party to schedule the additional debates in March, April and May. The debates must involve all three candidates and must not be held on Fridays, Saturdays or holiday weekends. Sanders looks forward to participating in a Feb. 4 debate in New Hampshire if Secretary Clinton and former Gov. Martin O'Malley agree beforehand to the three post-New Hampshire debates.
"The proposal is simple and straightforward. Bernie Sanders wants more debates. We hope the Clinton campaign does too. We urge the DNC to work with all three campaigns to set a schedule for debates that will help Democrats make an informed choice about who their presidential nominee should be," said Michael Briggs, Sanders' spokesman.
