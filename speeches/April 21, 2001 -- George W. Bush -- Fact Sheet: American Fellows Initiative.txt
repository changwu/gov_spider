President George W. Bush
  April 21, 2001

The American Fellows Program is intended to promote mutual understanding and excellence in government within the hemisphere through reciprocal, one-year exchanges of outstanding mid- to senior-grade officials in government agencies of participating countries. The Department of State will coordinate the program in the United States, in close consultation with participating U.S. agencies.
Agencies will cover the cost of the salary and associated administrative expenses of their employees participating in the program and placed in foreign agencies. Agencies will assign incoming participants, whose salaries and expenses will be borne by their home institutions, a full range of professional-level duties commensurate with their expertise and abilities. We anticipate exchanges in areas such as disaster relief and mitigation (FEMA), education (Department of Education), forestry (U.S. Department of Agriculture) and environment (EPA).
Argentina has agreed to participate and we are in discussions with other governments. Country participation will be agreed to through a bilateral exchange of letters between foreign ministries.
