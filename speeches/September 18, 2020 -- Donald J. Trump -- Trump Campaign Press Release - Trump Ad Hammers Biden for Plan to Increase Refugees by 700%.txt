    President Trump's re-election campaign today unveiled a new ad blasting Joe Biden for his plan to increase refugee intake by 700 percent, including from some of the world's most unstable nations, as the coronavirus still affects every country on Earth. The ad, titled "Seven Hundred Percent," goes into the existing television buy and will run on local television in Minnesota and Michigan.
The ad highlights President Trump's bold action to restrict travel from China at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, which experts have confirmed saved thousands of American lives. Biden criticized the move as "xenophobia" and "fear-mongering," and would not have taken that action. Now Biden proposes increasing refugee intake, which is more proof that the United States would be in worse position on the virus than we are today under President Trump.
The Trump campaign announced this week it had increased its television advertising buy by 50 percent, ramping up its presence in key states with early voting and expanding its national cable buy. The overall eight-figure buy is running on national cable, and local broadcast and cable in the following states: North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Nebraska (2nd Congressional District), and Maine (2nd Congressional District). The Trump campaign also announced it was expanding its existing urban radio buy, which now includes Pennsylvania, along with Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.
