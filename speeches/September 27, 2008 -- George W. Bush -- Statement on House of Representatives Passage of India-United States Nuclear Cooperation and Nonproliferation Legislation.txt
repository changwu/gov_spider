    I congratulate the House of Representatives for passing H.R. 7081, the United States-India Nuclear Cooperation Approval and Nonproliferation Enhancement Act. The passage of this legislation by the House is another major step forward in achieving the transformation of the U.S.-India relationship.
I thank the Members of Congress who helped to pass this legislation, especially House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard Berman (D-CA) and Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL). In addition, I would like to recognize the contributions of two great Americans and legislators, Congressmen Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde, who saw early on the importance of a strategic partnership with India and of bringing the people of our two great nations together through this initiative.
I urge the Senate to quickly take up and pass this important piece of legislation before their October adjournment. Signing this bipartisan bill will help strengthen our partnership with India.
