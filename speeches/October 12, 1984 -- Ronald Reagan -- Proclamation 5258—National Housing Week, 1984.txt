  A Proclamation

The provision of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family continues to be a national housing goal. Homeownership and decent housing instill pride in our citizens and contribute to the vitality of communities throughout America. This year, a vibrant housing industry continues to provide jobs for thousands of our citizens and to play a major role in our Nation's economic recovery.
Housing comes in an almost infinite variety of forms from single-family detached dwellings to large urban skyscrapers. It is available for purchase or rent. It includes lovingly restored older buildings and prefabricated new ones. But whatever form it takes, good housing remains an essential part of the American Dream. The efficiency and success of free enterprise in responding to the great variety of market demands for housing deserve special notice and commendation.
In recognition of our Nation's commitment to housing and homeownership and the role that housing plays in our economic vitality, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 606, has designated the week of October 14 through October 21, 1984, as "National Housing Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning October 14, 1984, as National Housing Week, and I call upon the people of the United States and interested groups and organizations to observe this week with appropriate activities and events.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and ninth.

RONALD REAGAN
