    IN THIS Bicentennial year the traditional tribute to our nation's newspapers takes on even greater significance. It calls public attention to the continuing vitality of the freedom of the press that is such a cherished part of the legacy we celebrate. It also evokes the solemn responsibility of America's newspapers to the trust they hold and acknowledges their efforts to perpetuate the integrity and honor of our birthright as members of a free society.
Our freedom has been nurtured by an unfettered press and by the vigilance and skill of publishers, editors and journalists throughout the country. I welcome the opportunity provided by this observance to salute the nation's newspapers and the hard-working men and women who make them such an indispensable force in our way of life.
