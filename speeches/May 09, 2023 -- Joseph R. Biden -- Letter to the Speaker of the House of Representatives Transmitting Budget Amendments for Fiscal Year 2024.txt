    Dear Mr. Speaker: 
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Budget amendments for the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Education, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, and Transportation as well as the Environmental Protection Agency and for International Assistance Programs. These amendments would not change the base discretionary budget authority requested in my FY 2024 Budget.
Also included is an amendment providing increased amounts for the National Science Foundation (NSF) STEM Education account. This increase is fully offset from amounts provided from within NSF and the Department of Agriculture. Also included for consideration are amendments shifting amounts provided from within the Department of Defense for higher priority programs.
This transmittal also contains FY 2024 Budget amendments for the Legislative Branch. As a matter of comity and tradition, these appropriations requests for the Legislative Branch are transmitted without change. These amendments would decrease by $17 million the overall discretionary budget authority in my FY 2024 Budget.
The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.
