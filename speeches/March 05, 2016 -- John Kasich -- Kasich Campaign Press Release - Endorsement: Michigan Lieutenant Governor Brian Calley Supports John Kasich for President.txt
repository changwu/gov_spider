    Today, Michigan Lieutenant Governor Brian Calley endorsed Gov. John Kasich for president and joined the Kasich for America leadership team in Michigan.
Said Calley, "There is no one in this race who is better-equipped or better-suited to lead our nation than Gov. John Kasich. His conservative, commonsense reforms have restored hope in Ohio, and they will restore hope in America. With a leader like John Kasich who will balance the federal budget and help businesses create jobs, there is no limit to the growth we can achieve in our states and communities. I'm proud to support Gov. Kasich for president and join my friends and colleagues on his extensive state leadership team here in Michigan."

In 2011, Calley entered office as America's youngest lieutenant governor. He has played a notably active role in the Snyder administration, promoting Michigan's 2011 tax reform package, autism insurance reform and other policy reforms around the state. Calley previously served as a member of the Michigan House of Representatives from 2007 to 2011.
Said Kasich, "I'm honored to receive the endorsement of one of Michigan's top public officials in these crucial days leading up to the state's primary election. Lieutenant Governor Brian Calley is an active, highly-respected leader and advocate for autism and other important issues that the people of Michigan face. It's a major win for our Michigan team to have his political expertise and ties in our corner."
