    Rudy Giuliani's Florida Chairman, Attorney General Bill McCollum, made the following statement today regarding the start of early voting in the state:
"This year, Florida Republicans are playing a pivotal role in choosing our party's presidential nominee. Starting today, Floridians will have an opportunity to let their voice be heard by casting their vote at early voting locations across the state. As Republicans cast their ballots, I urge voters to choose the only candidate who is a true fiscal conservative, has been tested and is ready to provide strong leadership for the country as the next President of the United States â€“ Mayor Rudy Giuliani."
