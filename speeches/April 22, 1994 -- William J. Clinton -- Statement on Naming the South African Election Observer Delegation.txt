    The world is elated at the prospect of these elections. They are the next step in South Africa's historic path from apartheid to nonracial democracy. Americans have stood by South Africans in their struggle, and we will be steadfast in our commitment to work with all South Africans to build the prosperous, stable, and just society that can come in its place.
