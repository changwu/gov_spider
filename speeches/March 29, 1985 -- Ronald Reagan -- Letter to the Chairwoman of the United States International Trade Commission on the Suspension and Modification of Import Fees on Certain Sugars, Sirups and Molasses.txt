    Dear Madam Chairwoman:
Pursuant to Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended, I have been advised by the Secretary of Agriculture, and I agree with him, that there is reason to believe that changed circumstances require the termination of import fees for the entry of raw sugar as described in item 956.15 of part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) and a modification of the import fees for TSUS items 956.05 and 957.15 from the current adjustable fees.
The United States International Trade Commission is therefore directed to make an investigation of this matter under Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended.
The Secretary of Agriculture has also determined and reported to me, pursuant to Section 22(b) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended, that a condition exists requiring emergency treatment. I have, therefore, issued a proclamation suspending the import fees for TSUS item 956.15 and modifying the fees for TSUS items 956.05 and 957.15 to one cent per pound.
The suspension and modification of these fees will continue in effect pending receipt of the report and recommendations of the United States International Trade Commission and action that I may take thereon. Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
[The Honorable Paula Stern, Chairwoman, United States International Trade Commission, 701 E Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20436]
