    THE FEDERAL Energy Administration Act of 1974, section 15(a), required that I submit to the Congress six months before the expiration of this Act my recommendations for the future of the Federal Energy Administration.
In view of my recent signing of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, I have determined that the management of energy policies and programs can best be served by the extension of the Federal Energy Administration until September 30, 1979--thirty-nine months beyond its current termination date of June 30, 1976. This will allow an orderly phasing out of price and allocation controls on domestic oil production over a period of forty months and implementation of other programs called for in that Act.
I have directed Federal Energy Administrator Zarb to seek the authority required to carry out this proposal.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
