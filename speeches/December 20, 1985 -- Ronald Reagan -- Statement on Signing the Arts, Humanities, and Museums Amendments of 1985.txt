    I have today approved S. 1264, the "Arts, Humanities, and Museums Amendments of 1985." The main purpose of this legislation is to extend for 5 years the authorizations for the National Endowment for the Arts and the Humanities, which was proposed by the administration in legislation submitted to the Congress last April. S. 1264 also extends the authorizations for the Institute of Museum Services and contains another amendment to the Museum Services Act about which I wish to comment. Section 201 of the bill contains a clause stating that the National Museum Services Board "may not include, at any time, more than three members from a single State." I have been advised by the Attorney General that this provision applies only to future appointments and that it does not require me, and could not constitutionally require me, to remove any of the present members of the Board in order to comply immediately with that clause. I shall he guided by that advice.
