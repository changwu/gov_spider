Have the Democrats finally realized that we desperately need Border Security and a Wall on the Southern Border. Need to stop Drugs Human TraffickingGang Members & Criminals from coming into our Country. Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats?Retweets: 30542Favorites: 131861

The reason the DACA for Wall deal didn't get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the 9th Circuit allowed DACA to remain thereby setting up a Supteme Court case. After ruling Dems dropped deal - and that's where we are today Democrat obstruction of the needed Wall.Retweets: 2339Favorites: 8218

The Democrats OBSTRUCTION of the desperately needed Wall where they almost all recently agreed it should be built is exceeded only by their OBSTRUCTION of 350 great people wanting & expecting to come into Government after being delayed for more than two years a U.S. record!Retweets: 20172Favorites: 84780

'Border Patrol Agents want the Wall.' Democrat's say they don't want the Wall (even though they know it is really needed) and they don't want ICE. They don't have much to campaign on do they? An Open Southern Border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity!Retweets: 24281Favorites: 105281

There is right now a full scale manhunt going on in California for an illegal immigrant accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop. Time to get tough on Border Security. Build the Wall!Retweets: 36523Favorites: 146277

Brad Blakeman: 'The American people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them. The Pesident says look this is your neighborhood you've got to stand up to protect yourselves. Don't always look to America.'Retweets: 2510Favorites: 9448

This isn't about the Wall everybody knows that a Wall will work perfectly (In Israel the Wall works 99.9%). This is only about the Dems not letting Donald Trump & the Republicans have a win. They may have the 10 Senate votes but we have the issue Border Security. 2020!Retweets: 31406Favorites: 127902

CNN & others within the Fake News Universe were going wild about my signing MAGA hats for our military in Iraq and Germany. If these brave young people ask me to sign their hat I will sign. Can you imagine my saying NO? We brought or gave NO hats as the Fake News first reported!Retweets: 43772Favorites: 181435
