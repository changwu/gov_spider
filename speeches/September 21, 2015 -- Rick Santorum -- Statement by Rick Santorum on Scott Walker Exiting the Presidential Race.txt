    Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) issued the following statement in response to news that Governor Scott Walker had ended his presidential campaign.
Rick Santorum said:
Scott Walker has been one of America's strongest governors over the past 6 years. From taking on public employee unions to fighting for the most vulnerable, the people of Wisconsin are blessed to have a strong leader in Scott Walker at the helm. I appreciated the opportunity to get to know Governor Walker over the past several months and I wish him and his family the best. I am sure this is not the last we will hear from Governor Walker.
