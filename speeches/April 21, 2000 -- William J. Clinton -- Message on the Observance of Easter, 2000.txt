    Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Easter.
In this holy season, Christians across America and around the world relive the events of Jesus' life, death, and Resurrection, rejoice in His fulfillment of the promise of salvation, and give prayerful thanks for the assurance of God's forgiving love.
As Christians, we have been called to share that forgiveness with others. Across the globe, in places large and small, we have witnessed the tragic consequences of humanity's refusal to forgive. Ancient feuds, ethnic tensions, old hatreds and prejudicesâ€”these have torn apart families, communities, and nations for decades and continue to bring suffering to our world. On this, the first Easter of the new millennium and in the Jubilee Year of Christ's birth, the challenge to each of us is to reflect God's love and forgiveness in all our actions.
Let us strive to see beyond the surface differences that may divide us from one another by discovering the values we share. Let us work together to lift the yoke of poverty and oppression that crushes so many lives around the world. Let us recognize that, in Jesus' Resurrection, we see both the promise and the proof of love's capacity to triumph over the forces of misunderstanding, fear, and hatred.
As millions of Americans gather with loved ones to share the joy of this blessed holiday, Hillary and I extend our best wishes to all for a wonderful Easter celebration.
