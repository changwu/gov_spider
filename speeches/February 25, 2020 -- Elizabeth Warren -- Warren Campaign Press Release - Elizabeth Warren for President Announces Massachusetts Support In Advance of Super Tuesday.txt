    Cambridge, MA – During the week of early voting for the Massachusetts Primary and right before the South Carolina debate, the movement for big, structural change in Massachusetts is in full swing. Today, Massachusetts for Warren announced a broad, diverse coalition of 147 federal, statewide, and local elected Massachusetts officials and community leaders supporting Elizabeth in the Massachusetts Primary on March 3rd.
"Elizabeth Warren has been my partner on issues that matter to Massachusetts, from combating the opioid epidemic to fighting predatory for-profit schools. We've taken on the Trump administration and won," said Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. "Even before she was our Senator, Elizabeth was fighting for our families – she created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protect American families from corporate greed, and it worked. She's passed bipartisan legislation and delivered progressive wins, which is exactly what it will take to fix the corruption of the Trump administration when she's in office – someone who can get things done. I am proud to support Elizabeth Warren for President."
"Elizabeth Warren showed the country last week why she's the strongest candidate to beat Donald Trump on the debate stage and at the ballot box in November," said Congressman Jim McGovern. "The people of Worcester know Elizabeth Warren, we know who she fights for, and we know she actually gets things done. We're excited to work together to get out the vote for her campaign."
"Just as I was proud to share an office in Winthrop with Senator Warren and campaign with her when she first ran for the Senate, I am proud to endorse her as my choice for the Democratic nominee for president," said Speaker of the House Robert DeLeo. "It was powerful to see Senator Warren introduce a gun safety model based on the work we have done in the Massachusetts House, and I believe she is a highly effective oral advocate who can fight for our party and retake the White House. She's proven time and time again - both in debates and on the Senate floor - that she's a quick thinker and a woman with a plan. I strongly believe that Elizabeth Warren is the type of tough fighter who can take on and defeat the president."
"Our country needs a candidate with the strength and vision to beat Donald Trump," said Senate President Karen Spilka. "In Massachusetts, we know that's Elizabeth Warren. She has fought for our families, she will fight for this country, and she will win this election."
"The people of Western Massachusetts know and trust Elizabeth Warren," said State Senator Eric Lesser. "I'm supporting her campaign because I know she has what it takes to beat Donald Trump and create opportunities for families here and across the country."
The people of Massachusetts know Elizabeth best. They saw her lead a campaign that beat Scott Brown in a race that people thought was unwinnable, and they've seen her get real things done – from making hearing aids affordable, to canceling student loans for thousands of Massachusetts students, to ensuring that survivors of the Boston Marathon bombing got the specialized care they needed. The elected officials listed are part of a strong Massachusetts delegation that has worked directly with Elizabeth to make progress for the Bay State.
Elizabeth built a statewide grassroots organization in Massachusetts that started in 2011 and led to her defeating a popular Republican incumbent and being elected the first woman to statewide office in Massachusetts. Today, that organization has expanded to include thousands of first time volunteers, small donors, and students, as well as veterans of her historic 2012 victory and re-election campaigns. She is the only Democratic candidate to defeat an incumbent Republican in the past thirty years.
Elizabeth has shown over and over again that she knows how to fight – and win. Voters want someone who gets big things done for working people and that is exactly what Elizabeth has done. She got a whole new consumer agency passed into law -- all in the face of a powerful financial industry that spent millions to stop reform in its tracks. Since then, that agency has returned more than $12 billion to consumers who were cheated.
Below is the full list of Elizabeth's Massachusetts endorsements – each one a part of Elizabeth's grassroots movement for big, structural change.
