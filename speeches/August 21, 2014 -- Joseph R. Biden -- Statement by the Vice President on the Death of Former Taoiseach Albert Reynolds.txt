    I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing today of former Taoiseach Albert Reynolds. His instrumental role in the 1993 Downing Street Declaration in London with former British Prime Minister John Major and his efforts to enact subsequent ceasefires paved the way for every major peace agreement for the last twenty years, and his deep conviction that there was nothing to fear from peace still resounds across Ireland and Northern Ireland today.
Taoiseach Reynolds knew that keeping of peace requires continuing commitment and constant attention. I urge today's leaders to continue advancing the peace process in Northern Ireland, so that all of its citizens can live in the peaceful, prosperous, and shared community that Reynolds envisioned. I send my deepest condolences to the Taoiseach's wife, Kathleen, to the rest of his family, and to his friends and colleagues.
