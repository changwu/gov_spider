    Kentucky Congressman and Chairman of the House Energy and Power Subcommittee Ed Whitfield made the following statement on Mitt Romney's vision for America as an energy superpower:
"Affordable, reliable energy is vital to our economy, job creation, and our global competitiveness.Â  President Obama has proven to the American people that he is more interested in having taxpayers play the role of venture capitalists by chasing risky ventures, such as Solyndra, rather than using our abundant natural resources. Governor Romney on the other hand recently released his energy plan, which includes commonsense proposals to promote North American energy independence, create millions of new jobs, add $500 billion to GDP, reduce our trade deficit, generate $1 trillion in federal, state, and local revenue, strengthen national security, and lower energy prices for consumers. By supporting expanded domestic production of coal, natural gas, nuclear, and alternative energy sources and eliminating red tape and permitting delays, Governor Romney's energy plan will lead to a more robust economy, increased job creation, and lower energy costs for all Americans."
