    DENVER — Bennet for America today announced that it brought in $3.5 million in the two months since Michael announced his candidacy for president on May 2. This includes $700,000 that was transferred from his Senate campaign account.
"In just two months, Michael has set himself apart from other candidates, showing he has the breadth of experience and record of winning tough races to defeat Donald Trump," said Bennet for America spokesperson Shannon Beckham. "Despite Michael entering the race late because of a prostate cancer diagnosis, we raised more in two months than several other campaigns did in the entire first quarter. We're building a sustainable, long-term campaign to defeat Donald Trump, and we're just getting started."
Bennet for America also announced that 83 percent of the campaign's contributions are $25 or less, and 95 percent of the contributions are $100 or less — demonstrating a strong base of grassroots support. The campaign has seen a surge of donors and interest following Michael's strong debate performance last week, particularly from first-time donors and those in early states.
Last Friday, the campaign received the highest number of donors since the week it launched — 54% of whom were brand new supporters of the campaign. This swell of support represents nine times the number of donations in a single day compared to the previous week.
The campaign has also seen an outpouring of interest online, with a 222% increase in visitors to the website the day after the debate compared to the previous week. There was a particular surge from early states, with a 245% increase from Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada, and a 367% increase from California.
