The Democrat Congresswomen have been spewing some of the most vile hateful and disgusting things ever said by a politician in the House or Senate & yet they get a free pass and a big embrace from the Democrat Party. Horrible anti-Israel anti-USA pro-terrorist & public.....Retweets: 36120Favorites: 159708

.....shouting of the F...word among many other terrible things and the petrified Dems run for the hills. Why isn't the House voting to rebuke the filthy and hate laced things they have said? Because they are the Radical Left and the Democrats are afraid to take them on. Sad!Retweets: 29652Favorites: 136332

If you come after the President the Country the Flag - he's going to defend himself. What the squad doesn't like is that Donald Trump is enforcing the very laws that are on the books that were put there by Congress.' Jason Chaffetz.

Those Tweets were NOT Racist. I don't have a Racist bone in my body! The so-called vote to be taken is a Democrat con game. Republicans should not show 'weakness' and fall into their trap. This should be a vote on the filthy language statements and lies told by the Democrat.....Retweets: 42156Favorites: 201108

.....Congresswomen who I truly believe based on their actions hate our Country. Get a list of the HORRIBLE things they have said. Omar is polling at 8% Cortez at 21%. Nancy Pelosi tried to push them away but now they are forever wedded to the Democrat Party. See you in 2020!Retweets: 30255Favorites: 151862
