Pool is packed into a hallway and holding for the spray. Here are some more quotes. Please check against transcript.
Michel:
"Your participation in this meeting is a very strong signal."
He said these are difficult times, challenging times and we need to make intelligent decisions for the future.
Biden:
Tweak to the earlier re-election quote from Biden I sent — He was congratulating him on reelection without opposition, when he said "I dream about that."
"From the very beginning ours is the view that the single most important thing we have to do in the west is to be united… I mean it literally."
" I spent some time with Vladimir Putin back in November and Dec…and it was clear to me that his intentions were very different than benign intentions."
"His overwhelming objective is to demonstrate that democracies cannot function in the 21st century because things are moving so rapidly they require consensus and it's too difficult to get consensus and autocracies are going to rule."
He said his goal has been to get "total and complete unity among the major democracies."
On Putin's objective of breaking up NATO, he said: "He'd rather face 30 independent countries than 30 United countries… I'm being deadly earnest. I believe that's been his intention from the very beginning."
