    BURLINGTON, Vt. – U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday welcomed a major endorsement by former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner for Sanders' Democratic Party presidential campaign.

"Senator Turner is nationally known as a voice for voting rights, for workers' rights and for marginalized people. The support of someone with that record of standing up for middle-income and working people is tremendously important," said Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver. "We are extremely, extremely humbled by the support of Sen. Nina Turner."
In an interview with the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Turner explained why she endorsed Sanders. "I'm very attracted by his message and his style and that he has held pretty much strong on his beliefs and the world is catching up with him," Turner said.
The Ohio Democrat will take a leave of absence from her leadership role as chair of Party Engagement while traveling the country on behalf of the campaign. Turner will join Sanders on Monday at a rally in Cleveland, Ohio.
Turner joins a growing list of progressive voices putting their name behind the grassroots campaign. U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison and U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva endorsed Sanders in October.
Sanders is headed to Iowa in advance of Saturday night's Democratic Party debate.
