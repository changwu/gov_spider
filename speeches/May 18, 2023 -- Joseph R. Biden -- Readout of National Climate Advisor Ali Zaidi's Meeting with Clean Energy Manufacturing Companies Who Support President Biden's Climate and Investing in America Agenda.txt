    Yesterday, National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi hosted a meeting at the White House with sustainability executives and business leaders from companies that are experiencing benefits from the President's Investing in America agenda including the Inflation Reduction Act. At the meeting, they discussed how the Inflation Reduction Act has changed their companies' business models to scale across the country, and how the tax credits have changed their calculus for their clean energy work. These companies expressed significant concerns about how any repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits – including clean energy tax incentives – presents substantial economic risk and would hurt the hundreds of thousands of Americans they employ in communities across the country.
National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi explained to the executives how the Inflation Reduction Act and the tax credits are growing our economy and strengthening our competitiveness. The executives also expressed their intent to work across the aisle to grow their businesses and continue to develop a clean energy economy that is made in America.
Companies in attendance included Hannon Armstrong, Holcim, HP, National Grid, Outdoor Industry Association, Siemens, Vail Resorts, Bonterra Organic Estates, PepsiCo, and Stonyfield.
