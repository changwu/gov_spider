(Senate)
(Sen. Murray, D-WA, Sen. Isakson, R-GA, Sen. Harkin, D-IA, Sen. Alexander, R-TN and 17 cosponsors)
The Administration supports passage of Senate Amendments to H.R. 803, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014. This bipartisan legislation would strengthen our workforce system and provide workers and job seekers with access to employment, education, training, and support services that will help them secure good jobs and advance their careers.
While this legislation does not address certain reforms that the Administration has pursued, such as the Workforce Innovation Fund, it represents an important bipartisan compromise that will help individuals, including people with disabilities, acquire the skills they need to succeed in the workforce and employers find the skilled workers they need to compete in the global economy. Ensuring that employment, education, and training programs are "job-driven"—designed to take business and workforce needs into account—is a critical aspect of helping workers enter the middle class and prosper. This bill would hold programs accountable for getting people into good jobs and providing education and training that is aligned with the skills employers need.
The Administration applauds the spirit of bipartisanship that led to this compromise and looks forward to its swift passage.
