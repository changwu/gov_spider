    To the Congress of the United States:
I am hereby transmitting the United States Civil Service Commission's Annual Report for fiscal year 1971.
The report encompasses a year marked with considerable progress and innovation in Federal personnel management. Among the year's highlights were significant liberalizations in retirement and health benefits; increased emphasis on employment opportunities for returning Vietnam veterans; a strengthened program in equal employment opportunity for minorities and women; considerable progress in job evaluation policy and personnel management evaluation; and preparations by the Commission to implement the Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970 which should bring a new partnership between Federal, State, and local governments.
These improvements resulted from the joint action and cooperation of the Commission, the Congress, the executive agencies, employee organizations, and the President. I therefore hope you share my pride in these achievements which not only have made the Government a better employer but have also provided sharpened government responsiveness to the changing social and economic needs of the American people.
