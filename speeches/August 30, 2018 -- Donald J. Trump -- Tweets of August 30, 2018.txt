'Lanny Davis admits being anonymous source in CNN Report.' @BretBaier Oh well so much for CNN saying it wasn't Lanny. No wonder their ratings are so low it's FAKE NEWS!Retweets: 22285Favorites: 84341

'Ohr told the FBI it (the Fake Dossier) wasn't true it was a lie and the FBI was determined to use it anyway to damage Trump and to perpetrate a fraud on the court to spy on the Trump campaign.

The hatred and extreme bias of me by @CNN has clouded their thinking and made them unable to function. But actually as I have always said this has been going on for a long time. Little Jeff Z has done a terrible job his ratings suck & AT&T should fire him to save credibility!Retweets: 23904Favorites: 100345

What's going on at @CNN is happening to different degrees at other networks - with @NBCNews being the worst. The good news is that Andy Lack(y) is about to be fired(?) for incompetence and much worse. When Lester Holt got caught fudging my tape on Russia they were hurt badly!Retweets: 18808Favorites: 71978

I just cannot state strongly enough how totally dishonest much of the Media is. Truth doesn't matter to them they only have their hatred & agenda. This includes fake books which come out about me all the time always anonymous sources and are pure fiction. Enemy of the People!Retweets: 31482Favorites: 127265

Ivanka Trump & Jared Kushner had NOTHING to do with the so called 'pushing out' of Don McGahn.The Fake News Media has it purposelyso wrong! They love to portray chaos in the White House when they know that chaos doesn't exist-just a 'smooth running machine' with changing parts!Retweets: 18616Favorites: 77237

I am very excited about the person who will be taking the place of Don McGahn as White House Councel! I liked Don but he was NOT responsible for me not firing Bob Mueller or Jeff Sessions. So much Fake Reporting and Fake News!Retweets: 5876Favorites: 22917

Wow Nellie Ohr Bruce Ohr's wife is a Russia expert who is fluent in Russian. She worked for Fusion GPS where she was paid a lot. Collusion! Bruce was a boss at the Department of Justice and is unbelievably still there!Retweets: 26670Favorites: 88416
