"Mitt Romney: Experience And Wide Appeal Make Him The Best GOP Presidential Nominee"

In the March 6 primary, The Dispatch urges Ohio Republicans to choose Mitt Romney as their party's presidential nominee.
American voters need someone who offers an alternative to the failed policies of President Barack Obama. Romney is the candidate best able to do that.
It would be politically expedient for a presidential candidate to vow that he'll single-handedly create jobs. Romney promises something else: He says he'll get government out of the way, because government can't create jobs. It can only inhibit their creation, as has been amply demonstrated over the past three years.
...
The nation's voters should have the chance to choose a candidate who will reduce government burdens and government-induced uncertainty that impede the ability of business owners to plan, grow and hire.
...
Gingrich is not a sound choice if Republicans want to win back the White House. It's ironic that the former speaker of the House has become a darling of hard-right conservatives, since Gingrich has not hewed faithfully to conservative principles.
...
Gingrich's professional record also has been erratic. There are the ethics charges from his time as speaker. Though he now distances himself from it, Gingrich famously joined Nancy Pelosi in calling for solutions to global warming...
What is most troubling about Gingrich, though, is the fact that so many of those who know him well are adamant that he not become the Republican nominee.
...
Gingrich is incapable of offering the stability and predictability that the nation so desperately needs.
...
Romney especially distinguishes himself from his Republican rivals — and the president — through his broad experience in business and in public service. In addition to his years investing in companies at Bain Capital, Romney is widely known for saving the troubled 2002 Olympic Games in Salt Lake City.
He understands how the market works and what prevents it from working. Unlike Obama, who would have people think that the success of some takes away from others, Romney correctly sees that if policies are favorable to those who build companies and hire, benefits flow to all.
...
Republicans should offer the voters of the United States a chief executive who is experienced at and unafraid of the often-unpopular job of turning things around. Romney fills that bill.
That's why The Dispatch urges Republican voters to choose Mitt Romney as their presidential nominee in the March 6 primary election.
