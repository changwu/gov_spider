    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2007 Budget amendments for the Department of Health and Human Services to enhance the preparedness and response capabilities of the agency based primarily on the findings of the Federal Response to Hurricane Katrina: Lessons Learned report of February 2006. The total discretionary budget authority in my FY 2007 Budget would not be increased by these requests.
The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
