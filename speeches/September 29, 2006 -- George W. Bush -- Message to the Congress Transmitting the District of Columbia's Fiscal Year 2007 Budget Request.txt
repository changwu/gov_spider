    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to my constitutional authority and consistent with section 446 of The District of Columbia Self-Governmental Reorganization Act as amended in 1989, I am transmitting the District of Columbia's 2007 Budget Request Act.
The proposed 2007 Budget Request Act reflects the major programmatic objectives of the Mayor and the Council of the District of Columbia. For 2007, the District estimates total revenues and expenditures of $7.61 billion.
