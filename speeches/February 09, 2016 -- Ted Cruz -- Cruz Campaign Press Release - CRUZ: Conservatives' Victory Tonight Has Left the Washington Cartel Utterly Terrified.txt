HOLLIS, NH – Presidential Candidate Ted Cruz today addressed the people of the Granite State and conservatives across the country after a strong finish in the New Hampshire primary. Excerpts of his remarks included below:
"Together, we have done what the pundits and the media said could not be done, what the Washington establishment desperately hoped would not be done.
"The real winner – the real winner – is the conservative grassroots. Who propelled us to an outright victory in Iowa and to a far stronger result and outcome in New Hampshire than anyone predicted....
"Thank you New Hampshire, for tonight's result, your victory tonight has left the Washington Cartel utterly terrified.
"And so now on to South Carolina, on to Nevada, on to Super Tuesday. We've put Washington on the run, and tonight's outcome is a victory for 'we the people.' And this election, this primary and this general election in November 2016, will be a victory for the hardworking men and women who want to believe again in the promise of America against the bipartisan corruption of Washington, which mark my words will end on January 20, 2017."
