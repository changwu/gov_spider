    CHICAGO,IL -- Today, Obama for America announced record-breaking grassroots support. In just the second quarter, more than 154,000 donors gave the campaign at least $31 million in primary dollars alone, for a total of at least $32.5 million including general election funds.
"Together, we have built the largest grassroots campaign in history for this stage of a Presidential race. We now have hundreds of thousands of Americans who are ready to demand health care for all, energy independence, and an end to this war in Iraq. That's the kind of movement that can change the special interest-driven politics in Washington and transform our country. And it's just the beginning," said Barack Obama.
"Every day over the past three months, over 1,500 Americans have made clear to BarackObama that they believe in his vision for our country by contributing to his campaign," said Penny Pritzker, Obama for America National Finance Chair. "I am glad to be a part of the more than 258,000 citizens of this country who are already united behind Barack's vision for our future."
