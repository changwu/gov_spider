    The Vice President spoke by telephone today with Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci. The Vice President underscored U.S. support for the resumption of UN-facilitated talks in Switzerland and expressed hope that the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders will agree to a settlement that would reunify Cyprus as a bizonal, bicommunal federation to the benefit of all Cypriots.
