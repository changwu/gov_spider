    The President. Good morning, everybody. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you all very much. Let me just say that I know some of you have been up all night long. And so, what we want to do is not delay this but take whoever is first. And I gather that's been sorted out by whoever got first in line into the -- --
Visitors. No!
The President. Not quite?
Visitors. No!
The President. Okay, so there's some injustice out there. [Laughter]
Visitor. We love you, George! I love you!
The President. No, but this is the people's house, and it just seemed appropriate on this first day that we welcome as many as we can. I have a little hiatus in the middle because I do have to go over to this building. I'm sure most of you recognize that as the West Wing, and then the office you see in the corner is the President's Oval Office. And I have to go sign one or two things and at least start to work over there, and then I will come back. Barbara will be here -- some of our kids inside. But we just wanted to wish you well and welcome you to the people's house.
Thank you all very, very much. Thank you. We'll scoot on in.
