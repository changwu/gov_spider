MITT ROMNEY: "What the people are focused on is the issue of Medicare and the fact that under the President's plan, he cuts Medicare by $716 billion, takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund, and uses it to pay for Obamacare. And I think this is something which people are just now focused on and they find it very, very difficult to understand why he would cut Medicare funding for our current seniors."
