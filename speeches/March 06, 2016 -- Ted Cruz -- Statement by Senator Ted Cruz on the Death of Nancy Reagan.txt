HOUSTON, Texas – Presidential Candidate Ted Cruz released the following statement upon news of First Lady Nancy Reagan's passing.
"Today we mourn the loss of First Lady Nancy Reagan – she was first in the heart of 'Ronnie,' and of Americans across the nation who will forever be grateful for her service to the nation. She was her husband's first friend and counselor – and his inspiration. In her public role as first lady, she brought elegance, dignity, and wisdom to the White House as she so graciously hosted dignitaries from around the world. She also poured her life into helping the afflicted, especially those gripped by drug and alcohol addition. She pioneered programs to lift Americans out of addiction and restore hope to them and their families.
"When Ronald Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, her faithfulness only multiplied as she stayed by his side. She always remained the love of his life, and after his passing she carried on his legacy – and most of all his faith that this nation would always stand for good in the face of evil, defeat those who meant her harm, and remain a shining city upon a hill.
"Today, Heidi and I mourn with the Reagan family, and we lift up prayers of gratitude for the many years of devotion Nancy gave to her husband and her country. We remember especially how dedicated she was to preserving the memories of her husband. She will be deeply missed. And we feel the sorrow of the nation. But we remember too that like her husband Nancy was a person of faith. Ronald Reagan said once he could not 'imagine life without her.' It is good that they are together again."
