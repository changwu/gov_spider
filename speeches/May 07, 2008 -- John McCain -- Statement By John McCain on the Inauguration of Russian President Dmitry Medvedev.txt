    U.S. Senator John McCain today issued the following statement regarding the inauguration of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev:
"I sincerely hope the beginning of the Medvedev presidency will also be the beginning of a new era for Russia and for U.S.- Russian relations. The next U.S. President should look forward to working closely with President Medvedev on the great issues of our day. Americans and Russians share a common interest in a prosperous global economy and mutually beneficial free trade. We share common interests in addressing climate change, the careful use of our natural resources and countering radical Islamic extremism. And we share a common interest in non-proliferation and nuclear arms reduction. The United States needs to work hard to forge a productive relationship with the government and the people of Russia in these areas.
"Today, President Medvedev pledged that his greatest duty would be to develop civil and economic freedom for the Russian people. I welcome this pledge and hope President Medvedev will soon begin restoring and strengthening the institutions of democracy, including a free press and the rights of a vibrant Russian political opposition to express its views and run for office. That is what the Russian people want and deserve, and it is also what we want for Russia. I also hope President Medvedev will take steps to ease tensions with Georgia by reversing recently announced measures that undermine Georgia's internationally - recognized sovereignty which have rightly caused great concern among our European allies. "
