    Today, California Congresswoman Jackie Speier released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for the President of the United States:
"I'm proud to endorse Joe Biden. Voting for the Affordable Care Act and to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act were some of my proudest moments in Congress. Such monumental legislation wouldn't have been possible without Joe. His integrity, values, and experience set Joe apart and make him the best suited to beat Donald Trump and get our country back on track. He will be a uniting leader and President for all Americans."
Speier was elected to Congress in 2008 and represents California's 14th Congressional District. Prior to that Speier had served in the California legislature since 1986.
Speier's endorsement builds on the wide support for Joe Biden in California, which includes prominent leaders like Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia, Los Angeles County Supervisor and former Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, Congressman Tony CÃ¡rdenas, Congressman Ami Bera, Congressman John Garamendi, Congressman Lou Correa, Congressman Jerry McNerney, and more than 50 others.
Biden for President has announced more than 2,100 endorsements from national, state and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, and community leaders.
