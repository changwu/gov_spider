    Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. released the following statement in response to the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO) endorsement of President Donald J. Trump's re-election. NAPO represents more than 1,000 police associations and 241,000 sworn officers. NAPO previously endorsed the Obama-Biden presidential ticket in both 2008 and 2012.
Trump 2020 Senior Advisor for Law Enforcement and Labor Unions Bob Paduchik issued the following statement:
"President Trump fights everyday day for the cops that keep us safe. Joe Biden has done nothing to stop his party's 'defund the police' movement and remains silent as police officers across the country are being attacked by violent rioters and protesters. This endorsement for President Trump highlights that as the Law and Order President, he is defending the hardworking people who risk their own lives every day to keep our communities safe."
