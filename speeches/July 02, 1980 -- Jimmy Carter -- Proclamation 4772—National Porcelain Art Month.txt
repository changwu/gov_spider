  A Proclamation

The art of painting on porcelain has been recognized as a fine art by all the world's great civilizations and has enriched museums in many countries for hundreds of years.
This art form, requiring great skill, training, and talent, has been enthusiastically adopted and enhanced by thousands of talented Americans whose labors will awe and delight generations yet to come.
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 115, has requested the President to proclaim the month of July 1980 as National Porcelain Art Month.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of July 1980 as National Porcelain Art Month, and I call upon the people of the United States to observe the month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.

JIMMY CARTER
