    DAVENPORT, Iowa -- Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign on Tuesday announced individual endorsements from over 85 Iowa union workers across the state during a stop on the "Bernie Beats Trump" Tour of Iowa.
"Right to work laws have been on the books in Iowa for over seventy years so it's not hyperbole to say workers rights have been under attack here for generations. With Sen. Sanders' Workplace Democracy Plan, Iowa's Chapter 20 and so-called 'right to work' law will be a thing of the past. These union workers standing with Bernie Sanders are going to help us repeal right to work in Iowa once and for all," said Bernie 2020 Iowa State Director Misty Rebik.
Last month at the Iowa AFL-CIO convention in Altoona, Sanders announced his Workplace Democracy Plan, a comprehensive platform to double union membership in his first term as president and effectively repeal Iowa's Chapter 20 law that stripped the rights of public sector workers to collectively bargain for better benefits and safer working conditions.
Sanders received individual endorsements from a half dozen members of AFSCME Chapter 61, which challenged Iowa's Chapter 20 in the State Supreme Court earlier this year. The individual endorsements of over a dozen Iowa UAW members comes the day before Sanders is set to walk the UAW GM picket line in Detroit-Hamtramck on Wednesday.
