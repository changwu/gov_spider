Boston, MA – Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced that two prominent Delaware Republicans joined the Romney for President Team. State Representative Joe Booth and Former Delaware Republican Party Executive Director Garrett Wozniak have endorsed Governor Romney and his effort to bring change to Washington.
Representative Booth said, "Washington is broken and we're not going to fix it by sending the same people back just to have them sit in different chairs. We need someone with real-world experience. Governor Romney has actually worked in the private sector – he understands how the economy works and how to create jobs. Voters in Delaware have a choice on Tuesday, and they understand that we need a leader with proven executive experience who can fix Washington. Governor Mitt Romney is that leader."
Making today's announcement, Governor Romney said, "I appreciate the endorsements of Representative Booth and Mr. Wozniak. With experience fixing businesses, the Olympics, and Massachusetts, I can't wait to get my hands on Washington. I look forward to working with Representative Booth and Mr. Wozniak to earn the support of as many Delaware voters as possible."
They join State Auditor Tom Wagner, Delaware Romney for President Statewide Steering Committee Vice Chairman Dave Burris, and the other members of the Delaware Romney For President Statewide Steering Committee in supporting Governor Romney.
