    In an interview yesterday morning on Brietbart News Radio, Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) said that Senate Republicans should try to repeal Obamacare – yet again – after trying unsuccessfully in 2017 and after the failure of multiple legal challenges, including at the Supreme Court last summer.
Should Republicans successfully repeal Obamacare:

Over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions will lose insurance protections.
At least 21 million Americans would lose their insurance.
Americans with private insurance could see their premiums skyrocket.
Women could be charged more for their insurance.

This follows the unveiling of Senator Rick Scott's "Skin in the Game" tax plan, which studies by the ITEP and Tax Policy Center found would disproportionately hike taxes on lower-income and middle-income Americans, with ITEP estimating that Americans in the bottom 40% of incomes would pay an average $1000 more annually in taxes while the top 1% of earners remain unaffected.
This focus on raising taxes and stripping Americans of healthcare stands in sharp contrast to President Biden, who is focused on manufacturing more in America, breaking up supply chain bottlenecks that are raising prices, and passing legislation to reduce everyday expenses like health care and reduce the deficit.
