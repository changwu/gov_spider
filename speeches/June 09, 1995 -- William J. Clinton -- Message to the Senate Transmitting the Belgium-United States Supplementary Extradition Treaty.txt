    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Supplementary Treaty on Extradition Between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Belgium to Promote the Repression of Terrorism, signed at Brussels on April 27, 1987 (the "Supplementary Treaty"). Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Supplementary Treaty.
This Supplementary Treaty is designed to facilitate the extradition of terrorists, and is similar to the protocols to extradition treaties currently in force with other countries, including Australia, Canada, Spain, the Federal Republic of Germany, and the United Kingdom. Upon entry into force, the Supplementary Treaty will amend the Treaty for the Mutual Extradition of Fugitives from Justice, signed at Washington on October 26, 1901, as amended by the Supplementary Conventions, signed at Washington on June 20, 1935, and at Brussels on November 14, 1963, if that Treaty is still in force, or the Extradition Treaty Between the United States and Belgium signed at Brussels on April 27, 1987.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Supplementary Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
