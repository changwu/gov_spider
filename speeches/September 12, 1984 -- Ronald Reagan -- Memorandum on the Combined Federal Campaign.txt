    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Our Administration is committed to improving the lives of all people. We can be proud of our record of encouraging a broad spectrum of private sector initiatives. We know that it takes a great effort by individuals, groups, voluntary organizations, and corporations to accomplish this most important mission. We are key members of the team, and must do our part through our leadership of the Combined Federal Campaign in our respective agencies and our direct personal involvement. It takes a team effort to get the job done right.
I am pleased to announce that Secretary of Agriculture John R. Block has agreed to serve as the Chairman of the fall 1984 Combined Federal Campaign for the National Capital Area. I ask that you personally serve as Chairman of the campaign in your organization and appoint a top official as your Vice-Chairman. Please advise Secretary Block of the person you designate.
I urge you to take a personal interest in this year's campaign by working with your employees to achieve new levels of support for the programs of the Combined Federal Campaign. The private voluntary agencies and our neighbors in need are depending on us. Together, let's make this the best campaign ever.
RONALD REAGAN
