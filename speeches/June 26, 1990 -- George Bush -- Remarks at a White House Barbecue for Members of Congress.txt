    The President. Glen, thank you. Thank you all very much. You really turned it on tonight.
Let me just say to everybody how pleased -- I think I speak for all of you -- we are to have Glen here -- 40 albums, 4 gold singles, and 4 special awards, one of the great musical talents in our country and a friend to everybody out here. And we are very, very pleased, Glen. Thank you for that marvelous, lively performance.
Mr. Campbell. You are quite welcome, sir. Thank you, everybody.
The President. And all this wonderful band of yours. We're delighted to have you all here. And let me say to the Members of the Congress that Barbara and I are delighted that you came down here -- a good, relaxed evening and a beautiful night at the White House. We've got a lot of work ahead, but I think at least as far as we're concerned from this end of Pennsylvania Avenue it's been a joy. We're delighted you were here. Now, make yourselves at home, and thank you once again, Glen Campbell. Thank you so much.
Mr. Campbell. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you a lot.
