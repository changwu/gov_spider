Boston, MA â€“ Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement today regarding President Bush's speech on Cuba, which was delivered today in Washington, D.C.:
"For a half-century, the Castro dictatorship has been a terrible reality for millions of Cubans - on the island and in exile. Every person that values liberty should help the Cuban people bury a cruel dictatorship and usher in a free and democratic Cuba. I applaud President Bush's leadership in supporting the Cuban people and for calling upon world leaders to do so as well.
"As President, I pledge my commitment to support the Cuban people as they reclaim their future and rebuild their country. We know from our own Cuban-American community that these are industrious, talented, and freedom-loving people who can achieve extraordinary things. Those on the island will be able to count on my help, the help of the American people and international solidarity and assistance as they seize the opportunity for genuine change.
"To keep faith with the Cuban people, we must make clear that there will be no deals with the illegitimate Castro regime which clings to power in Cuba. We must continue to hold back normal economic ties and political recognition until all political prisoners are free to join their fellow Cubans in building a genuine democracy through free and fair elections. Until then, we must continue to be innovative and generous in backing those who demand freedom."
