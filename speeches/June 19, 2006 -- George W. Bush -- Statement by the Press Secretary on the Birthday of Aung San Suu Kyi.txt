    Today is the 61st birthday of Nobel Prize winner and detained democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. She spends her birthday, again, in detention in Burma. Aung San Suu Kyi's courage and fortitude are an inspiration to those who seek freedom and justice in all parts of the world. The United States urges the international community and the United Nations to take up its responsibility to address the plight of the Burmese people and the need for an inclusive, genuine political dialogue in Burma.
