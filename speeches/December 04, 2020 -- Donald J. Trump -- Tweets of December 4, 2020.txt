Governor @dougducey of Arizona hired a lawyer today. Wouldn't allowing a strong check of ballots, which would be easier and so much better for our Country, be easier on him and the great State of Arizona?Retweets: 41659Favorites: 183688

People in Georgia got caught cold bringing in massive numbers of ballots and putting them in voting machines. Great job @BrianKempGA!Retweets: 60904Favorites: 271424

The best way to insure a @KLoeffler and @sendavidperdue VICTORY is to allow signature checks in the Presidential race, which will insure a Georgia Presidential win (very few votes are needed, many will be found). Spirits will soar and everyone will rush out and VOTE! @BrianKempGARetweets: 39417Favorites: 170738

Very sadly for our Nation, it looks like Senator @JimInhofe will not be putting the Section 230 termination clause into the Defense Bill. So bad for our National Security and Election Integrity. Last chance to ever get it done. I will VETO!Retweets: 43173Favorites: 206710

@JimInhofe What good is having a very expensive National Defense Authorization Act if Big Tech can run circles around you and the security of our Country? End Section 230 now! #NDAARetweets: 4617Favorites: 12483

Whistleblowers reveal that the USPS is responsible for tampering with hundreds of thousands of ballots. @OANN This long time Democrat stronghold got rid of massive numbers, especially in swing states, during and before delivery of the ballots. Well documented evidence!Retweets: 41998Favorites: 162654

The only thing more RIGGED than the 2020 Presidential Election is the FAKE NEWS SUPPRESSED MEDIA. No matter how big or important the story, if it is even slightly positive for us, or negative for them, it will not be reported!Retweets: 57895Favorites: 248555

Thank you to Senate President Karen Fann and House Speaker Russell Bowers – and all, for what you are doing in Arizona. A fast check of signatures will easily give us the state.
