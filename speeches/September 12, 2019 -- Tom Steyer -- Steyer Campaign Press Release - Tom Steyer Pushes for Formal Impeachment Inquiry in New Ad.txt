    New six-figure ad campaign will debut on Fox and Friends the same day House Judiciary Committee to vote on scope of impeachment investigation
(SAN FRANCISCO, September 12, 2019) â€” Today, on the same day that the House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on the scope of an impeachment investigation, candidate for the presidential Tom Steyer reasserted his call for the impeachment of Donald Trump by launching a new six-figure ad campaign on Fox and Friends. Steyer's 30-second "Not Even You, Donald" ad highlights the impeachment movement begun by Steyer more than two years ago, which has grown to more than 8.3 million people pushing to hold Trump accountable for his criminal behavior.
Steyer was the first presidential candidate to call for Trump's impeachment. Following Robert Mueller's findings, almost every presidential candidate and over half of Democrats in the House now favor impeachment. Steyer has consistently pushed Congress, and Democratic House leadership, to move forward with impeachment proceedings. Steyer's ad will run on Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC nationally, and in the DC market on Fox News.
"I started Need to Impeach two years ago because Donald Trump has always been corrupt and a threat to our democracy," Steyer said in the ad. "Since then, over eight million people, almost every Democratic presidential candidate, and over half the Democrats in the House of Representatives support impeachment."
"Mueller's investigation exposed crimes and cover-up," Steyer continued. "And now this week, the House Judiciary Committee is supposed to start a formal impeachment proceeding.... No one should be above the law. Not even you, Donald."
The new ad campaign comes as Steyer recently secured a spot on the Democratic National Committee debate stage in October by gaining his fourth qualifying on Sunday, September 8.
