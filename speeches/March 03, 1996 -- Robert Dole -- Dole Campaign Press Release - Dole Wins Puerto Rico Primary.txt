    Momentum Building as GOP Front-runner Enters Critical Week
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole today won the Puerto Rico Republican primary, sweeping all fourteen delegates in the, winner- take-all contest. Combined with Dole's massive South Carolina victory on Saturday, the Puerto Rico win is expected to give further momentum to the GOP front-runner as the campaign enters a critical week.
"You always want to start a week like this with a bang," said Dole Campaign Manager Scott Reed on the results, "and we clearly did that: two days, two big wins. We'd like to thank all of the voters of Puerto Rico for their hard work and support in this outstanding win. Our campaign seems to be surging at just the right time, and we plan to build on this victory with strong showings on Tuesday and Thursday as we enter a critical period in this primary season."
Senator Dole had the support of most of the GOP leadership in Puerto Rico. His committee included Republican Party Chairman Luis Ferre, National Committeeman Edison Misla, National Committeewoman Zory Fonalledas, executive director Cesar Cabrera, campaign vice Eduardo Ballori, State Senator Freddy Valentin, and Finance Chairman Juan Woodroffe. Dole was also supported by commonwealth Secretary of State Norma Burgos, President of the Senate Roberto Rexach, and Speaker of the House Zaida Hernandez.
