    Â Wyoming Senator John Barrasso today made the following statement on the recent leaks of sensitive national security information:
"Even senior Obama aides like David Axelrod are not denying that the Obama White House was responsible for leaking highly sensitive classified information, putting U.S. national security at risk and endangering the brave men and women in uniform who serve our country abroad. The buck stops with President Obama, and I urge him to initiate an immediate independent investigation into these dangerous disclosures."
