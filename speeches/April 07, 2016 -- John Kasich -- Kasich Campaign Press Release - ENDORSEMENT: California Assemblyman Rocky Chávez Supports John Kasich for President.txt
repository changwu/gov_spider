    Today California Assemblyman Rocky Ch치vez announced his support for Gov. John Kasich for President and joined the Kasich for America leadership team in California.
Said Ch치vez, "Our men and women in uniform deserve a Commander-in-Chief with the experience to lead on Day One, and only John Kasich has that experience. Our job creators need a leader who can partner with them, not stand in their way, by balancing the federal budget and cutting taxes. Only John Kasich has a realistic plan to create a jobs-friendly climate. Most important, poll after poll confirms that he is the only Republican candidate who can actually win in a general election. He's run a campaign with the dignity befitting a great leader, and I'm proud to stand with him as we spread his message throughout California."

Ch치vez is a longtime public servant who rose to the rank of Colonel during his 28 years as a U.S. Marine. Since 2012 he has represented California's 76th Assembly District, which includes Camp Pendleton, Carlsbad, Encinitas, Oceanside and Vista. The Oceanside resident has also served on the Oceanside City Council and as Undersecretary of the California Department of Veterans Affairs in Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's administration.
Said Kasich, "Assemblyman Ch치vez has devoted his career to serving his country and his state. I'm honored to receive his support. There's no doubt that Rocky's deep understanding of issues that matter to Californians will be a tremendous asset to us moving forward in the primary."
