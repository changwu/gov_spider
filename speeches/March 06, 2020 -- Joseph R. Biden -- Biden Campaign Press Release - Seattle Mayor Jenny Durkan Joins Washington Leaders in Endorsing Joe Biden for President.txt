    Today, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan joined elected officials and community leaders in endorsing Joe Biden for President.
"Working under President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden for five years I saw first hand how Joe Biden fought for working people, LGBTQ equality, health care and criminal justice reform," said Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan. "I know as President, Joe Biden will sustain that fight and deliver on our progressive values to address climate changes, reduce gun violence, expand access to college and opportunity, and invest in affordable housing. Joe Biden believes in the promise of America and knows how to make that promise real."
