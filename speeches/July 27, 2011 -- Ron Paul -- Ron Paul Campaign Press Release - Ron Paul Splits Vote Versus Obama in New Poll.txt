    Gets 50 percent against President according to new Harris survey
LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” According to a newly released survey from Harris Interactive, 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul splits the vote in half versus President Obama, doing better than a majority of the other Republican contenders. The poll gives Paul 50 percent of the vote versus the president in a head to head match up.
"Right now, the push for true leadership is gaining momentum," said Ron Paul 2012 Campaign Manager, John Tate. "In poll after poll, Americans are eager for real change, they are sick of the status quo, and looking for a leader who stands for constitutionally limited government and individual liberty. Ron Paul is that leader."
Just last week, a Rasmussen survey showed Paul only 4 points behind Obama in a match between the two. In a similar head to head survey from last year done by Rasmussen, Paul actually drew a statistical dead heat with the president. And earlier this year in a survey by CNN he did the best out of the other Republicans put up against Obama in a head to head poll.
