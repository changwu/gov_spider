SCRIPT - "It Won't"
Senator Bob Casey: In towns like yours and mine, families are struggling with bills they can't afford and jobs moving away.
It has to change - but it won't until we change Washington.
That's why I believe in Barack Obama.
I've worked with him. I've seen him stand up to the lobbyists and special interestsâ€¦
And like us, he's tired of the political games and division that stops anything from getting done.
Barack Obama knows Pennsylvania's hurting. He can unite America and bring real change.
