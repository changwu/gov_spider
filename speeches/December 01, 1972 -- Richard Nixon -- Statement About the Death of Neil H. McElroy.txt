    WITH the death of Neil H. McElroy, the United States has lost an outstanding citizen, the American people have lost a dedicated public servant, and I have lost a valued friend and associate.
Neil McElroy served his country in many ways. He was a highly successful executive, an active civic and community leader, a strong and resourceful Secretary of Defense in the Eisenhower Administration, and--most recently--a very effective chairman for the President's Commission on School Finance.
To all of his undertakings, he brought the gifts of high character and keen intelligence. Mrs. Nixon and I are deeply grateful for his life and deeply saddened by his death. We extend our profound sympathy to the members of his family.
