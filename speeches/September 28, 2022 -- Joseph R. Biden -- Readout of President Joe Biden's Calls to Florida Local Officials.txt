    President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. today made separate calls to the Mayors of Fort Myers, Cape Coral, Sarasota and the Chair of Charlotte County, Florida to let them know their communities have the full force of the Federal government behind them as Hurricane Ian makes landfall in Florida. President Biden was able to reach Mayor Kevin Anderson, and they discussed Fort Myers' ongoing needs including support for the elderly members of the community, families that live in mobile homes and other community members who are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of the storm.
