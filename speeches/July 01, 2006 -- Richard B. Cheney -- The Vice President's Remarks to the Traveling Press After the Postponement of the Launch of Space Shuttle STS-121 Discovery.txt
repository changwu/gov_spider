Q: Disappointed?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Sure. I was down here -- when I was a member of Congress, early in the program in the '80s -- really looking forward to today; especially looking forward to having my grandkids here. But it's not to be today, and maybe it'll work tomorrow.
Q: What was their impression so far, the girls?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Very impressed. They're all walking around with patches from the mission, got the mission design on them and are very excited. But we'll have to bring them back another day.
Q: They were asking some good questions on their tour?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, they're all good questions. I'm no expert by any means, but -- no, it's a great program. And it's important we keep going, and keep our space program going. And this, of course, is a continuing part of that. We got to see a tour of the Atlantis, which is the next ship they're getting ready to launch. So at least we got to see that.
Q: And you get to see NASCAR, right?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we get to see NASCAR. That's the next stop.
Q: Will this be your first NASCAR race?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: It will be, as a matter of fact, yes -- first time I've actually attended a race. I've been to tracks before, but it's the first time I've been to an actual race.
Q: Well, ride on Space Mountain and you get the Florida experience right there in one trip.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: All right, see you later.
Q: Thanks, Mr. Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: You bet.
