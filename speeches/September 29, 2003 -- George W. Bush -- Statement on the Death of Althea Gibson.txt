    Althea Gibson rose above segregation and discrimination to become a world-class tennis player. In 1957 and 1958, she won both Wimbledon and the United States Open, displaying her remarkable spirit, determination, and skill. In breaking the racial barrier in championship tennis, she furthered America's progress in recognizing individuals for their character and abilities, not their skin color. Laura and I send our prayers and condolences to the family and friends of Althea Gibson.
