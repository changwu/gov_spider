    Nebraska Congressman Lee Terry made the following statement on Mitt Romney's vision for America as an energy superpower:
"The difference between President Obama and Governor Romney can be summed up by their approach to the Keystone pipeline.  Where President Obama has stalled and used every excuse in the book to put off this important project, Governor Romney couldn't be clearer in his commitment to seeing it through to completion.  Where President Obama plays political games with our energy security—emboldening countries which do not have our best interests at heart, Governor Romney has laid out a clear plan to maximize North American resources and to lessen our dependence on unfriendly nations.  It is time for new leadership."
