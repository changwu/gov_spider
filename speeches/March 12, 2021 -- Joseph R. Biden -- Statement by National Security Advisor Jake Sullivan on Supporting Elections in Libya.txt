    On behalf of President Biden, I congratulate the Libyan people on establishing a Government of National Unity that will guide Libya to national elections on December 24, 2021.
All Libyans deserve this chance to choose their leaders through the democratic process, reestablish their sovereignty free from foreign interference and violence, and secure a brighter future after painful years of civil conflict and political upheaval. The United States stands with all those committed to elections and, in support of United Nations mediation and together with our international partners, we will promote accountability for any parties that seek to undermine the electoral roadmap Libyans have established.
The empty logic of military escalation has failed. It is long past time for foreign countries sending mercenaries and weapons that harm innocent Libyans to begin their withdrawal and respect the resounding Libyan calls for a peaceful political transition. Now is the opportunity for Libyans to lay down their arms, resolve their differences peacefully, subscribe to a new era of law and order, and write for themselves a more stable and prosperous chapter in their history.
