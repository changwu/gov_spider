    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, the Supplementary Protocol Modifying and Supplementing the Convention between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Belgium for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, together with a related exchange of notes. The Supplementary Protocol and the exchange of notes were signed at Washington on December 31, 1987. I also transmit for the information of the Senate the report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol.
Pending the successful conclusion of a comprehensive new income tax convention, the Supplementary Protocol will make certain improvements in the existing convention intended to promote the development of economic relations between the United States and Belgium.
It is most desirable that this Protocol be considered by the Senate as soon as possible and that the Senate give advice and consent to ratification.
