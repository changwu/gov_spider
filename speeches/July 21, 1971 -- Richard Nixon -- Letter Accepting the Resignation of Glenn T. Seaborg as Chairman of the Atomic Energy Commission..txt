    Dear Glenn:
It is with special regret that I accept your resignation as Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission effective, as you have requested, upon a date to be determined. However, I would hope that you will continue as planned to head our Delegations to the Soviet Union in August and to Geneva and Vienna in September, even if your successor is confirmed and sworn in before the date of these trips. I would also hope that you could remain as a consultant for some time after these meetings are completed to insure the smoothest possible transition.
For ten years, three Presidents have had the benefit of your wisdom and counsel in making decisions which, increasingly, affect the daily lives and well-being of our fellow citizens. Thanks in large measure to your outstanding leadership during this time, the United States has maintained its position of preeminence in the field of atomic energy.
As a world famous chemist, scholar, and administrator, you have contributed in a unique and meaningful way to far greater understanding and application of the miracles of the atom. As you return to academic life, I am confident that your activities will bring new benefits to mankind while reflecting the highest credit upon yourself and your country. You may be certain that my warmest wishes and the deep admiration of your colleagues go with you.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[Honorable Glenn T. Seaborg, Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission, Washington, D.C. 20545]
