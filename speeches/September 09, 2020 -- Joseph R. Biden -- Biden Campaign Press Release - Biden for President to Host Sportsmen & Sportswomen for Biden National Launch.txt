    On Thursday, September 10, Biden for President will host the first Sportsmen & Sportswomen for Biden national event after launching last week via an exclusive story in MLive.com and an ensuing press release. This event will highlight the importance of supporting Joe Biden for President and explain why Joe will be a much better President for hunters, anglers, and those who enjoy the outdoors than Donald Trump.
The volunteer leaders of Sportsmen & Sportswomen will discuss how they're going to work over the next 50+ days to make sure that the community of hunting, angling, and outdoor enthusiasts know that they'll have a champion in the White House if they elect Joe Biden. The event will also serve as the launch event for the Ohio Sportsmen & Sportswomen for Biden Leadership Council.
Special guests appearing in the event will include Ryan Busse, longtime North American Board Chair of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, who will serve as the host of the meeting; U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM); Collin O'Mara, CEO of the National Wildlife Federation Action Fund; Congressman Tim Ryan (D-OH) and Sean Logan, former Director of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources.
