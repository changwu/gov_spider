Victor Davis Hanson was a very good and interesting guest of Mark Levin on @FoxNews. He wrote a highly touted book called 'The Second World Wars' and a new book will soon be coming out called 'The Case For Trump.' Recommend both. @marklevinshowRetweets: 14504Favorites: 61137

The large and violent French protests don't take into account how badly the United States has been treated on Trade by the European Union or on fair and reasonable payments for our GREAT military protection. Both of these topics must be remedied soon.Retweets: 17939Favorites: 76443

Would be very SMART if Mexico would stop the Caravans long before they get to our Southern Border or if originating countries would not let them form (it is a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in U.S. No longer). Dems created this problem. No crossings!Retweets: 30904Favorites: 128893

General Anthony Tata: 'President Trump is a man of his word & he said he was going to be tough on the Border and he is tough on the Border. He has rightfully strengthened the Border in the face of an unprecedented threat. It's the right move by President Trump.' Thanks General!Retweets: 21474Favorites: 84645

Europe has to pay their fair share for Military Protection. The European Union for many years has taken advantage of us on Trade and then they don't live up to their Military commitment through NATO. Things must change fast!Retweets: 21522Favorites: 88108

Clinton Foundation donations drop 42% - which shows that they illegally played the power game. They monetized their political influence through the Foundation. 'During her tenure the State Department was put in the service of the Clinton Foundation.' Andrew McCarthyRetweets: 36864Favorites: 121797
