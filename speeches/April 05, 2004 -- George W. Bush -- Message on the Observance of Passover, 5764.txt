    I send greetings to those observing Passover, beginning at sundown on April 5.
Freedom is God's gift to every man and woman. During Passover, Jewish people celebrate their historic liberation from slavery. This joyous eight-day observance is testimony to the power of good to overcome evil and is an opportunity for Jews to share the message of God's mercy. By reading the Haggadah, which tells the story of the Exodus and explains the traditional Passover Seder, Jewish children learn about their proud heritage and the importance of faith, courage, endurance, and love.
Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a Happy Passover.
