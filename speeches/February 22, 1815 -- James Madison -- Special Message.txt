    To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
I lay before Congress copies of two ratified treaties which were entered into on the part of the United States, one on the 22d day of July, 1814, with the several tribes of Indians called the Wyandots, Delawares, Shawanees, Senakas, and Miamies; the other on the 9th day of August, 1814, with the Creek Nation of Indians.
It is referred to the consideration of Congress how far legislative provisions may be necessary for carrying any part of these stipulations into effect.
JAMES MADISON.
