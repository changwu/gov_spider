    Former Green Bay Packers defensive end, Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila, known as "KGB" to his fans, is endorsing Rick Santorum for President of the United States, the campaign announced today.
"Football taught me a lot," Gbaja-Biamila said. "One of the game's greatest lessons is that we play to win, and we play until it is over. I am endorsing Rick Santorum for president because he is a solid leader that represents the timeless values that made America good and prosperous. Rick Santorum is also the only person who can beat Barack Obama in November. While some may want to declare the game over, the reality is, it's not even half-time yet. 'Game on!'"
KGB was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in 2000, where he continues to be the all-time sack leader, holding the record for sacks with the Packers with 74 and a half.
KGB left the Packers after nine years and is unofficially retired from the NFL. He lives in Green Bay with his wife, Eileen, and sons, Rashid, Ali, Jedi, Judah, Kabeer Jr. and Immanuel.
