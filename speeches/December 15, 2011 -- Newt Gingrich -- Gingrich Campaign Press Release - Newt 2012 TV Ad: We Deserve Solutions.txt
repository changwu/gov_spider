    Des Moines, IA - On the same day of the last Republican debate before the Iowa caucuses, Newt 2012 is releasing a new television advertisement which will air in Iowa titled "We Deserve Solutions".
The script for the ad is as follows:
"These are challenging and important times for America. We want and deserve solutions. Others seem to be more focused on attacks rather than moving the country forward. That's up to them.
"I believe bold ideas and new solutions will unleash America's creative spirit. When I was Speaker, our budget was balanced and 11 million jobs were created. We can do it again and rebuild the America we love. I'm Newt Gingrich and I approve this message."

The advertisement builds upon Newt's commitment to running a positive, solutions oriented campaign and sticks to his pledge not to run attack ads, while still defending against false attacks and reminding voters of Newt's record as conservative reformer.
Watch the campaign's first television ad, Rebuilding the America We Love.
