Tomorrow families across our Nation will gather to celebrate the Fourth of July. As we do we will think of the men & women serving overseas at this very moment far away from their families protecting America - & we will thank GOD for blessing us with these incredible HEROES! https://t.co/FQ1D7oEta2Retweets: 20776Favorites: 90767

The OPEC Monopoly must remember that gas prices are up & they are doing little to help. If anything they are driving prices higher as the United States defends many of their members for very little $'s. This must be a two way street. REDUCE PRICING NOW!Retweets: 26956Favorites: 114781
