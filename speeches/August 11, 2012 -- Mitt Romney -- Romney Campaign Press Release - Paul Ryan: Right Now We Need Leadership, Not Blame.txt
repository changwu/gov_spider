REP. PAUL RYAN: "Now, we are witnessing a nation in debt, further in doubt, deeper in despair. Now, we are seeing a country where after the recession the so-called recovery is the worst we have seen in 70 years. Unemployment above 8% the entire time. We have had the largest deficits and the biggest government since World War II. Nearly one out of six Americans today is living in poverty. That is the worst we have seen in a generation. Household incomes are down. Unemployment is up. You know what the good news is? It doesn't have to be this way. We can turn this thing around. We can get this right. You know how we do that? We elect a leader. We elect a leader. Because right now we need leadership. We don't need attack. We don't need blame. We need leadership. We need someone of principle. Someone of achievement. Someone of integrity. That man is standing next to me. His name is Mitt Romney and he is going be the next President of the United States!"
