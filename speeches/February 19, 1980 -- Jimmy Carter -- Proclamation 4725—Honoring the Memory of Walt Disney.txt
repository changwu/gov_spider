  A Proclamation

In the world of entertainment no name is more widely known than that of Walt Disney. For nearly fifty years, his creations brought us laughter and love, joy and gladness. The products of his imagination will enthrall and delight many more generations of children of all ages in every country on earth.
The House of Representatives, by a joint resolution of February 13, 1980, has requested the President to issue a proclamation honoring the memory of Walt Disney for his contribution to the American dream.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of this Nation to recall the accomplishments of Walt Disney and to honor his memory on February 19, 1980.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.

JIMMY CARTER
