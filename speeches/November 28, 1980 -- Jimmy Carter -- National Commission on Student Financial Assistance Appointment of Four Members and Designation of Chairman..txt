    The President has appointed four members to the National Commission on Student Financial Assistance, a new commission created by the Education Amendments of 1980 to study a wide range of issues dealing with financial aid for postsecondary education.
The Commission will submit recommendations to the President and Congress on matters such as appropriate means of student loan subsidization, the relationship between differing forms of aid, and the general impact of Federal student aid programs.
The President designated Congressman William D. Ford, of Michigan, as Chairman of the Commission. Mr. Ford is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Postsecondary Education. He was instrumental in writing and passing the Education Amendments.
The other members appointed by the President are:
ALPHONSE JACKSON, JR., of Louisiana, a member of the State legislature and president of a public relations and advertising firm. A former classroom teacher, Mr. Jackson was the first black from Louisiana to serve on the board of the National Education Association.
MARCELLA MAXWELL, of New York, dean of Continuing Education and Community Outreach at Medgar Evers College. She is also chairperson of the New York City Commission on the Status of Women.
JOSEPH B. MONTOYA, of California, a State senator. He is vice chair of the Senate Education Committee, chairman of the Select Committee on Occupational Preparation and Placement, and a former member of the California Advisory Committee on Vocational Education.
Four other members of the Commission will be selected by the President pro ternpore of the Senate and four by the Speaker of the House.
