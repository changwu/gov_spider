Last night, Marco dropped this bombshell quote on Donald Trump:
Rubio: If Trump hadn't inherited $200 million, he'd be selling watches in Manhattan https://t.co/jHaIMgkiAR @CNNPolitics

To hammer the point home, Team Marco added a "Trump Watch" to the store:

Needless to say, people can't stop talking about the watch, which like many things Trump, is completely made up.
From the Rubio store: "You won't actually get a broken Trump watch, but your $10 donation will help Marco stop him" https://t.co/ooxvgq7DpL

So no, you don't actually get a broken watch, but if you buy one you will be helping Marco stop a con artist from becoming our nominee!
