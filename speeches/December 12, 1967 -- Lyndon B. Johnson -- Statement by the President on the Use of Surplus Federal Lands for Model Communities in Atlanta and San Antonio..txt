    THE PROPERTY of the Federal Government belongs to all of the people.
Wherever possible, surplus land should be turned to their benefit.
The Federal Government will cooperate fully with private enterprise and State and local government to transform these surplus and idle lands into new communities.
The American people, I believe, want to see government and private enterprise join together to build decent homes for citizens who have never known their comfort, and to provide new training opportunities for those who want to improve their lives.
The projects in Atlanta and San Antonio are directed to those goals. We hope in the months ahead to see more communities for the people take shape on surplus Federal land.
