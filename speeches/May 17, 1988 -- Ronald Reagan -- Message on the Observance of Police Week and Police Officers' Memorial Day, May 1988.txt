    There can be no more noble vocation than the protection of one's fellow citizens. Police Week, and in particular Police Officers' Memorial Day, affords each one of us the yearly opportunity to reflect upon the countless contributions made by our Nation's police officers.
No single group is more fully committed to the well-being of their fellow Americans and to the faithful discharge of duty than our law enforcement personnel. Danger is a routine part of their job, and all too often we lose one of these valiant men and women to the sickness that is crime.
I invite all Americans to honor the memories of these courageous heroes on Police Officers' Memorial Day. Our Nation is blessed with the most able, professional, and caring peace officers in the world. What better time to show our deep appreciation for their selfless devotion than during Police Week.
