    Sir:
I ask the Congress to consider proposed supplemental appropriations and amendments to pending supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year 1981 in the amount of $4,980,298,000 for program purposes, and reductions in the requests to cover the October 1980 Federal pay raise totalling $67,608,000; amendments reducing requests for appropriations for fiscal year 1982 by $22,134,673,463; and an amendment reducing a request for an advance appropriation for the fiscal year 1984 by $77,000,000.
These requests are part of my Economic Recovery Program.
The details of these proposals are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and observations.
Respectfully,
RONALD REAGAN
