    "Ideologies Are Not Defeated With Guns, They Are Defeated By Better Ideas" â€” President Obama on ISIS
It is astonishing to hear President Obama say that ISIS won't be defeated by guns, rather by changing 'hearts and minds.' Well, Mr. President, guns help.
President Obama won't call a spade a spade, which is why he has no strategy to defeat ISIS. The result is that his new timeline to defeat ISIS is a generation. This is not acceptable.
The United States needs a president who will identify our enemy and rid the world of them and their ideas.
