    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Sen. Warner (R) and Sen. Trible (R) Virginia)
The Administration opposes enactment of S.J. Res. 187, which would designate the property known as Red Hill as a national memorial to Patrick Henry. Three nationally significant historical properties associated with Patrick Henry's achievements have already been recognized by the National Park Service and designated as national historic landmarks. Any one of these properties would be an appropriate national memorial to Patrick Henry because, contrary to Red Hill, each of them meets the National Park Service's standards of historical integrity.
