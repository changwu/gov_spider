    Urbandale, IA - Rick Santorum and the Rick Santorum for President Campaign made the following statement in reaction to the passing of Iowa campaign volunteer and Republican activist, Wendy Jensen.
Rick Santorum said: "The news of Wendy's passing is absolutely heartbreaking. I just had the opportunity to visit with Wendy on Wednesday evening, where she was where she always was - hard at work volunteering for our campaign. She was absolutely amazing. Wendy may have been small in stature, but she had the heart of a lion. My deep condolences go out to her entire family and loved ones on her passing. She will be dearly missed."
Cody Brown, Iowa State Director for the Rick Santorum for President Campaign, said: "Among the rewarding aspects of political campaigns is the opportunity to meet good people and build lasting relationships. We had the benefit and privilege to have met Wendy Jensen who became an integral part of our tight knit Santorum 'family.' We knew her not only as our top phone banker, but as our campaign's delight and an inspiration for us all."
