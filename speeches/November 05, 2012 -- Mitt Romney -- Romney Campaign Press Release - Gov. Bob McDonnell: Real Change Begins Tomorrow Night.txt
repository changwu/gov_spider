    Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell made the following statement on Mitt Romney's plan for real change:
"Thanks in part to the hard work and support of the people of Virginia, Mitt Romney is going to win this election and, when he does, America will take its first steps down a positive, new path. It is a path away from chronically high unemployment, weak leadership, and trillion-dollar deficits, and toward a strong foreign policy, energy independence, and a booming, job-creating economy. Americans deserve a future that's even brighter than our past - and the peace of the world depends upon another American Century. The change our country has been waiting for begins on November 6. All Mitt Romney needs now is our votes. As president, he will get America out of debt, and Americans back to work."
