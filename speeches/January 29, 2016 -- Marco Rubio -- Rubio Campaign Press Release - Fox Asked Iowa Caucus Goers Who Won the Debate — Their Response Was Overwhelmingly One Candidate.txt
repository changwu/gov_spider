With the Iowa Caucus just three days away, last night's Fox News debate in Des Moines was a big moment.
So who won the debate according to Iowa caucus goers?

 
Frank Luntz: What's your reaction? I want to show the audience at home, how many of you walked in here supporting Marco Rubio? Raise your hands…One, two, three of you. How many of you are going home most likely to vote for Rubio? Raise your hands. That's the impact of a single debate. Give me a word or phrase to describe Rubio.
Focus Group Members: Organized. Confident. Presidential. Powerful. Prepared. Eloquent. Credible. Game-changer. Electable . . .

Marco's debate dominance didn't go unnoticed by Iowans, and Iowans' support of Marco didn't go unnoticed by others:

With the final debate before Iowa wrapped up, everything Team Marco has been fighting for is right around the corner.
Voting begins in 3 days, and Marco has the momentum.
