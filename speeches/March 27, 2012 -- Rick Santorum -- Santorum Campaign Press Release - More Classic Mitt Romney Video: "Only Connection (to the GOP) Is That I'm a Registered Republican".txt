    Verona, PA - As the Republican Presidential Primary turns to Wisconsin, the birthplace of the Republican Party, it is important to remember that former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney characterized his only connection to the Republican Party was his republican registration: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6ccdyM09pY
Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said: "No one should be surprised by Mitt Romney's confession that he's an opportunist. Just last week Governor Romney himself said he was 'running AS a conservative' clearly exposing that Governor Romney will run AS whatever it takes to get votes. First he ran AS liberal 'left of Ted Kennedy', then he ran AS a moderate, then he ran AS a conservative - and now he's back to running AS a moderate while claiming to run 'AS a conservative'. Confused? So is America.
"On the other hand - Rick Santorum IS a conservative republican. Voters trust Rick because they know his views are unshakable and etched in stone. All the establishment support and money hasn't been able to buy Mitt Romney the Republican nomination because he simply doesn't have the core convictions - and voters can see that."
