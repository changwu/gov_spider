    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Reps. Aspin (D) Wisconsin and Dickinson (R) Alabama)
The Administration supports the level of Defense funding authorized in H.R. 1872, which is consistent with the compromise deficit reduction agreement approved by the Senate. The Administration will, however, seek to have certain provisions of the bill modified to more closely conform to certain details of its request.
