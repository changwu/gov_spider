    Dear Zoe:
I have received your letter asking that I withdraw your nomination as Attorney General of the United States from further consideration by the Senate. With sadness, I accept your request that the nomination be withdrawn.
You are an exceptionally gifted attorney, and a person of great decency and integrity. You have responded to the call of public service with energy and a firm dedication to the mission of the Justice Department. I realize that it was your candid disclosure of the child care matter that led to the circumstances we face today. I believe that the concerns raised about your child care situation were unique to the position of Attorney General.
You are highly qualified to be Attorney General. Your stated goals for a nonpartisan, independent and strongly managed Department of Justice were fully in accord with my own. I believe you would have been a fine Attorney General.
Hillary and I value your and Paul's friendship. We look forward to seeing you often. I hope that you will be available for other assignments for your country in my Administration.
Sincerely,
BILL CLINTON
