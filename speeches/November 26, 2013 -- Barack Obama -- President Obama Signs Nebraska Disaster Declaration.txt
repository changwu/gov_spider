Federal funding is available to state and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms, winter storms, tornadoes, and flooding in the counties of Adams, Dawes, Dixon, Howard, Sheridan, Sherman, Sioux, Thurston, and Wayne.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
