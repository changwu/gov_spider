    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I have today, pursuant to section 673b of title 10, United States Code, authorized the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service within the Department of the Navy, to order to active duty any units, and any individual members not assigned to a unit organized to serve as a unit, of the Selected Reserve. The deployment of United States forces to conduct operational missions to restore the civilian government in Haiti necessitates this action.
A copy of the Executive order implementing this action is attached.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
