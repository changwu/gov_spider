    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Florio (D) New Jersey and two others)
The Administration supports the objective of H.R. 2205, to establish a memorial to honor those Americans who served in the Korean War. The Administration opposes H.R. 2205, however, solely because it requires Federal funds to be used for construction of the memorial, which is contrary to longstanding congressional and Executive policy of requiring private funding of such memorials, the most notable recent example being the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
