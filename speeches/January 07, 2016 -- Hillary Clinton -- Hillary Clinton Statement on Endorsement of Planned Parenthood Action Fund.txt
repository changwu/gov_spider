    Hillary Clinton released the following statement in response to earning the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund:
"As a lifelong Planned Parenthood supporter, I'm honored to have the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. There has never been a more important election when it comes to women's health and reproductive rights—and Planned Parenthood's patients, providers, and advocates across the country are a crucial line of defense against the dangerous agenda being advanced by every Republican candidate for president.
"This week was a jarring reminder of what's at stake in 2016. For the first time ever, the United States House and Senate passed a bill to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal the Affordable Care Act. Thankfully, President Obama will exercise his veto power to stop the Republicans from cutting off women, men, and young people from vital health care services at Planned Parenthood—including cancer screenings, well-woman exams, and STI and HIV tests—and taking away health coverage from 18 million people. Any of the Republican candidates will proudly sign that bill into law if they win. We can't let that happen.
"We need a president who has what it takes to stop Republicans from defunding Planned Parenthood and taking away a woman's right to basic health care. If I'm elected, I will be that president. I've fought for women and families my entire life, and I refuse to let anyone rip away the progress we've made. I will defend against attacks on reproductive health care, and protect access to affordable contraception and safe and legal abortion across the country. I will fight to ensure access to reproductive health care regardless of income, national origin, race, or ZIP code. And I will be a champion for women and families—just as Planned Parenthood has been for nearly a century."
