As Hurricane Hanna ravages Southeast Texas, the situation has become far more precarious. The pandemic has claimed the lives of more than 5,700 Texans, positive COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations continue to climb, and hotspots are becoming harder and harder to contain. Both the continued COVID-19 surges and Hurricane Hanna's impact must be met with swift action from the state and federal government. Mr. President, now isn't the time for politicking or photo-ops. Texans need a President with the experience and vision to fight for families no matter how many catastrophes reach our shores.
