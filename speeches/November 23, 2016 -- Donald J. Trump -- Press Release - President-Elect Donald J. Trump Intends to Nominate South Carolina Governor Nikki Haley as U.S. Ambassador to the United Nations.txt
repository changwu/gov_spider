    (New York, NY) â€“ President-elect Donald J. Trump today announced his intent to nominate Governor Nikki Haley (R-SC) as the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations, a cabinet-level position in the Trump-Pence Administration.
Governor Haley is one of the most universally respected governors in the country. After working at her family's business, Governor Haley turned her focus to economic development and has traveled abroad to negotiate with international companies on behalf of South Carolina.

"Governor Haley has a proven track record of bringing people together regardless of background or party affiliation to move critical policies forward for the betterment of her state and our country," said President-elect Trump. "She is also a proven dealmaker, and we look to be making plenty of deals. She will be a great leader representing us on the world stage."
