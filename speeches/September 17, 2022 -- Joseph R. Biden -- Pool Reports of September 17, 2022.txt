Out of town pool report #1 - JBA departure + Truss UNGA bilat news
Good morning from JBA, where the Air & Space Expo is underway (pool can see the crowd a ways down the tarmac).
Marine One touched down at 10:17 a.m. and rolled to a stop a minute later in the usual spot.
POTUS and FLOTUS stepped down and walked across the tarmac (greeter info below). Both are wearing navy blue Air Force One jackets, which the WH said is to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Air Force tomorrow.
They waved to the pool and boarded using the main steps at 10:23 after a short pause to glance up the tarmac at the air show.
Staff followed up the front steps after, including Jake Sullivan (in blue jeans). Full list below.
We will be wheels up momentarily for the United Kingdom and London's Stanstead Airport. Flight time is roughly six hours.
Additionally, the WH confirms that the meeting with Prime Minister Liz Truss will not take place this weekend in the UK but next week in NYC: "The President will hold a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Truss on Wednesday in New York when both are attending UNGA."

Out of town pool report #4 - pool separated from motorcade
The pool van got separated from the motorcade just before 11 p.m somewhere in northeast London when the driver lagged too far behind. Unfortunate!
So we will not be tailing POTUS to the RON and are proceeding to the press RON. We will get word when he's arrived and pass that along soon.



September 17, 202223:32 BST

Out of town pool report #5 - RON arrival and lid
As the press van snaked it's way through King's Cross, at 11:28 p.m., we were informed by our wrangler that POTUS and FLOTUS have made it to the RON.
And we have a travel/photo lid.
