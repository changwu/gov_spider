    Des Moines, IA -- Today, the Obama Campaign announced an 88-member African American steering committee that will take a leadership role in outreach efforts to African Americans and Iowans statewide. Dedicated to building upon Senator Obama's grassroots movement for change, the African American steering committee will work to spread Senator Obama's message of hope throughout Iowa.
"The change our nation desperately needs on issues such as Iraq, health care, and education can only be made by a candidate who isn't afraid to challenge the conventional thinking in Washington, D.C." Iowa City Mayor Ross Wilburn said. "Barack Obama exercised good judgment when he spoke out against the Iraq war when it was politically unpopular to do so and again when he rejected campaign donations from PACs and federal lobbyists. Barack Obama is the candidate with the best combination of courage and judgment to strengthen our communities and lead our country, and that's why I'm proud to give him my support."
The steering committee will lead African Americans for Obama and reach out to Iowans to discuss Barack Obama's vision for changing our country. African Americans for Obama will hold statewide kickoff events this evening, which will include a conference call with Obama senior advisor Rick Wade.
"As a community organizer in Chicago's South Side, I learned first hand that it takes the hard work of everyday people coming together to create extraordinary change," Barack Obama said. "That's why I'm honored to have the support of these leaders in the African American community who have committed their time and effort to help us reach out to Iowans and who will play a vital role in our outreach efforts throughout the state."
Barack Obama has spent much of his career working in the African American community as a civil rights attorney, community organizer, Illinois State Senator representing Chicago's South Side, and the only African American U.S. Senator. Whether it is decrying the Bush Administration's botched response to Hurricane Katrina, promoting economic opportunity, working to improve our nation's education and health care systems or protecting the right to vote, Barack Obama has been a powerful and consistent advocate for the black community.
