    AUSTIN â€” Gov. Rick Perry today issued the following statement on today's news regarding the Federal Reserve's undisclosed bank loans:
"These outrageous secret federal loans to bailout big banks are why Americans are disgusted with business-as-usual Washington, the Federal Reserve and taxpayer-funded bailouts. The actions of Chairman Bernanke and Secretary Geithner have again proven that Washington insiders cannot be trusted to stop bailouts, protect taxpayers, or create jobs.
"My economic reform plans seriously overhaul Washington, end federal bailouts and cut government spending, regulations and taxes to put American job creation and our economy on the right track."
