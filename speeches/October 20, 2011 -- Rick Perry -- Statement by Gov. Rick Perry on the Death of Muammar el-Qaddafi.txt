    AUSTIN â€” Gov. Rick Perry today released the following statement on the death of Muammar el-Qaddafi:
"The death of Muammar el-Qaddafi is good news for the people of Libya. It should bring the end of conflict there, and help them move closer to elections and a real democracy.
"The United States should work closely with Libya to ensure the transition is successful, and that a stable, peaceful nation emerges.
"The U.S. must also take an active role in ensuring the security of any remaining stockpiles of Qaddafi's weapons. These weapons pose a real danger to the United States and our allies, and we cannot help secure them through simple observation."
