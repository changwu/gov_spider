    I commend the House for passing our budget. This budget continues to bring down the deficit and makes needed investments in our people and in our economy. Our commitment to fiscal discipline and targeted investments is paying off in strong economic growth and job creation. Working together, the Congress and this administration are building a stronger economy for today and a future of opportunity for our children.
