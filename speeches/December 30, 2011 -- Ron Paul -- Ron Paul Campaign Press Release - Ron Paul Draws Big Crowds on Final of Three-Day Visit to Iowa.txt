ANKENY, Iowa — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul attracted big crowds in three Western Iowa town hall meetings tonight, continuing a pattern of packing venues with supporters and undecided voters.
More than 220 people attended Paul's Plymouth County Town Hall Meeting in LeMars, where the 12-term Congressman from Texas spoke about how there could be no liberty without valuing life, and how no constitutional government could exist in the absence of a moral people. More than 175 people—a full-capacity crowd stacked up against the doorways—attended his Sioux County Town Hall Meeting held in Sioux Center where he spoke about economics and family. And a remarkable 275 people attended his Sioux City Town Hall Meeting to hear Paul's views concerning a strong national defense, private property, and lasting prosperity.
