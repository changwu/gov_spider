    I SPEAK for every American when I commend the statesmanship and restraint shown by the leaders of Pakistan and India in their acceptance of the cease-fire call of the United Nations Security Council. The leadership shown in both nations thus takes us a long step away from the terrible dangers which have threatened the subcontinent of Asia.
On behalf of the American people, I want to express our deep appreciation and gratitude to Secretary General U Thant for his fairness and firmness in the service of peace in these last weeks. I am especially proud of our own gifted Ambassador Arthur Goldberg and members of his new U.N. team. As President of the Security Council he has given his able and untiring support to the efforts of the Secretary General.
We now hope that both nations, in the spirit of the Security Council resolution, will move forward to peaceful settlement of their outstanding differences. The job of the U.N. has just begun. We will fully support it every step of the way by our actions and our words.
