    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today unveiled additional members of Rudy Giuliani's Justice Advisory Committee.
The Committee is chaired by former U.S. Solicitor General Ted Olson and is comprised of some of America's leading conservative scholars and practicing attorneys, many of whom Rudy Giuliani has known since his time serving as Associate Attorney General in Ronald Reagan's Justice Department.
"From his remarkable tenures as Associate Attorney General, U.S. Attorney and Mayor, Rudy Giuliani knows the importance of judges with a keen respect for the Tenth Amendment, for federalism, and for state and local authority," said Nicholas Quinn Rosenkranz, Associate Professor of Law at Georgetown University and a member of the Board of Visitors of the Federalist Society. "I believe that he would appoint judges like Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Roberts--who apply the law as written, who know the meaning of judicial restraint, and who know that the People, and not the judges, have the power to change the Constitution."
Members will advise Rudy Giuliani on a wide range of legal and policy issues including judicial appointments, tort reform and reducing frivolous lawsuits in our country.
