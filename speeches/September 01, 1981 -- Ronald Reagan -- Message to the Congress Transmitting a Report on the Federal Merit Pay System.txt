    To the Congress of the United States:
Supervisors and management officials in GS-13, 14, and 15 positions throughout the Federal Government will be converted to merit pay this October as required by Chapter 54, Title 5, U.S. Code, unless otherwise excluded by law.
Upon proper applications from the heads of affected agencies and upon the recommendation of the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, I have, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. ยง5401(b)(2)(B), excluded 44 agencies and units of agencies from coverage under the Merit Pay System on account of size and efficiency, emergency conditions, and comity with the Legislative and Judicial branches.
Attached is my report describing the agency or unit to be excluded and the reasons therefor.
