    Presidential Designation of Foreign Narcotics Kingpins
The President notified the Congress of the fourth set of determinations of drug traffickers who will be subject to the sanctions provided in the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act ("Kingpin Act"). This is the first year the President has identified foreign entities as kingpins.
This action underscores the President's determination to pursue narco-terrorists. This action also underscores the President's determination to do everything possible to fight drug traffickers, undermine their operations, and end the suffering that trade in illicit drugs inflicts on Americans and other people around the world.
The Kingpin Act, which became law in December 1999, targets, on a worldwide basis, significant foreign narcotics traffickers, their organizations, and operatives. Its fundamental objective is to deny these foreign individuals and entities access to the U.S. financial system and all trade and transactions involving U.S. companies and individuals. The Kingpin Act does not target the countries in which these foreign individuals and entities are operating or the governments of such countries.
The additional foreign individuals and entities that the President has determined are appropriate for sanctions pursuant to the Kingpin Act are:
Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno (Mexico)
Jose Albino Quintero Meraz (Mexico)
Hector Luis Palma Salazar (Mexico)
Leonardo Dias Mendonca (Brazil)
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Colombia) (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, "FARC")
United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Colombia) (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, "AUC")
United Wa State Army (Burma)
The initial list of foreign drug kingpins was released in June 2000, and the names just released are additions to that list.
