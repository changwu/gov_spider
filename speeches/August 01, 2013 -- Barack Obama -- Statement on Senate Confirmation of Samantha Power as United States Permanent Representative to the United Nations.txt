    I'm pleased that the Senate has confirmed Samantha Power as our next U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations by a strong bipartisan majority. As one of our country's leading foreign policy thinkers, Samantha knows that our Nation's interests are advanced with strong and principled American leadership. As a long-time champion of human rights and dignity, she will be a fierce advocate for universal rights, fundamental freedoms, and U.S. national interests. I'm grateful that Samantha will continue to be a vital member of my national security team, and I know that under her leadership, our U.N. Mission in New York will continue to represent American diplomacy at its best.
