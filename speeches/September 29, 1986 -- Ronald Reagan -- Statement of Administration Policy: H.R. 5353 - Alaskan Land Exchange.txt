    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
FINAL
(House)(Rep. Young (R) Alaska)
The Administration opposes H.R. 5353, because the value of the Federal land interests and other resources that the bill would require to be given to the Haida Corporation is greater than the value of the land that the Corporation would convey to the United States.
Thus, the bill is tantamount to a requirement for a grant to the Haida Native Corporation, which has already received its full entitlement under the Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act.
Such assistance would not be fair to other native corporations experiencing financial difficulties, and is unjustifiable in these times of fiscal constraint.
