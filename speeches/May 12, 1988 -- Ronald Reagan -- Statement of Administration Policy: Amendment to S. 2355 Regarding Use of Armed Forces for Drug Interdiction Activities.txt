    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(D'Amato (R) New York)
The Administration opposes enactment of this amendment, which would expand the role of the United States Armed Forces in drug interdiction in an inappropriate manner, but will work with the Congress to develop an acceptable alternative to the proposal now under consideration.
The Administration believes that in considering proposals of this nature it is essential that the United States' domestic law enforcement and national security requirements both be carefully considered and evaluated. Existing limitations on the involvement of the military in civilian law enforcement serve an important purpose in reminding us that the overriding mission of the Department of Defense is, and must continue to be, assuring the security of the Nation. It is imperative, therefore, that any further involvement of the Armed Forces in assisting in the effort to halt the flow of illegal drugs into the United States not detract from that mission. Likewise, we need to recognize the proper role of the military in our democratic society; the Armed Forces have generally and historically not engaged in civil law enforcement activities. The Administration would not object to an amendment that strikes a proper and measured balance between these concerns.
