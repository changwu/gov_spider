    Washington, DCâ€” Vice President Joe Biden today made the following statement on the new level of information now available on Recovery.gov:
"Unprecedented transparency has been one of the hallmarks of our implementation of the Recovery Act and the new interactive maps now available on Recovery.gov showing how Recovery dollars are moving to states, contractors, grantees and other recipients are an important next step in making a historic amount of information available to the public. I applaud the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board for taking advantage of the latest technology to provide the American people with an unprecedented look at their taxpayer dollars at work creating jobs and boosting the economy and look forward to seeing the amount of information on the website grow as we continue to implement the Act."
The new map detailing how states are putting Recovery Act funds to work can be viewed here: http://www.recovery.gov/?q=content/investments-state. The state map shows the amount of money that the Recovery Act has provided for each state (announced), the amount each state is putting to work (obligated) and the amount actually paid out (outlays). Visitors can click on a given state to view the spending in more detail.
The new series of maps detailing how Recovery Act funds are moving out to contractors, grantees and loan recipients can be viewed here: http://www.recovery.gov/?q=content/investment-award. The maps allow for sorting by state, amount and federal agency.
