    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to section 1 of title II of Public Law 65-24, ch. 30, 50 U.S.C. 191 and sections 201 and 301 of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq., United States Code, I hereby report that I have exercised my statutory authority to declare a national emergency in response to the Government of Cuba's destruction of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in international airspace north of Cuba.
In the proclamation (copy attached), I have authorized and directed the Secretary of Transportation to make and issue such rules and regulations that the Secretary may find appropriate to prevent unauthorized U.S. vessels from entering Cuban territorial waters.
I have authorized these rules and regulations as a result of the Government of Cuba's demonstrated willingness to use reckless force, including deadly force, in the ostensible enforcement of its sovereignty. I have determined that the unauthorized departure of vessels intending to enter Cuban territorial waters could jeopardize the safety of certain U.S. citizens and other persons residing in the United States and threaten a disturbance of international relations. I have, accordingly, declared a national emergency in response to these threats.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, March 1, 1996.
