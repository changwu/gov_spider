    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Kyl (R) AZ and Campbell (D) CO)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2006, but will work in the Senate to modify the bill's flawed definition of Indian tribes. In this regard, language should be deleted that would otherwise provide tribes that are not federally recognized with the protections afforded by this Act.
