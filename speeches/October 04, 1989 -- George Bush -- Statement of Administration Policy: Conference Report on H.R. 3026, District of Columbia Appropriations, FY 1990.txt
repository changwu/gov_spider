    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Sponsors: Whitten (D) , Mississippi; Dixon (D), California; Byrd (D), West Virginia; Adams (D), Washington)
The Administration objects strongly to H.R. 3026, the FY 1990 District of Columbia Appropriations bill, as reported by House and Senate conferees. The bill, as reported, would delete language included in the FY 1989 District of Columbia Appropriations Act that prohibits the use of appropriated funds for abortion except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term. In a letter dated August 2, 1989, the President indicated that the absence of this language would result in his veto of the bill.
The Administration urges the House and Senate to send the bill back to Committee with instructions to restore the FY 1989 abortion provision so that the President is presented with a bill that he can sign.
