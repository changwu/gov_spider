    President Bush will host Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson for a meeting at the White House on April 28, 2004. Sweden is a valued partner of the United States, particularly in Afghanistan, where Sweden plays a significant role in the reconstruction effort, and in Kosovo and Liberia, where Swedish troops contribute to security and stability. Sweden and the United States cooperate closely on a range of global challenges, such as combating the scourges of HIV/AIDS and trafficking in persons. The President looks forward to discussions with Prime Minister Persson on European security; Iraq; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; and support to calls for freedom, democracy, and reform throughout the Greater Middle East.
