  A Proclamation

Each year, workplace accidents kill over 11,000 Americans and injure an additional 1.9 million workers. These tragic accidents also cost American industry an estimated $33.4 billion in annual losses.
Today's public and private sector employers and employees recognize the need to safeguard the working place so that all may enjoy a productive and healthy environment. National Safety in the Workplace Week, supported by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States Department of Labor, the American Society of Safety Engineers, and the Associated General Contractors, presents an opportunity for all Americans to reaffirm our dedication to the protection of the health and safety of American workers.
When it comes to workplace safety, OSHA's slogan—"Job Safety? You Bet Your Life!"—is more than a catchy phrase. It is a watchword for everyone to remember. Each employer and worker in this country is responsible for keeping America's worksites safe and healthy, not during just one week in June but each and every day of the year.
The Congress, by House Joint Resolution 131, has designated the week beginning June 15, 1986, as "National Safety in the Workplace Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning June 15, 1986, as National Safety in the Workplace Week. I call upon all government agencies and the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth.

RONALD REAGAN
