A Proclamation
In 1986, the United States celebrates the twentieth anniversary of the establishment of the National Endowment for the Humanities. The overriding goal of this small but important Federal agency is the promotion of humanities scholarship and programming.
The study of the humanities increases our understanding of the great traditions of civilization and of the intellectual heritage of mankind. In partnerships with State and local governments, private foundations, and corporations, the National Endowment for the Humanities, over the past two decades, has provided critical leadership and direction for both individuals and institutions seeking to improve our understanding of the humanities.
As a Nation, we have benefitted from the fruits of this humanities programming in a variety of ways: through improvements in humanities education at all levels; through scholarly research at the cutting edge of contemporary issues in the humanities; and through programs and projects in museums, libraries, and the media that foster a heightened understanding of the humanities across America.
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 219, has designated the week beginning February 9, 1986, as "National Humanities Week, 1986" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning February 9, 1986, as National Humanities Week, 1986. I call upon the people of the United States to observe the week with appropriate conferences, programs, ceremonies, and activities recognizing the importance of the humanities in the lives of all Americans and acknowledging the significant role the National Endowment for the Humanities has played in sustaining and enriching our cultural heritage.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth.
RONALD REAGAN
