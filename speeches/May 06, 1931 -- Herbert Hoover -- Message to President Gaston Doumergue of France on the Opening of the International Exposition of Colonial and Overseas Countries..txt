IT AFFORDS ME special pleasure on the occasion of the opening of the International Colonial and Overseas Exposition to extend to Your Excellency my cordial greetings and to assure you of the best wishes of the United States for the success of the Exposition. From a historic as well as from a modern point of view the exhibits will have great educational value. France is to be congratulated on the enterprise and vision which have assembled in Paris so much of interest from such distant parts of the world.
