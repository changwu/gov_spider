    We regret the murder of Senator Benigno S. Aquino, Jr., in Manila, on August 21st. It is a cowardly and despicable act which the United States Government condemns in the strongest terms.
The U.S. Government trusts that the Government of the Philippines will swiftly and vigorously track down the perpetrators of this political assassination, bring them to justice, and punish them to the fullest extent of the law.
The U.S. Government extends our sympathy to his wife and children in Massachusetts and to the family and friends and supporters in the Philippines.
