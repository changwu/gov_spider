    Let me say first of all, I am so pleased to have Dick Spring here. And I'm pleased that he came across the ocean to visit with me and others in the United States who very much want this process to succeed.
I am delighted by the developments of the last several days and by all the efforts that have been made in the last few months. The United States is strongly supportive of this peace process. We want to reach out and work with all the elements in Ireland, in Northern Ireland. We want all the communities to feel a part of the peace process and to feel that there is a peace dividend. We want to continue to work with and support the work of the Government of Ireland and the Government of Great Britain. And we are prepared to take some steps to do whatever we can to help that now.
Dick is going to talk at greater length about some of the specific things we talked about here today, but the United States has tried to be a friend of peace in Ireland, and we will continue to do that. And we're very, very pleased by the developments.
