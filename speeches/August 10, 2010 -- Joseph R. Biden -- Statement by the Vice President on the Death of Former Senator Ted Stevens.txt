    My thoughts and prayers go out to Catherine and all the Stevens children, as well as to the families of those also lost today in Alaska. Jill and I had genuine affection for Ted. As Senators, he and I bonded over shared similar family tragedies, but we also celebrated life's great moments together too, like the births of our daughters a few days apart. We served together for more than 30 years, but more than that, he was my friend and I will miss him.
