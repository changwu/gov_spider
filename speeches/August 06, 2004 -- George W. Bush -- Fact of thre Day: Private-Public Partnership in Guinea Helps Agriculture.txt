    In Guinea, 80 percent of the population lives on subsistence farming, and poor agricultural practices have resulted in the rapid erosion of land. Together, Kraft and the U.S. government are helping local farmers and small businesses by helping to manage a growing cashew sector. The alliance will provide cashew farmers with the training and tools needed to manage the country's natural resources. This is a good example of private business, the U.S. government, and a developing country working together to foster economic and social development.
