    Laura and I are deeply saddened by the death of Jennifer Dunn. She was a good friend and compassionate leader. During her congressional career, Jennifer effectively promoted policies that enabled more people throughout our country to realize the American Dream. She was committed to reforming welfare, reducing taxes, and strengthening our health care system. She was a tireless advocate for free trade and worked to eliminate the death tax, believing that leadership on these issues would foster growth and prosperity for small businesses and communities. As a member of the House Republican leadership, Jennifer used her position to help strengthen women's rights and protect children.
After leaving Congress, Jennifer continued to be a strong advocate of commonsense conservative values.
Jennifer was most proud of her family. Our thoughts and prayers are with Keith, Bryant, Reagan, and Angus.
