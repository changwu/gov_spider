INVESTING IN FORGOTTEN COMMUNITIES: President Trump's policies are spurring investment to revitalize hurting communities and unleash their economic potential.

President Trump's historic tax cuts established Opportunity Zones to incentivize long-term investments in low-income communities nationwide.

There are 8,760 designated Opportunity Zones, home to nearly 35 million Americans in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and 5 Territories.
Opportunity Zones are projected to spur $100 billion in private investment in these communities.

The median family income in these communities is 37 percent below the State median.
