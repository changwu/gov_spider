    The President today met with Wan Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, from 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. Following the plenary meeting, Wan Li visited the Residence to greet Mrs. Bush.
The Chinese leader briefed the President on the outcome of the recent Sino-Soviet summit and on the student demonstrations in China. "We are strongly committed to democracy around the world," the President said. "It is the underpinning of our being as a nation. I urge nonviolence and restraint in your present situation. I urge that Voice of America not be jammed and that reporters be given open access."
The President told Chairman Wan that he remains personally committed to expanding the normal and constructive relations the United States enjoys with China. The world has a stake in China's economic progress, national security, and political vitality. The United States hopes to see the continuing implementation of economic and political reforms, which undoubtedly will also help advance these goals.
