    I HAVE a serious and growing concern over the outlook for congressional action during the remainder of 1976.
Time for action is rapidly dwindling. An enormous backlog of work is piling up on congressional desks. Important laws must be passed this year in many
areas:
--to cut taxes and to cut spending;
--to expand catastrophic health care program;
--to set up a national swine flu program;
--to limit court-ordered school busing;
--to attack crime and drugs; and
--to attack many other important matters.
This afternoon, I am sending to the Congress a special message urging prompt action on 74 proposals that I have sent to the Congress and are still waiting action.
I am also deeply concerned that at a time when the public's business has become so pressing, some Members of the Congress apparently want to turn the rest of this legislative schedule in this session into a political test of wills between one party in the Congress and another party in the White House. I do not think the Nation will be well served if partisanship is placed ahead of public service during the rest of this legislative schedule.
The people expect political differences. The people expect a high-level, spirited, political contest this fall. But our people also expect that those who have the privilege of occupying public offices and collecting public salaries should render a full measure of public service.
There must be no holiday on good government. I expect to meet that standard, and I trust the Congress will also.
