    (New York, NY) January 26th, 2016 â€” Today Donald J. Trump received Sheriff Joe Arpaio's endorsement. The Sheriff is well known for his hard-line stance on illegal immigration. Sheriff Arpaio joined Mr. Trump at his rally in Marshalltown, Iowa to voice his support less than one week before the Iowa Caucus.
Mr. Trump stated, "I have great respect for Sheriff Arpaio. We must restore law and order on the border and respect the men and women of our police forces. I thank him for his support of my policies and candidacy for President."
Sheriff Arpaio added, "Donald Trump is a leader. He produces results and is ready to get tough in order to protect American jobs and families. I have fought on the front lines to prevent illegal immigration. I know Donald Trump will stand with me and countless Americans to secure our border. I am proud to support him as the best candidate for President of the United States of America."
Mr. Trump has visited Arizona twice since announcing his campaign in June and Sheriff Arpaio has attended both rallies in Phoenix and Mesa where the Trump campaign hosted record crowds. Mr. Trump has a strong state operation in place and has been endorsed by several community leaders including Arizona State Treasurer Jeff DeWit.
Mr. Trump continues to lead all national and state polls with a significant lead in Arizona where the most recent poll out last week shows him with 38% support. He maintains a substantial lead in Iowa with great momentum heading into Monday's Caucus. Mr. Trump will be in South Carolina on Wednesday before returning to Iowa on Thursday for the seventh Republican Presidential debate in Des Moines, Iowa.
