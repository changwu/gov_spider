    Campaign encourages supporters to give back to community at rallies
Chicago, IL - The Obama for America campaign today announced that it would kick off community service events to benefit charitable organizations at each of the events on this weekend's tour with the Obamas and special guest Oprah Winfrey. The campaign is encouraging supporters to bring charitable goods for collection at the rallies or to donate those goods at local field offices. This week, Obama issued a "Call to Serve" and detailed his commitment to making national service a cause of his presidency in a policy address in Mt. Vernon, Iowa.
"As we work everyday to organize our way to victory, it's important that our campaign give back to the community," said campaign manager David Plouffe. "We've created a powerful grassroots base in the early states and across the country, and we believe asking our supporters to contribute a little will make a big difference for those in need."
