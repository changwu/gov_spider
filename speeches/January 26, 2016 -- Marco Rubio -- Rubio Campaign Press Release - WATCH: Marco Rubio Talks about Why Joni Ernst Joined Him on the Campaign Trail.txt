Yesterday, Iowa Senator Joni Ernst introduced Marco to a packed house in Des Moines, praising him as the right candidate to take on ISIS. 
Here's what he had to say about the event on Fox last night:
She promised the people of Iowa she would not be endorsing and I respect that very much. But we were glad to have her with us.
You know, the issue of national security is one that I care about deeply and she talked about how she trusted me on that, which is the most important thing a president does is to be commander-in-chief.
I'm very proud to be Joni's friend, to have supported her in the primary when she was running in a competitive field, because to me, she represents so much of what I hope the Republican Party will be about it in the 21st Century. So we were glad to have her with us. It really was a boost to us earlier this morning when a lot of Iowans turned out to hear her introduce me. 

With just days until the Iowa caucus, Iowans are recognizing that Marco's the right candidate to bring our party, and the country, into a New American Century.
