The "Ready to Lead in the West" tour will incorporate events in both urban and rural Nevada, involving visits from top campaign surrogates, as well as the candidate herself.
The first date of the tour begins in Las Vegas as Hillary takes the stage at the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) conference at Bally's. Additional details for August 9 will be released later this week.
During the dynamic tour, key supporters from the national campaign will also visit the state, reaching out to Nevadans who are ready for change.
