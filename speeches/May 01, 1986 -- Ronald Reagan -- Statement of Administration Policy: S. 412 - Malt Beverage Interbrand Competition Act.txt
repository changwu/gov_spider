    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Goldwater (R) Arizona and 23 others)
The Administration opposes S. 412 because it would grant a special exemption from the antitrust laws for the malt beverage industry, without any corresponding improvement in product or service. Such an exemption would pose a significant risk of reducing competition, which could result in higher prices to consumers, making special relief from the antitrust laws for this industry objectionable.
