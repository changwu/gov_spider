  A Proclamation

Our Nation, nurtured on individual self-reliance, began as a rural society. Through two centuries, it has developed into primarily an urban society of great cities.
This growth has firmly established an interdependence between farm and city, which is greater today than it was two hundred years ago. Although farmers and ranchers comprise less of our population than in the past, their production of food has more than kept pace with our fundamental needs. This capability to produce our plentiful food supply is, in turn, dependent upon the efforts of those in urban centers to provide the goods and services which our farmers and ranchers need.
It is appropriate to remember and renew our understanding of this continuing partnership between farm and city. Only out of this working partnership will our country achieve new abundance and prosperity in the future.
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period November 21 through November 27, 1975, as National Farm-City Week.
I request interested persons to join with agricultural organizations, business and labor groups, youth and community groups, schools and others to focus attention upon the interrelationships which exist among the constructive labors of all individuals, whether on the farm or in the city.
I urge the Department of Agriculture, educational institutions and other organizations and governmental agencies and officials to mark the significance of National Farm-City Week with special study, public meetings, exhibits and other appropriate activities in the public interest.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundredth.

GERALD R. FORD
