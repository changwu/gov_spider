    President-elect Joe Biden spoke with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer. The President-elect thanked them for their congratulations and expressed his commitment to uniting the country after a hard-fought campaign.
The President-elect, the Speaker, and the Leader spoke about the intensifying COVID-19 pandemic and the growing economic pain facing so many Americans across this country.
They discussed the urgent need for the Congress to come together in the lame duck session on a bipartisan basis to pass a bill that provides resources to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, relief for working families and small businesses, support for state and local governments trying to keep frontline workers on the payroll, expanded unemployment insurance, and affordable health care for millions of families.
They also discussed the importance of finding bipartisan solutions to create millions of good-paying union jobs, including through investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, research and development, and clean energy.
They will stay in close touch in the days ahead.
