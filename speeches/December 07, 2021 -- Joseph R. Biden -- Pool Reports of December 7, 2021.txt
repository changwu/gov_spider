in town pool report #3 WWII memorial color/arrival at White House
The president and First Lady entered the World War II memorial at 7:20 am from the Pacific tower. The president walked towards a wreath at the center point of the memorial, waved to the press and saluted the wreath and 7:25 am.
The wreath contained 1 wild sunflower, the state flower of Kansas, in honor of Senator Bob Dole, according to the White House. First Lady Jill Biden then touched the wreath with her right hand before taking a moment of silence.
The president then did the sign of the cross before walking back to the New Jersey pillar at 7:26 am. The First Lady then laid a bouquet at the New Jersey pillar in honor of her father, Donald Jacobs, who served as a US Navy Signalman in WWII.
At 7:28, the president and First Lady walked to the Pacific Tower, where they stood side by side viewing the memorial.
We were brought to the motorcade 7:32 am and we have a 7:34 arrival at the White House.
