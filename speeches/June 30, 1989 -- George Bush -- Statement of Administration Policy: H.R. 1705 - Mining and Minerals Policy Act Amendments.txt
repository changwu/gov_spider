    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rahall (D) West Virginia)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1705 because the bill is unnecessary. Current law and administrative procedures adequately ensure that the national security and economic interests of the United States are considered in decisions affecting foreign mining ventures. Furthermore, the approximately $9 billion Defense Strategic and Critical Materials stockpile provides substantial protection against a possible interruption in strategic and critical supplies for national security purposes.
