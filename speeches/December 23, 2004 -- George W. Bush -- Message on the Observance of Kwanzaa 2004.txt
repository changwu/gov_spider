    I send greetings to those observing Kwanzaa.
During Kwanzaa, millions of African Americans and people of African descent gather to celebrate their heritage and ancestry. Kwanzaa celebrations provide an opportunity to focus on the importance of family, community, and history, and to reflect on the Nguzo Saba or seven principles of African culture. These principles emphasize unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith.
Kwanzaa strengthens the ties that bind communities across America and around the world and reflects the great promise and diversity of America.
Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a joyous Kwanzaa.
