    While Joe Biden spread lies and tried to undermine PPP, President Trump's program saved 51 million jobs.
For months, Joe Biden lied and said President's Trump Paycheck Protection Program wasn't working. He supported delaying additional funding and even urged surrogates to lie about the program's success.
After back-to-back-to-back stellar jobs reports and success stories from businesses around the country, it's clear President Trump's PPP was undeniably successful in keeping Americans employed and small businesses afloat during the pandemic. 


The Paycheck Protection Program has provided $525 billion to over 5.2 million U.S. businesses, protecting more than 51 million jobs.


The Washington Post confirmed that the Paycheck Protection Program was a "measured success" and that "things would be even worse without the giant loan forgiveness program."


President Trump ensured that $30 billion of the Paycheck Protection Program was reserved for small financial institutions serving minority communities.
