    "Republican primary voters may be surprised to learn that Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum have a lot in common. Among other similarities, they are both career politicians who were removed from office by those who knew them best and chose to stay in D.C. afterward. Mitt Romney offers something different. He is not a creature of Washington. He offers the kind of private sector and chief executive experience that career politicians can't match." —Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
