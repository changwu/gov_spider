    Chicago, IL - "I welcome the Bush Administration's announcement of $1 billion in humanitarian and economic assistance to Georgia, a step that Joe Biden and I have been advocating for weeks. The United States and our allies must stand firm in supporting Georgia's economic and political stability, and opposing Russia's efforts to undermine Georgia's democratically-elected government. Today's decision to answer our call for $1 billion in assistance is an important step forward in supporting the people of Georgia and standing up to Russia's aggression."
