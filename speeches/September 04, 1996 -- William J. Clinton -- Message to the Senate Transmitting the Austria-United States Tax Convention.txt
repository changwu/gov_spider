    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the Convention Between the United States of America and the Republic of Austria for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, signed at Vienna May 31, 1996. Enclosed is an exchange of notes with an attached Memorandum of Understanding, which provides clarification with respect to the application of the Convention in specified cases. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
This Convention, which is similar to tax treaties between the United States and other OECD nations, provides maximum rates of tax to be applied to various types of income and protection from double taxation of income. The Convention also provides for exchange of information to prevent fiscal evasion and sets forth standard rules to limit the benefits of the Convention to persons that are not engaged in treaty shopping.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this Convention and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, September 4, 1996.
