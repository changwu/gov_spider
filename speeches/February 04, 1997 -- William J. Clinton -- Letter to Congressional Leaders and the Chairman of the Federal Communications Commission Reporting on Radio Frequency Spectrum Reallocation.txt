    Dear __________:
Title VI of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 directs the Secretary of Commerce to prepare a report identifying at least 200 megahertz (MHz) of the radio frequency spectrum for reallocation, over a period of 15 years, from Federal Government use to nonfederal Government use. This title also directs the President to notify the Federal Communications Commission and both Houses of Congress as actions are taken under this title. Including the reallocation of the 25 MHz reported in this notice, actions have now been completed to reallocate 120 MHz of spectrum for use by non federal Government entities.
Under delegated authority, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is responsible for managing the Federal Government's use of the radio frequency spectrum. On March 22, 1995, former Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown submitted to you NTIA's Spectrum Reallocation Final Report; this report presented a schedule for reallocating specified frequency bands over the period extending to January 1999. The NTIA report identified the frequency band 4635-4660 MHz for reallocation in January 1997.
I am pleased to inform you that the Federal Government frequency assignments in the 4635- 4660 MHz frequency band have been withdrawn by NTIA in compliance with section 114 of the Act. In addition, appropriate modifications have been made to the United States Table of Frequency Allocations for Federal Government stations to reflect the completed spectrum reallocation actions.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
