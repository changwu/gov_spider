    During the campaign, I spoke to local construction workers and pledged my support for the Westway Highway, a building project that will serve to restore and revitalize an area that sorely needs the help. I am pleased to announce today, on the occasion of my first visit to New York City as President, that many of the Federal financial and regulatory roadblocks that snarled the Westway Project have been cleared away.
Now that we've responded at the Federal level, any further action awaits decisions by State and local officials here in New York. I know there are differences among the various parties, but those differences are best resolved by the level of government closest to the people.
Washington is no longer standing in the way of this project. Westway has the green light, and it's up to New York to drive through.
