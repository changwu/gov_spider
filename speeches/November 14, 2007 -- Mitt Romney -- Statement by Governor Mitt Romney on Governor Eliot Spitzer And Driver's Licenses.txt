Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement on Governor Eliot Spitzer abandoning his plan to give driver's licenses to illegal immigrants:
"It took long enough to convince him and other open border Democrats like Senator Clinton that driver's licenses for illegal immigrants was exactly the wrong approach to enforcement, but at least Governor Spitzer finally listened to the American people and common sense.
"States that provide driver's licenses to illegal immigrants act as a magnet for more illegal immigration and frustrate our country's efforts to control the borders. Unlike Senator Clinton, I oppose driver's licenses for illegal immigrants. As president, I will adopt policies that discourage states from turning into sanctuaries."
