Click Here To Watch Gov. John Sununu Discuss President Obama's Incompetence In Handling The Economy
DOM GIORDANO, HOST: "The campaign has been laser-like: jobs and the economy. Where do we go now during this sort of down time until the convention? Give us an idea of what the Romney campaign will be rolling out in coming weeks."
GOV. JOHN SUNUNU: "Well, I think you're going to see the focus on jobs. Listen, the biggest problem in America today is twenty four and a half million people who are suffering because of the incompetence of a president who can't run a lemonade stand. This is a guy who doesn't understand his management responsibilities as President; doesn't understand policy responsibilities; keeps asking for the same thing. He has one formula: spend and tax, spend and tax. Einstein said that the sign of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. It's also the sign of incompetence. This guy keeps doing the same thing over and over again and expects different results. You're going to hear the Romney campaign talk about the fact that this guy has destroyed America's economy."
