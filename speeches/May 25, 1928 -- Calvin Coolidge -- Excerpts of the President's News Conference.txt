    I haven't seen the Muscle Shoals bill and know but very little about it. I will take it and look at it when it comes and try and decide it on its merits. I have discussed that problem several times in my messages. If you want my views more in detail you will find them there. I have of course been trying to get Muscle Shoals out of the hands of the Government and into private operation. I hope that this wouldn't put us any further into Government operation than we are now.
