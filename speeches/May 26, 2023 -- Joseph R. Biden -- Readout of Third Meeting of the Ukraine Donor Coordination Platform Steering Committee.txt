    Today, Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics Mike Pyle, together with Finance Minister of Ukraine, Sergii Marchenko, and European Commission Director-General for Neighborhood and Enlargement Negotiations, Gert Jan Koopman, co-chaired the third meeting of the Steering Committee of the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform for Ukraine. The Government of Ukraine and G7 Members of the Steering Committee, and representatives from international financial institutions (IFIs), discussed progress on Ukraine's 2023 early recovery priorities in the areas of energy infrastructure, civilian demining, critical and social infrastructure, housing, and support to the private sector. Ukraine also provided an update on implementation of its reform agenda. Deputy National Security Advisor Pyle welcomed Ukraine's commitment to continued progress on reform efforts, which will be critical for longer-term economic sustainability and catalyzing financial support from the private sector. He emphasized that the Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC) next month in London will be a crucial moment to demonstrate that the platform is able to provide transparency, clarity, and coordination in meeting Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction needs. Collaboration will continue in the coming weeks, and the Steering Committee will hold its next meeting on the margins of the URC in June.
