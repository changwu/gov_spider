    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit this report on Little Beaver Creek, Ohio. The report was prepared in response to the provisions of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, Public Law 90-542, as amended.
This study found that 33 miles of the Little Beaver and its tributaries meet the criteria for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and recommended this stretch of the river be included in the National System under the administration of the State of Ohio as identified by Section 2(a) (ii) of the Act.
The State of Ohio filed an application requesting that this segment of the Little Beaver be included as a State-administered component of the National System. On October 23, 1975, Secretary Kleppe approved the application of the State of Ohio and so informed Governor Rhodes. The Congress is not required to take action in order for Little Beaver Creek to become a component of the Wild and Scenic Rivers system.
I am pleased that the Congress, in establishing this program, has made provision for the State administration of Wild and Scenic River components. This report and its recommendations demonstrate the capability of both Federal and State governments to profitably cooperate with each other.
