    To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
The Secretary of State has lately received a note from the Danish charge' d'affaires, claiming, in the name of his Government, restitution in the case of the brig Henrich, communicated to Congress at a former session, in which note were transmitted sundry documents chiefly relating to the value and neutral character of the vessel, and to the question whether the judicial proceedings were instituted and conducted without the concurrence of the captain of the Henrich. As these documents appear to form a necessary appendage to those already before Congress, and throw additional light on the subject, I transmit copies of them herewith.
TH: JEFFERSON.
