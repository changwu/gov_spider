    (Phoenix, AZ) - National Campaign Co-chair Raul Yzaguirre and Maricopa County District 5 Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox responded to Hillary Clinton's huge win in Nevada today:
"Hillary Clinton won the first important nominating contest in the West today because she has the momentum, the strength, and the experience to deliver the change we need," said Wilcox.
"The people of Arizona have a champion in Hillary Clinton. She has been fighting for America's families for 35 years. She has heard their voices and when she is President they will never go unheard. In Nevada, Latinos backed Hillary by a nearly 3 to 1 a margin. This shows she can win in the West, and I expect her to do so in Arizona in two weeks," added Yzaguirre.
Hillary Clinton has been talking to families across the country about the challenges they face and offering an aggressive economic stimulus plan to help deliver the relief and assistance they need. She overcame significant hurdles in Nevada to earn a resounding victory in the first nomination contest in the West.
