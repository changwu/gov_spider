    Senator Obama's middle class tax fairness proposal would eliminate income taxes for 120,000 New Hampshire seniors
Manchester, NH -- Barack Obama unveiled his middle class tax fairness policy on Tuesday, and his New Hampshire campaign continues to share his message with Granite State voters. Today and tomorrow, Obama supporters will hold chats with seniors in six communities to discuss Obama's proposal to eliminate income taxes for retirees making less than $50,000 per year.
Yesterday, state Senator Jackie Cilley hosted a roundtable in Rochester to discuss the merits of Obama's tax fairness policy.
The tax fairness chats are open to the press. For credentials please email nh-media@barackobama.com.
