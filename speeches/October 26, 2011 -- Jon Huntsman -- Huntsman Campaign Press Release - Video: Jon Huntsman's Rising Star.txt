    

Jon Huntsman is the rising star -- not a shooting star. Since day one he's been fighting for real solutions like rebuilding our manufacturing base and leading with a foreign policy focused on free trade, investment and economic engagement.
You won't hear Jon Huntsman discuss birtherism like Rick Perry or put his finger to the wind to take a position like Mitt Romney.
That's because he's a principled leader with a plan for our future.
He's had a good week in the media and he's been meaningfully connecting with voters wherever he goes. I encourage you to watch the video above to see some of the highlights and then share it with your friends on twitter and facebook.
If you like what you hear and see, then also please make a donation in the amount you can afford to our campaign. We are counting on your continued financial support as Jon Huntsman climbs in the polls discussing his ideas for America's future.
We are all proud to stand with Jon Huntsman.
