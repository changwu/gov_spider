Here's what he had to say about Marco:
Marco Rubio is the kind of leader Hawaii needs in the White House.  His story is similar to so many of us, his hard working parents immigrated here wanting nothing more than to give the best opportunities to their children. They succeeded in achieving the American dream, and with Marco as President, we can help lift more of our community up and help them achieve their dreams too.  Marco's vision for Hawaii is like mine and he upholds the values of trust, respect and balance in all of his actions.

He's calling for Hawaiians to get to their caucuses to support Marco tonight:
Hawaii, we have an opportunity to make a huge difference in the direction of our country in today's caucuses.  Please get out and vote for Marco today in the Republican Caucus.
