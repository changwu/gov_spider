    Since there is another trial pending, I cannot comment on the jury's decision.
But on behalf of all Americans, I thank the jurors for their deliberations and their thoroughness as they made these grave decisions. This investigation and trial have confirmed our country's faith in its justice system.
To the victims and their families, I know that your healing can be measured only one day at a time. The prayers and support of your fellow Americans will be with you every one of those days.
