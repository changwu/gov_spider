    Mitt Romney today announced that former Wisconsin State Senator Ted Kanavas will serve as Co-Chair of the Wisconsin campaign.
"I am proud to announce the endorsement of Ted Kanavas," said Mitt Romney. "Ted shares my goals for Wisconsin and the rest of the country. We need to fundamentally change business in Washington in order to help small businesses grow and start hiring again. Ted has fought for this in Wisconsin and I look forward to working with him to bring jobs back to Wisconsin."
Announcing his support Kanavas said, "Mitt Romney is the only candidate with a record of job creation in the private sector and as a governor. After three years of President Obama's failed policies, it is clear that we need a president with experience working in the private sector, not another career politician. Wisconsin will be a critical state in this election. Mitt Romney is the only candidate who has the leadership experience Wisconsin voters are looking for and is the best candidate to beat President Obama in Wisconsin."
