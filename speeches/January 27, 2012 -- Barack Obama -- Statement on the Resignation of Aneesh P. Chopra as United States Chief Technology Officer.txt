    As the Federal Government's first Chief Technology Officer, Aneesh Chopra did groundbreaking work to bring our Government into the 21st century. Aneesh found countless ways to engage the American people using technology, from electronic health records for veterans to expanding access to broadband for rural communities to modernizing Government records. His legacy of leadership and innovation will benefit Americans for years to come, and I thank him for his outstanding service.
