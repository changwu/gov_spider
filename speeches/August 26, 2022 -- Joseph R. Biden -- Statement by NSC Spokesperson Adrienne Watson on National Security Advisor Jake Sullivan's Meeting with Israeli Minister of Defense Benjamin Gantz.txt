    National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with Israeli Minister of Defense Benjamin "Benny" Gantz on August 26 at the White House to continue consultations on security issues of mutual concern. Sullivan emphasized President Biden's unwavering commitment to Israel's security, and the two exchanged views on ways to deepen the U.S.-Israel security partnership, including via regional cooperation and coordination. They discussed U.S. commitment to ensure Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon, and the need to counter threats from Iran and Iran-based proxies. They also discussed the need to ensure equal measures of security, freedom, and prosperity for Palestinians and Israelis alike, and the importance of ongoing follow-through on initiatives announced during President Biden's trip to Israel.
