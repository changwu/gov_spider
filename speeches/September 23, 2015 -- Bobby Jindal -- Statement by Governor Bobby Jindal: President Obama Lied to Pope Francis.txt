    BATON ROUGE â€” Today, Governor Jindal said that President Obama lied to Pope Francis this morning when he said Americans must be free to live out their faith. Governor Jindal pointed out that simply is not reality in America today:
Governor Jindal said, "President Obama lied to Pope Francis. The President told the Pope that, in America, people must be free to live out their faith without fear of intimidation. That's the opposite of reality in America today, Mr. President. We have Christians who are jailed for their closely-held religious beliefs. We have Christians fined thousands of dollars by the government simply because they didn't bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple.
"Meanwhile, liberals are spending their time excoriating Christian conservatives, demanding that they publicly profess their support for a theoretical Muslim president that doesn't exist. Here's a reality check: Christians are Americans, too, with the same rights as everyone else. This President has not protected Christians and their constitutionally-guaranteed religious freedom, and it's time we have a president who will."
