    The White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) announced its 2017 HBCU All-Stars at the Annual Summit hosted at the White House on Monday, September 18, 2017. The 62 All-Stars are undergraduate, graduate, and professional students recognized for their outstanding accomplishments.
The All-Stars are appointed for one year to serve as ambassadors of the White House Initiative on HBCUs. The All-Stars provide outreach opportunities and communications to their fellow students about the value of education and the Initiative as a networking resource. Selected from a wide-range of applicants, the All-Stars came highly recommended from HBCU administrators and proved impressive beyond their resumes, transcripts and thorough applications.
"As a proud HBCU graduate, I am personally thrilled to congratulate this year's impressive class of HBCU All-Stars," said Omarosa Manigault, Assistant to the President and Director of Communications for the Office of Public Liaison.
