    SELMA, ALABAMA—Tulsi Gabbard, Hawaii congresswoman and presidential candidate, spent the days leading up to the 54th Anniversary of "Bloody Sunday" with Rep. John Lewis and others on a civil rights pilgrimage in Alabama. They visited Selma, crossed over the Edmund Pettus Bridge, prayed and worshiped in the pews of the 16th Street Baptist Church, and walked the halls of the Legacy Museum where slaves were once jailed, traded, and sold.
On the 54th Anniversary of "Bloody Sunday" in Selma, Tulsi Gabbard said, "On the 54th Anniversary of Bloody Sunday in Selma, we honor the courageous acts of love by people like Amelia Boynton and John Lewis, who were beaten and bloodied as they marched for freedom, humanity, and the right to vote. Walking across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, we honor their sacrifice and understand that there is more work to be done—to defeat hate with love as we continue to march for freedom, equality, and justice."
