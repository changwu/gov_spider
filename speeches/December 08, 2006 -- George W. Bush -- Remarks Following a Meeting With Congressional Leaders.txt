    I want to thank the Members of Congress—both Houses, both political parties— for joining me and the Vice President and members of my team. We just had a very constructive conversation. We talked about Iraq. We talked about the need for a new way forward in Iraq, and we talked about the need to work together on this important subject. We also talked about other key issues.
I assured the leaders that the White House door will be open when the new Congress shows up. And I think we ought to meet on a regular basis; I believe there's consensus toward that. And the reason you meet on a regular basis is so that the American people can know that we're working hard to find common ground. That's what they expect us to do; they expect us to work on big problems and solve them.
I want to say something about my two friends here. Senator Frist, we appreciate your service to the United States of America. You brought a lot of dignity to the office. And I appreciate the Speaker being, as well—Mr. Speaker, you've done a fine job as Speaker.
I look forward to working with Senator Reid and Congresswoman Pelosi for doing what's right for the country. And again, I want to thank you all for coming down. I appreciate your interest, appreciate your advice, appreciate the input that you've given.
Thank you.
