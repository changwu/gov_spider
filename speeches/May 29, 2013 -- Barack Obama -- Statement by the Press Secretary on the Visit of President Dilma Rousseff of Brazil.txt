    The President and First Lady will host Dilma Rousseff, President of the Federative Republic of Brazil, for an official State Visit with a State Dinner at the White House on October 23. This visit follows the visit of President Rousseff to Washington in April 2012, President Obama's visit to Brasilia in March 2011, Vice President Biden's May 2013 visit to Brasilia, and will allow the two leaders to continue developing and strengthening the strategic partnership between the United States and Brazil.
During President Rousseff's visit, the two leaders will highlight the importance of expanding dialogue and cooperation between the United States and Brazil on a growing number of bilateral, regional, and global issues, as well as the deep cultural ties and friendship that exist between the peoples of our two countries. The President looks forward to welcoming President Rousseff back to Washington and working with her to advance our increasingly common interests as two hemispheric and global partners.
Further details about the visit will be provided in the coming months.
