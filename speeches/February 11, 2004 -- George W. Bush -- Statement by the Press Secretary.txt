    Earlier this evening, we received additional information from the Air Reserve Personnel Center in Denver, Colorado. As we have previously said, if there is new information that further demonstrates the President served in the National Guard while in Alabama, then we would release it.
This dental examination documents the President serving at Dannelly ANG Base, Alabama on January 6, 1973. As has previously been documented and reported, the President was performing equivalent duty with the 187th Tactical Recon Group in a non-flying status.
The only additional information we received from the Personnel Center is the President's medical records. The President's physician has reviewed the medical and dental records, and his statement is attached.
