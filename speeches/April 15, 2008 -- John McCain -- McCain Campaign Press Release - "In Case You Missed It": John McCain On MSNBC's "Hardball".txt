MSNBC's "Hardball"
April 15, 2008
MSNBC'S CHRIS MATTHEWS: "Is Barack Obama an elitist?" 
JOHN MCCAIN: "No, but I do believe that his statements were elitist. I think the comments about America and small towns in Pennsylvania, which I guess would apply to across America, the values and the faith that they have, I think, is immutable and unshakable. I think that the fact that they like to hunt has nothing to do with their economic conditions. I think that they respect and cherish the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. And I think their faith, as I said, is something that goes on in bad times and good. These people were the ones that went through the Great Depression and then went to war and made the world safe for democracy and came home and built a better nation than we have today. And I think that it's from the small towns and the large, but from all over America, that people have hope and optimism and faith in this nation and their future, and a real feeling of the unique nature of the United States Of America. And we are a unique experiment in history and the greatest thing about America and these young people out here today and from the small towns in Pennsylvania want to continue to serve a cause greater than their self-interest."
