    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 3/20/91)(House)(Glickman (D) and 8 others)
The Administration supports the basic intent of H.R. 805 to remove the current $425 million cap on bonus payments made under the Export Enhancement Program in FY 1991. Accordingly, the Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 805. The Administration will work in the Senate, however, to delete certain unnecessary and administratively burdensome provisions currently included in H.R. 805.
Specifically, the bill's $900 million payment floor would unnecessarily restrict the Administration's flexibility in administering the program. Similarly, section 1 of the bill, which would delay certain export bonus payments until October 1, 1991, would also needlessly complicate program administration.
