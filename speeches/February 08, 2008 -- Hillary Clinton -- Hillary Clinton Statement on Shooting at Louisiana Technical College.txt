    I am saddened and my heart goes out to the victims and families of those affected today by the senseless crime that took place at Louisiana Technical College.
Violence of any kind should not be tolerated and hits too close to home when it's directed at our young people.
America has witnessed school violence before and it is always tragic. We must do all that we can to prevent such acts and keep our children safe at home and in our schools.
