    On September 9, 1985, by Executive Order No. 12532, I declared a national emergency to deal with the threat to the foreign policy and economy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of South Africa. Because those actions and policies continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy and economy of the United States, the national emergency declared on September 9, 1985, must continue in effect beyond September 9, 1986. Therefore, in accordance with Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to South Africa. Additional measures to deal with this threat will be considered upon the completion of consultations with key Allies on joint, effective measures to eliminate apartheid and encourage negotiations for peaceful change in South Africa. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.
