    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 11/15/91)(House)(Kolbe (R) Arizona)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2790. The bill would withdraw certain lands in the Cave Creek Canyon area of the Coronado National Forest in Arizona from mining and mineral leasing laws. This would circumvent a current review of the area. A temporary mineral withdrawal was issued in September 1991 and no mining will take place until the area's potential as a National Recreation Area (NRA) has been studied. If the area is designated as an NRA, this legislation would not be necessary.
