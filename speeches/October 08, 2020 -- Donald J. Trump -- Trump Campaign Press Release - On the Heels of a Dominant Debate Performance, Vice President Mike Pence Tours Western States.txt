    After soundly defeating Kamala Harris in last night's vice presidential debate, Vice President Mike Pence hosted events in Boulder City, Nevada and Peoria, Arizona to tout the Trump Administration's Make America Great Again agenda. While the Biden-Harris ticket proposes far-left policies like banning fracking, raising taxes by $4 trillion, and implementing their version of the Green New Deal, President Trump and Vice President Pence are working to support American workers and business-owners. As the Vice President discussed, only by re-electing President Trump can the American people ensure the Great American Comeback:
"I think it was a debate between two visions. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine. They want to abolish fossil fuels, use taxpayer funds to abortion. They want to defund the police. And if you couldn't figure it out last night, they want to pack the Supreme Court. President Trump's vision? We've rebuilt our military, we cut taxes, rolled back regulations, unleashed American energy. We secured our border, stood with law enforcement, and for life and liberties in every American."
