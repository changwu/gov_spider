    SPRINGFIELD, Mo. â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' spokesman Michael Briggs issued the following statement after it was reported that Sec. Clinton will announce opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership at an event in Ohio:
"Secretary Clinton could have stopped a trade deal that threatens hundreds of thousands of jobs last year when it was being debated in Congress. Instead, she chose to remain silent and forced working families, unions and members of Congress to fight against the world's biggest corporations and the most powerful special interests in the country without her support.
"The people of Ohio don't need a president who says the right things in a stump speech. They need a president who is with them every single day."
