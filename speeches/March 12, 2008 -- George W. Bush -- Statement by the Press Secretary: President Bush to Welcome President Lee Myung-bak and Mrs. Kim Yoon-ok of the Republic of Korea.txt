    The President and Mrs. Bush will host President Lee Myung-bak of the Republic of Korea and his wife, Mrs. Kim Yoon-ok, at Camp David on April 18-19, 2008. The President welcomes this important opportunity to consult with the new President on ways to continue to work together to advance our shared values of freedom, security, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. The two leaders will also discuss a wide range of common goals, including ratifying the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula through the Six-Party Talks, continuing our cooperation in aiding the new democracies in Iraq and Afghanistan, and further strengthening the U.S.-Republic of Korea Alliance. This will be President Lee's first visit overseas since he took office.
