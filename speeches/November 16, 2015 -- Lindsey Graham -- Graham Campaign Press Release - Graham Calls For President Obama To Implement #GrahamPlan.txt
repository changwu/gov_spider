Following the horrendous terrorist attacks in Paris on Friday, today Lindsey Graham 2016 rereleased Senator Graham's detailed plan to destroy ISIL and stop the rise of radical Islamic extremism.
This plan, which was originally released on July 8th and includes ideas about which Graham has been actively speaking out about since 2011, focuses on increasing our military intervention in Iraq and Syria in partnership with regional allies and providing humanitarian aid that is essential to stabilizing these nations and preventing them from becoming failed states.
"I stand ready to work with President Obama to implement a comprehensive plan, such as what I outlined earlier this year, to defeat ISIL and stop the growing threat of radical Islamic terrorism," said Senator Graham. "We cannot wait another 6 months, or for, God forbid, an attack on our homeland, to go in on the ground and hit them there. There is no other way to defeat this threat - we must go in on the ground and stop them over there."
