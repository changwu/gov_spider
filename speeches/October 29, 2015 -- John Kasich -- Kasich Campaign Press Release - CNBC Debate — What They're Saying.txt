"Kasich offered the most substantive economic solutions, drawing on his record as governor of Ohio and as a former House Budget Committee chairman." -Al Hunt, Chicago Tribune
"His campaign has insisted that Bush's weakness would open up the establishment lane of the primary, and Kasich's relative strength made that look possible." -David Weigel, Washington Post
