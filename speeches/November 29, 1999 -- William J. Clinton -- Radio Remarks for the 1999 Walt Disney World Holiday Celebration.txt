    Hello, this is President Bill Clinton. I'm sure everyone around the world appreciates how special this year's holiday celebration is. We're about to enter a new millennium, an era of tremendous promise and opportunity. There is no better time than now to reflect on our hopes and dreams and the gifts we want to leave for the future. We can all do something to make the world a better place.
Hillary, Chelsea, and I want to wish everyone listening the happiest of holidays. And as we celebrate the future, it is our hope that your dreams for the new millennium will come true.
