HOUSTON, Texas – Today, Ted Cruz continued to build on the campaign's strong Michigan leadership team with endorsements from several conservative legislative leaders. The endorsements expand the Michigan Leadership team to over 100 members, including county chairs in all 83 counties and faith leaders from all across the state. Over 4,000 volunteers have signed up to help with the campaign.
"I am thrilled to announce the addition of such outstanding conservative legislators to our Michigan leadership team," said Cruz. "These courageous conservatives are coalescing behind our campaign because the people of Michigan are tired of career politicians in Washington and want someone who has a record of fighting for our values and the Constitution."
"Ted Cruz can bring to Washington what conservatives in the state legislatures across the nation have been yearning for — consistent conservative leadership," said Michigan State Senator Patrick Colbeck.
