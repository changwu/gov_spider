The full text of the letter:
Dear Senator Rubio,
For my eighth grade assignment, my class is supposed to write letters to someone famous who we admire. I chose you because I am very into politics (even though I'm a thirteen year old girl) and you are my favorite politician. I am very involved in politics and took after my father who is a longtime Republican. I first found out about you when I was watching the 2012 Republican National Convention and heard your speech which made me cry. It is still to this day the best speech I've ever heard. When you announced that you were running for the 2016 election, I was so happy because I completely agree with your values and beliefs and I feel that you will have the greatest impact on America.
I chose you because you have an amazing story and I think you are inspiration for everyone. You have amazing values and in this day and age in America, that's quite difficult to find. I truly hope that you win the Republican nomination and win the election. I truly believe that no one deserves it more than you do. You are an amazing public speaker and you believe strongly in what you say and I respect that.
I would absolutely be ecstatic if I could be written back or receive an autograph. I would treasure them forever and it would make me so happy. It would be an amazing memory to receive something from my favorite politician. Best of luck in getting the nomination and in the election!
Sincerely,
Paulina
