    Nevada's electoral college candidates pledged to President Donald J. Trump today filed an election contest under Nevada's election code, citing substantial irregularities, improprieties, and fraud that occurred in Nevada's 2020 presidential election. The suit details the unreliability of the Agilis ballot processing and signature scanning machine used in Clark County, and the electronic voting machines used throughout the state. It also argues that the denial of observer access to the duplication process, and the impropriety of some Native American outreach programs that resulted in apparent vote-buying, cast substantial doubt on the results of the election. No less than 40,000 votes, and possibly more, were impacted by these various defects. This margin is greater than the margin between President Trump and Joe Biden in Nevada.
"We believe the discrepancies discovered in the days following Nevada's election and invited by the Democrat's last-minute changes to the law monumentally influenced this presidential election to benefit Joe Biden, and as a result, these irregularities have deprived Nevadans of their right to a free and fair election," said Jenna Ellis, Trump Campaign Senior Legal Advisor. "These malicious actions, which have impacted more than 40,000 ballots, cannot be overlooked, and President Trump will continue battling for justice and seeking to restore Americans' faith in our electoral process."
The contest was filed in the First Judicial District Court in Carson City, Nevada, on behalf of six Nevada citizens and voters who were candidates for presidential electors in Nevada.
