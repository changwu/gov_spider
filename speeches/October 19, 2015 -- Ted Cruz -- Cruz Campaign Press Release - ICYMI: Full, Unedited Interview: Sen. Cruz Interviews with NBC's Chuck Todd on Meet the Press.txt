    Cruz: We need leaders who will honor the promises we made to the men and women who elected us
HOUSTON, Texas â€“ U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, appeared on NBC's Meet the Press with Chuck Todd Sunday to discuss his efforts to break up the Washington Cartel, to keep the promises he made to those who elected him, and his vision for the United States' foreign policy toward Syria and ISIS.


In the unedited interview, Sen. Cruz discussed his growing support among grassroots groups across the conservative spectrum, including the 603 Alliance in New Hampshire, Freedom Works, and Values Voters:
"I think the test that primary voters are applying is who has actually walked the walk. Let me give a couple of examples of what we are seeing in the grassroots. Just this weekend, in the state of New Hampshire, the 603 Alliance, which is the gathering of all the major conservative leaders in New Hampshire, had their straw poll on who to endorse, we won with 72 percent of the vote overwhelmingly seeing conservatives unite. A month ago at FreedomWorks ... we won their straw poll with 42 percent of the vote. Two weeks later at the Values Voter Summit, we won that with 35 percent of the vote... it is exceptionally unusual to see that depth of support of the grassroots across the country and across the spectrum of that old Reagan coalition."
