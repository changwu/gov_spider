    I have some thoughts about the Trump immigration plan….
First, since his inauguration, Donald Trump and his administration have continually vilified immigrants for political purposes. Their new immigration plan would go even further to sabotage our nation's principles.
Second, if we want to beat Donald Trump in 2020, it's clear that the Democratic nominee will need to have a real alternative to Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. I have that plan — and I'm the only Democrat running for President who's articulated one so far.
In April, I put forward my People First Immigration plan to show Americans that there's an alternative to Trump's cruelty — one that treats those who seek refuge from violence and turmoil with compassion, addresses the root causes of migration, and protects our borders.
This is possible when the president is working toward solutions instead of sowing chaos for political gain.
Some Democrats may not see immigration as a winning issue, but there has been no issue that more clearly demonstrates the cruelty and incompetence of this administration than immigration.
On January 20, 2021 we will have an opportunity to get this right. As President, I will lead us to an immigration system that actually benefits America.
Before we get there, though, I need your support. Our ideas need you to give them life. Please support our campaign.
