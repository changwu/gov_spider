    Today's votes in the Senate demonstrate that Democrats and Republicans must come together to find common ground on a budget that cuts spending and puts us on a path to live within our means, but also ensures we continue to invest in our future. There is no disagreement that we have to cut spending, which is why we have already agreed to meet Republicans halfway and have indicated our willingness to do more. But, we need to ensure we cut responsibly, and that we don't undermine growth and competitiveness by cutting investments in education and research and development.
Today, the President had a productive meeting with Senators Reid, Durbin, Schumer and Murray, and the Vice President also had good discussions with Speaker Boehner and Minority Leader McConnell. The President and Vice President urged them to come together to find a solution that funds the government through the end of the fiscal year and reiterated their commitment to helping make this happen. Last year both parties showed that each could give a little to reach a middle class tax cut compromise that works for the American people. We are confident we can do this again to avoid a government shutdown that would harm our economic recovery.
