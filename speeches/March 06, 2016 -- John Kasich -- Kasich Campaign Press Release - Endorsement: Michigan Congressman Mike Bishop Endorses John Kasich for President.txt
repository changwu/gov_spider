    Today, Michigan Congressman Mike Bishop (R-MI8) announced his endorsement of Gov. John Kasich's presidential campaign.
Said Bishop, "John Kasich is a compassionate, pragmatic leader who will be ready to lead our country on Day One. His achievement of cutting taxes, balancing budgets and creating jobs will revive our economy just like it has done for Ohio. I am proud to stand behind him and support his campaign to be our president."

A lifelong resident of Oakland County, Congressman Bishop is serving his first term as a U.S. Representative for Michigan's 8th Congressional District. He previously served in the Michigan House of Representatives from 1999 to 2003 and the Michigan State Senate from 2002 to 2010 where he served as Majority Leader.
Said Kasich, "We are happy to have Congressman Bishop on the team. I am thankful for his endorsement as we continue to spread a positive message for commonsense, conservative solutions across Michigan."
