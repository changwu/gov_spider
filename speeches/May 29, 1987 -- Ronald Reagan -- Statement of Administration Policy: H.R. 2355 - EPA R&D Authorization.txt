    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Scheuer (D) New York)
The administration would support H.R. 2355 if it is amended to delete the numerous special studies and the mandatory reservation of at least ten percent of EPA's appropriated R&D funds for basic research. These requirements would divert funds needed for critical research in support of statutorily required EPA regulations. Other Federal agencies already spend a total of $650 million annually for basic research.
