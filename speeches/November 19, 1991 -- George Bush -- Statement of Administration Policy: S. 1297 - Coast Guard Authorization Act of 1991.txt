    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Hollings (D) South Carolina and 3 others)
The Administration would support enactment of S. 1297, with the proposed deletion of the repeal of the boat user fees, if it were further amended to:

—   Specify that no obligations are allowed under the longterm leases authorized by sections 8 and 9 unless budget authority is provided specifically for those leases in an appropriations bill in advance of the obligation.
—   Delete provisions that unnecessarily restrict the Coast Guard's ability to expend funds in the most cost effective manner. These provisions include: (1) the requirement that specific amounts be spent to acquire a new command and control aircraft; (2) the requirement that the Coast Guard's procurement of oil skimming equipment on new buoy tenders be restricted to equipment "manufactured in the United States"; and (3) the requirement to begin and actively pursue renovation of the Coast Guard Cutter Mackinaw.
—   Delete section 12, which would erroneously designate a bridge as an unreasonable obstruction to navigation, and hence incorrectly make it eligible for certain Federal assistance.
—   Delete section 17, which would unjustifiably exempt certain vessels from vessel safety requirements.
—   Delete sections 19 and 20, which would circumvent the procedures of the Federal Property Management Act. These procedures are designed to assure that the Government derives the maximum utility from the disposal of its real property. Enactment of these provisions would be unfair to those public bodies which have followed these procedures in purchasing surplus Federal properties.
—   Delete the "Sense of Congress" provision stating that the requirement to collect fees from the owners of recreational vessels should be repealed. Repeal ofthis requirement would unfairly require the general public to bear the cost of Coast Guard services that provide substantial benefits to the boating public. It would also require a sequester unless offsetting increases in revenues are enacted. 
Scoring for the Purpose of Pay-As-You-Go
At least four provisions of S. 1297 (sections 5, 8, 9, and 22) would increase direct spending. Therefore, S. 1297 is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. No offsets to the direct spending increases are provided in the bill. A budget point of order applies in both the House and Senate against any bill that is not fully offset under CBO scoring. If, contrary to the Administration's recommendation, the Senate waives any such point of order that applies against S. 1297, the effects of enactment of this legislation would be included in a look back pay-as-you- go sequester report at the end of the Congressional session.
OMB's preliminary scoring estimates of this bill are presented in the table below. (These estimates assume adoption of the boat user fee amendment.) Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If S. 1297 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within five days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to the Congress.
