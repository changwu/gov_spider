    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee released the following statement from Campaign Co-Chair Steve Forbes who spent the day in New Hampshire campaigning:
"Rudy got it exactly right tonight when he said change is only good if it moves our country in the right direction. You can count on Rudy Giuliani to change America for the better by cutting taxes, restraining runaway spending, ending illegal immigration and most importantly, keeping Americans safe and secure. Rudy is the only tested leader who gets that change is more than just a slogan, it's about tackling the difficult issues head on and getting results."
