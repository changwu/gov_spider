    What They're Saying About Kamala's Winning Debate: "On Point," "Laser-Like Focus and Balance," "Forceful," and "Strong"
The fifth Democratic debate is over in Atlanta and the consensus is clear -- Senator Kamala Harris commanded the stage and reminded Americans how she "kicks ass."
Harris stood out in a crowded field on the debate stage tonight - her personal and dynamic answers broke through the same tired talking points from the rest of the field. She hammered home that, in 2020, justice is on the ballot, and her career long record fighting for justice makes her the perfect candidate to take on Trump.
Here are some of the early reactions to her stellar performance:
Donna Brazile: .@KamalaHarris is giving my sermon. Thank you. Tell our story. Tell it.
Jennifer Rubin, Washington Post: Excellent foreign policy answer from Harris touting American credibility in world and declining to give NK concessions.
Chris Matthews, MSNBC: Solid answer by Senator Kamala Harris. She nailed Trump on his North Korea policy, said he got "punked" and "traded a photo-op for nothing." #DemDebate
Geoff Bennett, MSNBC: Kamala Harris crystallized a fact that Democrats often conveniently forget or take for granted: Black women are the most reliable base of the Democratic Party. Harris responding to strong questioning from @kwelkernbc.
Mo Elleithee: In my opinion, that first answer was @KamalaHarris' best debate moment all cycle.
Ilyse Hogue, NARAL President: @KamalaHarris reminding us that this is all connected. Women need pay equity, paid leave for taking care of our kids and our parents. We are truly the sandwich generation and we can't do it without women centric policies. #DemocraticDebate
Jess Morales Rocketto: Excellent answer from Harris that ties into her new message, actually answers the question, and reminds people of how much she kicks ass in judicial hearings. #DemDebate
Randi Weingarten, AFT: Exactly this! "Justice is on the ballot." - @KamalaHarris #DemDebate #AFTvotes
Fred Guttenberg, Parkland Father: Thank you @KamalaHarris for mentioning the reality that the sons of black women will die of gun violence more than any other reason in America. I hope that before this debate ends, you will have the chance to discuss your plans to deal with gun violence.
Charlotte Clymer: With laser-like focus and balance, Kamala Harris successfully dismissed Buttigieg and seized the momentum without it being obvious. That was skillful.

Jordan Weissmann: Kamala Harris's riff on paid family leave was the best answer I've seen from her on economic policy. Forceful, cogent, something she sincerely seems to care about. Too bad we haven't seen more of that from her.
