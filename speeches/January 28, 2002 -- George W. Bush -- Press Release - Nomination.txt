In 1984, he became the Executive Director of the Greater Philadelphia First Corporation, where he worked closely with area government and business leaders to spur economic growth throughout the region. In 1990, President George H. W. Bush appointed Terpeluk to the Board of Directors of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Commission. He was previously Of Counsel to the Forum for International Policy, chaired by Brent Scowcroft.
A Pennsylvania native, Terpeluk earned a bachelor's degree from LaSalle College and a Master's degree in Public Administration from Rider College.
