Boston, MA – Today, Nevada State Senator Joe Heck, M.D., announced his support for Governor Mitt Romney for President.
In announcing his support State Senator Heck said, "This election is critical to the future of our country. Too many politicians have made promises – but they haven't delivered. Governor Romney has a strong record of accomplishment in business, the Olympics, and in Massachusetts. We need someone with his ability and integrity to fix Washington."
Governor Romney said, "I thank Senator Heck for his support. Washington is broken and we can't fix it by sending the same people back, just to have them sit in different chairs. I've spent my whole career fixing things – and I can't wait to get my hands on Washington. I look forward to working with Senator Heck to earn the support of as many Nevada voters as possible."
