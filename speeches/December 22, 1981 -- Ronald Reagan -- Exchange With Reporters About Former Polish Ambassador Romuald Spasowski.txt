    Q. Mr. President, can you make any comment on the Polish situation today, any reports, any word of options on our part?
The President. No. It's too early in the day. We haven't had any meeting yet on it for any update on the progress that we might be making.
Q. What is your feeling about the Ambassador and what he represents to us as Americans and to the Polish people?
The President. I'm very proud that he's here in this office. I think we're in the presence of a very courageous man and woman who have acted on the highest of principle. And I think the people of Poland are probably very proud of them also.
Q. Can you give him any encouragement about options that this country might take?
The President. Well, the Ambassador is aware of the things that we've been talking about and what we're trying to do.
Q. Are you at all concerned that your remarks may incite the Poles to take to the streets and then they, in fact, be crushed by it?
The President. No, no one is suggesting that.
Q. Thank you.
