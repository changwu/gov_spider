    The President spoke with Afghan presidential candidates Dr. Ashraf Ghani this afternoon and Dr. Abdullah Abdullah last night as part of our ongoing efforts to call for calm and emphasize the need for political dialogue as last month's election results are tabulated. With both, the President stressed that the United States expects a thorough review of all reasonable allegations of fraud to ensure a credible electoral process. He reiterated that all parties should avoid steps that undermine Afghan national unity and should come together to work toward a resolution that represents the will of the Afghan people and produces a government that can bring Afghanistan together. He also noted that there is no justification for resorting to violent or extra-constitutional means, which would result in the end of U.S. assistance to Afghanistan. The President indicated that Secretary Kerry would continue his close consultations with the two candidates and President Karzai in the days to come.
