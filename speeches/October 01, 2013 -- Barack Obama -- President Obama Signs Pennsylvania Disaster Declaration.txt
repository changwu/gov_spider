    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the area affected by severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding during the period of June 26 to July 11, 2013.
Federal funding is available to commonwealth and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding in the counties of Centre, Clearfield, Clinton, Crawford, Fayette, Huntingdon, Jefferson, Lawrence, Venango, and Wayne.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures for all counties in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
W. Craig Fugate, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Donald L. Keldsen as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
FEMA said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the commonwealth and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
