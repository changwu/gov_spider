    WASHINGTON, DC – Today, President Barack Obama signed an Executive Order creating a second Presidential Emergency Board to help resolve an ongoing dispute between the New Jersey Transit Rail and some of its employees.
The Presidential Emergency Board will provide a structure that allows the two sides to attempt to resolve their disagreements. In the 60 days following its establishment, the Presidential Emergency Board will obtain final offers for settlement of the dispute from each side, and then produce a report to the President that selects the offer that the Board finds to be the most reasonable. The Board's report is not binding, but the party whose offer is not selected would be prohibited by law from receiving certain benefits if a work stoppage subsequently occurs.
President Obama also announced that he intends to appoint the following members to Presidential Emergency Board No. 249:
•      Joshua Javitz – Chair, Presidential Emergency Board No. 249
•      Elizabeth Neumeier – Member, Presidential Emergency Board No. 249
•      Nancy E. Peace – Member, Presidential Emergency Board No. 249
President Obama said, "I appreciate that these dedicated individuals have agreed to devote their talent and years of experience working on labor-management disputes to help reach a swift and smooth resolution of this issue."
