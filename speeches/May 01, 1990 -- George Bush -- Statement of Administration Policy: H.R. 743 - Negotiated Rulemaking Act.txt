    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Pease (D) Ohio and 9 others)
The Administration, while not objecting to House passage of H.R. 743, does have a number of concerns about the bill. The Administration is concerned that H.R. 743 would:

—  Permit payment to private parties to represent their own interests in a negotiated rulemaking committee.
—  Reduce accountability for agency spending by permitting the Administrative Conference to pay agency expenses for a negotiated rulemaking committee.
—  Allow negotiated rulemaking committees to continue to exist until promulgation of a final rule. The responsibilities of such a committee should properly end when it provides its report and accompanying records to an agency. 
The negotiated rulemakings undertaken pursuant to H.R. 743 must also be conducted in a manner that would not undermine the accountability and responsibility of Executive Branch officers to conduct rulemaking functions.
