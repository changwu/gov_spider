    The President today announced the appointment of Bruce Chapman as Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of Planning and Evaluation (OPE) in the White House. Mr. Chapman will report to Edwin Meese III, Counsellor to the President, and will be responsible for long-range issues identification, statistical analysis, and program evaluation.
Mr. Chapman has been serving as Director of the Bureau of the Census since October 1981. Previously he was secretary of state for the State of Washington in 1975-1981; a member of the Seattle City Council in 1971-1975; a public affairs consultant in 1966-1971; and an editorial writer for the New York Herald Tribune in 1965-1966.
Under Mr. Chapman, the reconstituted Office of Planning and Evaluation will serve as a catalyst for increasing long-range research support from Federal offices outside the White House and for seeking similar assistance from persons and groups outside the Government. The Office also will help stimulate the climate for public discussion of long-range issues of importance to the President's goals. Within the White House, the Office will participate in strategic planning and program analysis. In addition, Mr. Chapman will report on demographic developments and will suggest improvements in the Government's statistical system.
Mr. Chapman graduated from Harvard University (B.A., 1962). He is married and has one child. He was born December 1. 1940, in Evanston, Ill.
