    Memorandum for the Secretary of State,
the Secretary of Defense
Subject: Drawdown of Commodities and Services from the Inventory and Resources of the Department of Defense to Assist Peacekeeping Operations in Nagorno-Karabakh
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 552(c)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2348a(c)(2) (the "Act"), I hereby determine that:
(1) as a result of an unforeseen emergency, the provision of assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act in amounts in excess of funds otherwise available for such assistance is important to the national interests of the United States; and
(2) such unforeseen emergency requires the immediate provision of assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act.
I therefore direct the drawdown of commodities and services from the inventory and resources of the Department of Defense of an aggregate value not to exceed $2 million in support of peacekeeping operations in Nagorno-Karabakh.
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to report this determination to the Congress and to arrange for its publication in the Federal Register.
George Bush
