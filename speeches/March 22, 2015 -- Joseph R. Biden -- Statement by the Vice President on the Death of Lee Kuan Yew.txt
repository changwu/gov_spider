    Jill and I were deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Singapore's founding father, Lee Kuan Yew. Lee was a visionary leader who spearheaded Singapore's economic growth and helped it become one of the most prosperous countries in the world today. He understood the importance of economic integration and effective governance to building a thriving, modern economy. He was a pragmatist, and sometimes uncompromising. But his commitment to delivering excellence in public service was exemplary. I valued his insights on Asia, geopolitics, and economics, which have shaped the thinking of many around the world. I will always cherish the wisdom he imparted on me when I had the honor to sit and talk with him in Singapore in July 2013. Then just shy of ninety years old, he remained formidable. Lee's legacy lives on in the nation of Singapore. He was a believer in the importance of America's enduring role as a resident Pacific power and a friend and admirer of the United States. Jill and I offer our condolences to Lee's family and join the people of Singapore in mourning his loss.
