    The President met separately with a group of Senate Democrats and House Democrats who supported trade legislation at the White House. He reiterated his commitment to working with leaders in Congress to pass both TPA and TAA and made clear that he will only back a path forward that sends both bills to his desk. The President reinforced that Congress must pass TAA, which will expire soon, to ensure that we are helping all our workers compete in the global economy. The President expressed his gratitude to these Democrats for supporting these trade bills that will be good for American workers and help American businesses compete on a level playing field.
