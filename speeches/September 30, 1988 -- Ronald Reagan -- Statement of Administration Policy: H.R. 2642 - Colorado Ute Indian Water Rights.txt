    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Campbell (D) Colorado and 23 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2642 because the bill does not require thirty-year, straight-line amortization of the Federal irrigation assistance costs of the Animas-La Plata Project. This concept is a critical component of the agreement reached with non-Federal interests.
