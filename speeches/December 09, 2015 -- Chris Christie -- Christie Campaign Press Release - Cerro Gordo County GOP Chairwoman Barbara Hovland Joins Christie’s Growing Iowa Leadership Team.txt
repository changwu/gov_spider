Wednesday, December 9, 2015
MORRISTOWN, NJ - Cerro Gordo County GOP Chairwoman Barbara Hovland joined Chris Christie's growing Iowa leadership team today citing his depth of experience both as US attorney and governor.
"I am supporting Governor Chris Christie because he has the experience as a U.S. Attorney who had to prosecute terrorism, gangs and human trafficking cases," said Hovland. "As Governor his record of education reform, overhauling the police force and the health and pension program shows he takes action and solves problems. Day one as President, he will know what he needs to do and will not need on the job training. Governor Christie is the candidate who can take on Hillary Clinton and win. He has a strong work ethic that he learned at an early age from his parents that is ingrained in who he is. He speaks the truth and isn't afraid to stand up for the truth."
Barbara was elected Cerro Gordo County GOP Chairwoman in December 2014. She previously served as County GOP Co-Chair, and has been a long time republican activist and community leader in Mason City and Cerro Gordo County.
