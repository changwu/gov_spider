    My dear Mr. Secretary:
It was a noble purpose that inspired successive International Conferences of American States to launch and foster the idea of a great continental memorial to Christopher Columbus. The time has now come to give definite form and substance to this inspiring plan.
Through the generosity of the Dominican Government a beautiful site has been provided and a world wide architectural competition has furnished a design of surpassing beauty.
The responsibility now rests with the governments and the peoples of the American Republics to make available the funds for this great memorial which will ever serve not only as a beacon both for aerial and marine navigation, but also as a constant reminder to the nations of this continent of their essential unity of ideals, of interest and of purpose.
Very sincerely yours,
The Honorable, The Secretary of State, Washington, D.C.
