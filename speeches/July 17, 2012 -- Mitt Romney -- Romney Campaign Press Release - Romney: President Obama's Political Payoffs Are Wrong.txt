    "I am ashamed to say that we're seeing our President hand out money to the businesses of campaign contributors, when he gave money, $500 million in loans to a company called Fisker that makes high end electric cars, and they make the cars now in Finland. That is wrong and it's got to stop. That kind of crony capitalism does not create jobs and it does not create jobs here." — Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "There's, there's something else that's got to stop and I believe you know about this but you know the history of our country is a country where individuals with their dreams go out and begin an enterprise like this one here that Joe and his colleagues built, and they go out and talk to friends and family and say 'would you loan us the money to start the business' and people scrape together the cash and build, or buy a building like they bought this one here and get started in business, sometimes successfully, sometimes not, that's sort of how we have done it in this country. And that's very different than the way they've done it in some other countries, where the government comes in, and based on who you know in government, who's a friend in government, you get money from them, you get tax payer dollars. That's happening in this country today. I am ashamed to say that we're seeing our President hand out money to the businesses of campaign contributors, when he gave money, $500 million in loans to a company called Fisker that makes high end electric cars, and they make the cars now in Finland. That is wrong and it's got to stop. That kind of crony capitalism does not create jobs and it does not create jobs here. I believe in free people and free markets and I want government to get out of investing in individual businesses."
