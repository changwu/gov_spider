    Nevada State Senator Pat Spearman endorsed Senator Kamala Harris for president Friday at a rally in Las Vegas. A 29-year veteran of the United States Army, Spearman has represented parts of North Las Vegas and neighboring jurisdictions since 2012 and currently serves as co-majority whip. In the Nevada Senate, she is known as a champion for equal pay for women, LGBTQ rights, and supporting veterans. At the time of her election, she was the first openly lesbian member of the Nevada legislature.
"This nation is ready for change. We are ready for someone who doesn't mind standing up in the face of adversity and will not make excuses when our Constitution is trampled on," Spearman said Friday. "We are ready for someone who will carry the banner of freedom and justice for us and honor the oath do defend this democracy against enemies foreign and domestic. We are ready for Senator Kamala Harris as President of the United States."
Spearman appears to be the first elected official from Nevada to endorse in the Democratic presidential primary. Nevada will hold their caucus contests on Tuesday, February 23, the third state in the 2020 primary schedule.
