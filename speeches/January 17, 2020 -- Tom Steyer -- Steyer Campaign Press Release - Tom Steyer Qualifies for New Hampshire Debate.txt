    (SAN FRANCISCO, CA, January 17, 2020) â€” Today, presidential candidate Tom Steyer officially qualified for the eighth Democratic National Committee debate, continuing his surge into the top tier of candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Steyer secured qualification by polling at 15% and 12% in South Carolina and Nevada, respectively. Steyer has also surpassed the DNC's 225,000 unique donor threshold requirement for debate qualification.
"Since Tom's standout performance in the January debate, momentum has continued to build behind Tom's message that he's the best candidate to take on Trump on the economy and expose him as a fraud and failure," Campaign Manager Heather Hargreaves said. "We are built to compete in every state, and have the candidate best prepared to break the corporate stranglehold of our government, tackle the climate crisis head-on, and pave the path towards shared prosperity for all Americans."
Conducted by Fox News between January 5 and 8, the most recent polls show Steyer surging to second place in South Carolina and tied for third place in Nevada. These results were followed by the most recent Morning Consult early state tracker which showed Steyer polling at 15% in an average of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada voters.
The DNC February debate will take place on February 7th in Manchester, New Hampshire.
