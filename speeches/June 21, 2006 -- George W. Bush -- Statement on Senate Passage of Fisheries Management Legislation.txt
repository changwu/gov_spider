    I applaud the Senate for passing a stronger Magnuson-Stevens Act by unanimous consent. By emphasizing the important role of ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management and strengthening penalties for overfishing and other violations, this legislation will be vital to ensuring that we remain good stewards of our marine environment. I congratulate Chairman Stevens and Cochairman Inouye for their work on this important bipartisan bill that embraces my priorities of ending over-fishing and rebuilding our Nation's fish stocks through more effective, market-based management methods.
Since my administration released the Ocean Action Plan in 2004, we have been making great strides in our efforts to make our oceans, coasts, and lakes cleaner, healthier, and more productive. Last week, I established the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument, the largest single conservation area in the history of our country and the largest protected marine area in the world. Enactment of a stronger Magnuson-Stevens Act is one of the top priorities of the Ocean Action Plan, and Senate passage of this bill is an important milestone on the way to another significant bipartisan ocean policy achievement.
I urge the House of Representatives to join the Senate in passing this important initiative.
