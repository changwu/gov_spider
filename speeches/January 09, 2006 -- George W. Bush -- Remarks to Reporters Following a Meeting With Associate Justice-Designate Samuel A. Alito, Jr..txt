    Good morning. I just had breakfast with Judge Alito. I told him I think he conducted himself with such dignity and class in the weeks leading up to the confirmation process, which begins today.
Sam Alito is imminently qualified to be a member of the bench. I'm not the only person who feels that way. The American Bar Association looked at his record, looked at his opinions, looked at his temperament, and came to the same conclusion, that he is well-qualified to be a Supreme Court judge.
Sam's got the intellect necessary to bring a lot of class to that Court. He's got a judicial temperament necessary to make sure that the Court is a body that interprets the law and doesn't try to write the law. And so I'm looking forward to your hearings. I know the American people will be impressed, just like I have been impressed and a lot of other Members of the Senate have been impressed.
And my hope, of course, is that the American people will be impressed by the process. It's very important that Members of the Senate conduct a dignified hearing. The Supreme Court is a dignified body; Sam is a dignified person. And my hope, of course, is that the Senate bring dignity to the process, give this man a fair hearing, and an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.
Sam, good luck to you. Thanks for your agreement to serve. I appreciate you.
