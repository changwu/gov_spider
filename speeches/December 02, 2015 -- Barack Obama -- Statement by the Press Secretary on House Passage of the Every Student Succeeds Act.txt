    Since 2009, America's schools have raised academic expectations, increased graduation rates to their highest level on record, and sent more students to college than ever. The bill passed by the House today will cement this progress. The Every Student Succeeds Act will fix the No Child Left Behind Act to reduce over-testing and one-size-fits-all federal mandates. It also guarantees that all students will be held to high academic standards that prepare them for college and careers. This legislation ensures that, when students fall behind, local educators will take action and invest in what works to help them learn. Finally, the bill makes one of the best investments we can make in our children's future by providing high-quality preschool to more students. This bipartisan compromise is an important step forward, and we look forward to the Senate's swift passage of this bill.
