    The United States congratulates the first cohort of Quad Fellows from Australia, India, Japan, and the United States. At the second in-person Quad Leaders' Summit this past May, President Biden, Prime Minister Albanese, Prime Minister Modi, and Prime Minister Kishida officially opened this Fellowship. Today we are proud to welcome a group of 100 diverse, interdisciplinary, inspiring, and exceptional students – 25 from each Quad country – who are the next-generation of great STEM minds. Each of them have demonstrated their commitment to advancing innovation and collaboration among our four great democracies and an enthusiasm for building a better tomorrow for the Indo-Pacific and the world. Under President Biden, the Quad partnership has been elevated to unprecedented heights and it will only grow in the coming years. These young people will bring the Quad closer together and with them leading the way, we are confident our future is in good hands.
