    I commend the Senate for moving quickly to confirm John Negroponte as the first Director of National Intelligence. I congratulate John on his confirmation, and I look forward to working closely with him. As the DNI, Ambassador Negroponte will lead a unified intelligence community as it reforms and adapts to the new challenges of the 21st century. The United States continues to make progress in the global war -on terror against the enemies of freedom who target innocent civilians and seek weapons of mass destruction. I appreciate John's willingness to once again serve his country and the many men and women who serve in the intelligence community.
