    I have signed into law H.R. 739, which effects miscellaneous changes in the laws administered by or affecting the United States Coast Guard and Maritime Administration. In approving H.R. 739, I have been assured by the Department of State that section 10 of the act is consistent with existing treaty obligations and consistent with existing United States cabotage statutes.
