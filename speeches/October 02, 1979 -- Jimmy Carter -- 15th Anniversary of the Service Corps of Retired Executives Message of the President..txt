    On the fifteenth anniversary of the Service Corps of Retired Executives, I want to congratulate the 8,000 SCORE volunteers who provide valuable assistance to small businesses all over the country
. As a former small businessman, I know from first-hand experience how important this SBA program really is.
SCORE volunteers have guided and counseled hundreds of thousands of small businesses over the past fifteen years. Their efforts have helped our nation maintain the healthy small business community that is the backbone of national stability and confidence.
On this occasion I salute SCORE volunteers and their associates at the Small Business Administration who have helped SCORE grow in numbers, spirit and accomplishment. All Americans can be proud of what this milestone represents.
