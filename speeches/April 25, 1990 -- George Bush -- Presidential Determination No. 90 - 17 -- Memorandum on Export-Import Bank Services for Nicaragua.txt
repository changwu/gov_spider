    Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Subject: Determination Under Section 2(b)(2) of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, as Amended in 1986 -- Nicaragua
Pursuant to section 2(b)(2) of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, as amended in 1986, I determine that Nicaragua is no longer a "Marxist-Leninist" country; it is therefore in the national interest for the Export-Import Bank of the United States to guarantee, insure, extend credit and participate in the extension of credit in connection with the purchase or lease of any product or service by, for use in, or for sale or lease to Nicaragua.
Please transmit this determination to the Speaker of the House and to the President of the Senate.
You are authorized and directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
George Bush
