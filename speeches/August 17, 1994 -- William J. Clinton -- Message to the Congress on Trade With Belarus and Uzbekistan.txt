    To the Congress of the United States:
I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Belarus and Uzbekistan to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP program offers duty-free access to the U.S. market and is authorized by the Trade Act of 1974.
I have carefully considered the criteria identified in sections 501 and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974. In light of these criteria, and particularly the level of development and initiation of economic reforms in Belarus and Uzbekistan, I have determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits to these two countries.
This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, August 17, 1994.
