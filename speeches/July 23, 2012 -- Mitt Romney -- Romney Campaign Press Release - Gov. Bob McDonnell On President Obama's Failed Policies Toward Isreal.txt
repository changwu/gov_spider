    Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell today made the following statement on President Obama's failure to visit Israel during his first term:
"U.S.-Israeli relations have been strained by the failure of the Obama Administration to stress unequivocal support for our longstanding ally.  Thus, it's no surprise that President Obama is struggling to shore up support in the Jewish community. But his photo-ops are no substitute for a policy based upon shared values and shared interests — something we haven't seen from Barack Obama. Instead, we've seen his administration pressure Israel at a moment when Israel's security is under the greatest threat since the October War of 1973."
