    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Cox (R) California and 134 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports passage of H.R. 49, as reported from the House Judiciary Committee, to make permanent the moratorium on taxes on Internet access, regardless of the speed of that access, and on multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. The Administration believes that government should support e-commerce and Internet usage and availability, including the use of broadband technology, and not discourage it through new administrative barriers or taxes. The Administration urges the House of Representatives to pass H.R. 49 expeditiously so legislation can be enacted before the current moratorium expires on November 1, 2003.
