    Dear Mr. Carey:
It is with sincere gratitude for your devoted service to our Nation that I accept your resignation as General Counsel of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, effective on this date, as you requested.
For nearly three years, you have directed the office of the General Counsel with energy, skill and a strong sense of purpose. Under your leadership, landmark decisions have been reached which have broadened the economic opportunities of all Americans and have effectively enlisted the positive assistance of employers in identifying and correcting discriminatory employment systems. Your personal contributions in this regard have been significant, and you have my heartfelt gratitude.
Now as you depart, I hope you will always look back with a special sense of satisfaction on your years with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. You have established a record of accomplishment in which you can take pride, and you leave with my best wishes for every success and happiness in the years ahead.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
[The Honorable William A. Carey, General Counsel, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 1800 G Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20506]
