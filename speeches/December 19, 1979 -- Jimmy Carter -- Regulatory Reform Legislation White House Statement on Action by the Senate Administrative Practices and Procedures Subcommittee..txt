    The Senate Administrative Practices and Procedures Subcommittee has drafted and today reported out S. 2147, the Regulatory Flexibility and Administrative Reform Act of 1979.
The President congratulated Senators John Culver and Paul Laxalt and their colleagues on the subcommittee on an impressive job of melding and refining regulatory reform proposals from the administration, other Senators, and many expert witnesses. He said that this issue urgently needs to be addressed by responsible and well-crafted legislation.
The President is gratified that major provisions of the bill carry forward the essentials of his regulatory reform program, established through Executive orders and other administrative initiatives. These include strengthening regulatory management and cost-effective decisionmaking, elimination of unnecessary regulatory burdens, enhanced opportunities for meaningful public participation, and reduction of redtape and unnecessary delay in the regulatory process. This is the type of balanced reform effort which will streamline the Government's efforts to protect the health, safety, and welfare of our citizens, without wasting public or private resources.
The President hopes for speedy and responsible action in the full Judiciary Committee and in the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, where Senator Ribicoff has introduced and held hearings on similar legislation.
