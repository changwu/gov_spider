    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement on Mother's Day.
"I could not have gotten to where I am today without my mother Bobbi. She worked hard so I could get ahead. She instilled in me the values of hard work and perseverance and I am so grateful. I am also thankful to have such a wonderful woman as a partner. Elizabeth continues to amaze me every day.
"Today, let's also remember all the mothers who are working hard, but struggling to provide for their kids. We need to make it easier for working mothers to balance work and family. Our mothers have given us the best and deserve the best from us."
