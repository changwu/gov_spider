    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Pepper (D) FL and 67 others)
The Administration favors elimination of the age-70 cap in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), to protect older workers against mandatory retirement and adverse personnel actions that could be construed as forcing retirement. Accordingly, the Administration would support H.R. 4154 if it were amended so that elimination of the cap would not apply to promotion and hiring.
