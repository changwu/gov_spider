.@60Minutes & third place anchor, @NorahODonnell, are doing everything in their power to demean our Country, much to the benefit of the Radical Left Democrats. Tonight they put on yet another Fake "Whistleblower", a disgruntled employee who supports Dems, fabricates stories, &...Retweets: 18531Favorites: 71159

....spews lies. @60Minutes report was incorrect, which they couldn't care less about. Fake News! I don't know this guy, never met him, but don't like what I see. How can a creep like this show up to work tomorrow & report to @SecAzar, his boss, after trashing him on T.V.?....Retweets: 11971Favorites: 49228

....This whole Whistleblower racket needs to be looked at very closely, it is causing great injustice & harm. I hope you are listening @SenSusanCollins I also hope that Shari Redstone will take a look at her poorly performing gang. She knows how to make things right!Retweets: 12516Favorites: 49753

Wow! The Front Page @washingtonpost Headline reads, "A BOOST IN TESTS, BUT LACK OF TAKERS." We have done a great job on Ventilators, Testing, and everything else. Were left little by Obama. Over 11 million tests, and going up fast. More than all countries in the world, combined.Retweets: 23367Favorites: 94582

The Wall Street Journal Editorial states that it doesn't want me to act in an "impulsive" manner in Afghanistan. Could somebody please explain to them that we have been there for 19 years, and while soldier counts are way down now, hardly impulsive. Besides, the Taliban is.....Retweets: 20724Favorites: 86191

.....mixed about even wanting us to get out. They make a fortune $$$ by having us stay, and except at the beginning, we never really fought to win. We are more of a police force than the mighty military that we are, especially now as rebuilt. No, I am not acting impulsively!Retweets: 13457Favorites: 60530

So the so-called HHS Whistleblower was against HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE. Then why did he make, and sign, an emergency use authorization? @NorahODonnell said, "He shared his concerns with a reporter." In other words, he LEAKED. A dumb @60Minutes hit job on a grandstanding Never Trumper!Retweets: 26036Favorites: 84601
