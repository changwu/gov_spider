    Throughout his campaign, Donald Trump has consistently proven he's unfit to lead this nation in serious times.
By now, we've gotten use to his unserious policy proposals, lack of substance and outrageous comments.
But when he mocked a reporter with a disability, he stooped to a new low. What kind of person does something like that? What kind of person insults not only a disabled reporter, but millions of Americans across the country who either know someone with a disability or struggle with one themselves? It's certainly not the kind of person deserving of the presidency. That's why Tim Dyar got involved in our campaign.
"It's just not right. It's not presidential. I have a 12-year-old son who's handicapped. He has cerebral palsy and that just made me so angry. I told my wife I just couldn't let that stand. I had to do something to make sure Donald Trump wasn't the nominee," said Dyar who signed up to volunteer in South Carolina.
Donald Trump simply lacks the integrity, leadership and character worthy of the Oval Office.
It's time to say: Enough.
