    On this sixth anniversary of the murder of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri and 22 other innocent victims, the United States reaffirms our strong support for the Special Tribunal for Lebanon and its mission to find the truth behind that outrageous act of terrorism. Ending the era of impunity for political assassinations is essential to realizing the justice and stability that the Lebanese people deserve, and any attempt to interfere with the Tribunal's work or fuel tensions within Lebanon must not be tolerated.
The cause for which Prime Minister Hariri and so many Lebanese patriots gave their lives must remain our guide. To this end, the United States will never waver in our support for the sovereignty, integrity, and independence of Lebanon, and we remain committed to the full implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1559, 1680, and 1701. At this critical moment, we call on all friends of Lebanon to stand with the people of Lebanon, who must be free to determine their own destiny. And those Lebanese who forge their future in a spirit of peace and reconciliation will continue to have a strong partner in the United States.
