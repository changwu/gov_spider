    Nancy and I were deeply distressed and concerned to learn about Bill Casey's condition. He is a talented, dedicated, and able public servant, whose service to this administration and to our country is deeply valued.
While he is hospitalized, the Central Intelligence Agency will maintain its normal operations under the careful procedures Bill developed in the event of his temporary incapacity. Our thoughts and prayers are with Bill and his family.
