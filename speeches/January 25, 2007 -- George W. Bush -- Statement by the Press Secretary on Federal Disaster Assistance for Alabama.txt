    The President today made additional disaster assistance available to the State of Alabama by authorizing an increase in the level of Federal funding for Public Assistance projects undertaken as a result of Hurricane Katrina.
Under the President's major disaster declaration issued for the State of Alabama on August 29, 2005, for Hurricane Katrina, Federal funding was made available to State and local governments in multiple counties for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct Federal assistance. For a period of up to 72 hours, Federal funding was made available at 100 percent of the total eligible costs for emergency protective measures, including direct Federal assistance. The period of up to 72 hours at 100 percent excluded debris removal.
On September 1, 2005, the President amended his declaration of August 29, 2005, and extended the period for 100 percent Federal funding for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct Federal assistance, for a period of 60 days retroactive to the date of the major disaster declaration.
Under the President's order today, the Federal share for Public Assistance, including direct Federal assistance, has been increased to 90 percent of the total eligible costs, except for assistance previously approved at 100 percent Federal funding.
The increase to 90 percent Federal share is retroactive to the date of the President's major disaster declaration for the State of Alabama.
