Will be speaking to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey this morning about bringing peace to the mess that I inherited in the Middle East. I will get it all done but what a mistake in lives and dollars (6 trillion) to be there in the first place!Retweets: 16150Favorites: 69764

After Turkey call I will be heading over to Trump National Golf Club Jupiter to play golf (quickly) with Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson. Then back to Mar-a-Lago for talks on bringing even more jobs and companies back to the USA!Retweets: 15606Favorites: 92732

Horrible and cowardly terrorist attack on innocent and defenseless worshipers in Egypt. The world cannot tolerate terrorism we must defeat them militarily and discredit the extremist ideology that forms the basis of their existence!Retweets: 33866Favorites: 145647

Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named Man (Person) of the Year like last year but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway!Retweets: 43917Favorites: 166537
