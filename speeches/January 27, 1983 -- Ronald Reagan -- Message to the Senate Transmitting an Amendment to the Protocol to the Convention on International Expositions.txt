    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith an amendment to the Protocol of November 30, 1972 (TIAS 9948) to the Convention of November 22, 1928 concerning International Expositions (TIAS 6548, 6549) with a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to its acceptance.
The purpose of the amendment is to permit France to commemorate the French Revolution in a universal exposition at Paris in 1989, and the United States and Spain to commemorate the discovery of the Americas in a two-site universal exposition at Chicago and Seville in 1992. The present provisions of the Protocol do not permit the holding of a universal exposition in 1992 and another universal exposition only three years earlier in 1989. A minimum interval of seven years is required by the Protocol.
I submit herewith the Report of the Secretary of State on the amendment.
I strongly support the holding of a universal exposition to commemorate the discovery of the Americas and have previously designated Chicago as the site in the United States for that purpose. I recommend that the Senate give prompt consideration to the amendment and advice and consent to its acceptance.
