LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” GOP presidential candidate Ron Paul beats President Barack Obama in a head-to-head matchup in the key swing state of Iowa according to the latest Des Moines Register Iowa Poll.
Congressman Paul bests President Obama 49-42 percent, the largest margin of victory for any of the other GOP contenders. Obama would beat Newt Gingrich 51 percent to 37 percent, while Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney would beat Obama by four percent and two percent, respectively, both within the +/- 4 percent margin of error for the poll. In 2008 President Barack Obama beat Senator John McCain by nearly 10 percent in Iowa.
Notably, Paul wins 55 percent of the under-30 vote, a demographic that Obama won 66 percent of in Iowa in the 2008 general election.
"This is just more evidence of the fact that Ron Paul is the only candidate who can beat Barack Obama," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton. "In order to win back the White House Republicans must nominate a candidate who can provide stark contrast with the failings of the current administration and Ron Paul is the only candidate advocating for something other than the dismal, status quo policies."
The poll surveyed 611 likely Iowa voters between February 12th and 15th.
