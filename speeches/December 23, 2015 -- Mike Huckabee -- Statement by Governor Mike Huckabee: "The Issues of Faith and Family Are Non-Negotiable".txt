    Conservatives are being asked to 'coalesce' around yet another corporately-funded candidate that says something very different at a big donor fundraiser in Manhattan than at a church in Marshalltown. Shouldn't a candidate be expected to have authenticity and consistency, instead of having to look at a map to decide what to believe and what to say?
One reason I do respect Trump is that whether you agree with him or not, he doesn't pretend with his principles or change his message depending on his location or audience. If issues like marriage and the sanctity of life are truly issues of principle and not just politics, then there should not be geographical boundaries to what is right and wrong.
As the campaign continues you're going to continue to see reports of candidates who say one thing in private and another to the public -- all in an effort to win at all costs. However I will remain steadfast in my positions, particularly on the non-negotiable issues of faith and family.
