    In celebration of Veterans Day, Scott O'Grady, Co-Chair of Veterans for Trump and Air Force veteran issued the following statement:
"Those who raise their right hand, taking an oath to defend this great nation from all enemies, both foreign and domestic, are the finest of American treasures. Since the founding of our nation, countless soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines have answered the call and for their service we are truly grateful. Without these brave souls, our republic would be lost to tyranny or terror. Because of military veterans, future generations have hope in the values of faith and freedom. Thanks to those who served, we have peace on the home front. We thank you for your service and wish all who wore the uniform a happy Veterans Day."
