    Clinton Campaign Releases New 30-second Ad in Pennsylvania Featuring Voter Reactions to Sen. Obama's Comments
PHILADELPHIA, PA - The Clinton campaign is releasing a new television ad today featuring the reactions that some of its supporters in Pennsylvania are having to the remarks Sen. Obama made about those Americans who live in Pennsylvania's small towns.
At a fundraiser in San Francisco on April 6, 2008 that was closed to the press, Sen. Obama said: "You go into some of these small towns in Pennsylvania, and like a lot of small towns in the Midwest, the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing's replaced them. And they fell through the Clinton administration, and the Bush administration, and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not. So it's not surprising then that they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations."
