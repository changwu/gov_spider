    As a native New Yorker, Maurice Hinchey has served the people of the Empire State for over 35 years. Prior to his time in office, Maurice proudly served his country as a member of the United States Navy. He then went on to serve as a member in the State Assembly for 18 years, followed by 10 consecutive terms as a U.S. Representative for the 22d congressional district of New York. Throughout his career Maurice has been a champion for the middle class, leading the charge for renewable energy and Wall Street reform and working tirelessly to get Americans back to work. Michelle and I join the people of New York in thanking Congressman Hinchey for his service.
