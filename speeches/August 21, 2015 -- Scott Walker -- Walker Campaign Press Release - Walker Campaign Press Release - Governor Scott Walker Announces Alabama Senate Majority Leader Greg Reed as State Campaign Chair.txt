    Manchester, N.H. - Ahead of his Saturday visit to Alabama, Gov. Scott Walker today announced State Senate Majority Leader Greg Reed as the Alabama chairman for his presidential campaign.
"It is an absolute pleasure to have the backing of Sen. Greg Reed in this race," said Walker. "I have a great deal of respect for his work on behalf of Alabama's hard-working taxpayers. As next year's SEC Primary begins to take shape, his insight and guidance will be invaluable to our campaign. We intend to compete to win in Alabama, and with Sen. Reed's help, I believe we will."
"With a crowded and talented field of Republican presidential candidates, what we need right now is someone who has governed and shown that conservative principles work," said Reed. "Gov. Scott Walker is a doer who proved he can enact those conservative reforms in a blue state. I wholeheartedly support Gov. Walker because our party deserves this candidate of action."
State Sen. Greg Reed is Alabama Senate Majority Leader, a position elected by the Senate Republican Caucus members. He is Deputy Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services, a member of the Judiciary Committee and several others. He was an integral part of reforming the state's Medicaid system and has been a vital participant in streamlining state government. Reed has passed legislation to fund classroom supplies for teachers and to push back against Obamacare. In 2010, Reed won the general election for State Senate with 72 percent of the vote, and in 2014, he won re-election, receiving 29,611 votes, the highest of any state senator that year. Reed works at Preferred Medical Systems where he has served as Vice President for the past 11 years. He and his wife Mitsy are parents to three sons.
