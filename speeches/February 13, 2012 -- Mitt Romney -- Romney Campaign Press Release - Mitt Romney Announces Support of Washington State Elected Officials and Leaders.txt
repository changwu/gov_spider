    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Washington State elected officials and leaders. These supporters join a growing list that includes Congresswomen Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Jaime Herrera Beutler, Secretary of State Sam Reed, former Congressman George Nethercutt and former State Senator Dino Rossi.
"These leaders share my goals to get government out of the lives of Washingtonians," said Mitt Romney. "In order to lower spending, repeal Obamacare, and bring back jobs, we must first defeat President Obama. With the hard work of these leaders, we can bring conservative change to the White House."
"Mitt Romney has such strong support in Washington because he is the only candidate who can defeat President Obama and bring the principles we have been fighting for in Washington State to the White House," said Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers. "Our state and our country cannot afford four more years of failure from President Obama. He has failed to deliver on the promises he made four years ago and it is time that we have a leader in the White House who can fix our fiscal mess and save the economy."
