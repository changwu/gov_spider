    I welcome and applaud passage today by the House of Representatives of the African growth and opportunity act. This historic initiative will set the foundation for a stronger partnership between the United States and Africa. I urge the Senate to act quickly so that we can strengthen the ties between our Nation and a continent on the verge of a new era of democracy and prosperity.
This legislation offers the opportunity for increased trade and investment between the United States and Africa to the mutual benefit of both. By working with African nations to build their economies, strengthen democratic government, and increase opportunities for all the people of Africa, we will help build strong, capable partners with whom we can work to counter the growing threats of terrorism, crime, environmental degradation, and disease.
