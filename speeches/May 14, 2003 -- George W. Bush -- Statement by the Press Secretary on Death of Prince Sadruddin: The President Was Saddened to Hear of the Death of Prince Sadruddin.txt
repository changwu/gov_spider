    Aga Khan on May 13, 2003. Prince Sadruddin was a great humanitarian, philanthropist, and international civil servant.
As UN High Commissioner for Refugees for over a decade starting in the mid-1960s, Prince Sadruddin led international efforts to help refugees from Bangladesh and Burundi, assist Southeast Asians fleeing conflict, and find new homes for thousands of Asians expelled from Uganda by then-President Idi Amin. He served with great distinction in a number of other roles, including coordinator of UN humanitarian aid programs in Afghanistan and in the Gulf region during the 1990-91 Gulf War, and supported several important environmental causes.
The world will miss this man of great compassion and principled action. On behalf of the American people, we extend our deepest sympathies to his family and friends.
