Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced that former Congressman Bob Beauprez (R-CO) has endorsed his candidacy for President of the United States. Congressman Beauprez will advise the campaign and help communicate Governor Romney's message of conservative change in Washington. He will travel to Iowa tomorrow to campaign for Governor Romney.
"Congressman Beauprez has had a distinguished career serving his community, his state and his nation. He has never stopped working to ensure that future generations would find a Colorado better than it is today. He will be a powerful surrogate for our message of strengthening the American people through lower taxes, less government regulation and stronger national defense," said Governor Romney.
Joining Romney for President and preparing to travel to Iowa, Congressman Beauprez said, "To change Washington, we need to elect a President who can take Washington apart and put it back together. Governor Romney is not a Washington insider, but has a record built in the private sector and in public service. He is the right candidate to lead America forward."
