    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of South Dakota and ordered Federal aid to supplement State, local and Tribal recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms and flooding during the period of September 22-23, 2010.
Federal funding is available to State and eligible local and Tribal governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms and flooding in Brookings, Lake, Moody, and Union Counties and the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures for all counties and Tribes within the State.
