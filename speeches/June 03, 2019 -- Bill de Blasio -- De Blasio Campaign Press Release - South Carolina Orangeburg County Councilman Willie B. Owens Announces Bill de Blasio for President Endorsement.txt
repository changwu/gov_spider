    Orangeburg County Councilman Willie B. Owens announced that he is endorsing Mayor de Blasio for President of the United States today. Located in South Carolina, Orangeburg County is home to the second largest population of African-American voters in the Palmetto State.
"After hearing Mayor de Blasio speak twice about what he has done for working families in NYC and what he can do for all us as President, I have decided to put all of my support behind him. We need a proven leader who will put people first in the White House, and Mayor de Blasio is that leader," said Councilman Willie B. Owens.
"I'm so grateful for Councilman Owens supports. He is a fighter for South Carolinians, and I'm excited to work with him to put working people first in this country," said Mayor Bill de Blasio.
