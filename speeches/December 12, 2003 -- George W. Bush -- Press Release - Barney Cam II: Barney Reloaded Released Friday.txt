    The highly anticipated sequel to last year's holiday blockbuster video "Barney Cam" will be unveiled Friday at 11:00 A.M. by Laura Bush at the Children's National Medical Center
"Barney Cam II: Barney Reloaded" will then be available exclusively on the White House web site - www.whitehouse.gov
The original "Barney Cam" was released last December and featured Barney, the President's Scottish Terrier, touring the White House to provide viewers with a dog's eye view of the holiday decorations.
Realizing that sequels are often fraught with peril, the producers of Barney Cam secured starring roles from the President, the First Lady, many senior White House officials and a yet-to-be-named surprise cameo appearance.
Sources close to Barney say that Barney Cam II: Barney Reloaded has a "more complicated plot" and is "rich with drama and humor."
