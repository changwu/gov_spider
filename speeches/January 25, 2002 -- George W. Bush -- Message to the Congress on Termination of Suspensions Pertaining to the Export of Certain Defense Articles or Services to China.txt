    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 902 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (Public Law 101-246) (the "Act"), and as President of the United States, I hereby report to the Congress that it is in the national interest of the United States to terminate the suspensions under section 902 of the Act insofar as such suspensions pertain to the export of defense articles or defense services in support of efforts by the Government of Japan to destroy Japanese chemical weapons abandoned during World War II in the People's Republic of China. License requirements remain in place for these exports and require review and approval on a case-by-case basis by the United States Government.
