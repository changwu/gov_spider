    Today the House of Representatives moved us one historic step closer toward a new tax code for America. I congratulate the Members of both parties who worked together to enable the long and arduous process of tax reform to go forward. We now look to the Senate to move quickly, and to make all necessary changes, to ensure that the final bill is unequivocally profamily, projobs, and progrowth.
