  A Proclamation

Individual acts of kindness are the currency of social change. Combined with others and directed toward a worthwhile cause, these efforts exemplify the spirit of volunteerism. Inspired by just such a vision of service, organizations throughout the country are coming together this week to recycle pennies for charitable causes.
The penny is the most widely used of the denominations currently in circulation, but pennies too often rest idle in piggy banks and dresser drawers. The U.S. Mint—which will produce another 13.3 billion pennies this year to meet demands—joins me in encouraging citizens to help return pennies to circulation.
With the holiday season approaching, this is a better time than ever to remember those who are in need of a helping hand. By contributing pennies to charities and worthy community causes, we can make this season a little brighter for our fellow citizens and truly make every penny count.
The Congress, by House Joint Resolution 415, has designated the week of October 16, 1994, as "National Penny Charity Week" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.
Now, Therefore, I, William J. Clinton, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of October 16, 1994, as National Penny Charity Week. I urge all Americans to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities, including the donation of pennies to charities, particularly those that provide direct services to our Nation's underprivileged and disadvantaged population, and to worthy community causes.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and nineteenth.

WILLIAM J. CLINTON
