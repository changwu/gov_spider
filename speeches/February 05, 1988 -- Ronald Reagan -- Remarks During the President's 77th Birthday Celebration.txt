Well, all of you here—and to think that I kept trying to get Howard [Baker] to drop the packages and let me bring them over here. I didn't know why he was going to all that trouble. [Laughter] But, yes, it was a surprise, but I don't know of a happier surprise-all of you here, so many of you so dear to both of us. And I couldn't have imagined this in my wildest times. A matter of fact, I had it figured that we'd be just about getting into the helicopter now to go to Camp David, and I'm glad we're not.
But I don't know how to thank you, and Marvin—a song of my very own. [Laughter]
Mr. Hamlisch. That's yours.
The President. I've got to take singing lessons. [Laughter] But thank you all very much for all that you've done.
Mr. Hamlisch. We're all going to now sing one song that I didn't write, but I think it's the appropriate song.
