Some very disturbing videos have emerged of these top officials of Planned Parenthood basically saying that they're going to be selling baby parts, it's disgusting stuff. I know you're pro-life, I do know that, but would you pull federal funding from Planned Parenthood if you were president right now?
RICK PERRY: Well we did that in Texas when I was the Governor. We zeroed out the funding for Planned Parenthood in the state of Texas and I see no difference between that and I think all Americans who have conscience looked at that video and realized that's not where they want their federal dollars being spent. I think Democrats and Republicans alike, they see that â€” that's abhorrent, and we shouldn't be spending federal dollars on Planned Parenthood.
