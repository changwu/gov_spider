    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the death of Massachusetts native Glen Doherty during the recent attack on our consulate in Libya:  
"Ann and I extend our deepest condolences to the family and friends of Glen Doherty, a native of Winchester, Massachusetts, who was among those killed in Tuesday's assault on our consulate in Libya. Glen served America with bravery and distinction, and gave his life in an effort to save others. Befitting his service as a Navy SEAL, his legacy is one of heroism and courage. We grieve for his loss — and for all who lost their lives — and pray for the comfort of those who will miss him."
