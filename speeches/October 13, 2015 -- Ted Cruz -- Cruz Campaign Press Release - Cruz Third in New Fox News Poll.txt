    HOUSTON, Texas – A new Fox News poll shows Cruz continues to move up in national surveys and has taken sole position of third place behind Donald Trump and Ben Carson. Cruz comes in at 10% in the Fox News poll, affirming results from this week's CBS poll, which also had Cruz in third.


The rising poll numbers come after a successful fundraising quarter in which the campaign raised more than $12 million, followed by raising over $1 million in the first nine days of the fourth quarter — bringing the total raised for the campaign to $27.5 million. And Cruz has built an impressive nationwide organization totaling more than 500 leadership team members, including chairs in every county of the first four caucus and primary states.
Critics and pundits have begun noticing that Cruz has put together a top-notch organization relying on the fundamentals of successful campaigns.
National Review observed, "Cruz has proved to be an ambitious and serious campaigner, devoted to doing the hard and unglamorous work required of presidential candidates."
Cruz will spend the next week campaigning in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire continuing to argue that his record of consistent conservatism is what America needs to the keep the country free, prosperous, and secure.
