    Former Missouri Senator Kit Bond issued the following statement regarding the Missouri caucuses today:
"With the economy in the sad shape it's in, I'm gratified that the voters here have chosen the one candidate who has actual experience turning around failing enterprises. Mitt Romney has accomplished many things in his life, but it's his experience in business that truly makes him stand out in this field. Here in Missouri, where a lot of people are hurting, we sorely need the kind of change that he alone is capable of bringing to Washington. We need a conservative businessman in the White House. Republican voters here clearly agree."
