    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Sen. Byrd (D) West Virginia)
This Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views on the Supplemental Appropriations Bill, FY 2001, as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
The Administration supports passage of the bill as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Administration applauds the Senate's efforts to provide most of the funding requested by the Administration to enhance defense readiness, operations, and maintenance and to improve the morale of our servicemen, women, and families, as well as other priorities and to do so without the use of unnecessary emergency designations. The President's senior advisors would recommend that the President sign a bill that reflects his priorities and is within the levels the discretionary spending limits allow.
The Administration commends the Senate for not including the provision in the House-passed version of the bill that would have rescinded $389 million in disaster relief funds for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). FEMA is continuing to assess the impact of Tropical Storm Allison on Texas, Louisiana, and Florida, and these funds may be needed to pay for this or other natural disasters occurring in FY 2001.
The Administration is committed to working with the Congress to enact the supplemental appropriations bill as soon as possible in order to address compelling fourth-quarter requirements. It is imperative to enact this measure promptly to meet critical national security and other needs. The Administration looks forward to working with the Senate in order to enact this bill as expeditiously as possible.
