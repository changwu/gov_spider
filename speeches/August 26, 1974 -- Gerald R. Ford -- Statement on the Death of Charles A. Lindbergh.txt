    FROM THE MOMENT that the Spirit of St. Louis landed in Paris on May 21, 1927, Charles A. Lindbergh had earned a place in history. For a generation of Americans and for millions of other people around the world, the "Lone Eagle" represented all that was best in our country--honesty, courage, and the will to greatness.
In later years, his life was darkened by tragedy and colored by political controversy. But, in both public and private life, General Lindbergh always remained a brave, sincere patriot. Nearly half a century has passed since his courageous solo flight across the Atlantic, but the courage and daring of his feat will never be forgotten. For years to come, we will also remember the selfless, sincere man himself, Charles A. Lindbergh, one of America's all-time heroes and a great pioneer of the air age that changed the world.
On the occasion of his death, Mrs. Ford and I extend our sincere condolences to Mrs. Lindbergh and the family.
