    From the start of his campaign, President Trump has denied science and undermined our democracy rather than addressing the struggles facing American working families. President Trump doesn't have a plan to stop this pandemic, protect the health care of Mainers with preexisting conditions, or rebuild our struggling economy. His failed leadership has threatened the health and safety of Americans and ultimately punished hardworking Mainers.
Mainers don't need more dishonesty — they need a leader with a plan. As president, I will put us on a path to recovery — starting with immediate action to save the lives and protect the jobs of Americans who cannot afford another four years of President Trump. I'll work to bring our country together, address our national crises, and rebuild our economy to create a better future for all.
