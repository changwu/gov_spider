    James M. Beggs has requested that the President relieve him of his duties as Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration pending disposition of the charges against Mr. Beggs. While reluctantly acceding to his request, the President has asked Mr. Beggs to assist temporarily in the orderly transition of his responsibilities to his colleagues at NASA to facilitate continuity of management at this critically important agency. Mr. Beggs has agreed to do so. Under Mr. Beggs' leadership the space program has been revitalized, a fact which is accepted by virtually everyone in the field. This important record must be continued.
