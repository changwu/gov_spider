    Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:) 
Pursuant to section 502(d)(3) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, (the "1974 Act") (19 U.S.C. 2462(d)(3)), I am hereby advising you of my intent to suspend the duty-free treatment accorded under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) to certain eligible articles that are the product of Thailand, effective on December 30, 2020.
After considering the criteria set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2462(c)), in particular section 502(c)(4) (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)(4)), I have determined that Thailand has not assured the United States that Thailand will provide equitable and reasonable access to its markets. Accordingly, I have determined that it is appropriate to suspend the duty-free treatment accorded under the GSP to certain eligible articles that are the product of Thailand.
The United States remains committed to fair and reciprocal trade with Thailand.
DONALD J. TRUMP
