On The Kelly File last night, Marco said the White House's response to the terror attack in San Bernardino defies explanation.

Megyn Kelly asked him about the Obama Administration's treatment of the attack.
Here's how he described it:
Inexplicable, really.
First of all, from the very first instance after this happened, they, like most people on the left, immediately jumped on this whole gun control argument without knowing any of the facts about this case — just immediately jumped on that.
And they have continued banging the drum of gun control up until today when as every hour went by the indications were greater and greater that this was a terrorist act. And we now know that it was, irrespective of whether the White House or not has acknowledged it yet.

Marco also pointed out that the left has ignored how irrelevant their proposed gun control measures are to stopping tragedies like this one.
They immediately jumped on it as another example of another mass killing, and this is why we need gun control, completely ignoring that none of the laws that they are proposing would have done anything to prevent this shooting or any of the previous shootings that they have cited or pointed to.

Marco has been relentless in rejecting the left's attempts to use the San Bernardino attack to push gun control, always standing up for the right of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves.
