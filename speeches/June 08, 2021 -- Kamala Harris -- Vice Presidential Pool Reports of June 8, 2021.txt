VPOTUS travel pool report #3 -Palace arrival 
The motorcade pulled up to the Palacaio Nacional at 9:54 AM CST after an exciting ride featuring dozens of cameramen on the back of motorcycles speeding alongside the motorcade.
At one point transit security tried to run off the motorcyclists from following us.

Military members dressed in green saluted VPOTUS and AMLO as they entered the patio at 10am.
The two stood off to the side as signatories signed the memorandum. The VP was wearing a mask and AMLO was not.
After the signing and a round of applause the pair exited at 10:01.

VPOTUS travel pool report #5 - Photo op

The rooms where the meeting is taking place are the official rooms in the palace typically used for meetings of state like this one. In one of the anterooms, there are portraits of leaders of different American nations, including one of George Washington & one of Jose Marti, the Cuban poet & revolutionary. They're holding the actual meeting in an elegant room outfitted with a long, polished wood table, gilt-framed mirrors on the wall and a huge crystal chandelier hanging over the table set with small American and Mexican flags and nameplates. They are rotating us in so we're each getting a minute or two to look. We are holding in one of the anterooms; Harris and AMLO are not yet in there, the meeting room (Leona Vicario room) appears to be empty

VPOTUS travel report #15 - VP gaggle remarks 
VP Harris spoke for six minutes with members of the travel pool.
She's addressed the border question overshadowing her trip to the region but said when she's in Guatemala "I think we should be having a conversation about Guatemala"
"In terms of border security, the work that we are doing together includes the work of processing migration within the country of Mexico and, and, in its southern border and then of course in Guatemala, which is part of the conversation we had yesterday, There is the work that we are doing around Mutual Aid around reinforcement of security issues, particularly as it relates to our concern about human trafficking and things of that nature. But look, here's the bottom line:
We have, and it is a legitimate correct conversation and concern, which is to address what is happening at our America's southern border, and no question about that.We cannot have that question and had that conversation without also giving equal weight and attention to what is causing that to occur.""And so, the work that we are doing by being in Guatemala yesterday and in Mexico today is the work of reinforcing the point that we have to look at not only what is actually happening at the border, but what is causing that to happen."
On meeting withAMLO:"We had a very productive morning of with President Lopez Obrador. He and I spent a significant amount of time together one on one, and very directed candid conversations as well as a very productive bilateral meeting, and the Topics ranged from, especially in the bilateral meeting what we need to do around are interested in security, vaccines, and the pandemic of what we need to do on the issue of migration, and the relationship that Mexico in the United States have terms of our mutual interest in economic strength and security."
"It was, I believe, a very important conversation to have. At this level, where we made clear that the United States considers Mexico to be a partner on many of these issues. And, as evidenced by the MLU that we signed today between the United States and Mexico to combine our resources targeted at Central America and in particular the countries of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. There is work we are also doing together that relates to our shared interest and concern about smuggling in particular human trafficking an issue I've worked on for a long time, we have a shared interest in what is happening in terms of narcotics and the trafficking of narcotics, we spoke about that, in many ways, including specifically about our shared concern about fentanyl Entering the entering Mexico through its ports, and then arriving in the United States. We had a very productive conversation about specific issues related to that, including Mexico's recent enhanced port security initiatives, so there was a lot to discuss a lot of details. Allie my orcas Secretary I leave my office will be here next week. To follow up on the conversations we've had today."
