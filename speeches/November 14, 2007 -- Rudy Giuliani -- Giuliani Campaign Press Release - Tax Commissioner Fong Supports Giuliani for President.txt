    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced the endorsement of North Dakota Tax Commissioner Cory Fong. Fong, who was elected statewide on a platform of tax relief, sound fiscal management and government accountability, will serve as a State Co-Chair for Mayor Giuliani's North Dakota campaign.
Fong's endorsement comes as Mayor Giuliani makes a visit to Fargo today.
"Rudy is the leader who proved that fiscal discipline and conservative principles can be effective in controlling spending and cutting taxes in New York City," said Fong. "Rudy helped turn New York's deficit into a surplus. We need a President like Rudy who has the executive experience of managing a budget."
"Rudy is the real fiscal conservative in this race and having the support of Commissioner Fong is further evidence of that message resonating," said Giuliani's National Political Director Mark Campbell.
Fong joins State Chairman Kevin Cramer, Bismarck Mayor John Warford, State Public Service Commissioner Susan Wefald, National Committeewoman Connie Nicholas and North Dakota State Auditor Bob Peterson as fellow supporters for Rudy Giuliani in the state.
