But while President Obama tells Americans that his plan 'worked' and we're moving 'in the right direction,' another anemic quarter of economic growth and a slumping jobs market proves otherwise. Mitt Romney will pursue pro-growth economic policies that deliver a record he can run on, not run from." —Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman
