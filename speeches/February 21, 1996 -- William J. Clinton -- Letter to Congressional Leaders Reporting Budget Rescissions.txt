    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report three rescission proposals of budgetary resources, totaling $820 million. These rescissions offset the emergency FY 1996 Defense supplemental appropriations, which support the Bosnia peace implementation force. The rescissions affect the Department of Defense.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
