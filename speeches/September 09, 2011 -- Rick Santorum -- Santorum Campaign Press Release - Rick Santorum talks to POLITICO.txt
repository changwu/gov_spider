    Rick Santorum spoke with Politico prior to the debate last night. Here's the video. One important point that he makes is that he has always run as a conservative and has won elections in a blue state. Others have come from red states and have taken conservative positions, or come from blue states and governed in a progressive manner, but Santorum is a solid conservative who has won elections in a blue state. It takes leadership to be able to do that. Watch.
