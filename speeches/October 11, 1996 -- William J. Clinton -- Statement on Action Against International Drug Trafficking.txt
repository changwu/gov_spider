    I want to congratulate Attorney General Reno, Treasury Secretary Rubin, their crime fighting teams, and all law enforcement officers who worked to ensure the breakup of another notorious international drug ring through Operation Global S.E.A. Building on the success of this May's Operation Zorro II, the breakup of this drug network marks another milestone in our effort to cripple major international drug trafficking cartels.
I want to commend the unprecedented cooperation between frontline law enforcement agencies on the Federal, State, and local levels that brought down this narcotic network. My administration will continue to work with determination to track down and convict those who would threaten our communities and our children.
