  A Proclamation

Each year, at the height of spring's renewal, Americans take the time to reaffirm our allegiance to our country and to the ideals upon which it was founded. On this "Loyalty Day," we pledge to defend the blessings of American democracy.
Ours is still a relatively young Nation, but even in our brief history, we have seen many other forms of government come and go. We have witnessed the collapse of dictatorial regimes, while our brand of democracy has continued to evolve and flourish. Rather than establishing government control through the deprivation of basic human rights, our founders realized that individual freedom and the right to self-determination are the most powerful sources of national strength. This philosophy forms the bedrock upon which our Nation is built, and we continue to expand and enforce its wise mandate to this very day.
Generations of Americans have demonstrated their loyalty and devotion to this country, many risking their lives for the sake of defending the common good. To ensure that this loyalty and love of country remain a vibrant part of each new generation, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved July 18, 1958 (72 Stat. 369; 36 U.S.C. 162), has designated May 1 of each year as "Loyalty Day."
Now, Therefore, I, William J. Clinton, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 1994, as
Loyalty Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, including public recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States. I also call upon government officials to display the flag on all government buildings and grounds on this day.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighteenth.

WILLIAM J. CLINTON
