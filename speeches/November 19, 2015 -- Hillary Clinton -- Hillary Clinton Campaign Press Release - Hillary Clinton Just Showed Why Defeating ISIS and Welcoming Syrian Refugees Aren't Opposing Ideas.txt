Hillary just laid out her plan to defeat ISIS and end radical jihadi terrorism. One thing it doesn't include? Closing our doors to Syrian refugees.

"We cannot allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values and humanitarian obligations. Turning away orphans, applying a religious test, discriminating against Muslims, slamming the door on every single Syrian refugee—that's just not who we are. We are better than that."
Openness, freedom, and tolerance aren't just values—they are some of our best tools in the fight against terrorism.

"Remember, many of these refugees are fleeing the same terrorists who threaten us. It would be a cruel irony indeed if ISIS can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from finding new ones. ...
"America's open, free, tolerant society is described by some as a vulnerability in the struggle against terrorism. But I actually believe it's one of our greatest strengths. It reduces the appeal of radicalism and enhances the richness and resilience of our communities."
