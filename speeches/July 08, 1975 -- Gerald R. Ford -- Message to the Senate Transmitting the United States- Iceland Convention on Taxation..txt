    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, the Convention signed at Reykjavik on May 7, 1975 between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Iceland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital.
There is no convention on this subject presently in force between the United States and Iceland.
The Convention follows generally the form and content of most conventions of this type recently concluded by this government. Its primary purpose is to clearly identify the tax interests of the two countries so as to avoid double taxation and make difficult the illegal evasion of taxation.
I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
Conventions such as this one are an important element in promoting closer economic cooperation between the United States and other countries. I urge the Senate to act favorably on this Convention at an early date and give its advice and consent to ratification.
