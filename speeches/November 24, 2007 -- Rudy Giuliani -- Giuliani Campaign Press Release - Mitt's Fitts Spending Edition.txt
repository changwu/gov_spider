"Campaign Trail Mitt Romney is at it again in an effort to cover up his own lackluster record as Governor by attacking Rudy Giuliani. Then again, what other choice does Romney have considering he never cut taxes, received a 'C' rating from the CATO Institute for his handling of the economy as Governor, and passed a mandate-laden universal health care plan that he's now running away from?
"Mitt Romney simply has his facts wrong – not only did Mayor Giuliani turn over a balanced budget to his successor, but the city ended that fiscal year with a surplus."
– Paul Cellucci, Former Massachusetts Governor

  Imagine How Upset He'll Be When He Sees
