    STEWART ALSOP's hard, valiant struggle against cancer has ended at last, but his life and his writings will remain a standard for his profession for years to come. One of America's premier political commentators, he built his reputation upon a rigorous independence of mind, a dedicated and fearless pursuit of the truth, an uncommon devotion to the Nation's welfare, and an insistence that in all matters, no matter how controversial, good will and decency should prevail. It was characteristic of Stewart Alsop that the courage which marked his military service during World War II and his long, distinguished career as a journalist should also be the hallmark of his final struggle against death.
Mrs. Nixon and I join the Nation in mourning this sad loss.
