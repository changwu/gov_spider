And I call upon the people in each of our communities to contribute to the conservation of child health and the reduction of illness among children by exerting every effort to the end that before May Day, Child Health Day, children over nine months of age be immunized against diphtheria and smallpox, the two diseases for which we have the surest means of prevention.
