    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. DeMint (R) South Carolina and 281 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 622, the Hope for Children Act, as an important pro-family and pro-adoption tax relief initiative. H.R. 622 is consistent with the President's priorities, which
include permanently extending and increasing the adoption tax credit. The Administration looks forward to working with Congress through the legislative process to achieve a result that best embodies the objectives of the President's plan.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
Any law that would reduce receipts is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. Accordingly, H.R. 622 or any substitute amendment in lieu thereof, that will also reduce revenues, will be subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement. The Administration will work with Congress to ensure that any unintended sequester of spending does not occur under current law or the enactment of any other proposals that meet the President's objectives to reduce the debt, fund priority initiatives, and grant tax relief to all income tax paying Americans.
