    One of the exciting moments for our trip to Albania is to meet with small-business owners. Laura and I thank the mayor. We thank the owner of the restaurant, and we thank these entrepreneurs for joining us to talk about your story, about your dreams, and about the opportunities a microloan program, provided by the taxpayers of the United States, is giving you to create jobs.
And so we're excited to be here. Thank you for coming. And we're looking forward to hearing your stories.
Thank you.
