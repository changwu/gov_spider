    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Condit (D) CA and 60 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 350. The Administration recognizes the value of the additional analytical information called for by the bill. However, the Administration is concerned that, by considering only the costs and none of the benefits of legislation that protects human health, safety, the environment, or the Nation's economic well-being, the bill creates an unbalanced procedural obstacle to the enactment of legislation in the public interest.
An amendment may be offered on the House floor to address the imbalance and to ensure consideration of the benefits of such legislation. The Administration would support such an amendment.
The Administration is especially concerned about the provision in the bill that would establish a point of order on the use of user fees and revenues. This provision could delay or undermine funding for a number of well-established and important programs and laws that have traditionally received bipartisan support, including airline air traffic and ground safety, the Superfund program, and public health and health research legislation that would provide additional resources for public health programs.
