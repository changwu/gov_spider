    Today, 61 economists, led by Nobel Economics Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz, signed a letter urging Congress to pass the Build Back Better framework, which will create millions of good-paying jobs, spur long-term growth, reduce costs for middle class families, and combat the climate crisis. In particular, the economists highlight Build Back Better's transformative investments in children and caregiving, a clean energy economy for the 21st century, and the largest expansion of affordable health care coverage in a decade.

Economists: Build Back Better Framework Will Make Long-Neglected Key Economic Investments[10/28/21]
Dear Majority Leader Schumer, Minority Leader McConnell, Speaker Pelosi, and Minority Leader McCarthy:
The Build Back Better framework is a historic opportunity to invest in child care, long-term care, clean energy, health care and more.
These once-in-a-generation investments will create millions of jobs, lower costs on essential expenses for American families and help position the United States to meet the enormous challenges of the 21st century, including a changing economy and a growing climate crisis.
Once passed, this framework will counteract decades of underinvestment in our communities that has come at a cost to working Americans and caused our economy to grow unevenly.
We urge Congress to pass this critical and historic framework into law.
Signed,
