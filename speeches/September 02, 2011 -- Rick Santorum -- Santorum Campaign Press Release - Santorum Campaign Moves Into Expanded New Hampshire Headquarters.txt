Rick Santorum for President
273 South River Road
Bedford, NH 03110
Senator Santorum said, "The outpouring of support we have received since the Ames Straw Poll has spilled over beyond Iowa's borders and into many other states including New Hampshire. We're excited that the enthusiasm and size of our campaign continues to grow every day. The additions of staff, volunteers, and new office space were needed and necessary to run our New Hampshire campaign operations. Our new office space will allow our campaign to be the most volunteer friendly headquarters for our expanding grassroots base. I'm so proud of our New Hampshire team, and I look forward to working with them as we advance toward victory in New Hampshire's First-in-Nation Primary."
