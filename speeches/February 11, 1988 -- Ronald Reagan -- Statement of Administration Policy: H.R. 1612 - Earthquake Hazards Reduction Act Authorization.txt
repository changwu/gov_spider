    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Roe (D) New Jersey)
The Administration recommends that H.R. 1612, as passed by the Senate on December 21, 1987, not be considered under suspension of the rules. The Administration opposes H.R. 1612, as passed by the Senate, unless it is amended to:

—      Reduce authorization levels for the U.S. Geological Survey and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, consistent with the Bipartisan Budget agreement; and
—      Delete section 2, which is unnecessary in light of cost sharing regulations already issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
