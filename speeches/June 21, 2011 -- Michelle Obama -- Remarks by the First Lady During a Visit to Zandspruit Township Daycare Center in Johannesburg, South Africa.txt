    MRS. OBAMA: So we brought a gift. We brought you lots of books, some of my favorite books, some of the President's favorite books, some of Malia and Sasha's favorite books. But we wanted to read one of our favorite books.
This is called "The Cat in the Hat." Do you want to hold it up? "The Cat in the Hat." I used to read this book to Malia and Sasha all the time when they were little. I don't know if they remember. But we're -- all three of us are going to read it.
It's about a little boy and a little girl who are home all day by themselves, and it was raining outside, and they were very bored, and they got a visitor that wasn't invited. And he caused a lot of interesting stuff to go on.
Okay, you ready? Malia, take it away.
(The First Lady, Malia and Sasha read "The Cat in the Hat."
