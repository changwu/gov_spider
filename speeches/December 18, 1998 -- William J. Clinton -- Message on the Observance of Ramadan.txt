    Warm greetings to all those observing the holy month of Ramadan.
Ramadan is a special time of reflection and renewal for Muslims around the world, including the 6 million Americans who are making Islam one of our nation's fastest-growing religions. Through fasting and devoted reading of the Koran, Muslims strengthen their faith in God and deepen the compassion that gives their faith such dignity and power in the eyes of Muslims and non-Muslims alike. It is a time for renewing our spirituality and for recognizing our common humanity. It is a time to remember all that we have done and all that we have yet to do to make this world worthy of its Creator.
As the crescent moon rises, and the ninth month begins, Hillary joins me in extending best wishes to you and your families for health, prosperity, and happiness. May our prayers for a better world soon be answered.
BILL CLINTON
