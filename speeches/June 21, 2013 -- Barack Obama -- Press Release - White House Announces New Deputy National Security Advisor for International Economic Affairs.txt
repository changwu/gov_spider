    Today, President Obama announced the appointment of Caroline Atkinson to be Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics, replacing Michael Froman, who was recently sworn in as United States Trade Representative. Atkinson has served as Special Assistant to the President for International Economic Affairs since August 2011. 
For the last two years, Atkinson has played a central role in the Administration's response to the European financial crisis, supported work in the G-8 and G-20 and led the interagency efforts on the economic response to the Arab Spring. In her new role, Atkinson will be the President's personal representative to major international economic summits, including the G-8 and the G-20. She will serve as the President's senior international economic advisor, coordinating the policy-making process and driving the execution of policy on international economic affairs, including financial, trade and investment, development, energy and environmental issues.
"Caroline is respected around the world for her understanding of how the global economy works, her tireless efforts to promote strong, balanced and sustainable growth and her experience in managing international financial crises," said President Obama. 
Prior to joining the Obama Administration, Atkinson was a senior executive in the International Monetary Fund. She has previously served in the United States Department of the Treasury as Senior Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Monetary and Financial Policy from 1997-2001, as a Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, as a Senior Director at Stonebridge International and as a Head of Division on Regulatory Policy at the Bank of England. Atkinson began her career as a journalist for the Washington Post, the Economist, and the Times of London.
Atkinson was born in Washington, D.C. She received her undergraduate degree from Oxford University.
