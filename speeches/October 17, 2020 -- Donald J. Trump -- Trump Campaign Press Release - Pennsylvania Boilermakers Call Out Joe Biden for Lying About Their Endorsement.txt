    Joe Biden blatantly lied to the people of Pennsylvania when he claimed that the boilermakers union had endorsed him when, in fact, Pennsylvania's Boilermakers Local 154 overwhelmingly endorsed President Trump last month. President Trump reversed the anti-energy policies of the Obama-Biden Administration and, while Joe Biden promises to crush energy workers under his version of the Green New Deal, President Trump stands in defense of this vital American industry. As former Representative Lou Barletta (PA-11) and John Hughes, Boilermakers Local 154 Business Manager, explained on a Trump Campaign press call, Joe Biden's lies cannot hide his decades-long assault on blue-collar Americans' livelihoods.
"I couldn't believe it when Joe Biden blatantly lied at a town hall right here in Pennsylvania and said he was overwhelmingly endorsed by the boilermakers. As a matter of fact, Boilermakers Local 154 endorsed President Donald Trump last month. And I knew this first-hand because I worked with John Hughes, the business manager, and Local 154 on that endorsement.," said Former Representative Lou Barletta (PA-11).
"The other day I'm watching the debate and I see Joe Biden tell everybody that the Boilermakers endorsed him and that is not true, and I would like somebody to tell me who - he said he talked to somebody - I'd like to know who he talked to in the Boilermakers because anybody I talk to did not endorse him. And I believe if you go onto our International website we have not endorsed a candidate this round, nor did the International Boilermakers endorse a candidate last time. We did not endorse Obama and Joe Biden last time because of their energy issues," said John Hughes, Boilermakers Local 154 Business Manager.
