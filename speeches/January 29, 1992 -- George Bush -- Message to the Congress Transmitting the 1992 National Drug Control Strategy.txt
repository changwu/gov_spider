    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit today for the consideration of the Congress and the American people the 1992 National Drug Control Strategy, in accordance with section 1005 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Public Law 100 - 690; 21 U.S.C. 1504).
This is the Fourth National Drug Control Strategy, and it lays out a comprehensive plan for Federal drug control activities for Fiscal Year 1993 and beyond. The principal goal remains unchanged from the previous three strategies: to reduce the level of illegal drug use in America.
We are fighting a two-front war against drugs. The first front is against casual drug use, and I am pleased to report that significant progress is being made here, particularly among our Nation's youth. Casual drug use is still too high, however, and this Strategy rightly continues to stress efforts to reduce it. The second front, against hard-core drug use, poses a more difficult challenge. Progress here is slower. There are still too many neighborhoods, families, and individuals who suffer the consequences of drug use and drug-related crime. To address this problem, the Strategy proposes a variety of carefully targeted and intensified efforts. I urge the Congress to expedite their enactment.
The war on drugs is vital to our country's economy, international competitiveness, and security. Previous Strategies have enjoyed bipartisan political and funding support in the Congress. I ask for your continued support in this critical endeavor.
George Bush
The White House,
January 29, 1992.
