    President Bush will welcome Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili to the White House on February 25, 2004. This visit will provide an opportunity to deepen our partnership with Georgia on the fight against terrorism, resolving regional conflicts, Caspian energy, and Georgia's democratic and market economic reforms. The Presidents will also explore ways to deepen cooperation with Russia, Turkey, and our other European allies in pursuit of freedom, prosperity, and peace throughout the south Caucasus.
