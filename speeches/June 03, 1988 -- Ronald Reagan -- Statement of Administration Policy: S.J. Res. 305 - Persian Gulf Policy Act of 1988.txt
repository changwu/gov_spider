    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Adams (D) Washington)
The President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto S.J. Res. 305 if it is presented to him.
This Administration, like every previous Administration, believes that the War Powers Resolution constitutes an unconstitutional infringement on the President's authorities, specifically including his authority as Commander in Chief.
In addition, creating a deadline by which United States Armed Forces would have to cease convoying or escorting certain vessels, including vessels covered by the current program, would (1) encourage attacks on international shipping as soon as the United States withdraws; (2) reinforce claims that the United States is unreliable; and (3) undermine the positive contribution that the program has made to United States interests in the Gulf and worldwide.
