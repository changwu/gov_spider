    Gray Named as National Campaign Co-Chair
ARLINGTON, VA - The Clinton Campaign today announced the key endorsement of Rev. William H. Gray III, former Pennsylvania Congressman and former head of the United Negro College Fund (UNCF).
Gray represented Pennsylvania's 2nd District (Philadelphia) in the U. S. House of Representatives for 13 years, rising through the ranks to become the first African American to chair both the powerful House Budget Committee and the Democratic Caucus, and the first to serve as House Majority Whip.
In 1991, he resigned his seat in Congress to become the president and chief executive officer of the UNCF. During his 13 year tenure Gray raised over $1 billion for Historically Black Colleges and Universities to help students of color gain a college education.
"There is no other candidate with the experience of Senator Clinton and I believe she has the strength, wisdom, and compassion to be our nation's President," said Gray. "In January 2009, she will provide the change needed to restore the reputation and diplomacy of the United States around the world."
Also an ordained minister, Gray was the pastor of Bright Hope Baptist Church in Philadelphia for 35 years, where his father and grandfather served before him. In 1994, Gray also served as a special adviser for Haitian Affairs under the Clinton Administration. He is currently chairman of the Amani Group, a business and education advisory group.
"I have known Rev. Gray for many years and am honored to have his endorsement," said Hillary Clinton. "His leadership and support will be a valuable asset to my campaign."
