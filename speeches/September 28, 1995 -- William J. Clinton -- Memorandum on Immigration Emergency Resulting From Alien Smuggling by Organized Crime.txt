    Presidential Determination No. 95-49
Memorandum for the Attorney General
Recognizing that the smuggling of illegal aliens by international organized crime syndicates creates extraordinary concerns for United States law enforcement and immigration authorities, the Congress in 1994 appropriated $6,000,000 to the Immigration Emergency Fund to cover costs associated with repatriation of smuggled aliens.
As determined by the Congress, the repatriation of foreign nationals intercepted en route to the United States is an activity that is appropriate for reimbursement from the Immigration Emergency Fund.
Accordingly, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 404(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1101 note), I hereby:
Determine that an immigration emergency has been in existence and continues to exist with respect to the smuggling into the United States of illegal aliens by international organized crime syndicates; and
Direct that up to $6,000,000 appropriated by the Congress to the Immigration Emergency Fund be used to cover costs associated with repatriation of foreign nationals intercepted en route to the United States when it appears that such persons are being smuggled by international organized crime syndicates and to reimburse the State Department and international organizations for past and future costs incurred in association with this purpose.
You are authorized and directed to inform the appropriate committees of the Congress of this determination and the obligation of funds under this authority and to publish it in the Federal Register.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
THE WHITE HOUSE,
Washington, September 28, 1995.
