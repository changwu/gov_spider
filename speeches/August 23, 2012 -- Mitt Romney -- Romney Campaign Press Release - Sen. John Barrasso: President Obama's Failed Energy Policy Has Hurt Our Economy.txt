    Wyoming Senator John Barrasso made the following statement on Mitt Romney's vision for America as an energy superpower:
"Ever since he took office, President Obama has denied Americans the opportunity to use their energy resources to create affordable energy, enhanced energy security, millions of jobs, and billions in economic prosperity.He's blocked new oil and natural gas development, waged a regulatory War on Coal, rejected the Keystone XL pipeline, and wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on Solyndra and other 'green' energy boondoggles. The President's poor leadership on energy policy is another reason why we have high unemployment and high gas prices.
"GovernorÂ Romney understands we must employ a true 'all of the above' energy strategy that includes oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear, hydropower, wind and solar. The comprehensive energy plan he outlined today is the best way to grow our economy and put Americans back to work."
