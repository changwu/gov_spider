    Theodore White was truly an American institution. More than just another reporter on the campaign trail, Teddy was a familiar part of the American political fabric, observing and explaining the very essence of our democracy. In books which have become works of historical importance, Teddy White taught us much of ourselves and our country. Somehow, a Presidential campaign was not really over until Teddy's book was written.
He was a true professional, tough and insightful, but always fair. He respected and understood the Presidency and took us behind the scenes with a special wisdom and sensitivity. Nancy and I will miss Teddy White and extend our deepest sympathy to his family.
