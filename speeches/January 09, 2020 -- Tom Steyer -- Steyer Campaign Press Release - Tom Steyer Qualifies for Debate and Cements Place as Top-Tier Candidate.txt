    Steyer surges to second place in South Carolina and third in Nevada
(SAN FRANCISCO, CA, January 9, 2020) â€” Today, presidential candidate Tom Steyer cemented himself into the top tier of candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, officially qualifying for the Democratic National Committee debate in January.
Steyer secured qualification following polling showing Tom at 15% and 12% in South Carolina and Nevada, respectively. He is in second place in South Carolina and third place in Nevada. Last week, Steyer surpassed the DNC's 225,000 unique donor threshold requirement for debate qualification.
"Voters are tired of business as usual and are responding to Tom's fight to create real economic prosperity, tackle the climate crisis, and get Washington working for American families, not big corporations," Campaign Manager Heather Hargreaves said. "We experience this momentum on the ground every day in the early states, and look forward to connecting with more Americans and growing this campaign in the weeks and months ahead. We are built to win, and have the candidate best prepared to take Donald Trump on over the economy and expose him."
Conducted by Fox News between January 5 and 8, the most recent polls show Steyer surging to second place in South Carolina and tied for third place in Nevada. These results mark a decisive continuation of upward momentum for Steyer, following the most recent Morning Consult early state tracker which showed Steyer polling at 10%.
Steyer is the sixth candidate to qualify for the December debate. The DNC January debate will take place on January 14th in Des Moines, Iowa.
