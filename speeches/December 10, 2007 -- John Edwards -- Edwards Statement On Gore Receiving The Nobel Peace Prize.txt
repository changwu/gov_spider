    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Today, Senator John Edwards released the following statement:
"Today's award by the Nobel Committee recognizes three decades of Vice President Gore's prescient and compelling advocacy for the future of the Earth. His passionate voice and calls for change have echoed throughout America and the world and sparked a true movement to save our plant from global warming. Now, more than ever, we must be stand united as one nation and meet the moral test of generation that compels us to leave a better America and a better world to our children and all future generations."
