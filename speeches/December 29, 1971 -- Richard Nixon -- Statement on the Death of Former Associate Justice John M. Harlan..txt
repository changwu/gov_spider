    JUSTICE Harlan was one of the 20th century's giants on the Supreme Court of the United States--a man whose lucid intellect and consistently clear reasoning won him the highest respect of his judicial colleagues, of the legal profession at large, and of the Nation he served with such selfless dedication.
His contribution was enormous, and he will be deeply mourned and enormously missed.
Mrs. Nixon and I join the Nation in expressing our sympathy to the family of this splendid American.
