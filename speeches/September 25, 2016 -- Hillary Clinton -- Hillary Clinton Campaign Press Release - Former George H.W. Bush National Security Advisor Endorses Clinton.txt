    Statement by Donald P Gregg, National Security Advisor to Vice President George H.W. Bush. The endorsement comes after 115 former Ambassadors – including 80 appointed by Republican Presidents – backed Clinton earlier this week andmore than 50 national security officials urged Trump to disclose his financial conflicts of interests.
"I was in the Reagan administration for 8 years. I was Vice President George H.W. Bush's National Security Advisor for over six years. I traveled with him to over 65 countries.
"In my view the two great diplomatic overtures since World War II were carried out by Republicans – Nixon to China and President George H. W. Bush's outreach to Gorbachev and the Soviet Union after the collapse of the Berlin Wall.
"But we now have a person at the top of Republican ticket who I believe is dangerous, doesn't understand the complex world we live in, doesn't care to, and is without any moral or international philosophy.
"I've met Hillary Clinton a number of times and followed her career in public service. I'm impressed with her knowledge and experience. She would make an extremely good President."
