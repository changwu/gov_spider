Boston, MA â€“ Today, veteran Republican State Delegate Don Elliott has endorsed Governor Mitt Romney for President. Elliott, who represents parts of Carroll and Frederick Counties, has served in the House of Delegates since his election in 1986. In addition, Delegate Elliott's Chief of Staff, David Bauer, who is a member of the Baltimore County Republican Central Committee, has also endorsed Governor Romney.
"Delegate Elliott understands the need for a government that embodies a conservative vision to strengthen our nation's economy, national defense and families. He has faithfully served his constituents and embodies the leadership we need in Annapolis and state houses across the country," said Governor Romney. "I look forward to working with him to share my optimistic vision for the future of our country."
