    "And so, Mr. President, you're not doing the job to help us finally get gasoline prices down. That's what I am hearing. Let me tell you, my policy is just the opposite. Open up our energy resources. Start drilling and pumping out that oil — and that natural gas, by the way — so we can be energy secure." — Mitt Romney

Mitt Romney On Getting Our Energy Prices Down:
MITT ROMNEY: "The next issue I hear a great deal about is the price of gasoline. It's gone up. You're down here in the Gulf and it's not as high right here as perhaps in some other parts of the country but there are a lot of folks who I talk to that say, 'Gosh, I am just wondering can I even get back and forth to work and still make enough money to buy groceries for the week.' People are having a very hard time with these gasoline prices and the President says 'Oh, this is beyond my control.' It's like, 'But wait a second. Mr. President, you held off drilling in the Gulf. You wouldn't let us drill in ANWR. You won't let us drill in the Outer Continental Shelf in certain places. You held off the drilling in North Dakota and Oklahoma and Texas to a degree and you've done everything to keep us from getting that oil from Canada, the Keystone pipeline. And so, Mr. President, you're not doing the job to help us finally get gasoline prices down. That's what I am hearing. Let me tell you, my policy is just the opposite. Open up our energy resources. Start drilling and pumping out that oil — and that natural gas, by the way — so we can be energy secure."
