    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 6/6/91)(House Rules)(McCurdy (D) Oklahoma)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 2038, as reported by the House Select Committee on Intelligence, but will seek to restore the requested authorization levels for some programs during further congressional consideration of the bill.
The Administration also notes the discussion concerning the restructuring of certain intelligence activities contained in the Classified Annex to H.R. 2038, as reflected in the Schedule of Authorizations.' The Administration believes that the restructuring proposed in the Annex should not be mandated.
Further, certain stipulations contained in the Classified Annex are cause for concern with respect to Presidential prerogatives in the collection of foreign intelligence. The Administration will seek to resolve these concerns as congressional action on H.R. 2038 proceeds.
