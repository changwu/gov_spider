    "Yesterday's dismal jobs report was further evidence that middle-class families aren't better off in the Obama economy. After nearly four years in office, President Obama's economic policies have produced the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression, with fewer jobs, labor force participation at thirty-year lows, and unemployment stuck above 8% for 43 straight months. Mitt Romney's plan for a stronger middle class will create 12 million new jobs and deliver the new leadership and strong economy Americans deserve." – Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
