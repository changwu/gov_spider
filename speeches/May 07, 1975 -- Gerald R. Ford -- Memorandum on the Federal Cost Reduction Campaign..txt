Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
Success in the critical fight against recession and inflation requires the commitment and cooperation of each of us in this country. The 4.6 million Federal civilian and military personnel can play a major role in this effort by using their creative talents and skills to provide vitally needed Government services and programs as economically as possible.
During the past fiscal year, more than 197,000 civilian and military personnel in Government were recognized under the Federal government awards programs and awarded over $22 million for saving $268 million through their constructive ideas and other achievements beyond job requirements. To emphasize the need for cost saving suggestions and improved productivity, a special cost reduction campaign will be conducted during the remainder of Calendar Year 1975. During the campaign, I ask that you bring to my attention the contributions of civilian and military personnel which result in first year measurable benefits of $5,000 or more so that I may extend my congratulations to them by personal letter.
I urge that existing agency communications media be used to convey the attached message to members of your organization and that each of you find special ways to encourage and recognize those whose efforts result in significant cost savings. By enlisting the full support and creative talents of the Federal work force, I am confident that we can achieve needed economies within the Government.
