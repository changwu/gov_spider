    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate, the Treaty of Friendship between the United States of America and Tuvalu. The report of the Department of State is enclosed for the information of the Senate.
The Treaty meets the practical interests of both countries. It will satisfy the desire of the Tuvaluan people that their claim to sovereignty over half of the inhabited islands in their country, including their capital, will not be encumbered by a conflicting claim by the United States. It will protect United States interest in assuring nondiscriminatory future access to the fishing grounds of Tuvalu which supply fish to the canneries on American Samoa. United States security interests in a peaceful, secure, and stable South Pacific are served by the consultation clauses in times of international crisis.
The Treaty will further United States foreign policy interest in promoting peace, security and development of the region and assure nondiscriminatory access to the region by the United States fishing fleet and other vessels contributing to the American Samoan economy. I recommend that the Senate give early consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
