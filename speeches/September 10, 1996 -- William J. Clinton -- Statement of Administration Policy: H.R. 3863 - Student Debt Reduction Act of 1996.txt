(House)(Goodling (R) PA and 30 cosponsors)
The amendments made during full Committee markup improve H.R. 3863 and, therefore, the Administration supports House passage of the bill. However, the Administration would prefer a reduction in loan fees for all student loan borrowers, not just those students selected by banks to receive this benefit. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to expand this benefit to more student borrowers, including those borrowing under the Direct Loan Program.
