    Today I have signed into law H.J. Res. 402, which approves the location of a memorial to George Mason in the District of Columbia and its environs. Pursuant to the Commemorative Works Act, 40 U.S.C. 1001, et seq., the Congress authorized the establishment of this memorial in 1990 (Public Law 101 - 358, 104 Stat. 419, August 10, 1990). On October 10, 1991, and again on April 22, 1992, the Secretary of the Interior notified the Congress of his determination that the memorial should be located in Area I, the central monumental core of the District of Columbia. It is my understanding that, upon enactment of this joint resolution, a memorial to George Mason may be established in Area I without further legislation.
