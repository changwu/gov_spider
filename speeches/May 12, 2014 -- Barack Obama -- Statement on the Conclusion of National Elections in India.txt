    I congratulate the people of India on concluding their national elections today. India has set an example for the world in holding the largest democratic election in history, a vibrant demonstration of our shared values of diversity and freedom.
The United States and India have developed a strong friendship and comprehensive partnership over the last two decades, which has made our citizens safer and more prosperous and which has enhanced our ability to work together to solve global challenges. We look forward to the formation of a new Government once election results are announced and to working closely with India's next administration to make the coming years equally transformative.
