    Dear Mr. Chairman:
I appreciate your report on the recent Conference of Federal Executive Board Chairmen and Washington officials. From your comments I judge the Conference to be two days well spent in exploring ways to cut costs and in paving the way for the effective implementation of new programs.
I am gratified that the briefings by key Administration officials gave the participants deeper insights into the dimensions of the programs enacted by Congress in the fight against poverty, against discrimination, and against inadequate education. The opportunity for interagency cooperation and coordination was never greater--or more necessary.
There can be no letup in our War on Waste. The Federal executive must set the pace for the employees and supervisors in his organization. Not only must each manager search out new ways to improve operations, but managers must coordinate their efforts to eliminate duplication and provide greater efficiency.
These are matters of national urgency and of the highest priority. From past experience, and the note of high resolve on which the meeting ended, I look to the Federal Executive Boards for their full support in facilitating the implementation of new programs and for significant contributions for greater economy.
Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Honorable John W. Macy, Jr., Chairman, Civil Service Commission, Washington, D.C.]
