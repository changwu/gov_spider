    (SAN FRANCISCO, October 9, 2019) â€” Today candidate for the Democratic nomination for president Tom Steyer released this statement following Turkey's invasion of Syrian territory held by Kurdish troops:
"Once again, Donald Trump's ineptness and ignorance of world affairs have put the lives of thousands of people at risk. The Kurds have not only been loyal allies in the fight against ISIS, but they have put their own lives at risk to protect our troops in Syria and in neighboring provinces. They have played a crucial role in maintaining critical support in the region. Leaving the Kurds alone at this time is an act of cowardice and it will allow ISIS to return to the region."
