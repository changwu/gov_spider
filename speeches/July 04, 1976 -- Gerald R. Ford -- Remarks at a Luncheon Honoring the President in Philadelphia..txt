    Mayor Rizzo, reverend clergy, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:
First, Mr. Mayor, may I express my deepest gratitude and appreciation for the very thoughtful gift from you and the people of Philadelphia. And may I express from the bottom of my heart my gratitude for the opportunity for me to participate in the Fourth of July ceremonies on this occasion on our 200th birthday in the city of Philadelphia.
It made me, as an American, proud to see what was discussed there. The people who participated in the tremendous outburst of feeling among the people of Philadelphia--you truly represent and epitomize the spirit of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution itself, and I congratulate you.
And may I thank all the people in Pennsylvania for the opportunity to have a part in the program at Valley Forge, where the spirit of sacrifice was so evident 200-plus years ago, and to participate in all of the things throughout America where the 215 million people, wonderful individuals who believe in freedom and liberty, will lay the foundation for our third century predicated on the gifts that we have received by the sacrifices and wisdom of those of the past 200 years.
We are all proud to be Americans and proud to turn on to future generations the blessings that we have had in the past.
Thank you very, very much.
