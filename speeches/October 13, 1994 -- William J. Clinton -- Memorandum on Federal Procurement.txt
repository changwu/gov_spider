    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, the President's Management Council
Subject: Continued Commitment to Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Small Women-Owned Businesses in Federal Procurement
It is the policy of the Federal Government that a fair proportion of its contracts be placed with small, small disadvantaged, and small women-owned businesses. Such businesses should also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in contracts awarded by the Federal Government consistent with efficient contract performance. I am committed to the continuation of this policy. Therefore, I ask that you encourage the use of various tools, including set-asides, price preferences, and section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)), as necessary to achieve this policy objective.
The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 authorizes civilian agencies to utilize set-aside procurements for small disadvantaged businesses. The Act also, for the first time, establishes goals for contracting with small women-owned businesses. These provisions, along with others in the Act, will provide greater access to Federal Government business opportunities for small, small disadvantaged, and small women-owned businesses. Department and agency heads should ensure that efforts to streamline acquisition procedures encourage the participation of these businesses in Federal procurements.
This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.
William J. Clinton
