    The United States remains steadfast in its support of the Ukrainian people as they defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity, advance the fight against corruption, implement democratic and constitutional reforms, strengthen the rule of law, restore economic stability and growth, and respond to humanitarian needs.
In pursuit of these objectives, Vice President Joe Biden announced today in Kyiv, Ukraine, that, pending consultation with Congress, the White House plans to commit approximately $190 million in new assistance to support Ukraine's ambitious reform agenda. This broad assistance package will help Ukraine:
•      Elevate the fight against corruption through law enforcement and justice sector reform;
•      Attract investment by streamlining regulations and transparently privatizing state-owned enterprises;
•      Promote economic growth through better trade capacity and access to capital for small- and medium-size enterprises;
•      Strengthen energy security by increasing efficiency, transparency, and resilience in the energy sector; and
•      Build a long-term democratic foundation through Constitutional and good-governance reforms in key sectors.
These funds also will support the critical role of civil society and independent media, as well as the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission as it monitors and verifies agreements in the conflict areas of eastern Ukraine.
With this announcement, the United States now has committed $2 billion in loan guarantees and nearly $760 million in security, programmatic, and technical assistance to Ukraine since the end of the Yanukovych regime in 2014. The proceeds of U.S. loan guarantees have helped Ukraine to stabilize its economy and protect the most vulnerable households from the impact of needed economic adjustments.
The Administration will continue to work with Congress and its international partners to support Ukraine as it defends its sovereignty, stabilizes its economy, and advances its reform agenda.
