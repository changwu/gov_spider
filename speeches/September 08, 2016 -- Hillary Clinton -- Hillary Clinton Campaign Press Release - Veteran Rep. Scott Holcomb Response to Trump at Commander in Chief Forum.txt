    In response to NBC's Commander in Chief Forum, Georgia Representative Scott Holcomb, an Army veteran who served six years on active duty and deployed overseas three times for the conflicts in Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq, said:
"The most damning evidence that Donald Trump is unfit to be Command-in-Chief are his own words. He mocks the sacrifices of parents who lost a child to war but can't identify any sacrifices he's ever made for our nation. He laments that he always wanted a Purple Heart butÂ lied about giving to veterans charities that support those who've sacrificed. He lacks the most basic understanding of foreign policy and thinks that he's smarter than our professional soldiers because he went to a military high school decades ago.
"Mr. Trump won't stand behind our troops and have their backs, Hillary will. She's ready, and I'm proud to join veterans across our state and nation who are supporting her."
