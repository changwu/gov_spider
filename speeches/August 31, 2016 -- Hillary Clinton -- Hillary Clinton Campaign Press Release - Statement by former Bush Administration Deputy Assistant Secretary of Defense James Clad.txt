    Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for President George W. Bush, James Clad, released the following statement endorsing Hillary Clinton today:
"Secretary Clinton has demonstrated her skills as Secretary of State, especially but by no means exclusively in helping other Asian countries counter Chinese bullying in the western Pacific.
"For Republicans and Democrats alike, everything in national security requires clarity and steadiness, whether managing nuclear weapons or balancing great power rivalries. Never losing sight of the national interest is key â€“ a discipline which Secretary Clinton possesses in full measure.
"Our adversaries must never hear flippancy or ignorance in America's voice. They should never take satisfaction from an incompetent president. Giving an incoherent amateur the keys to the White House this November will doom us to second or third class status.
"In my career, I've seen close-up what happens when American reliability falters. It's not pretty, for us or for the world. There is no choice: In razor sharp contrast to her opponent, Secretary Clinton is ready, steady and prepared. With a proven preference for bipartisanship, she must win this election."
