When Hillary Clinton was asked a range of questions on reproductive rights during Fusion's Iowa Brown & Black Presidential Forum, her answers showed why she's the best candidate to defend reproductive rights and build on the progress we've made.
On whether she supports efforts to repeal the Hyde Amendment, which makes it more difficult for low-income women to exercise their full reproductive rights:

"If state governments [or] politicians use their power to try to restrict that right, well-off people are still going to have it ... . But a lot of poorer women, rural women—isolated far from a place that they can get services—are going to be denied." 
On Republican efforts to limit abortion access in Texas:

"The Texas government has forced the closing of Planned Parenthood clinics on totally inaccurate medical requirements, and this is a huge state—and it's going to be much more difficult for poor women to access that right."
