  A Proclamation

The American Merchant Marine is the lifeline that links America with its overseas trading partners. In times of peace, it builds our economy; in times of national emergency, it provides logistic support to our armed forces.
In recognition of the importance of the American Merchant Marine, the Congress, by joint resolution of May 20, 1933 (48 Stat. 73; 36 U.S.C. 145), designated May 22 of each year as National Maritime Day in commemoration of the departure from Savannah, Georgia, on that date in 1819 of the SS Savannah on the first transatlantic voyage by any steamship, and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its appropriate observance.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States to honor our American Merchant Marine on May 22, 1978, by displaying the flag of the United States at their homes and other suitable places, and I request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second.

JIMMY CARTER
