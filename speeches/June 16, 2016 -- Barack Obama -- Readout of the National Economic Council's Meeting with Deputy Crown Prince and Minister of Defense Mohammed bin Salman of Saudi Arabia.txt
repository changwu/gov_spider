    Director of the National Economic Council Jeff Zients hosted a meeting of the National Economic Council—including Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman, and Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Jason Furman—with His Royal Highness Deputy Crown Prince and Minister of Defense Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia and his delegation this afternoon at the White House. U.S. officials welcomed Saudi Arabia's commitment to economic reform and underscored the United States' desire to be a key partner in helping Saudi Arabia implement its ambitious economic reform program. Both sides agreed on the importance of economic diversification, expanding private sector employment opportunities, renewable and natural gas development, and the beneficial role U.S. companies could play in implementing Saudi reform objectives. The United States and Saudi Arabia intend to build on these conversations in the coming months, consistent with the strong partnership between our countries and the mutual benefit in further deepening our economic ties.
