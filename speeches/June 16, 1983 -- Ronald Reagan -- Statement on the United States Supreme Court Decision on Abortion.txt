    Our society is confronted with a great moral issueâ€”the taking of the life of an unborn child. Accordingly, I join millions of Americans expressing profound disappointment at the decisions announced by the Supreme Court in striking down several efforts by States and localities to control the circumstances under which abortion may be performed.
As Justice O'Connor emphasized in her dissenting opinion joined by Justices White and Rehnquist, the legislature is the appropriate forum for resolving these issues. The issue of abortion must be resolved by our democratic process. Once again I call on the Congress to make its voice heard against abortion on demand and to restore legal protections for the unborn whether by statute or constitutional amendment.
