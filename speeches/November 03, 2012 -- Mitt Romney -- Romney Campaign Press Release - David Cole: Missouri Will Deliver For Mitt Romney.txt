    Boston, MA â€” David Cole, Chairman of the Missouri Republican Party, made the following statement on Mitt Romney's plan for real change:
"In 2008, Missouri was the only battleground state to vote against Barack Obama, and over the past four years, more and more Missourians have grown tired of his liberal agenda and his failure to deliver on his promises to reduce the deficit and create jobs. We have seen a groundswell of support for the Romney-Ryan ticket and on Tuesday, we expect that Missourians will go to the polls and by a huge margin, deliver our 10 electoral votes for Mitt Romney."
