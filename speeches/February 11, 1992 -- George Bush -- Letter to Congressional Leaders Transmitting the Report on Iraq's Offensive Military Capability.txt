    Dear Mr. Chairman:
Under cover of this letter I am transmitting to the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs the report on Iraq's Offensive Military Capability required by section 586J(b) of the Foreign Operations Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1991 (Public Law 101 - 513).
This interim assessment of Iraq's offensive military capability and its effect on the Middle East balance of power includes an assessment of Iraq's power projection capability, the prospects for another sustained conflict with Iran, joint Iraqi-Jordanian cooperation, the threat Iraq's arms transfer activities pose to U.S. allies in the Middle East, and the potential extension of Iraq's political-military influence into Africa and Latin America.
The report unfortunately cannot be produced in an unclassified form. I recommend to your attention, however, the January 22, 1992, testimony on Iraqi unconventional weapons capabilities by Robert Gates before the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Sincerely,
George Bush
