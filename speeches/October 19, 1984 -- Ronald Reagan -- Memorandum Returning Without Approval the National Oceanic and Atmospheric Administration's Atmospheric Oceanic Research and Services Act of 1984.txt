    I have withheld my approval from S. 1097, the "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atmospheric and Oceanic Research and Services Act of 1984." S. 1097 would, among other things, authorize appropriations for various National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) programs for fiscal year 1985, for which appropriations have already been enacted.
S. 1097 also contains, however, a number of undesirable provisions that would unduly effect the ability of the Department of Commerce to manage its programs responsibly and effectively. The provisions in title VI concerning the closings and consolidations of National Weather Service offices are particularly onerous and would have the effect of virtually precluding the consolidation or closing of such offices, even when such closings or consolidations are fully justified.
In addition, S. 1097 contains other highly objectionable provisions concerning the Department's activities. Section 205 of S. 1097 would result in excessive and unjustifiable delays in Department contracting-out activities, even when such contracting would be in the clear interest of the Nation's taxpayers. And, Section 202(b), which concerns the weather satellite program, is objectionable because it would lessen the Secretary of Commerce's discretion in managing that program, as well as require the inefficient use of a government asset.
This Act represents an unwarranted intrusion by Congress into matters normally and properly within the management discretion of the Executive branch. In the interest of efficient and economical conduct of government activities, therefore, I am constrained to withhold my approval of S. 1097.
