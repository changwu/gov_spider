    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
I have again proclaimed March as Red Cross Month to remind all Americans of the myriad services the American Red Cross provides each day in communities across the nation.
During the past year, as disaster after disaster disrupted lives and brought destruction to widespread areas of the nation, Red Cross volunteers helped ease the suffering of their neighbors. The Red Cross Blood Program expanded last year to play an even more important role in our daily lives by providing life-saying and life-sustaining blood and blood products to more and more ill and injured Americans. Through Red Cross nursing, first aid, water and boating safety instruction, we have the opportunity to train ourselves to care for the infirm.
Finally, our men and women in the Armed Forces, veterans and their families look to the Red Cross for help in coping with their emergency problems.
The Red Cross is a vital part of America. I urge all civilian employees of the Federal Government and members of the Armed Forces to support this essential effort through voluntary services, donation of blood and financial support in their home communities.
