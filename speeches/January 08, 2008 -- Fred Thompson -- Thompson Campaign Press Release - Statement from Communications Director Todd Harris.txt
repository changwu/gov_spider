    McLean, VA - Thompson Campaign Communications Director Todd Harris released the following statement on tonight's New Hampshire Primary results: "Tonight's results, with no clear frontrunner, prove the GOP nomination is wide open. The next battlefield is South Carolina, where voters are far more conservative than in New Hampshire and deeply concerned about illegal immigration in America. Fred Thompson is uniquely positioned for victory in the Southern states. He is the only true conservative with a plan to end illegal immigration and protect our sovereignty."
