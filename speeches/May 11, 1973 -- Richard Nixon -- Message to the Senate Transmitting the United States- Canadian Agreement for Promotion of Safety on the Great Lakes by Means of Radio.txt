    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Agreement Between the United States of America and Canada for Promotion of Safety on the Great Lakes by Means of Radio, 1973, signed at Ottawa on February 26, 1973. I also transmit for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Agreement.
This Agreement will, upon entry into force, terminate the 1952 Agreement for the Promotion of Safety on the Great Lakes by Means of Radio between the United States and Canada and constitutes a significant modernization thereof.
This new Agreement will make a valuable contribution to the protection of lives and property on the Great Lakes. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Agreement and give its advice and consent to ratification.
