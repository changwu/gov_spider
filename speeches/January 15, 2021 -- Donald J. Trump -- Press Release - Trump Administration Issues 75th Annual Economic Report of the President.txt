    Council of Economic Advisers
Today, the President's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) released its 75th annual Economic Report of the President, codifying the leadership of President Trump and encapsulating the historic efforts the United States made during the COVID-19 pandemic. The report details the steadfast commitment to put America First, promote a strong middle class, and oversee two economic recoveries that have vastly exceeded expectations. The pillars of this movement—fair and reciprocal trade, tax reform, and extensive deregulation—have provided a framework for enduring American prosperity, and now exist as proof that the pro-growth policies of this Administration and the decisive response to the pandemic ameliorated the potential for severe and prolonged economic hardship.
"Since taking office, rather than apologize for America, I have stood up for America. From day one of my Presidency, I have put America First, and I have fought for the American worker harder than anyone ever has."–President Donald J. Trump
