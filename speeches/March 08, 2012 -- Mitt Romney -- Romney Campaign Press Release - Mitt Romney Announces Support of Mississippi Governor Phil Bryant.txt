    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant.
"It is an honor to have the support of Governor Bryant — he has been a great public servant for the State of Mississippi," said Mitt Romney. "His support will be needed to help defeat President Obama in November, repeal Obamacare, and restore fiscal sanity in Washington. I look forward to discussing my pro-growth plan to fix our economy as I campaign in Mississippi."
"Our country must have a Republican nominee who can defeat President Barack Obama and turn America around to get back on the right track," Gov. Bryant said. "I am encouraged and supportive of Gov. Romney's conservative policies on key issues like more American energy development, cracking down on illegal immigration, and putting in place job creation policies that will jumpstart our economy.  As a former Governor, he understands how to make tough choices as a chief executive.  That is why Deborah and I are pleased to support him in pursuit of winning our Party's nomination and becoming our next President of the United States."
