    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
Revised(Senate)(Senator Nunn (D) Georgia)
The President's senior advisors will recommend a veto of S. 1174 if the bill contains a limitation on the testing and development of space-based and other mobile-ABM systems that would legislate the so-called "strict" interpretation of the ABM Treaty.
The restrictive ABM provision undermines Presidential authority and weakens U.S. arms control negotiating leverage at a particularly sensitive time. Further, the restrictive interpretation is not supported by the negotiating record associated with the ABM Treaty, and it is contrary to U.S. national security interests.
The Administration also opposes passage of S. 1174 because it reduces authorizations for certain key national defense programs below the Administration's request.
The Administration will seek to have certain provisions of the bill modified to conform more closely to the original request.
