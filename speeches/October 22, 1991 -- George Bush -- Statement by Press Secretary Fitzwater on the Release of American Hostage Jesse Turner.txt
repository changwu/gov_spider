    We rejoice with Mr. Jesse Turner and his family at his release after so many years in unjust captivity. We pray that he is in good health and will soon be reunited with his family. Our special State Department reception team left the U.S. at midday for Wiesbaden, Germany, to provide any assistance possible. We cannot forget that others remain hostage. We call again for the safe, immediate, and unconditional release of all those in the region who are held hostage outside the process of law. We also seek a full accounting of those who have died in captivity, including return of their remains.
We appreciate the efforts of all those who helped make this release possible and welcome the humanitarian efforts of the U.N. Secretary-General. Mr. Turner had been in captivity for nearly 5 years. Four other American hostages remain.
