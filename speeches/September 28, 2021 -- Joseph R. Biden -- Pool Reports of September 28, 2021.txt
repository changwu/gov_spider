Pool report 6 - Chicago trip postponed
Good evening,
President Biden's trip to Chicago will no longer be taking place tomorrow.
The White House has sent an update on the president's conversations with lawmakers.
From White House official:
In meetings and calls over the weekend and through today, President Biden has been engaging with members of Congress on the path forward for the Build Back Better Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal. He will now remain at the White House tomorrow to continue working on advancing these two pieces of legislation to create jobs, grow the economy, and make investments in families, rather than failed giveaways to the rich and big corporations.
There will be more to come on his engagement over the next couple of days, and the trip to Chicago to discuss the ongoing importance of getting people vaccinated will be rescheduled.
