    For on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins shall ye be clean before the LORD.
LEVITICUS 16:30
Yom Kippur is the Jewish Day of Atonement and the most holy day in the Jewish faith. From the time the Kol Nidre is recited until the Shofar is sounded, Jews around the world will draw nearer to God through acts of atonement, fasting, and prayer. Jewish tradition teaches that on Yom Kippur, God remembers every name, listens to every petition, and offers forgiveness to the repentant.
On this day, Americans are reminded of the great blessings of religious freedom and the unalienable rights bestowed upon all people by the Creator of life. May God grant us peace, comfort, and hope for all the challenges we may face in the year ahead.
Laura and I send our best wishes for a blessed day and a most meaningful fast.
GEORGE W. BUSH
