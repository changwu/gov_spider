    Bachmann: "I oppose any governor or president who mandates a family's healthcare choices"
Los Angeles, Calif. — Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann released a new web video today titled "No to Obamacare and Perrycare" in which she takes a stand against the abuse of executive power and crony capitalism. The video highlights her specific opposition to individual mandates in Obamacare and Governor Rick Perry's executive order for a mandate requiring 12-year-old girls to take the HPV vaccine.
"Whether it's Obamacare or Perrycare, I oppose any governor or president who mandates a family's healthcare choices," Bachmann states in the video. "Especially if the decision-making process occurs behind closed doors, bypassing legislative action, and favors campaign contributors over families."
The following is full text of the video:
"Hi, I'm Michele Bachmann. There are many important issues in this presidential campaign — including the role of government, abuse of executive power and crony capitalism. As a mother of three daughters, I believe that parents are the ones who should decide whether or not their young daughters should receive injections for sexually transmitted diseases. These are decisions that are best left to parents, the children and their doctors and should take into consideration the child's health and the family's values.
"Whether its Obamacare or Perrycare I oppose any governor or president who mandates a family's healthcare choices and violates the rights of parents on these issues — especially if the decision-making process occurs behind closed doors, bypassing legislative action, and favors campaign contributors over families. That's not right. As President, I'll do what's right for families."
