People working in the White House should receive the vaccine somewhat later in the program, unless specifically necessary. I have asked that this adjustment be made. I am not scheduled to take the vaccine, but look forward to doing so at the appropriate time. Thank you!Retweets: 23931Favorites: 180621

Oh no! What is going on? This is not good news, even for Indians. Cancel culture at work!  https://t.co/d1l0C9g6Pd Retweets: 17525Favorites: 99790

Democrats weakened the Signature Verification (and other) safeguards in Georgia. @staceyabrams played @BrianKempGA & Secretary of State, for fools. Consent Decree, which is terrible for Republicans (and honest people!), must be opened up NOW - David, Kelly, and I will then win!Retweets: 30002Favorites: 141144

What a fool Governor @BrianKempGA of Georgia is. Could have been so easy, but now we have to do it the hard way. Demand this clown call a Special Session and open up signature verification, NOW. Otherwise, could be a bad day for two GREAT Senators on January 5th.Retweets: 44464Favorites: 216765

Why did the Swing States stop counting in the middle of the night? @MariaBartiromo Because they waited to find out how many ballots they had to produce in order to steal the Rigged Election. They were so far behind that they needed time, & a fake water main break, to recover!Retweets: 62408Favorites: 269237

Just had a very nice meeting with Attorney General Bill Barr at the White House. Our relationship has been a very good one, he has done an outstanding job! As per letter, Bill will be leaving just before Christmas to spend the holidays with his family...Retweets: 40833Favorites: 229942
