    As President Trump continues to deliver on his record of Promises Made, Promises Kept, he today released the American Dream Plan for Hispanic Americans. The plan focuses on fulfilling the promises of America that bring so many people to our shores, including a thriving economy, educational opportunity, freedom, and community. While Joe Biden panders to Hispanic voters with the same false promises that Democrats have made for decades, President Trump is delivering on his commitment to uplift Americans of all backgrounds.
The President's plan includes promises to add 500,000 Hispanic-owned businesses, increase capital for minority entrepreneurs through Opportunity Zones, create 2 million new jobs for Hispanic Americans, increase access to home ownership, bolster school choice programs, and deliver a resolution to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program with a permanent solution that benefits both Americans and recent arrivals.
In a statement, 'Latinos for Trump' Advisory Board member Alfredo Ortiz celebrated the American Dream Plan:
"President Trump has done more for the Hispanic community in 47 months than Joe Biden has in 47 years, and the 'American Dream Plan' is just one more example of the President's record of Promises Made, Promises Kept. From the lowest Hispanic unemployment rate on record, to Opportunity Zones, to school choice, to the support of pro-life, pro-family values, President Trump clearly stands with the Hispanic community and our priorities. Now, faced with the prospect of a Joe Biden presidency controlled by the Democrats' socialist base, Hispanics are rushing to support President Trump and the Republican Party more than any time in recent history. President Trump's 'American Dream Plan' gives Hispanic Americans just one more reasons to vote for four more years of strong, America First leadership," said Alfredo Ortiz, 'Latinos for Trump' Advisory Board member.
