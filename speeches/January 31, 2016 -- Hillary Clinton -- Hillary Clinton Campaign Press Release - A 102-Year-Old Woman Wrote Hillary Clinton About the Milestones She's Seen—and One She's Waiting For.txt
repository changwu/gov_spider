Like a lot of her fellow Hawkeyes, Ruline Steininger is really looking forward to the Iowa caucus. But there's at least one thing that sets her apart.
She's 102 years old.

Ruline had the chance to meet Hillary when she came to hear her speak in Des Moines. She gave her a quick pep talkâ€”and told Hillary she's one of the most qualified candidates she's ever seen in her life.
Coming from Ruline, that's really saying something.
If you live in Iowa, don't miss your chance to be part of history. Join Ruline and people across the state who are caucusing on February 1.?
