    Shows Paul drawing President below 50 percent
LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” In a new Reuters/Ipsos survey, 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul polls within striking distance of President Obama among registered voters.
"Our campaign has been gaining momentum for some time now, and this is yet another poll that clearly proves how competitive we are versus the President" said Ron Paul 2012 Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton. "Dr. Paul is gaining ground in poll after poll, affirming that people are looking for real change instead of the status quo they are being offered from the establishment."
These results come just a few weeks after a Rasmussen poll showed him within a percent of President Obama in a head-to-head matchup.
Another recent Gallup survey, conducted August 17-18, shows Paul only 2 points behind Obama in a general election match-up. In a similar head to head survey from last year done by Rasmussen, Paul actually drew a statistical dead heat with the President. And earlier this year in a survey by CNN, he did the best out of the other Republicans put up against Obama in a head-to-head poll.
