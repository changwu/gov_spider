    I am today signing legislation that will enable the United States to provide $50 million in assistance to the unfortunate victims of the earthquakes that have devastated southern Italy.
This disaster—the worst natural catastrophe in Western Europe in half a century—has killed more than 3,000 people and left more than 200,000 homeless. Whole villages have been wiped off the map. We in the United States are deeply sympathetic to the Italian people and their government in this time of great sorrow and great need.
The funds provided by this legislation will, I hope, provide some measure of immediate relief to the stricken area and help a courageous people to overcome the effects of disaster.
I know my feelings are shared by all Americans—whose spontaneous contributions to private voluntary agencies are already aiding in the relief efforts in praying that the worst is now over and that the suffering of southern Italy will now give way to hope as the rebuilding process begins.
