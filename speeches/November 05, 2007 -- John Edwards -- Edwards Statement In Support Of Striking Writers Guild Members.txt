    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Today, Senator John Edwards released the following statement in support of the striking Writers Guild members:
"The striking Writers Guild members are fighting an important battle to protect their creative rights. These writers deserve to be compensated fairly for their work, and I commend their courage in standing up to big media conglomerates. As someone who has walked picket lines with workers all across America and as a strong believer in collective bargaining, I hope that both sides are able to quickly reach a just settlement."
