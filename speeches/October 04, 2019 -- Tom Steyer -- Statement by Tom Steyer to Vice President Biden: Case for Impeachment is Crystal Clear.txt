    (SAN FRANCISCO, October 4, 2019) â€” Today, presidential candidate for the Democratic nomination Tom Steyer released a statement following Vice President Biden's refusal to comment on whether he would move to convict Donald Trump if he were still in the U.S. Senate.
"I have a lot of respect for Joe Biden, but there is more than enough evidence of Trump's corruption, crimes, and abuses of power. The case for impeachment is crystal clear, and it is the duty of every elected official to uphold the Constitution. For the good of the country, it's time to remove this lawless president from office."
