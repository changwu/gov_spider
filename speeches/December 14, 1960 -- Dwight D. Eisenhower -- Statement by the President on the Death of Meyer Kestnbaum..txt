    I HAVE JUST HEARD the news of the sudden and tragic passing of Meyer Kestnbaum. As Special Assistant, Mr. Kestnbaum's wisdom and advice were of great value to me in his special fields of Federal-State relationships and in the implementation of the recommendations of the Hoover Commission. An outstanding businessman, he unhesitatingly entered government service and contributed his talents to the public good. Mrs. Eisenhower and I join with his many friends in extending our deep sympathy to his family.
