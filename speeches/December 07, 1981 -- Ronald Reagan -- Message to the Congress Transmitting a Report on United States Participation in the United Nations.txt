    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit herewith a report of the activities of the United States Government in the United Nations and its affiliated agencies, as required by the United Nations Participation Act (Public Law 264, 79th Congress). The report covers calendar year 1980, the last year of the previous Administration.
The United Nations remains an important institution for the foreign policy of the United States, and the United States will uphold the ideals upon which the United Nations was founded.
