    Today, Senior Advisor and White House Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator Mitch Landrieu and other senior administration officials, including Sarah Greenberger the Associate Deputy Secretary at the Department of Interior, discussed how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will build a better America by investing in the conservation of and access to our public lands. Landrieu outlined the President's commitment as part of the America the Beautiful Initiative to building partnerships with states, conservation groups, hunters, anglers, Tribes and others to conserve America's lands and waters for future generations.
President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes billions for ecosystem restoration and resilience of America's lands, invasive species detection and prevention, and native vegetation restoration efforts, on top of nearly $16 billion for cleaning up legacy pollution. On Friday, the Department of the Interior announced distribution of a record $1.5 billion in Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration (WSFR) Program allocations to state wildlife agencies throughout the nation. The WSFR was reauthorized as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Landrieu noted that these grants will make significant progress in our work to protect our cherished natural treasures, and together with other Bipartisan Infrastructure Law investments, will make significant progress in our work on collaborative conservation.??
From today's conversation: "The tremendous amount of ongoing, new, or improved collaboration between the federal government, states, local leaders, tribes, nonprofits, and everyone here today will make it possible to build back better. Conservation is something we can all agree on, and as the President has said repeatedly, there's so much common ground for those who seek to find it." â€“ Mitch Landrieu, Senior Advisor and White House Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator
