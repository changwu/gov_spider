    BURLINGTON, Vt., â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday appointed Arturo Carmona to be the Latino outreach director and Southwest political director in the senator's campaign for the Democratic Party presidential nomination.
Carmona comes to the key roles in Sanders' campaign team from serving as the executive director of Presente.org, a Latino advocacy organization based in Los Angeles. He brings a background in civil rights and community organizing along with management and government relations expertise.
"I am going to work hard to build a strong team that can connect Bernie's campaign with Latino families. As the son of an immigrant, his story resembles that of millions of Latinos in the U.S.," Carmona said. The Sanders campaign, he added, "represents a historic opportunity to address the most important issues impacting Latino families."
In addition to the critical issue of immigration reform, Carmona said Latinos and Sanders share concerns about the collapsing American middle class, income and wealth inequality, the need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour, a strong emphasis on family values, criminal justice reform, climate change and the corruption of the campaign finance system ushered in by the Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United.
"Latinos need to be part of the political revolution that Sen. Sanders is calling for," Carmona said.
