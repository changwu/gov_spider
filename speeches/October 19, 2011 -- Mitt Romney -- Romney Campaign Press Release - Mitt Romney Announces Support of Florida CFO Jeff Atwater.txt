    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Florida CFO Jeff Atwater.
"Jeff Atwater's work to reduce spending and regulatory burdens has been critical in the effort to bring Florida out of this economic downturn," said Mitt Romney. "His leadership in Florida is an example for the rest of the country. I look forward to working with him to bring these principles of lower spending and less regulation to Washington."
Announcing his support, Florida CFO Jeff Atwater said, "Florida voters are looking for a conservative leader who will restore fiscal responsibility to Washington. President Obama's regulations have imposed heavy burdens on small businesses. With millions of Americans unemployed, the uncertainty created by his economic policies is simply unacceptable. From his time working in business, Mitt Romney understands that our country can't continue spending more than we take in. As Governor of Massachusetts, he balanced the budget with a Democratic legislature and without raising taxes. He will offer the critical leadership our country needs in the White House. I am proud to support Mitt in his campaign."
