    SANTA FE, NM -- Today, New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson released the following statement on the tragic death of nine South Carolina firefighters:
"Firefighters are trained to make the ultimate sacrifice -- to walk into the worst danger and to risk their lives without hesitation. Last night, nine South Carolina firefighters ran into a burning building to protect the lives of their fellow citizens trapped inside. These firefighters taught us the true meaning of the words courage, honor, and duty."
"Let us forever remember these nine brave firefighters, who gave their lives for others. Let us, citizens of a grateful nation, allow our thoughts and prayers to rest today on these courageous citizens, these American heroes."
