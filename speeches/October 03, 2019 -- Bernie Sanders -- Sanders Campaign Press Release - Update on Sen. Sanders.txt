    LAS VEGAS â€“ Jane Sanders on Thursday released the following statement:
"Thank you to everyone who reached out yesterday with so many touching and kind messages wishing Bernie well. We are so moved by your support.
"Bernie is up and about. Yesterday, he spent much of the day talking with staff about policies, cracking jokes with the nurses and doctors, and speaking with his family on the phone. His doctors are pleased with his progress, and there has been no need for any additional procedures. We expect Bernie will be discharged and on a plane back to Burlington before the end of the weekend. He'll take a few days to rest, but he's ready to get back out there and is looking forward to the October debate."
