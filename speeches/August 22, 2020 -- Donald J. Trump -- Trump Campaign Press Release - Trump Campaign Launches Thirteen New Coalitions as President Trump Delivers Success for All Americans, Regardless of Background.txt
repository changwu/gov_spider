    Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. announced the launch of thirteen new campaign coalitions to promote President Trump's message of Promises Made, Promises Kept. The coalitions are 'Albanian Americans for Trump,' 'Assyrians for Trump,' 'Chaldeans for Trump,' 'Firefighters for Trump,' 'German Americans for Trump,' 'Gun Owners for Trump,' 'Italian Americans for Trump,' 'Medical Professionals for Trump,' 'Polish Americans for Trump,' 'Serbian Americans for Trump,' 'Truckers for Trump,' 'Trump Pride,' and 'Ukrainian Americans for Trump.' They will unite a diverse array of Americans around President Trump's re-election campaign and the fight against Joe Biden's socialist agenda.
"All across America, diverse groups are coming together to support President Trump and his promise of economic empowerment, personal liberty, and the American Dream," said Ashley Hayek, Trump 2020 Director of Coalitions. "While Joe Biden and the radical Democrats propose policies that would undermine everything that makes America great, President Trump is standing up for our country's core values."
