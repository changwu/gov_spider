    30-Second Television Spot, "True" To Air in the Lone Star State
The Clinton campaign today announced it is broadcasting a new television ad in Texas highlighting Senator Clinton's promise to defend our nation's security by fighting Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, commitment to bringing our troops home from Iraq, and readiness to be Commander-in-Chief.
As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Clinton worked to provide body armor to our troops fighting in Iraq and deliver health care benefits to our veterans. Senator Obama, as chairman of an oversight committee charged with the force of fighting Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, was too busy running for President to hold even one hearing.
The 30-second spot, entitled "True," comes the day before Texas voters head to the polls on March 4th.

Following is the script for the ad.
Hillary For President
"True"
TV : 30
Announcer: Barack Obama says he has the judgment to be president.
But as chairman of an oversight committee charged with the force of fighting Al Qaeda in Afghanistan - he was too busy running for president to hold even one hearing.
Barack Obama: "I became chairman of this committee, at the beginning of this campaign-at the beginning of 2007, so it is true that we haven't had oversight hearings on Afghanistan."
Announcer: Hillary Clinton will never be too busy to defend our national security-bringing our troops home from Iraq and pursing Al Qaeda in Afghanistan.
Hillary Clinton: "I'm Hillary Clinton and I approved this message."
