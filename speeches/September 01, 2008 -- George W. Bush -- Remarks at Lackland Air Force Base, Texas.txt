    The President. You know, one of the great things about our country is the number of people who volunteer during one of these incidents. Here are some Red Cross volunteers. They are—they symbolize the thousands that will help.
And my call to our fellow citizens is that—find out how you can help. You can help by volunteering. You can help by contributing to the Red Cross or the Salvation Army. Somebody is going to say, "Well, I don't know how to." Well, it's pretty easy. You can get on the web page. If you're interested in the Red Cross, just call up Red Cross on your—and they'll steer you to the way to help.
Anyway, America is a great country. It's great because we've got great people. Nobody is happy about these storms; everybody is praying for everybody's safety. But I'm confident that after the storm passes and there's a human need, it will be met because of the generosity of the American people.
And I want to thank you all for setting such a good example.
Volunteer. You're very welcome, very welcome.
The President. Appreciate you.
Volunteer. Thank you.
The President. Thank you.
