    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of leading Iraq war critic and former Ambassador Joseph Wilson.
"I have known Hillary Clinton for a decade. She is the one candidate who, in my judgment, understands the need to get Americans out of harm's way and to move this to a political process," Wilson said. "She knows what to do. She has the leadership. On day one, she will be able to reach out to the international community, and I am delighted to fight the fight with her."
"I admire Joe Wilson's courage in standing up to this administration and holding it accountable for the misinformation that led us into the Iraq war," Clinton said. "I'm honored to have his support as we do everything in our power to bring this war to an end and begin bringing our troops home safely."
A career diplomat in the US Foreign Service, Wilson spent more than 20 years in postings across Africa and the Middle East. He served as Deputy Chief of Mission in Baghdad, Iraq, from 1988-1991 on the eve of the Gulf War, and defied Saddam Hussein by giving shelter to hundreds of Americans and other foreigners. From 1992 to 1995 Wilson was Ambassador to Gabon and SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe, and later served as a special assistant to President Clinton and Director for African Affairs at the National Security Council.
Wilson is the author of the New York Times bestseller The Politics of Truth: Inside the Lies that Led to War and Betrayed My Wife's CIA Identity: A Diplomat's Memoir.
