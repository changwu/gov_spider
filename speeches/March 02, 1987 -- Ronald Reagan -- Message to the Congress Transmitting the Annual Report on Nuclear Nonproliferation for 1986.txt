    To the Congress of the United States:
I have reviewed the activities of United States Government departments and agencies during the calendar year 1986 related to the prevention of nuclear proliferation, and I am pleased to submit my annual report pursuant to Section 601(a) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-242).
The report concludes that the United States continued to make significant progress during 1986 in its efforts to achieve its non-proliferation goals.
A central objective of my Administration has been the prevention of the spread of nuclear explosives to additional countries. I intend to continue my pursuit of this goal with unflagging determination and a deep sense of personal commitment.
