    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I am notifying the Congress of my intent to use funds provided in Public Law 107- 38, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States, FY 2001, for improvements to the White House Situation Room to enhance the capabilities of the White House in the war on terrorism.
At this time, $3.3 million will be transferred from the Emergency Response Fund to the Department of Defense. As provided in Public Law 107-38, these funds will be made available to the Department of Defense immediately.
The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
