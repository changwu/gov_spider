    McLean, VA - Friends of Fred Thompson Communication Director Todd Harris released the following statement today regarding Mitt Romney's claim that he speaks for the "Republican wing of the Republican Party:"
"In 1994, Mitt Romney accomplished what people had long thought was impossible - he ran for Senate to the left of Ted Kennedy. I didn't know there was any room there. For him to now claim to represent the Republican wing of the Republican Party is yet another Mitt Romney flip flop."
