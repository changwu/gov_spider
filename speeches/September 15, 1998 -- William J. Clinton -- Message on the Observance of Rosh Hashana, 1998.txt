    Warmest greetings to all who are celebrating Rosh Hashana.
Each year during this season of promise and renewal, the stirring sound of the shofar resonates in the airâ€”a sacred summons calling Jews across America and around the world to celebrate the anniversary of God's creation of the world and the birth of a new year. Jews welcome this time of spiritual reawakening as a means to reaffirm their relationship with God and to prepare them for the joys and challenges of the coming year.
As the beginning of the High Holy Days, Rosh Hashana is a time of intense prayer and serious reflection; but it is also a time of rejoicing in the promises of the future and of renewed commitment to God and loved ones.
Hillary joins me in extending best wishes to all for a joyous celebration and for a year sweet with happiness and peace.
