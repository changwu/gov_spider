    The President today announced his intention to nominate Diane B. Frankel to be Director of the Institute of Museum Services, National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities.
"Diane Frankel has spent her career strengthening the commitment to teaching in the museums in which she has worked and fostering closer ties between museums and their local communities," the President said. "With her unique background as the founder of her own museum, I am confident she will do an excellent job directing the IMS in its efforts to support America's museums, historical sites, and zoos."
