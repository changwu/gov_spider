    On behalf of the many thousands of citizens struggling to put their lives back together following the recent string of devastating tornadoes, I want to thank the Congress for its approval of the supplemental budget. Some $900 million in funding will go immediately to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to ensure there will be no interruption in assistance to the disaster victims in Oklahoma, Kansas, Tennessee, Texas, and other States.
Vice President Gore and I saw the devastation first hand. We know that many families lost not only loved ones but also everything they own. All these families remain in our prayers. And we want them to know that their Government will continue to be there for them throughout their time of need.
