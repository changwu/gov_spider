    Alexandria, Va. - November 18, 2015 - Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and GOP presidential candidate, has filed to be on the Republican ballots in four states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan and Texas.
Last Thursday, Dr. Ben Carson qualified for the Michigan primary to be held on March 8, 2016, gaining recognition from Secretary of State Ruth Johnson as a presidential candidate who is "generally advocated by the national news media."
On Friday, prior to speaking at the Republican Party of Florida's Sunshine Summit, Dr. Carson submitted the necessary paperwork for the state's primary on March 15, 2016.
On Saturday, the Carson campaign filed for the ballot of the Texas primary to be held on March 1, 2016, and submitted the requisite $5,000 filing fee to the state party. The campaign raised $15,670, three times the filing fee, directly from Texas citizens over a 48-hour period.
Later on Saturday, Dr. Carson stopped by the Arizona State Capitol and submitted the official paperwork for Arizona's March 22 primary ballot directly to Secretary of State Michele Reagan.
"I am humbled by the support citizens in Arizona, Florida, Michigan and Texas have shown me," said Dr. Carson. "I am thrilled to have qualified for the primary ballots of these four states," added Dr. Carson. "I look forward to working with their citizens to provide solutions to the challenges our country faces."
"I am also grateful to all the Texans who have provided time and resources to help me get on their state's GOP ballot," added Dr. Carson.
Arizona, Florida, Michigan and Texas will send 58, 99, 59 and 155 Delegates, respectively, to the Republican National Convention to be held in Cleveland, Ohio, July 18 to 21, 2016.
In a recent American Values Survey, Dr. Carson leads the GOP race with 27 percent support among likely primary voters. The same poll also concluded that Dr. Carson is the most favored presidential candidate among Hispanics and white evangelical voters.
