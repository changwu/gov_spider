    Chapel Hill, North Carolina – Senator John Edwards released the following statement today in anticipation of the U.S. Senate beginning debate on the Employee Free Choice Act later this week:
"Organized labor has been the most important anti-poverty movement in American history—strengthening the middle class and providing good-paying jobs for millions of Americans. We need a president who will make it easier for workers to organize themselves into unions, not work against them. If a Republican can join the Republican Party by signing their name to a card, any worker in America ought to be able to join a union by doing exactly the same thing.
"This will probably be the single most important vote on the future of the middle class cast in the Senate this year. Working men and women will be watching their Senators to see whose side they are on."
