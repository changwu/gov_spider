    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee announced today that Deborah VonSprecken from Olin, Iowa will serve as the Jones County Chair. As part of Mayor Giuliani's Iowa leadership team Mrs. VonSprecken will spearhead the campaign's organizational efforts in the county. The announcement followed a visit from Rudy Giuliani to the VonSprecken's family farm in Olin where Mayor Giuliani apologized for the misunderstanding surrounding his last visit to the state. After spending nearly two hours visiting with Mr. and Mrs. VonSprecken, Deborah expressed her interest in supporting Mayor Giuliani and leading his efforts in Jones County.
"I am honored to have Deborah as part of my team in Iowa. As the hard-working owner of a family farm she understands the importance of cutting taxes and implementing fiscal discipline to grow the economy and increase opportunity," said Mayor Rudy Giuliani. "Her support is tremendous and will be of great value to our efforts in Iowa."
