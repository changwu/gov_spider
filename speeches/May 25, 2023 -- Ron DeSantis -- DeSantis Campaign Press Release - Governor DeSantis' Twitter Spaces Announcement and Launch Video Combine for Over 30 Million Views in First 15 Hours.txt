    **Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' campaign announcement on Twitter Spaces and his launch video posted to his social media accounts combined to garner over 30 million views in the first 15 hours.
As Governor DeSantis said last night in an interview with Fox News' Trey Gowdy, "We had a huge audience. It was the biggest they've ever had. It did break the Twitter Space. And so we're really excited with the enthusiasm."
The staggering view count comes as the DeSantis campaign today announced the governor will travel to Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina next week to share his vision for revitalizing America in what will be the initial stops of "Our Great American Comeback Tour."
Governor DeSantis will continue to hit the ground running today with a robust slate of 12 television, radio, and podcast interviews. We will send an ICYMI at the end of the day.
