    The President today made additional disaster assistance available to the State of New York by authorizing an increase in the level of federal funding for Public Assistance projects undertaken in the State of New York as a result of Hurricane Sandy during the period of October 27 to November 8, 2012.
Under the President's major disaster declaration issued for the State of New York on October 30, 2012, assistance was made available for Public Assistance, Hazard Mitigation, and Other Needs Assistance at 75 percent federal funding.
The President previously authorized 100 percent federal funding for fifteen days for emergency power restoration assistance and emergency public transportation assistance, including direct federal assistance, for those areas within New York counties designated for Public Assistance.
Under the President's order today, the federal share for Public Assistance, including direct federal assistance, has been increased to 90 percent of the total eligible costs, except for the assistance previously authorized at 100 percent federal funding.
