    Governor Bennett, distinguished members of the State legislature, all of you wonderful people from Kansas:
I have had a wonderful ride in from the airport with one of the most outstanding citizens in our country today, a man who has given so much in good advice and good leadership, your former Governor, All Landon. And I want to thank him for coming and welcoming me.
It has also been a great inspiration to come in with one of your outstanding statesmen, Jim Pearson, your United States Senator, who represents you so well in the Nation's Capital.
But the thing that has impressed me from the moment I landed in Kansas has been the warm reception from the airport to here, and this crowd is unbelievable. And I can't thank you enough for being here and giving me this wonderful reception.
And I am told that for the first time in Topeka history, that Topeka West, Topeka High, and Highland Park bands are all playing together. That kind of cooperation, that kind of unity is what we need in America today.
You have a great State. I came here to Kansas to meet with the legislature, to meet with a number of Governors, because we have to work together to make America a better and better place to live.
We do have a few problems, but those problems are soluble, those problems can be met and challenged, and with this kind of tremendous enthusiasm, good will, and cooperation among all of us, we will make America the place that we want it to be: free, strong leadership throughout the world.
I thank you very, very much.
