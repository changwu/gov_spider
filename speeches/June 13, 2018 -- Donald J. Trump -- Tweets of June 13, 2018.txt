There is no limit to what NoKo can achieve when it gives up its nuclear weapons and embraces commerce & engagement w/ the world. Chairman Kim has before him the opportunity to be remembered as the leader who ushered in a glorious new era of security & prosperity for his citizens! https://t.co/Xbup4Zyz33Retweets: 18172Favorites: 83487

I want to thank Chairman Kim for taking the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people. Our unprecedented meeting ' the first between an American President and a leader of North Korea ' proves that real change is possible! https://t.co/yF3iwD23YQRetweets: 24209Favorites: 111870

A year ago the pundits & talking heads people that couldn't do the job before were begging for conciliation and peace - 'please meet don't go to war.' Now that we meet and have a great relationship with Kim Jong Un the same haters shout out 'you shouldn't meet do not meet!'Retweets: 30890Favorites: 127515

My political representatives didn't want me to get involved in the Mark Sanford primary thinking that Sanford would easily win - but with a few hours left I felt that Katie was such a good candidate and Sanford was so bad I had to give it a shot. Congrats to Katie Arrington!Retweets: 12221Favorites: 63132

Robert De Niro a very Low IQ individual has received too many shots to the head by real boxers in movies. I watched him last night and truly believe he may be 'punch-drunk.' I guess he doesn't...Retweets: 20145Favorites: 99597

Congratulations to Corey Stewart for his great victory for Senator from Virginia. Now he runs against a total stiff Tim Kaine who is weak on crime and borders and wants to raise your taxes through the roof. Don't underestimate Corey a major chance of winning!Retweets: 16367Favorites: 74404

Just landed - a long trip but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office. There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea. Meeting with Kim Jong Un was an interesting and very positive experience. North Korea has great potential for the future!Retweets: 21715Favorites: 105473

Before taking office people were assuming that we were going to War with North Korea. President Obama said that North Korea was our biggest and most dangerous problem. No longer - sleep well tonight!Retweets: 32671Favorites: 146005

So funny to watch the Fake News especially NBC and CNN. They are fighting hard to downplay the deal with North Korea. 500 days ago they would have 'begged' for this deal-looked like war would break out. Our Country's biggest enemy is the Fake News so easily promulgated by fools!Retweets: 42887Favorites: 164892

Senator Claire McCaskill of the GREAT State of Missouri flew around in a luxurious private jet during her RV tour of the state. RV's are not for her. People are really upset so phony! Josh Hawley should win big and has my full endorsement.Retweets: 24270Favorites: 94725

Congratulations to @KevinCramer on his huge win in North Dakota. We need Kevin in the Senate and I strongly endorse him. Heidi voted NO on our Tax Cuts and always will vote no when we need her. Kevin is strong on Crime & Borders big on Cutting Taxes!Retweets: 15347Favorites: 71212
