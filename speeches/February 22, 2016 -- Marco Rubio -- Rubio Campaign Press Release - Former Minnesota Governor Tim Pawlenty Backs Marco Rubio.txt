Former Minnesota Governor and 2012 presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty is backing Marco ahead of that state's March 1st caucuses.Governor Pawlenty made his announcement on CNN this morning:


I'm announcing this morning and first on your show that I'm going to endorse Marco Rubio for President. And Alisyn, I think it comes down to this: He's strong, he's also informed, he's conservative and he's electable and he can unite the party and you can't ask for much more than that. I think he has got the total package.
Pawlenty was elected twice as an outspoken conservative in Minnesota.Welcome Governor Pawlenty to Team Marco!
