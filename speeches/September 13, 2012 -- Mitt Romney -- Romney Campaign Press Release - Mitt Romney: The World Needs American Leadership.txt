  MITT ROMNEY: "So these are tough times for American families that have work, and then you have 23 million people who are out of work or stopped looking for work or underemployed. These are tough times. But you know what? Your optimism is my optimism. America is coming back. We're going to make sure that we have the jobs that we need. America is going to remain strong. And we're going to make sure that we remain the hope of the earth. Now, a strong America is essential to the world. It's essential to us and to our future but also to the world. I was in Poland a few weeks ago, and I met with Lech Walesa, a world hero, and he saw me come in, and through an interpreter, he said, you must be tired, you've come from across the ocean. He said, you sit, I talk, you listen. Abrupt and to the point. And he said this time and time again, he said, the world needs American leadership. Where is American leadership? We need a strong America. Where is American leadership? And I intend to lead and to have an America that's strong, that helps lead the world."
