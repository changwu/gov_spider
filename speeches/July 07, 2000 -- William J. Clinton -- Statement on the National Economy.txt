    Today we have more evidence that our economic strategy is working. The American economy has created more than 22 million jobs since the beginning of 1993. More than 20 million of these jobs are in the private sector, giving us the highest share of private-sector job creation since President Truman was in office. The benefits of job creation have been enjoyed across the American economy, with the unemployment rates for African-Americans and Hispanics falling to record lows this year.
This good news is another reminder that America should not reverse course with irresponsible tax cuts that risk our fiscal discipline and jeopardize our continued economic strength. Let's ensure that the American people can continue to break records by maintaining fiscal discipline, paying off the debt by 2012, keeping Social Security and Medicare strong for the next generation, and investing in education and other priorities.
