    Last year I signed into law the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. It authorizes the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General, to designate an organization that engages in terrorist activity a foreign terrorist organization if it threatens the national security of the United States. The law prevents any fundraising or other financial transactions by these groups in the U.S. Heavy criminal penalties will also be levied against individuals in the United States who provide material support or resources to these terrorist organizations. Together, these provisions will help deprive terrorist groups of the resources they need to finance their acts of destruction.
Today Secretary Albright has designated 30 foreign organizations as terrorist groups. Now we will work to uncover those who raise money for them in America and encourage our friends and allies to do the same within their own borders.
The Secretary's designations are part of our ongoing fight against those who would undermine freedom and prosperity by violent acts. Just as we must reward and encourage the builders of peace and democracy, we must give no quarter to the enemies of these aspirations. Today's action sends a clear message: The path to change is through dialog and open deliberation, not violence and hatred. The United States is committed to fight against those who speak the language of terror.
