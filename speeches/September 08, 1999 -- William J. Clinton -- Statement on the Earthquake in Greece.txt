    On behalf of all Americans, Hillary and I extend our profound sympathy to the loved ones of those who have lost their lives and to those injured in yesterday's earthquake in Greece. Last month people around the world were moved by Greece's generous assistance to Turkey in the wake of the devastating earthquake that struck near Istanbul. Now we have seen the same spirit of cooperation in President Demirel's pledge of support for the Greek people in their hour of need. We, too, are prepared to help the Greek Government respond to the disaster.
