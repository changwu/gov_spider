    Let me just say, when you look at all these cars, it is testimony to the outstanding work that's been done by workers: American workers, American designers. The U.S. auto industry is back. The fact that GM is back, number one, I think shows the kind of turnaround that's possible when it comes to American manufacturing.
And it's good to remember that--the fact that there were some folks who were willing to let this industry die. Because of folks coming together, we are now back in a place where we can compete with any car company in the world. And these are not only selling here in the United States, they also serve as a platform for us to sell product all around the world.
So I'm just very proud of what we're seeing here. That Camaro with the American eagle and the American flag, that helps tell the story.
So thank you very much.
