    The Job Corps began 15 years ago on the premise that, if given the opportunity, young people who had grown up in poverty and frustration could become responsible, employable, and productive citizens.
With government, labor, and industry working together, this idea has become a reality for more than 700,000 young men and women who have received basic education, skills training, work experience, and health care through the Job Corps. With their new skills and pride in accomplishment, Job Corps graduates are entering the labor market, confident that they can become contributing workers with satisfying careers.
In the years to come, I know that the Job Corps will continue to assist young men and women, who might otherwise have been neglected and forgotten, to lead rewarding lives.
