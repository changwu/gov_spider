(House Rules)
(Rep. Rogers, R-KY)
The Administration supports House passage of H.J. Res. 117, making continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2013, and for other purposes. Reflecting a compromise, the legislation adheres to the funding level agreed to by both parties and excludes ideological or extraneous policy riders that have no place in funding legislation. H.J. Res. 117 allows critical Government functions to operate without interruption in order to protect national security and ensure that Americans continue to receive vital services and benefits in a timely manner. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on appropriations legislation for the remainder of the fiscal year that honors the Budget Control Act, preserves critical national priorities, and makes investments to spur economic growth and job creation for years to come.
