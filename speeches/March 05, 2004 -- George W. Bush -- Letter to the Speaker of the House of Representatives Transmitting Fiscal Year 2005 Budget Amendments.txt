    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2005 budget amendments for the Department of Defense reflecting the Army's recommendation not to proceed further with funding for the Comanche helicopter program. Overall, the discretionary budget authority proposed in the FY 2005 Budget would not be affected by these amendments.
The details of these proposals are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
