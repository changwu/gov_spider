    The United States strongly condemns the cowardly attack on Afghan forces and civilians in Kabul this morning that killed dozens and wounded hundreds. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, and their loved ones. At the outset of this year's fighting season, we remain committed to supporting the Afghan people and their government. We also call on the Taliban to pursue a pathway of peace instead of continuing a military campaign responsible for the senseless deaths of Afghan civilians. We will remain steadfast partners with Afghan security forces as we work to promote peace and stability in the region, and as we counter the threat of terrorism that affects us all.
