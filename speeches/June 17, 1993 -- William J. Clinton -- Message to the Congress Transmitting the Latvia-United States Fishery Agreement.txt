    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Latvia Concerning Fisheries off the Coasts of the United States, with annex, signed at Washington on April 8, 1993. The agreement constitutes a governing international fishery agreement within the requirements of Section 201(c) of the Act.
United States fishing industry interests have urged prompt consideration of this agreement to take advantage of opportunities for seasonal cooperative fishing ventures. I recommend that the Congress give favorable consideration to this agreement at an early date.
