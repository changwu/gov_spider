    Mr. Prime Minister and our distinguished guests:
Mr. Prime Minister, it is a very great privilege to welcome you on this first day of spring to our country, and to welcome Mrs. Nihat Erim and the members of your party on this occasion.
Your visit comes at a very special time. It is halfway between the visits that I will have paid to the P.R.C. and the U.S.S.R., and it reminds us of a very profound truth. At a time that we seek better relations with those who have been our adversaries, we do not forget those who have been and are our friends.
Turkey and the United States have been allies and friends for many years. That alliance has been particularly strong in NATO, and from the standpoint of friendship, I shall never forget the warm welcome that the people of Turkey and your Government extended to Mrs. Nixon and me when we visited your country in 1956. We hope that we can make you, your wife, and the members of your party feel just as welcome as you visit Washington, our Nation's Capital today.
We are reminded, too, that our alliance and friendship goes beyond military matters. We know, for example, that in a cause that is interesting to not only people in your country, but in ours, people all over the world, that of dealing with dangerous drugs, your Government has taken strong positions of leadership and cooperation that have been most helpful in dealing with this problem, and for that we are most grateful.
As I think of your country and its great history, the motto which came from your great leader Ataturk, "Peace at home and peace in the world," is one that we in the United States can also say is our goal. That is the purpose of our meeting todays peace at home, peace in the world-and we know that our talks will contribute to that great goal.
