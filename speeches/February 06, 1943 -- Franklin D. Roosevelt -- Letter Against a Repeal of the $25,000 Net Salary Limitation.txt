    You have written me that there is a proposal before the Ways and Means Committee to amend the Public Debt Bill by adding a provision which in effect would nullify the Executive Order issued by me under the Act of Oct. 2, 1942 (price and wage control), limiting salaries to $25,000 net after taxes. You ask whether I care to submit any views with reference to this proposal.
It is my earnest hope that the Public Debt Bill can be passed without the addition of amendments not related to the subject matter of the bill. I believe it is of importance that this should be done. However, should the committee think otherwise, I will later, in response to your invitation, submit my views as to the merits of the proposal.
Hon. Robert Doughton, Chairman, House Ways and Means Committee
