Federal funding is available to state and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms, straight-line winds, flooding, landslides, and mudslides in the counties of Chippewa, Freeborn, Jackson, Murray, Nobles, Pipestone, Renville, and Rock.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
