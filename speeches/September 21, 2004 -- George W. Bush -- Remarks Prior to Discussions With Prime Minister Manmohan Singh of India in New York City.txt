    President Bush. I've really been looking forward to meeting the Prime Minister.
Prime Minister Singh. Thank you.
President Bush. He's the leader of a great country and the leader of a friend of the United States.
And I'm proud you're here, sir.
Prime Minister Singh. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm very, very happy to be in this land of opportunity that the United States is. And under your distinguished leadership, our two countries' relations have grown in diverse ways, but I do believe that the best is yet to come.
President Bush. Yes, sir. [Laughter] Thank you.
