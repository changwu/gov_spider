    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Subject: Part-time Employment
Part-time workers are an important, but relatively untapped national resource. Older people, those with family responsibilities, the handicapped, students and others who are unable to work full time can be valuable additions to an agency's permanent work force. To assure that we in the Federal Government take advantage of the many talents available, I am asking you to establish innovative programs to expand opportunities for men and women seeking part-time employment.
Such programs should include redesign of jobs and work schedules to open up permanent part-time opportunities, recruitment efforts to attract capable men and women to part-time work, review of rules, regulations, and procedures to eliminate artificial barriers to part-time employment, and pilot and research studies to determine where part-time employees can make the maximum contribution.
I believe that much can be done within existing employment ceilings. The Civil Service Commission will coordinate these efforts and will report to me periodically on the progress achieved and the need for any further actions.
