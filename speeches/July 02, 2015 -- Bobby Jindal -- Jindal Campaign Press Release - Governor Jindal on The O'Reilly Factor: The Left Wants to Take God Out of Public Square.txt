    BATON ROUGE — Governor Bobby Jindal told Bill O'Reilly on The O'Reilly Factor last night that the Left wants to take God out of the public square. The Governor went on the show by satellite from the campaign trail to discuss the ACLU lawsuit that was filed against his executive order protecting religious freedom rights. You can watch a clip of the interview here.
Governor Jindal said, "We did the executive order on May 19th in anticipation of the Court's awful ruling. I think their long game is, the ACLU used to be for religious freedom before they were against it. I think they want to get to a point where we no longer have First Amendment religious freedom rights... The ACLU, on their website, says religious liberty is a fundamental right. Here's the hypocrisy: they've actually used Louisiana's Religious Freedom Information Act (RFRA) to defend the rights of other religious minorities, and good for them for doing that — but now that it's evangelical Christians, now that it is Catholics who object to redefining marriage, who are simply saying we don't want to participate in weddings that violate our conscience and our beliefs, now the ACLU is saying you can't have the same rights, the same First Amendment protections we want for other religious minorities... I think the Left wants to take God out of the public square, I think they want to redefine America to a much more secular society."
