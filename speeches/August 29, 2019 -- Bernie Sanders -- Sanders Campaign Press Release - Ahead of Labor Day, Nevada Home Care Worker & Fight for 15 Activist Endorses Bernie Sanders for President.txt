    LAS VEGAS â€“ Ahead of Labor Day weekend, Bernie 2020 in Nevada announced that George Allen, a Las Vegas home care worker and Fight for 15 activist, endorsed Bernie Sanders' candidacy for president of the United States.
"The Bernie Sanders campaign is a campaign for a better America," Allen said. "His campaign is a promise that everyone deserves a chance for a better wage, a better life, and that no insignificant person was ever born. There's been a great deal of soul searching and I've come to the conclusion that this movement will give the American people the strength to fight injustice in all its forms."
Allen continued, "The gospel of truth has given the rich something they can't buy and the poor something they can't deny. That's why I am proud to endorse Bernie Sanders for president of the United States of America."
Allen was previously featured in a Bernie 2020 digital video documenting his experience with homelessness, caring for a son with a disability, and treating his diabetes while being paid only $9 an hour as a home care worker. The Nevada Independent also profiled Allen, describing in detail the struggles of low-wage workers in Nevada: "Allen lives his life at the nexus of some of today's hot-button policy issues, from health-care reform and the high cost of insulin to payday loans and the fight for a $15 an hour minimum wage."
