    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Studds (D) Massachusetts and Young (R) Alaska)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1223. The bill is objectionable because it would authorize appropriations of $75 million for each of FYs 1990-1992, instead of $35 million for FY 1990 as supported by the Administration, for miscellaneous marine fisheries programs.
