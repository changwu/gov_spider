    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. Nunes, R-CA)
The Administration supports House passage of the House Amendment to S. 139, the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017.
Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 provides authorities to collect critical intelligence on terrorist organizations, weapons proliferators, and other foreign adversaries that is vital to keeping the Nation safe. Reauthorizing these authorities before they expire on January 19, 2018, in a manner that preserves their effectiveness, is a top priority of the Administration.
The Administration would prefer a clean and permanent extension of section 702 of FISA. The bill would, however, provide for a six-year reauthorization of section 702, a critical extension that will keep America safe from those who wish to do us harm.
If the House Amendment to S. 139 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.
