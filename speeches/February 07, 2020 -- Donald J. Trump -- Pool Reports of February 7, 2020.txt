WH in-town pool report #5/ POTUS's comments on Pelosi and SOTU 
POTUS on Nancy Pelosi tearing up his state of the union address:
"Well, I thought it was a terrible thing when she ripped up the speech. First of all, it's an official document. You're not allowed, it's illegal what she did. She broke the law.
"But I haven't been asked the question other than a lot of people that viewed it, they couldn't believe that she did it. I thought it was terrible. I thought it was very disrespectful to the chamber, to the country.
"I got very high marks for the speech and I didn't know she did it until I was walking out and some of the Congressmen and women were saying, 'Can you believe what she did? But I didn't know she did."
POTUS on Democrats:
"Well, I think there's a lot of evil on that side. They've gone crazy, they've gone totally crazy. It's too bad. I've got tremendous amounts of stuff, more than anybody's gotten done in three years by far. But they're not constructive people.
"I do work with Democrats, I work with everybody but that group is, you know, they say 'Trump derangement syndrome'. They've got it. They've got a bad case of it. You saw that, that was on display the other night when she ripped up the speech. That was terrible, so disrespectful to our country and actually very illegal, what she did."
More to follow.

WH in-town pool report #7/ POTUS on jobs, Iowa and China 
POTUS on the latest jobs report:
"I have to say this. We just came out with fantastic job numbers. I think it was 230,000 or something thereabouts, which was much higher than projections. So jobs continue to be great. Our country continues to do great. I'm now going to North Carolina. Some of you maybe are coming but the jobs report just came out and it's great."
Asked if he still wants Ukraine to dig up dirt on political rivals like Joe Biden, POTUS said:
"No. These people, they're their own people. I'm not their boss and I don't think they've done anything, as far as I know. But it's very sad what happened with the Bidens and it's also very sad how he's doing, how he's doing in the polls.
"Now I understand the votes are fried in Iowa. They couldn't even take a simple tabulation and yet they're telling you how to run the country and how to run healthcare. I think they fried their votes on computer. Think of it, all the money that Democrats spent and the votes are fried. They have no idea who won. They have no idea.
"But I'll tell you who won on the Republican side. They accounted for every single vote and it was a lot of votes. It was a record setting number of votes. Trump won."
Responding to more questions about the Democratic race for president, he said:
"Well, you don't know what happened in Iowa because if you look, I mean they're essentially tied. But they couldn't keep tabulation of their votes."
POTUS added, "Everybody's a threat, I view everybody as a threat," then pointed at John Roberts of Fox News and joked, "I even view John as a threat. You never know." Pointing at a microphone, he said: "That's wet!"
POTUS was asked about China and the coronavirus.
He said: "China's working very hard. Late last night I had a very good talk with President Xi and we talked mostly about the coronavirus. They're working really hard and I think they're doing a very professional job. They're in touch with the World Health Organisation; CDC also. We're working together but World Health is working with them, CDC is working with them. I had a great conversation last night with President Xi. It's a tough situation. I think they're doing a very good job."
Asked if his impeachment in the House of Representatives should be expunged, POTUS said:
"They should because it was a hoax. That's a very good question. Should they expunge the impeachment in the House? They should because it was a hoax. It was a total political hoax."
The last question was how POTUS will unify the country.
He replied: "You know what's going to unify the country? And it's already unified in a lot of ways. All you have to do is look at our crowds and look at our support. But what unifies it is the great success. Our country today is more successful than it has ever been and that's unifying the country."
Wearing dark coat, suit, white shirt and red tie, POTUS then waved and walked across the damp south lawn to Marine One and departed.
