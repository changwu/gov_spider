    SAN DIEGO â€“ Following Mike Bloomberg's visit to San Diego yesterday, where he toured a small business owned by a veteran and met with gun violence prevention activists, San Diego City Council Member Mark Kersey and Imperial Beach City Council Member Mark West announced their endorsements of Bloomberg for President.
"Michael Bloomberg is the leader the Democratic Party and our country need today. Our nation is at a critical moment, and the challenges we face this decade, from gun violence, to a changing economy, to climate change, require a principled leader who has shown again and again that he will deliver," said Imperial Beach City Council Member Mark West. "We need to ensure that this is the final year of the Trump White House. But we also need to elect a President who understands the challenges working families face, and who have a vision and a plan to deliver for them. That leader is Michael Bloomberg."
"We need people in Washington who understand how to create jobs and grow wages, leaders who understand business and how to build a fairer economy. And we need consensus builders who know how to cut through bureaucratic red tape and partisan hot air, not just talk about it," said San Diego City Council Member Mark Kersey. "I'm proud to endorse Michael Bloomberg today, and proud to work with him to build a better and fairer California."
San Jose Mayor and Mike Bloomberg 2020 Co-Chair Sam Liccardo released the following statement, hailing their endorsements:
"Mark Kersey and Mark West are incredible civic leaders and champions for their communities. We are honored to have them on our team and grateful for their support."
