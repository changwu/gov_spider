    In a new set of Invest in America/Data for Progress poll questions released today, Americans overwhelmingly support investing in care infrastructure. The poll found:

71% of Americans, 64% of Independents and 58% of Republicans support investments in care infrastructure
More than 70% of respondents support investment in every aspect of the care economy

President Biden's American Jobs Plan will invest $400 billion in the caregiving economy, starting by creating new and better jobs for caregiving workers. The American Jobs Plan will expand access to quality, affordable home- or community-based care for aging relatives and people with disabilities. These investments will help hundreds of thousands of Americans finally obtain the long-term services and support they need, while creating new jobs and offering caregiving workers a long-overdue raise, stronger benefits, and an opportunity to organize or join a union and collectively bargain.
Once again, the data proves that the American Jobs Plan is both what the country needs, and what the American people – of both parties – want.
