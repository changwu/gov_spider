    The United States applauds the efforts of President Wade of Senegal in cooperation with the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations to help resolve the political impasse in Madagascar. The Dakar Accord was signed on April 18 by both Mr. Ratsiraka and Mr. Ravalomanana. The Accord provided a sound framework for an open, transparent, and democratic solution to Madagascar's political crisis and the President urged the parties to implement it in good faith. The President welcomes the agreement to return to Dakar May 13 to find a broad-based, permanent solution to the ongoing political crisis.
It is critical that Mr. Ratsiraka and Mr. Ravalomanana restrain their supporters from taking further violent actions, dismantle the barricades, and swiftly restore peace, tranquility, and order in Madagascar. The President calls upon the two leaders to put national interests and the interests of the people of Madagascar above their personal interests. The United States stands ready to assist Madagascar in implementing a political agreement so that Madagascar's citizens can move forward and claim the democratic future they desire and deserve.
