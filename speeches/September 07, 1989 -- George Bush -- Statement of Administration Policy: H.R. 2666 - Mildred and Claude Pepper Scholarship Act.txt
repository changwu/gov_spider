    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
Not sent per 9/8/89 LA meetin
(House)(Williams (D) MT)
The Administration opposes H.R. 2666, which would authorize $500,000 for FY 1990 and such sums for FYs 1991-1992 for grants to the Washington Workshops Foundation to establish and maintain the Mildred and Claude Pepper Scholarship Program. This bill would inappropriately earmark funds for a specific grantee for activities that are very similar to activities already funded by the Federal Government through the Allen J. Ellender Fellowship Program.
