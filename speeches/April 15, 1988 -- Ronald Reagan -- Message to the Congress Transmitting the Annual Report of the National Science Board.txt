    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to submit to the Congress a report of the National Science Board entitled Science and Engineering Indicators—1987. This report is the eighth in a continuing series in which important aspects of the status of American science and engineering are examined.
The importance of scientific and engineering research to the well-being of our Nation is widely recognized. Science and engineering play a vital role in maintaining our Nation's defense, improving its health, and increasing its economic productivity.
I commend Science and Engineering Indicators—1987 to the attention of the Congress and those in the scientific endeavor.
