    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Bachus (R) Alabama and 58 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 2622. The bill removes the sunsets from the Fair Credit Reporting Act and includes many of the Administration's proposed consumer protections, including new tools to help fight identity theft. The national credit reporting system has proven critical to the resilience of consumer spending and the overall economy. The Administration looks forward to working with Congress as the bill proceeds through the legislative process.
