    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Lipinski (D) Illinois and 20 others)
The Administration supports reemployment rights for merchant seamen who serve in times of war, national emergency, or special mobilization, and has no objection to House passage of H.R. 1109. The Administration may, however, seek Senate amendments to promote consistent enforcement of reemployment requirements.
