Then enter our contest to win tickets to the October 28th debate in Denver, with airfare and accommodation on us!
The CNN debate in September was their most watched broadcast in history, with more than 20 million viewers.
And the Fox News debate back in August — 24 million Americans tuned in — remains the most-watched cable program in history (other than sports, of course).
Tickets for these debates are seriously hard to come by, because everyone wants to be there when candidates get such a big stage.
Remember when Marco predicted in the September debate — only to be proven exactly right two weeks later — that Russia would start flying combat missions in Syria?

Or Marco's moving statement at the end of the August debate about how he wants to expand the American Dream his parents worked to provide him with?
