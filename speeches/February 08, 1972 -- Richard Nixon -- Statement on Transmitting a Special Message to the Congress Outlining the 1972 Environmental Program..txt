    EACH of us, all across this great land, has a stake in maintaining and improving environmental quality: clean air and clean water, the wise use of our land, the protection of wildlife and natural beauty, parks for all to enjoy.
These are part of the birthright of every American. To guarantee that birthright, we must act, and act decisively. It is literally now or never.
During the past 3 years, we have made a good start. We have passed new laws to protect the environment, and we have mobilized the power of public concern. But there is much yet to be done.
Eighteen of the major environmental proposals which I put forward a year ago have still not received final action by the Congress. I repeat today my urgent request for Congressional action on this much needed legislation, and I am also presenting a number of new proposals.
The environmental agenda now before the Congress includes laws to deal with water pollution, pesticide hazards, ocean dumping, excessive noise, careless land development, and many other environmental problems. These problems will not stand still for politics or for partisanship. They demand to be met now. By meeting them now, we can make 1972 the best year ever for environmental progress.
The time has come for man to make his peace with nature. Let us renew our commitment. Let us redouble our effort. The quality of our life on this good land is a cause to unite all Americans.
