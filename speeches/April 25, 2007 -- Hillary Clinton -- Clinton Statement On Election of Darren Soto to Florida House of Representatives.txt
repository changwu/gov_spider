    The following is a statement from Senator Hillary Clinton on the election of Darren Soto to the Florida House of Representatives.
"Darren Soto's victory is the latest example that Americans are ready for change. I look forward to working with Darren and other Florida Democrats as we offer Americans real change from the State House to the White House. I want to congratulate Darren for running a great race in Florida's 49th District. After spending time with him earlier this year in Orlando, it's clear that Darren is an exciting young leader who can get results in Tallahassee."
