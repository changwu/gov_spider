    "The same path means $20 trillion of debt at the end of a second term. It means crippling unemployment continuing for another four years. It means stagnant take-home pay. It means depressed home values. And of course, it means a devastated military." — Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "I learned as governor of Massachusetts that the best achievements are shared achievements. I learned that respect and good will go a long way, and are usually returned in kind. This is how I'll conduct myself as president. I'll bring people together. I won't just represent one party, I'll represent one nation. Throughout the campaign, the President has brought almost every argument he can think of to the front. He's tried to convince you that these last four years have been a success. And so his plan for the next four years is to take all the ideas from the first term -- the stimulus, the borrowing, Obamacare, all the rest -- and do them over again. He calls that ‘Forward.' I call it ‘Forewarned.' The same course we've been on won't lead to a better destination. The same path means $20 trillion of debt at the end of a second term. It means crippling unemployment continuing for another four years. It means stagnant take-home pay. It means depressed home values. And of course, it means a devastated military. Unless we change course, by the way, we may be looking at another recession."
