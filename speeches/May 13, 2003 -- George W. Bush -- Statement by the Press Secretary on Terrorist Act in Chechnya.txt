    The United States Government Condemns Yesterday's Terrorist Act in Znamenskoye, Chechnya, that has killed over 50 people. We extend our condolences to the victims and their families.
We continue to urge a political settlement of the Chechnya conflict that respects Russia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, stops the violence, and ends human rights violations. We resolutely condemn all terrorist acts and senseless violence against civilians in Chechnya. No political, national, or religious cause justifies the use of terrorism.
