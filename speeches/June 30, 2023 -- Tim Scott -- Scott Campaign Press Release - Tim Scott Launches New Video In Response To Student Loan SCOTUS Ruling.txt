TRANSCRIPT:
Tim Scott: Joe Biden wants you to pay off the student loans of lawyers and professors. I want to strengthen vocational education and apprenticeships.
We need more welders, carpenters and electricians. These are the jobs that built America, and these are the jobs liberal elites can't ship to China.
College isn't the only path to the American dream, and it's time for a president who values hard work and the people who do it.
I'm Tim Scott and I approve this message.
