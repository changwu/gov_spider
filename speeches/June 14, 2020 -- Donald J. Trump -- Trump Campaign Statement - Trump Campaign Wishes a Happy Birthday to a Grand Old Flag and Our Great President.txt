    Today, in celebration of Flag Day and President Trump's birthday, Lara Trump, Senior Advisor to Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., released the following statement.
"Two-hundred and forty-three years ago today, we marked the adoption of the flag of the United States, which has served as a beacon of hope to freedom-loving people throughout the world ever since. We join patriots throughout America to honor Flag Day and the sacred principles that it represents. Of course, it's no small irony that the 45th President of the United States was born on this day as well. President Trump honors our flag everyday with his support of our military, law enforcement, and so many others who protect our freedoms, as well as through his calls for all Americans to stand in honor of our flag and those who died defending it. Today, we honor Flag Day and we wish a very happy birthday to President Donald J. Trump!"
