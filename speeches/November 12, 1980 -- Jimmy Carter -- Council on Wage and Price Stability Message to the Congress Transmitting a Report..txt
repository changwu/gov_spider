    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with Section 5 of the Council on Wage and Price Stability Act, as amended, I hereby transmit to the Congress the twenty-second quarterly report of the Council on Wage and Price Stability. The report describes the Council's activities during the first quarter of 1980. These include the monitoring of prices and wages in the private sector as well as of various Federal Government activities that could lead to higher costs and prices without creating commensurate benefits. The report discusses the Council's activities before Federal regulatory agencies and its role in my anti-inflation program.
The Council on Wage and Price Stability will continue to play an important role in our efforts to fight inflation. Its work supplements fiscal and monetary policies by calling public attention to wage and price developments and to actions by the Government that should be of concern to American consumers.
