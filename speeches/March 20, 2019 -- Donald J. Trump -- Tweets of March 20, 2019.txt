Campaigning for the Popular Vote is much easier & different than campaigning for the Electoral College. It's like training for the 100 yard dash vs. a marathon. The brilliance of the Electoral College is that you must go to many States to win. With the Popular Vote you go to....Retweets: 23449Favorites: 92821

....just the large States - the Cities would end up running the Country. Smaller States & the entire Midwest would end up losing all power - & we can't let that happen. I used to like the idea of the Popular Vote but now realize the Electoral College is far better for the U.S.A.Retweets: 28902Favorites: 122748

The Democrats are getting very 'strange.' They now want to change the voting age to 16 abolish the Electoral College and Increase significantly the number of Supreme Court Justices. Actually you've got to win it at the Ballot Box!Retweets: 31515Favorites: 126572

George Conway often referred to as Mr. Kellyanne Conway by those who know him is VERY jealous of his wife's success & angry that I with her help didn't give him the job he so desperately wanted. I barely know him but just take a look a stone cold LOSER & husband from hell!Retweets: 26011Favorites: 127551

Great news from @Ford! They are investing nearly $1 BILLION in Flat Rock Michigan for auto production on top of a $1 BILLION investment last month in a facility outside of Chicago. Companies are pouring back into the United States - they want to be where the action is!Retweets: 24765Favorites: 102005
