    I am withholding my approval of H.R. 5560, a bill making technical corrections relating to the "Health Omnibus Programs Extension of 1988," which I approved on November 4, 1988 (Public Law 100-607). My approval of H.R. 5560 is unnecessary, because its provisions are identical to Title II, Subtitle G of H.R. 5210, the "Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988," which I was pleased to approve on November 18, 1988. Accordingly, and in order to avoid creating further technical problems, I am withholding my approval of H.R. 5560.
RONALD REAGAN
The White House,
November 23, 1988.
