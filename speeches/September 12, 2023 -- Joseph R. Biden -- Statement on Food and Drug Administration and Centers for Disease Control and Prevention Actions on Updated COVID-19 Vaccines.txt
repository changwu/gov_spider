    Since entering office, my administration has made historic progress in our ability to manage COVID-19 so that it no longer meaningfully disrupts our lives. Today marks another important milestone. Following an independent scientific review, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have now authorized, approved, and recommended everyone 6 months and older get an updated COVID-19 vaccine to protect against serious illness this fall and winter.
Today's announcement also means that we now have immunizations for all three major seasonal respiratory viruses: COVID-19, flu, and RSV. As we head into fall and winter, we are in our strongest position yet, with more tools and systems available than ever before, including safe and effective vaccines, widely available at-home tests, and effective treatments.
Vaccination against COVID-19 remains the most important protection in avoiding hospitalization, long-term health complications, and death. I encourage all Americans to stay up to date on their vaccines.
