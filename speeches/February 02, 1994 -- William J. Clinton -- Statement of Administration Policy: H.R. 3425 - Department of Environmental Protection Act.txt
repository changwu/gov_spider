    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Conyers (D) Michigan and 41 others)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 3425. Elevation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to Cabinet status will ensure that environmental issues are an integral part of the domestic policy process. The consideration of environmental concerns is imperative for the sustained success of our Nation's economic, social and trade policy.
The Administration strongly opposes amendments to H.R. 3425 affecting environmental policy, such as placing new "risk assessment" requirements on the promulgation of environmental regulations. The purpose of H.R. 3425 is to provide for the structural elevation of the EPA to Cabinet status and improve the management of EPA consistent with the recommendations of the Vice President's National Performance Review. It is an inappropriate vehicle for consideration of broader environmental policy issues.
We urge the Congress to reject efforts to provide for such amendments to this bill, to oppose a weakening amendment in the nature of a substitute, and to move quickly to enact this critical legislation.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 3425 would affect receipts; therefore it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. This office estimates the pay-as-you-go effect is zero.
