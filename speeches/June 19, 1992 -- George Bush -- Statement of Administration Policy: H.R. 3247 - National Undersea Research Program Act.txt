    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 6/22/92)(House)(Jones (D) North Carolina and 5 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3247.
The bill would authorize $150 million for FYs 1992-1996 for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to assist in undersea research. NOAA has administered the National Undersea Research Program since 1980, and many of the procedures prescribed by H.R. 3247 are presently in place. Statutory establishment of the program is unnecessary. Further, the program growth authorized by the bill would place higher priority NOAA programs at risk in the appropriations process.
The bill would designate in law four new undersea research regions and authorize the establishment of new research centers. Such designations are inappropriate without study of the scientific need for them and a determination that undersea research will be measurably enhanced by their designation.
