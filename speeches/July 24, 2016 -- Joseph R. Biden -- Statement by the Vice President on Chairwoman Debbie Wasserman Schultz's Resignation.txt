    ?Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had the President's and my back over the last eight years—and we're incredibly grateful. She's been part of our efforts to build an economy from the middle-out, to deliver quality, affordable health care to millions of Americans, and to protect equal rights for everyone.
Governing is serious business. The country deserves—and needs—serious leaders like Debbie. A fighter for women's health and rights. A fierce advocate for seniors and working families. A Congresswoman who knows her first job is serving her constituents—and her first obligation is always to her beautiful family—Steve, Jake, Rebecca, and Shelby. Debbie is an incredible public servant, and she will always be my friend.
