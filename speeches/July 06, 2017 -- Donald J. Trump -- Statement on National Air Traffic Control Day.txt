    Today, on National Air Traffic Control Day, we thank the hard working men and women of the Federal Aviation Administration as we unite behind our shared commitment to safe and efficient management of our skies. On July 6, 1936, the U.S. Bureau of Air Commerce established the United States air traffic control system. Since then, our Nation has enjoyed remarkable growth in safe air travel thanks to the dedication and unmatched skill of our technicians, engineers, and air traffic controllers.
Our Nation's aviation professionals help guide millions of planes through one of the world's most complex and voluminous airspaces each year. Unfortunately, air traffic controllers still lack access to the most advanced equipment available. We must do better to equip our air traffic controllers and meet the needs of our growing system of air travel.
To this end, I recently announced new principles to modernize air travel and transform our air traffic control services into an independent, non-profit organization. My initiative will bring America in line with the rest of the industrialized world and ensure that the Federal Aviation Administration focuses on what it does bestâ€”making our skies safe. These much-needed reforms will lead to accelerated innovation, fewer flight delays and cancellations, and more direct flights to more destinations.
Since President Ronald Reagan first marked National Air Traffic Control Day more than 30 years ago, technology has reshaped all aspects of American life. It is time to similarly innovate American air travel.
