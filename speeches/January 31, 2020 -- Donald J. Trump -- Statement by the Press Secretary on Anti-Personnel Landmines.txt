    As part of President Donald J. Trump's steadfast commitment to ensuring our forces are able to defend against any and all threats, the President has canceled the Obama Administration's policy to prohibit United States military forces from employing anti-personnel landmines outside of the Korean Peninsula. The Department of Defense has determined that restrictions imposed on American forces by the Obama Administration's policy could place them at a severe disadvantage during a conflict against our adversaries. The President is unwilling to accept this risk to our troops.
The Department of Defense is issuing a new landmine policy. This policy will authorize Combatant Commanders, in exceptional circumstances, to employ advanced, non-persistent landmines specifically designed to reduce unintended harm to civilians and partner forces. This action is yet another in a series of actions taken by the Trump Administration to give our military the flexibility and capability it needs to win. President Trump is rebuilding our military, and it is stronger than ever. The President will continue to support and equip our troops so that they will forever remain the greatest fighting force in the world.
