My warmest sympathy and best wishes goes out to the people of New Zealand after the horrible massacre in the Mosques. 49 innocent people have so senselessly died with so many more seriously injured. The U.S. stands by New Zealand for anything we can do. God bless all!Retweets: 31564Favorites: 164122

The 'Jexodus' movement encourages Jewish people to leave the Democrat Party. Total disrespect! Republicans are waiting with open arms. Remember Jerusalem (U.S. Embassy) and the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal! @OANN @foxandfriendsRetweets: 21078Favorites: 80638

'New evidence that the Obama era team of the FBI DOJ & CIA were working together to Spy on (and take out) President Trump all the way back in 2015.' A transcript of Peter Strzok's testimony is devastating. Hopefully the Mueller Report will be covering this. @OANN @foxandfriendsRetweets: 33266Favorites: 109922

So if there was knowingly & acknowledged to be 'zero' crime when the Special Counsel was appointed and if the appointment was made based on the Fake Dossier (paid for by Crooked Hillary) and now disgraced Andrew McCabe (he & all stated no crime) then the Special Counsel.......Retweets: 22626Favorites: 88535

....should never have been appointed and there should be no Mueller Report. This was an illegal & conflicted investigation in search of a crime. Russian Collusion was nothing more than an excuse by the Democrats for losing an Election that they thought they were going to win.....Retweets: 26775Favorites: 109777

I'd like to thank all of the Great Republican Senators who bravely voted for Strong Border Security and the WALL. This will help stop Crime Human Trafficking and Drugs entering our Country.

Just spoke w/ @GovRicketts. The people of Nebraska & across the Midwest especially the Farmers & Ranchers are feeling the impacts from severe weather. The first responders & emergency response teams have done a great job dealing w/ record flooding high winds & road closures.Retweets: 15795Favorites: 75392
