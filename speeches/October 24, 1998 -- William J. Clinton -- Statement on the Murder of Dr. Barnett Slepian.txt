    I am outraged by the murder of Dr. Barnett Slepian in his home last night in Amherst, NY. The Department of Justice is working with State and local authorities to find the person or persons responsible and bring them to justice. While we do not have all the facts of this case, one thing is clear: this Nation cannot tolerate violence directed at those providing a constitutionally protected medical service.
No matter where we stand on the issue of abortion, all Americans must stand together in condemning this tragic and brutal act. We must protect the safety and freedom of all our citizens.
Hillary and I extend our thoughts and prayers to the family of Dr. Slepian.
