'Some 40 U.S. companies have responded to President Trump's tax cut and reform victory in Congress last year by handing out bonuses up to $2000 increases in 401k matches and spending on charity a much higher number than previously known.' https://t.co/bmWrwWzxMRRetweets: 16718Favorites: 68324

Stock Market had another good day but now that the Tax Cut Bill has passed we have tremendous upward potential. Dow just short of 25000 a number that few thought would be possible this soon into my administration. Also unemployment went down to 4.1%. Only getting better!Retweets: 19850Favorites: 106397

Many mostly Democrat States refused to hand over data from the 2016 Election to the Commission On Voter Fraud. They fought hard that the Commission not see their records or methods because they know that many people are voting illegally. System is rigged must go to Voter I.D.Retweets: 30929Favorites: 111192

As Americans you need identification sometimes in a very strong and accurate form for almost everything you do.....except when it comes to the most important thing VOTING for the people that run your country. Push hard for Voter Identification!Retweets: 40391Favorites: 155369

With all of the failed 'experts' weighing in does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn't firm strong and willing to commit our total 'might' against the North. Fools but talks are a good thing!Retweets: 19831Favorites: 94396

Thank you to the great Republican Senators who showed up to our mtg on immigration reform. We must BUILD THE WALL stop illegal immigration end chain migration & cancel the visa lottery. The current system is unsafe & unfair to the great people of our country - time for change!Retweets: 30271Favorites: 137534
