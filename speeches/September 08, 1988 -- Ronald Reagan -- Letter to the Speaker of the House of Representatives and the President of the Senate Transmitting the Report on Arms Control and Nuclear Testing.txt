    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In their report accompanying Fiscal Year 1988 Defense Authorization Act, the Senate Armed Services Committee requested the President to submit a report on certain aspects of the relationship between success in other arms reduction limitations and further restrictions on the conduct of nuclear testing. I am pleased to submit the attached report setting forth U.S. policy in this important area.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
