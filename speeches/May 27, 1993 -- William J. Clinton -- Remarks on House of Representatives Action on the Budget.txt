    For a long time now, the American people have wondered whether their Government in Washington could ever really work for them again, ever really face the tough problems. Well, tonight the House of Representatives gave America a victory of growth over gridlock. Tonight the House showed courage and conviction. Tonight the House made hard choices: to cut a quarter of a billion dollars in spending; to ask those most able to pay, the wealthy, to do more to reduce our deficit; to increase incentives to invest and create jobs in the private sector; and to provide the incentives to make people at the bottom rungs of the economy prefer work over welfare. Tonight the House said no to gridlock, no to the status quo, and no to the special interests who worked so very hard to frighten millions of Americans about this program. Tonight the House said yes to jobs, yes to lowering the deficit, yes to lower interest rates, yes to a brighter future.
Tomorrow we go on to the Senate, and we go back to the country. We have broken the gridlock. We are taking responsibility for the future. We are dealing with the tough problems. I am very, very proud of the people who tonight east a very tough vote in a hard environment for a better tomorrow for America.
Thank you very much.
