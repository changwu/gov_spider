    I am very pleased that the Senate today voted unanimously to confirm Ambassador Bill Richardson as Secretary of Energy.
Ambassador Richardson brings extraordinary experience and expertise to this vital post. As a Member of the U.S. Congress representing New Mexico, an energy-rich State that is home to two Department of Energy national laboratories, he has extensive firsthand experience on issues ranging from oil and gas deregulation to alternative energy to ensuring strong environmental standards in energy development. As U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, he has been a vigorous and articulate proponent of U.S. engagement and has successfully tackled tough negotiating challenges around the world.
I am confident that Ambassador Richardson's tremendous energy, creativity, and leadership will help secure our Nation's energy future so that America continues to prosper.
