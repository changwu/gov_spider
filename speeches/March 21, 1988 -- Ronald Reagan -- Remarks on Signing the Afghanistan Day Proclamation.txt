    Well, we're gathered here today to mark the beginning of a new year for the valiant, freedom-loving people of Afghanistan. We may be approaching an historic moment. We all hope that what we hear from Moscow means there will be a complete and irreversible withdrawal of all the Soviet forces from Afghanistan, that the Afghan people will be able to freely determine their own future, and that the millions of refugees can return to their homes with dignity. The struggle for freedom waged by the people of Afghanistan is inspiration to free people all over the world. We have supported them in their effort to liberate their country from foreign domination, and we'll continue that support as long as it's needed. As a free people we can do no less, for their struggle is our struggle.
And with that said, I shall sign the proclamation.
