    Former Hawaii Congressman Charles Djou made the following statement on the upcoming caucuses in Hawaii:
"On Tuesday night, Republicans made clear that they are uniting behind Mitt Romney because he is the best candidate to lead America and put in place pro-growth economic policies to revive our economy. This Tuesday, Republicans in Hawaii will have the chance to vote for a proven leader who has what it takes to put our country on the right path again. I support Mitt Romney for these reasons and encourage all Hawaii residents who are tired of the failed policies coming from Washington to support him this Tuesday."
