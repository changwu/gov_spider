    President Bush will welcome Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson for a meeting in the White House on December 3. Persson hosted the President in Sweden in June, and the President is delighted to welcome the Prime Minister to a return visit. The Swedish people have shown great sympathy and solidarity with America since the attack of September 11, and the Swedish government has taken a number of concrete steps to help in the war on terrorism. This visit will be an opportunity to review common efforts and to discuss the road ahead in this common challenge.
