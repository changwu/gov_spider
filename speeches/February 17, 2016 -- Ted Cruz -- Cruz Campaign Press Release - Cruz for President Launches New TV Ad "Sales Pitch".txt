    HOUSTON, Texas — Today the Cruz for President campaign launched a new TV ad, "Sales Pitch," highlighting Marco Rubio's hypocritical flip flop on granting amnesty to those here illegally. Rubio campaigned on the promise that he'd fight amnesty in Washington, D.C. and then immediately led the effort with Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer to pass the Gang of Eight amnesty bill. Rubio used talking points directly from the Democrats and President Obama in an effort to sell the bill. The ad will run statewide in South Carolina starting today through Saturday.

"Sales Pitch"
TV: 60
CRUZ: I'm Ted Cruz and I approved this message.
ANNC: When Marco Rubio ran for Senate, he promised:
RUBIO: "I will never support, never have, and never will, support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered or stayed in this country illegally."
ANNC: Then Rubio got to Washington and wrote the bill giving amnesty to illegals.
Using Obama's talking points to make his sales pitch:
RUBIO: "We know we have to deal with the 11 million people who are here illegally."
OBAMA: "We have to deal with the 11 million individuals who are here illegally."
OBAMA: "The bill that Senator Rubio... put forward, I think, is a great place to start."
WALLACE: "You are giving legal status to people who have broken the law."
RUBIO: "They still have to qualify for it, meaning..."
OBAMA: "Passing a background check."
RUBIO: "Passed a background check."
OBAMA: "Paying a penalty."
RUBIO: "Pay a fine."
OBAMA: "Paying taxes."
RUBIO: "Start paying taxes."
OBAMA: "It won't be a quick process."
RUBIO: "That is a long path."
OBAMA: "But it will be a fair process."
RUBIO: "But I do think it's fair."
ANNC: Marco Rubio burned us once. He shouldn't get the chance to sell us out again.
