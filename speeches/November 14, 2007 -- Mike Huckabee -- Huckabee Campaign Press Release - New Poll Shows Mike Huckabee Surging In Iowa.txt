    Little Rock, AR – Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee issued the following comment today in response to a new CBS/ New York Times poll showing him in second place and gaining ground among likely Republican voters in Iowa.
The poll, released earlier today, shows Gov. Huckabee gaining ground with 21 percent, beating all other GOP candidates in the field, with the exception of Mitt Romney.
"There's definitely growing momentum in Iowa and across the country as people are paying attention to my message. We're also seeing first hand why it's crucial for the Iowa caucuses to be first – Iowa Republicans are looking beyond my campaign budget and are relating to my values and where I stand on important issues," said Huckabee.
