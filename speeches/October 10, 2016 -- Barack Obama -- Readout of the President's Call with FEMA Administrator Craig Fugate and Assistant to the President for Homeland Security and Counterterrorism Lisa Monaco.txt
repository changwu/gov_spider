    The President spoke this morning by phone with FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate and Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Lisa Monaco to receive the latest update on the impacts from Hurricane Matthew and ongoing federal response efforts. Administrator Fugate noted that recovery efforts are under way in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina and response efforts continue in North Carolina, including thousands of water rescues supported by Federal responders and assets in North Carolina. Administrator Fugate stressed that continued flooding in the Carolinas will create dangerous and life-threatening conditions into coming days. The President reiterated that all necessary federal resources be directed to help these impacted states respond effectively to the storm. The President continues to stress that the response to the storm is far from over and the danger continues from flooding for the coming days, and urges those in the potential path of the flooding to continue to listen to local officials. The President also expressed that his thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of those who lost their lives from the storm, and for all those who have been affected. The President will continue to be regularly briefed on the response to Hurricane Matthew this week.
