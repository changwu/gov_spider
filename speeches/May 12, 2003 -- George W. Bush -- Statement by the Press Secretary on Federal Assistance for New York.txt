    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of New York and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the areas struck by an ice storm on April 3-5, 2003.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in the counties of Cayuga, Monroe, Oneida, Onondaga, Ontario, Oswego, Seneca, and Wayne.
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
Federal funding is available to State and eligible local governments on a cost-sharing basis for the repair or replacement of public facilities damaged by the ice storm in the counties of Cayuga, Chenango, Monroe, Oneida, Onondaga, Ontario, Oswego, Wayne, and Yates. Federal funding is also available on a cost-share basis for hazard mitigation measures.
Representing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Michael D. Brown, Undersecretary for Emergency Preparedness and Response, Department of Homeland Security, named Marianne Jackson as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The Agency said that damage surveys are continuing in other areas and additional counties may be added for assistance after the assessments are completed.
