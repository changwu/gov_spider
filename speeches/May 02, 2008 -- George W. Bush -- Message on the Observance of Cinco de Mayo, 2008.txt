    I send greetings to those celebrating Cinco de Mayo.
Cinco de Mayo is a joyful day in Mexican history and an important milestone in the history and an important milestone in the history of freedom. On May 5, 1862, an outnumbered band of Mexican soldiers defeated a large European power against overwhelming odds at the Battle of Puebla. Emboldened by victory and yearning for independence, Mexican patriots ultimately won independence on September 16, 1867. Today, we remember these heroic accomplishments and all those working to advance peace and liberty around the globe.
This holiday is also an opportunity to recognize the strong ties of family, economy, and culture that bind the United States and Mexico. Through a shared commitment to economic liberty and the universal right of freedom, the United States and Mexico continue to build a future of prosperity and opportunity for all people.
Laura and I send our best wishes. Que Dios los bendiga.
