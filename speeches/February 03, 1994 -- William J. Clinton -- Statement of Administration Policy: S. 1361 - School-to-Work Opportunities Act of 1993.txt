    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 2/4/94)(Senate)(Simon (D) IL and 24 others)
The Administration strongly supports S. 1361.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
S. 1361 would increase direct spending and receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary estimate is that the pay-as-you-go effect of the bill is zero.
