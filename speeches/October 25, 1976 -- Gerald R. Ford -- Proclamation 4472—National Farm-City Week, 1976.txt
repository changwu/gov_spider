  A Proclamation

As we near the end of our Bicentennial year, we have good cause to once again give thanks for the unique productivity of our farms and cities. While we are a nation of individuals--farmers and ranchers, and townspeople--we all work closely together to operate our economic and governmental system.
Our independence as a country for two centuries has been successful because our citizens have been successful working together. This is nowhere more apparent than in the continuing development of our agricultural and urban areas. Our farmers and ranchers are the greatest producers of food in the world. They do this through the help of the goods and services produced by those who have moved from farms to the cities.
It is clear that this continuing interdependence between farm and city should be more fully understood by all citizens, for it is through this partnership that the country may achieve new abundance and prosperity in the future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I. GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period November 19 through November 25, 1976, as National Farm-City Week.
I request that interested individuals in all pursuits join with agricultural organizations, business and labor groups, youth and community groups, schools, and others to focus attention upon the interrelationships which exist between individuals and their labors in our economic system.
I urge the Department of Agriculture, educational institutions and all organizations and governmental agencies and officials to mark the significance of National Farm-City Week with special study, public meetings, exhibits and other appropriate activity in the public interest.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and first.

GERALD R. FORD
