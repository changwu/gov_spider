    Today I am calling upon the Congress to bring to a swift and final conclusion efforts to enact a new job training bill for unemployed Americans. This important initiative will chart a new course for job training in America, providing real hope by serving as a handup, rather than a handout, to our disadvantaged citizens. Over a million Americans a year will receive training when this program begins.
Work on this legislation has just been completed by a joint Senate-House Conference, and I am hopeful that the Congress will act on it before recess so that it may go into effect as quickly as possible.
Several principles which I consider absolutely essential are at the core of this proposal. The delivery system for job training incorporates the block grant funding approach of our new federalism. The private sector will take the lead in planning and implementing programs. Some 70 cents on every Federal dollar is to be spent on training, and 30 cents will be spent on support services and administrative costs. And there will be no make-work public service employment.
I believe that by directing the highest possible percentage of Federal funds toward actual training and by emphasizing the roles of the States and the private sector, we can give participants the best chance of securing lasting, productive jobs in the private sector.
