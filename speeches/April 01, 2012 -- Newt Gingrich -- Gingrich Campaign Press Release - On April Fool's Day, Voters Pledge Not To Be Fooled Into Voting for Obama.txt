"President Obama ran on the inspiration of hope and change, but his presidency has been marked by hopelessly managing America's decay," said Joe DeSantis, Communications Director for Newt 2012. "Whether it was keeping unemployment below 8%, cutting the deficit in half, or bridging the partisan divide in Washington, President Obama's first term has been filled with broken promise after broken promise. The American people will not be fooled into giving this failed president a second term."
