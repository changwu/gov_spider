MITT ROMNEY: "And this is one of those times when Americans are going to have to look beyond themselves, look beyond themselves for their senior parents, look beyond themselves for their kids, the coming generations. Look into the future and see the debt that's being amassed and say, what is right for America? This is a time of big choices, of big consequence. It's a big election. The President keeps talking about smaller and smaller things. We keep talking about larger and larger things. That's why this movement is growing across the country, it's why it will sweep the nation. It's why we're going to win in November."
