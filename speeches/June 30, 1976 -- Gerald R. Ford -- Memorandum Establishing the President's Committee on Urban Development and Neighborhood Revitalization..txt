Subject: President's Committee on Urban Development and Neighborhood Revitalization
I am today establishing a Committee on Urban Development and Neighborhood Revitalization to examine urban problems and to make recommendations to improve current Federal programs in order to revitalize urban and neighborhood areas. The Committee will study the problems both from a broad Federal policy perspective and from the perspective of those who live in urban neighborhoods. Specifically, the Committee will be responsible for:
1. Conducting a comprehensive review of all major Federal programs which have an impact on the cities and their neighborhoods and reporting results to the President;
2. Seeking the perspectives of local officials and neighborhood groups on Federal programs which affect them;
3. Developing recommendations to the President and the Congress for changes in Federal policies and programs affecting cities and their neighborhoods in order to place maximum decision-making responsibility at the local level, to remove legal and administrative obstacles to exercise this authority, and to provide for better coordination and delivery of Federal programs.
The Committee will be chaired by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and include the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, the Secretary of Transportation, the Director of Office of Management and Budget, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, the Director of Community Services Administration, the Executive Director of the Domestic Council, the Assistant to the President for Public Liaison; and, by invitation, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
