    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that Bill McCoshen, former Campaign Manager and Chief of Staff for Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, has endorsed Mayor Giuliani for President. McCoshen will serve as Mayor Giuliani's Wisconsin State Co-Chair.
"Mayor Giuliani has demonstrated the qualities Wisconsin voters are looking for in a leader," said McCoshen. "Rudy has the executive experience of leading the country's largest city and the fiscal discipline that turned the City's deficit into a surplus by cutting taxes and ending wasteful government spending. He is a proven leader with a real record of results."
"Bill knows Wisconsin politics as well as anyone, and we are pleased to have him on our team," said Giuliani's Deputy National Political Director Rick Wiley. "Bill will help build our grassroots organization and increase our growing support throughout the state."
Former Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson serves as Rudy's National Campaign Co-Chair. McCoshen also joins Wisconsin State Chair and former U.S. Senator Robert Kasten and fellow State Co-Chairs and former Congressman Scott Klug and former State Senator Cathy Stepp.
