    Georgia Congressman Jack Kingston today endorsed Newt Gingrich for President of the United States, praising Newt's unparalleled track record of implementing the right policies to achieve the right results.
"Newt, I think, knows policy better than any of the other candidates," Rep. Kingston said in an interview with Politico. "At a time we need entitlement reform more than anything, he's a guy who's already done it."
Kingston also praised Gingrich's ability to connect with young voters, saying "He's always been able to connect with young people as a reformer."
