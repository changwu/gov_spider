    Alexandria, VA â€” Today, Lindsey Graham 2016 pre-qualified for the notoriously difficult Virginia Republican primary ballot, requiring each candidate to submit 5,000 signatures from Republican voters spread across the state's eleven congressional districts, as well as the Tennessee Republican primary ballot. Today's announcements come just a week after the Vermont State Republican Party confirmed that Graham gained access to the state's primary ballot.
Senator Graham will officially file over 7,500 signatures of Republican voters this week; the Republican Party of Virginia today pre-qualified those petitions. As of that filing, Graham 2016 will have qualified for all Republican ballots to date. Virginia is widely considered to be the most difficult state in the country to get on the ballot. In 2012, only two candidates - Mitt Romney and Ron Paul - successfully met the requirements and were listed on the state's ballot.
"Gaining access to the Virginia, Vermont and Tennessee Republican primary ballots marks an important milestone for our strong political organization throughout the country," said Senator Lindsey Graham. "I'm incredibly proud and grateful to our volunteers and staff for their efforts in the ballot access operation."
