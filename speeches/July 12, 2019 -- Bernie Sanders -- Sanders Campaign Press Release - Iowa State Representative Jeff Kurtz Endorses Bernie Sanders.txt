    DES MOINES â€“ Bernie 2020 in Iowa today announces their first endorsement from a State Legislator with Rep. Jeff Kurtz joining a slate of progressive leaders across Iowa. Rep. Kurtz House represents District 83 which includes Lee County and parts of Des Moines County.
"It's with great pleasure that I give my endorsement to Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States," said Rep. Jeff Kurtz. "Bernie has been consistent through his entire career on the issues that matter to the 99%. I am endorsing him because he doesn't just talk about the issues, he has worked to implement policies that ensure a strong middle class and protect our most vulnerable citizens here in Iowa."
"Rep. Kurtz is a progressive leader in the Iowa Democratic Party and our grassroots movement is happy to have his support," said Misty Rebik, Bernie 2020 Iowa State Director. "As a life-long union member, Rep. Kurtz understands the true working class values of the Democratic Party and we are proud to have a leader like him stand with us as we fight for the issues Iowans care about like Medicare for All, a $15 wage and a union no matter where you work."
Rep. Jeff Kurtz worked as an engineer with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET), a Teamsters-affiliated union, for 41 years. He was a union officer most of his career, including stints as BLET Local 391 President for eight years and Chairman of the BLET Iowa State Legislative Board for ten years. He resides in Ft. Madison, Iowa.
