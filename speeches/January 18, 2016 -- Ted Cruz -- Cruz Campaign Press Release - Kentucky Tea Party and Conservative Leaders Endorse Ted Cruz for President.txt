    HOUSTON, Texas â€” Today, the Cruz for President campaign announced its Kentucky State Leadership Team consisting of Tea Party and conservative leaders from across the Bluegrass State. Scott Hofstra, Marty Kares-Workman, Barbara Knott, and Boone County Constable Joe Kalil will serve as Kentucky Co-Chairs.
"From day one, Cruz has said we needed to coalesce conservatives around the country to get behind his campaign," said Hofstra. "And there is no better example of that than right here in Kentucky where the various Tea Party leaders have consolidated efforts to support Cruz. He is unapologetically conservative and routinely fights for the issues we care about most. That is the kind of consistent leadership we need in the White House to restore the rule of law, respect the Constitution, and end Obama's reign of lawlessness."
"Scott has brought together longtime conservative activists and members of the liberty community to organize for our campaign and get people out to caucus for our campaign on March 5th," Cruz said. "I deeply appreciate their support, along with the time and effort of so many to make us competitive in Kentucky."
