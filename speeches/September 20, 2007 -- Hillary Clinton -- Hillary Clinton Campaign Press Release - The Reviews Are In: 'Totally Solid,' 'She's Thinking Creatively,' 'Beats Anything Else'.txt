    SEIU PRESIDENT ANDY STERN -- A 'TOTALLY SOLID, THOUGHTFUL PLAN'[American Prospect blog, 9/19/07 ]
TIME MAGAZINE'S JOE KLEIN: 'CLEVER' IT IS JUST THE SORT OF BILL THAT MAY HAVE A CHANCE TO WORK': "Well, Hillary Clinton has now introduced Health Care 2.0, and -- lo and behold! -- it is a direct descendant of the plan she chose not to support in 1993. And with some clever consensus building, it is just the sort of bill that may have a chance to work." [Time, 9/20/07 ]
BOSTON GLOBE EDITORIAL - HILLARY'S PLAN '˜CONTAINED THE BEST OF HER 1993 INITIATIVE,' AVOIDS PITFALLS: "Hillary Clinton has learned from her gravest political mistake. The health plan she unveiled this week contained the best of her 1993 initiative - health insurance for all - while avoiding the government expansion that doomed the earlier plan." [Boston Globe, 9/20/07 ]
LA TIMES' RON BROWNSTEIN - HILLARY'S PLAN SHOWS 'SHE'S THINKING CREATIVELY ABOUT HOW TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF PARTISAN POLARIZATION': Hillary's plan shows "she's thinking creatively about how to break the cycle of partisan polarization that for nearly two decades has doomed every domestic initiative as far-reaching as her second try at ensuring healthcare for all." [Los Angeles Times, 9/19/07 ]
HARVARD PROFESSOR ROBERT BLENDON SAID THE PLAN IS 'WISE TO NARROW THE PLAN'S FOCUS TO THE UNINSURED AND SMALL BUSINESS NEEDS' [St. Petersburg Times, 9/19/07 ]
UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA PROFESSOR MARY FRANCES BERRY - '˜CLINTON IS BEING SMART' [NPR, 9/19/07]
HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY PROF. LAWRENCE LEVY - HILLARY'S PLAN SHOWS 'SHE UNDERSTANDS NOT ONLY THE ART OF THE POSSIBLE BUT THE VALUE OF THE PRAGMATIC': "But I will tell you Clinton's plan to cover every American is... adroitly good politics. Not only for her, but for a Democratic Party that still leaves many swing voters skeptical. And if its details survive scrutiny, it is good for a country where bold, ground-breaking ideas get headlines but only pragmatically leavened proposals become law. ...Clinton has shown she understands not only the art of the possible but the value of the pragmatic. In tailoring her proposal to fit the needs and finesse the concerns of suburban voters, Clinton has decided the way to victory - in the election and eventually in Congress - is down moderate Main Street."

GOOGLE CEO ERIC SCHMIDT ON HILLARY - SHE 'WAS ORGANIZED; SHE KNEW HER STUFF; SHE LISTENED CAREFULLY; SHE RESPONDED TO IDEAS': "For months, she has been meeting with business leaders one-on-one and in small groups to explore health-care issues. Many have come away impressed, including Eric Schmidt, chief executive of Google Inc. "She was organized; she knew her stuff; she listened carefully; she responded to ideas," he said."

NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES - 'ONE OF THE STANDOUT FEATURES OF THIS IS IT SPECIFICALLY LOOKS TO HELP SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, AND THAT'S A GOOD THING' [Wall Street Journal, 9/20/07]
WASHINGTON POST'S STEVEN PEARLSTEIN - HILLARY'S PLAN '˜BEATS ANYTHING ELSE OUT THERE FROM CANDIDATES OF EITHER PARTY': "Her reform agenda isn't perfect, but it sure beats anything else out there from candidates of either party in terms of addressing all the important issues and coming up with a policy framework that is internally consistent and realistic in both a financial sense and a political one." [Washington Post, 9/19/07 ]
M.I.T.'S JONATHAN GRUBER -- HILLARY'S PLAN IS 'EXCELLENT': "Jonathan Gruber, an economics professor at M.I.T. who helped create the lauded Massachusetts health care system (and who advised all of the leading Democrats on their health care plans), said he found the Clinton proposal to be 'excellent.' He said that it went further than the Obama plan in that it mandated universal coverage, and was more progressive than the Edwards campaign's in that it would end tax breaks on health-care benefits for wealth Americans that went beyond the baseline benefits provided by the federal system." [New York Observer, 9/18/07 ]
