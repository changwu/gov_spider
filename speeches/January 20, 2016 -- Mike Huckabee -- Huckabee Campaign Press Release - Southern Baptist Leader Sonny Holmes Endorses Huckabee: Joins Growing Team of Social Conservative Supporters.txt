DES MOINES, Iowa-Prominent pastor and former President of the South Carolina Southern Baptist Convention, Sonny Holmes, endorsed Gov. Mike Huckabee today.
"Values voters are sick of politicians who say one thing for votes and another for campaign contributions, and I'm proud to have the support of Sonny Holmes and Christian conservative leaders from across the country," said Gov. Huckabee.
Last week, Huckabee announced the first in a series of social conservative endorsements, including Dr. Tim LaHaye, minister and author of the New York Times best-selling Left Behind book series.
"It's time for some integrity. In the Scriptures, James says we should be doers of the Word and not just hearers. I want to support a candidate who has stood on-the-line in public office for his ideals. I'm past voting for blow-hards who talk their way into the hearts of the electorate. Mike Huckabee's politics are consistently driven by his Christian world view and there's no political speak clouding his positions on any of the issues," said Holmes.
"Huckabee is an articulate, pinpoint communicator who can connect with people across the demographic spread of the nation. He is passionate for the nation because he loves the nation," said Holmes.
"Before entering the political arena, Huckabee also pastored two Southern Baptist Churches. Perhaps its some pastoral hyperbole on my part, but anyone who can pastor two Baptist churches can function in Washington too. Just saying!" said Holmes.
