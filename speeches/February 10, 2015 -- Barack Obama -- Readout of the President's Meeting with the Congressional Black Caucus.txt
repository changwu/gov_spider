    This afternoon, President Obama met with Members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) at the White House, where they discussed a wide range of topics including the economy, criminal justice reform and trade. The President acknowledged the hard work and perseverance demonstrated by the CBC to address pressing issues important to communities around the country. He also underscored the need to build on the legislative gains accomplished over the past six years with the help of the CBC, and they collectively agreed that there is still more work to be done together in the final two years of his presidency. The President expressed that while we have seen continued economic progress, there is more work to do to help ensure that all Americans share in the benefits of our growth. He expressed shared concern with the CBC regarding the unemployment rate among African Americans and reaffirmed his commitment to support and create policies that will help all hardworking families make ends meet, while boosting America's productivity and giving workers the tools they need to secure the good jobs of the future.
The President also underscored the need to continue to work with Congress to reform the criminal justice system and the critical need to build trust between communities and law enforcement officials and highlighted the work he and his Administration are doing on this important issue. The President also discussed his trade agenda that would provide new opportunities for workers and support economic growth by opening markets, enforcing high-standards in our agreements, and leveling the playing field for our workers, and asked the CBC for their support. At the conclusion of the meeting, the President again thanked the CBC and said that he looks forward to continue working with them.
