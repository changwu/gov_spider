Kasich argues that he's the only Republican who can defeat Hillary Clinton in the November general election, and he's banking on the party coming to its senses at the national convention to be held in his home state in July.
Kasich— a nine-term congressman, onetime investment banker and two-term governor— has a real track record and meaningful political experience. That puts him out of step with Republican Party voters in thrall to Donald Trump's nativism and demagoguery, but positions Kasich well for the general election.
Kasich is a policy and social conservative with experience in balancing budgets and making political compromises. He would cut taxes for individuals and businesses; repeal Obamacare and expand Medicaid in its stead; and offer a path to legalization (but not citizenship) for 11.5 million illegal immigrants. He is not ready to write the obituary for American manufacturing and thinks retraining people for jobs that are in demand is the answer to unemployment.
