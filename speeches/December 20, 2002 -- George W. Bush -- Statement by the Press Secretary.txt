    President Bush will reschedule his January 2003 trip to Africa until later in the year due to a combination of domestic and international considerations. The President looks forward to visiting Africa in 2003 to continue building America's partnership with the continent and to sharing firsthand with African leaders his commitment to working on issues ranging from the war on terrorism to economic development.
