    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of Peggy Browning. Through her devotion to the law and determination in encouraging fair labor practices, Peggy contributed greatly to constructive and harmonious labor relations in this country. Her distinguished career was marked by compassion, good judgment, and, especially in recent months, courage. Her dedicated service will be sorely missed. Our prayers and sympathies are with her family at this time.
