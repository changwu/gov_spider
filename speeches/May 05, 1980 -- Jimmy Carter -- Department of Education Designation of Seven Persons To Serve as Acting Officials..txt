    The President has designated seven executive branch officials to serve in an "acting" capacity in Education Department positions. These are positions which require Senate confirmation and which have not been filled at this time. The designated officials will serve for 120 days or until the office is filled, whichever comes first. The seven officials are:
CYNTHIA G. BROWN, to be Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights. (The President has announced his intention to nominate Brown for this position.)
DANIEL B. DUNHAM, to be Assistant Secretary for Vocational and Adult Education. (The President has announced his intention to nominate Daniel B. Taylor for this position. Taylor cannot be appointed as Acting Assistant Secretary under this provision because he is not currently an executive branch official. Dunham is currently Deputy Commissioner for the Bureau of Occupational and Adult Education at the U.S. Office of Education. )
MARTHA E. KEYS, to be Assistant Secretary for Legislation. (The President today announced his intention to nominate Keys for this position.)
