He said when he came into office that that he was going to restore those jobs. ... 8.1% unemployment is an awful number." â€“ Tim Pawlenty

GOV. TIM PAWLENTY: "His message should be that he failed. And he shouldn't be deserving of reelection. In fact, he's not deserving of even continuing in the job at this point. He said when he came into office that that he was going to restore those jobs. He said it again on your clip. 8.1% unemployment is an awful number. That slight down tick from 8.2 to 8.1, Clayton, is because a bunch of people left the workforce. There was about 115,000 jobs added but 340,000 people, adults, left the workforce. The percent of adults who are not working or who are, have given up looking for work is at an all-time high. So, in other words, the percent of people who are in the workforce or actively looking for work is at a 30 year low. And that number that he is touting only went down a little because so many people gave up. He shouldn't be proud of that; he should be ashamed of that."
