    Chicago, IL -- U.S. Senator Barack Obama today released the following statement on the failed SCHIP Vote in the U.S. House of Representatives.
"Four million American children were denied basic health coverage today because Washington politicians failed to stand up to this President's disgraceful veto. At a time when we're spending billions of dollars on a war that never should've been authorized and giving billions in tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans, Washington's failure shows a callousness of priorities that is offensive to the ideals we hold as Americans.
When I am President, I will sign a universal health care bill into law by the end of my first term that will cover every American and cut costs more dramatically than any other plan offered by a candidate in this race. And I'll do it by bringing Republicans and Democrats together, like I did when I expanded health care for an additional 150,000 children and their parents as an Illinois state Senator."
