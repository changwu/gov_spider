    In 2016, Donald Trump promised Michiganders, "if I'm elected, you won't lose one plant." But since then, Michigan has been crushed by the President's failed leadership, with an unemployment rate that has more than doubled since February, and manufacturing jobs down sharply. With 4 days until Election Day, working families in Michigan are hurting. More than 167,000 Michiganders have tested positive for COVID-19, cases are on the rise, and hundreds of thousands of Michiganders are out of work. And yet President Trump is only offering more lies and distractions â€” not a plan to get the virus under control or to create good-paying, middle-class jobs.
With their votes, Michiganders can turn the page on President Trump's failures. Together, we will unite our nation so that we can get control of this virus, ensure access to affordable health care for all Americans, and build our economy back better.
