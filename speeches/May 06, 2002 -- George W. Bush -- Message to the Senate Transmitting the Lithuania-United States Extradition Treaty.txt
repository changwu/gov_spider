    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Lithuania, signed at Vilnius on October 23, 2001.
In addition, I transmit for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. As the report explains, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.
The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content of modern extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States and will replace the Extradition Treaty of April 9, 1924, between the two countries and the Supplementary Extradition Treaty of May 17, 1934. In conjunction with the new U.S.-Lithuania Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty that took effect in 1999, the Treaty will, upon entry into force, enhance cooperation between the law enforcement communities of the two countries. It will thereby make a significant contribution to international law enforcement efforts against serious offenses, including terrorism, organized crime, and drug-trafficking offenses.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
