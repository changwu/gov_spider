    "As Joe Biden and the socialist Democrats fight to turn our country into the next Cuba or Venezuela, President Trump is defending the principles that make our country great. This President stands proudly with our nation's Latinos and has made increasing access to educational and economic opportunities a priority, delivering the lowest rates of unemployment and poverty for Hispanic Americans ever recorded. The White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative is yet another example of President Trump's bold leadership, ensuring Hispanic Americans can continue to thrive and achieve the American Dream.
"As the proud daughter of Cuban immigrants, I have personally witnessed the importance of economic opportunity and a quality education, and the impact they can have on Hispanic communities and families like mine. In stark contrast, too many Hispanic Americans have seen firsthand the destruction and devastation that Joe Biden's socialist ideology has inflicted on countries across Latin America. Biden's record of failing the Hispanic community and turning a blind eye to hostile, foreign dictators is a direct threat to American democracy, freedom, and the very opportunities President Trump has ensured for our communities. "
