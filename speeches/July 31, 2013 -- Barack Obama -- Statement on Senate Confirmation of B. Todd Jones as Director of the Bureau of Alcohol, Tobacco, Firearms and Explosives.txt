    Todd Jones is a tough and tested law enforcement professional with decades of experience, and his confirmation to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is both welcome and long overdue. For nearly 7 years, Senate Republicans had refused to confirm an ATF Director, not because they thought the nominees weren't qualified, but because they put politics ahead of the agency's law enforcement mission.
I applaud Senator Reid, Senator Leahy, Senator Klobuchar, and the bipartisan group of Senators who broke through that gridlock to give Todd Jones the up-or-down vote he deserved. But while Todd's confirmation will help ATF apply the tools it needs to protect our communities from dangerous criminals and reduce gun violence, we can't stop there. I will continue to stand with the majority of Americans who support commonsense reforms to keep dangerous weapons out of the hands of criminals. And I will continue to do everything in my power to keep our children and our communities safe.
