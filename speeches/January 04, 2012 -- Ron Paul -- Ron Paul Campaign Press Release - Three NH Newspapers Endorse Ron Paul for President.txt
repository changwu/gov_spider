CONCORD, NH - The Littleton Courier, Berlin Reporter, and Coos County Democrat all announced today their endorsements of 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul.
The endorsements come on the heels of the 12-term Congressman from Texas's strong top-three finish in the Iowa Caucus giving one of two viable tickets out of the Hawkeye State.
"Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has been in the lead for months," wrote the editors, "but voters still seem desperate for an alternative â€” there's always another candidate pulling stronger or almost as strong numbers in the polls. Voters have lost faith in Obama, but they are not sold on Romney to replace him."
Congressman Ron Paul, however, "has never voted to raise a tax and voted against all of the bailouts that have riled up Tea Partiers and Occupy Wall Streeters alike," they continued. "His prediction that the United States can no longer afford the economic cost of our overseas commitments makes many Republicans uncomfortable, possibly by the very truth of the assertion. For decades he has been that rare sort of politician who speaks what he believes to be the truth and doesn't flutter in the wind of public opinion. That could not be said of Obama or Romney.
"Powerful leaders like Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan change the political landscape," the editors concluded. "This is what Ron Paul would do for our country and why we support him."
