  A Proclamation

The provision of a home and a suitable living environment for every American family continues to be a national housing goal. Homeownership and decent housing instill pride in our citizens and contribute to the vitality of communities throughout America.
The resurgence of America's housing industry is both a contribution to and a result of our Nation's economic recovery. The substantial increase in housing starts in 1983, by restoring and creating thousands of jobs in housing and related industries, has been a major factor in the reduction of unemployment.
In recognition of our Nation's commitment to housing and homeownership and the role that housing plays in economic recovery, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 98, has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the week of October 2 through October 9, 1983, as "National Housing Week."
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning October 2, 1983, as National Housing Week, and call upon the people of the United States and interested groups and organizations to observe this week with appropriate activities and events.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.

RONALD REAGAN
