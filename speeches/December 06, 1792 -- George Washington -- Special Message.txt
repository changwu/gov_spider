    Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:
The several measures which have been pursued to induce the hostile Indian tribes north of the Ohio to enter into a conference or treaty with the United States at which all causes of difference might be fully understood and justly and amicably arranged have already been submitted to both Houses of Congress.
The papers herewith sent will inform you of the result.
GO. WASHINGTON.
