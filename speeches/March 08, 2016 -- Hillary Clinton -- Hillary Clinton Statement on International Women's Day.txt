    Hillary Clinton released the following statement on International Women's Day:
"On International Women's Day, we celebrate women around the world, in all stations of life – mothers, daughters, grandmothers, teachers, doctors, soldiers, artists, workers, employers, leaders of all kinds. We celebrate their achievements and their humanity. We celebrate the progress we've made to advance the full participation of women in economies and societies. And most importantly, we recommit to finishing the unfinished work that remains, and ensuring that women and girls are treated as the full and equal human beings they are.
"Advancing the status of women is not just the right thing to do; it's the smart thing to do. When women and girls participate fully, economies grow and nations are more secure. When their rights are denied, the opposite happens. No country can get ahead if half its people are left behind.
"I've spent my career working to break down barriers that hold back women here at home and around the world. As President, I will keep up the fight. I'll fight to close the pay gap; make paid family leave a reality; ensure families have access to quality, affordable child care; increase the minimum wage; protect women's health and reproductive rights; confront violence against women; and promote women's rights around the globe. These issues ought to be core priorities of our government. They are not just "women's issues"—they are family issues, economic issues, and they're crucial to America's competitiveness and security.
"This International Women's Day, let's take a page from the generations of women leaders around the world who never stopped working to make our world a better, more equitable place. And let's always remember that women's rights are human rights, and human rights are women's rights, once and for all."
