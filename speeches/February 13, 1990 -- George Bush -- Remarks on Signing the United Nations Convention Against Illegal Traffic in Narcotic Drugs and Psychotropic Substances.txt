    Well, I'm pleased today to sign the United States instrument of ratification for the U.N. Convention Against Illegal Drugs. In doing so is a key international goal of our initial drug strategy way back last September. And this important convention lays down clear norms for all nations to criminalize the production, cultivation, and trafficking in the drugs that are poisoning our kids: cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and other dangerous drugs. It calls for outlawing money-laundering and controlling essential and precursor chemicals, the chemical tools for producing the illicit drugs. And it provides for the seizure of drug-tainted assets, the extradition of drug traffickers, and other important measures of international cooperation.
This convention helps equip the international community with the coherent, tough legal authority to stop the flow of illicit drugs. And it says something very important -- sends a message -- and that is that this scourge will stop. And we will stop the criminals that deal drugs, and we'll take back the streets.
As we continue preparations for the Andean drug summit and on the eve of the U.N. General Assembly, I'd like to urge all nations to join the United States in ratifying this United Nations convention, to join us in working together to rid the world of this menace -- the menace from drugs. And now I'll sign the documents.
Thank you all very much. Thank you.
