    I send greetings to those celebrating Labor Day 2007.
Our country's economy is built on the hard work and ingenuity of the American people. There is no limit to what our citizens can accomplish when they have the skills to compete and the freedom to achieve their dreams. Through vision and determination, American workers are transforming their neighborhoods, strengthening our economy, and realizing the great promise of our Nation.
Today, productivity is high, consumers are confident, and incomes are rising across our country. Our economy has experienced one of the fastest growth rates of any major industrialized nation. More than 8.3 million jobs have been created in America since August 2003, and the unemployment rate remains low. My Administration is committed to promoting progrowth economic policies, keeping taxes low, and supporting small businesses to keep our economy strong and growing.
On Labor Day, we honor the hard work and dedication of the men and women of our workforce. Their efforts contribute to the prosperity of our great Nation.
Laura and I send our best wishes.
GEORGE W. BUSH
