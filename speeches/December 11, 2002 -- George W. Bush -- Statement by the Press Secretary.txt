    President Bush today signed an Executive Order establishing the President's Commission on the United States Postal Service. This nine-member, bipartisan commission will identify the operational, structural, and financial challenges facing the Postal Service in the 21st Century, examine potential solutions, and recommend legislative and administrative steps to ensure the long-term viability of postal service in the United States.
The Postal Service faces significant technological, competitive, financial and security challenges in the 21st Century. Because the Postal Service touches every American and plays a crucial role in a $900 billion domestic mail industry, we cannot afford to ignore these challenges. The Commission will bring together nine highly skilled individuals from diverse backgrounds, including business, academia and labor, to take a fresh look at the problems facing the Postal Service and make recommendations about how to resolve them.
