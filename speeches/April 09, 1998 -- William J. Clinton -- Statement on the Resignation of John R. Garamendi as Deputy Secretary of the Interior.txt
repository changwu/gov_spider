    It is with regret that I accept the resignation of John Garamendi as Deputy Secretary of the Interior.
For almost 3 years, John has been a very important member of my administration and has successfully handled some of the toughest and most complicated issues in one of the largest and most important agencies in the Federal Government. From California water issues to the protection of Headwaters redwoods, John's ability to find common ground and creative solutions has been a great asset.
I wish him the best for the future.
