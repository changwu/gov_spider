    This morning the President held a brief meeting with the NASA Administrator, Dr. James Fletcher. The meeting was held to follow up on the recent report by the President's Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident. The President has completed a review of the Rogers commission report and believes that their recommendations should be implemented.
The changes suggested in the report are essential to resuming effective and efficient space transportation system operations and will be crucial to restoring full operational status once again. Dr. Fletcher has been asked by the President to report back in 30 days with a plan for implementing the Commission's recommendations and establish milestones measuring progress in that process.
