My dear Mr. Brundage:
When the young men and women from the nations of the world assemble at the opening of the Games of the Tenth Olympiad in Los Angeles in August of 1932 it will be expected by all Americans that their teams will be represented with full strength and be of the best in character and ability to perform that we have to offer.
To gather together, train, coach and present for competition five hundred of the youth of our land needs both organization and money. It is especially gratifying to note that now as always America's participation is to be financed by voluntary gifts, thus being an expression of good will and cooperation on the part of our generous and sport loving general public.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
