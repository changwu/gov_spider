    On November 14, 1979, by Executive Order No. 12170, the President declared a national emergency to deal with the threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States constituted by the situation in Iran. Notices of the continuation of the national emergency were transmitted by the President to the Congress and the Federal Register on November 12, 1980, November 12, 1981, and November 8, 1982. Because our relations with Iran have not yet been normalized and the process of implementing the January 19, 1981 agreements with Iran is still underway, the national emergency declared November 14, 1979 must continue in effect beyond November 14, 1983. Therefore, pursuant to section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am so continuing the national emergency with respect to Iran declared on November 14, 1979. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.
