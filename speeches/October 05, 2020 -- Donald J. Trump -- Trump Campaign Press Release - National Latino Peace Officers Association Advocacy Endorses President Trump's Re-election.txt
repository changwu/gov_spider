    As a result of the Presidentâ€™s steadfast commitment to law and order, the National Latino Peace Officers Association Advocacy (NLPOA-Advocacy) released a letter endorsing President Donald J. Trump for re-election.
Whether it's left-wing rioters wreaking havoc on communities across America or the Democrats' mission to open our borders to even the most violent criminals, Joe Biden is too weak to stand up to the radicals of his own party and protect the American people. In stark contrast, President Trump prioritizes safety and stability for all Americans and will always back our brave law enforcement officers. In the endorsement letter, the National Latino Peace Officers Association Advocacy stated:
"The NLPOA-Advocacy supports you because of your fierce and unwavering support for the law enforcement community. In these difficult times for our profession and the repeated calls to defund us, you have continued to have our backs and voice your approval of the men and women of law enforcement. The NLPOAA looks forward to working with you in the future on issues regarding law enforcement, immigration, and issues concerning the Latino community."
