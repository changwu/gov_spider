    Congresswoman Michele Bachmann supports enforcement of America's immigration laws and opposes efforts like the DREAM Act (Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors) to provide in-state college tuition to illegal immigrants.
In 2001, Governor Rick Perry signed legislation making Texas the first state to offer in-state tuition to illegal immigrants:
Rick Perry has supported Texas versions of the DREAM Act (Miami Herald, 9/2/2011: http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/09/02/2388089/romney-takes-tough-line-on-immigration.html#ixzz1WuYmSS1P )
"Undocumented immigrants who graduate from Texas high schools and have lived in the state at least three years can now pay resident tuition at state colleges and universities. A law, signed Saturday by Gov. Rick Perry, targets all such students who came to Texas illegally as children but who have not become legal permanent residents. It is believed to be the first such legislation in the United States, but similar laws are being considered in other states, including California." (Dane Schiller, "College Law Benefits Immigrants," San Antonio Express-News, 6/20/2001)
The Mexican Government Praised Perry For Signing The Legislation.
"Mexico's government on Monday praised a new Texas law that allows undocumented immigrants who attended Texas high schools to pay in-state tuition at state universities." ("Mexico Praises Texas Bill To Allow Immigrants To Attend University," The Associated Press, 6/19/2001)
Conservative talk radio icon Mark Levin recently criticized Rick Perry for his stand on illegal immigration:
"But the more interesting part was in the middle where Perry affirms his continued support for allowing illegal immigrants in Texas to get instate tuition. . . . I disagree with him on the issue. I just can't get past the point of the law." (Mark Levin Show, 9/1/2011)
