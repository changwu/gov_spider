HOUSTON, Texas — Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today announced the endorsement of Twila Paris, Christian songwriter and accomplished recording artist.
"I am supporting Ted Cruz for President because he understands why America has been great — precisely because of our founding principles," Paris said. "He has devoted his life to defending those principles, and I believe that as president he will continue to uphold the essential ideas that uphold this nation. I admire Ted Cruz's unwavering stand for what is true and right and his gentle response in the face of relentless, unfounded attacks. Grace and wisdom under pressure are things we desperately need in a president. I voted for Ronald Reagan, and I look forward to voting for Ted Cruz – he is a leader we have been praying for."
Twila Paris recorded her first album as a 20-year-old in 1981, the same year Ronald Reagan took the oath of office to become the 40th President of the United States. She went on to record 22 albums, 33 number one hits, and numerous Dove Awards, including three awards for Female Vocalist of the Year. In 2012, she released a patriotic-themed compilation.
Paris' music has sold over 1.3 million albums. She is the author of such well-known worship singles as He Is Exalted, Lamb of God, Prince of Peace, and How Beautiful. In 2015, she was inducted into the Gospel Music Association Hall of Fame. She continues to write and record while homeschooling her son.
"Heidi and I are grateful for Twila's support," Cruz said. "Her music and her message have inspired people of faith all over the world, reminding us what the Lord has done and how great our Savior is. Twila represents millions of Americans who are looking for a president who will reignite the promise of America. We are honored to earn their trust and their votes."
