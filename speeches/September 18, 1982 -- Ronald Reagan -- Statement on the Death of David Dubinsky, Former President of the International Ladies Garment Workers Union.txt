    As an honored veteran of the trade union movement, David Dubinsky earned the respect of employers and employees alike. A man of courage, vision, and integrity, he was a staunch foe of injustice whether its source was foreign or domestic, and he fought long and successfully to cleanse the American labor movement of both internal corruption and subversion by alien ideologies. In a long life, David Dubinsky served his adopted land with energy, dedication, and total loyalty. His passing will be mourned by all Americans who cherish the values of honesty, patriotism, and social justice.
