    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Sponsor: Whitten (D), Mississippi)
The Administration believes that providing for the operation of the government through continuing resolutions is an undesirable practice. If a continuing resolution is unavoidable, however, the Administration believes that it should be free of extraneous provisions and, consistent with the President's freeze proposal, provide funding at the lower of House, Senate or current rate. H.J. Res. 553 meets this test.
The Administration has no objection to passage of H.J. Res. 553, which would provide for the continuation of normal government operations through October 5, 1992.
The Administration supports Representative Solomon's effort to secure a separate up or down vote on the line-item veto in the 102nd Congress. The President's support for the line-item veto is clear.
