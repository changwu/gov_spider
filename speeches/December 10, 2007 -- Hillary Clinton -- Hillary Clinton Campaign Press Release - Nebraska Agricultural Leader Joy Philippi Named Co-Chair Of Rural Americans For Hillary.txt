    The Clinton Campaign today named Joy Philippi of Bruning a Co-Chair of Rural Americans for Hillary.
"Hillary's record of fighting for the farmers and rural families of upstate New York and her deep understanding of the challenges facing family farms make her the clear choice for our community," Philippi said. "She has the strength and experience to bring the real change rural America needs."
Philippi is a fourth generation Nebraska farmer and operates a family farm with her parents, producing corn, soybeans and pork. She is the immediate past president of the National Pork Producers Council.
A staunch advocate for agricultural production and rural development, Philippi was named a "2006 Advocate for Agriculture" by the Nebraska Agribusiness Club. She has served for several years on the Nebraska Rural Rehabilitation Committee of the Nebraska Department of Agriculture and has represented farmers on international trade missions.
"I am honored to have Joy's support, and delighted that she'll play a leading role in my campaign in Nebraska and nationally," Clinton said.
