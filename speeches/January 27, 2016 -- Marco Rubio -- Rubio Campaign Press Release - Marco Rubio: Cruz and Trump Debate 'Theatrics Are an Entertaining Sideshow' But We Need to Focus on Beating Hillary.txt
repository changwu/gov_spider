America is heading in the wrong direction, and people are right to be angry about it. But it's not enough just to be angry. The next President has to have a real plan to turn the page on Obama and his disastrous policies, and they have to be willing and able to sell that plan to the American people. That's why these debates are so important.
These kinds of theatrics by Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are an entertaining sideshow, but they have nothing to do with defeating Hillary Clinton. I'm going to stay focused on uniting the Republican Party so we can defeat Hillary Clinton and turn the page on eight years of liberal failure. We don't have time for these kinds of distractions.
Marco will be participating in the debate, which will be held in Des Moines, Iowa ahead of Monday's caucuses.
