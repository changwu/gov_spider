    In electing Sandra Feldman president, the American Federation of Teachers has chosen someone who has already proven herself as a dynamic leader and superb educator. I've visited schools with her in New York and have seen first-hand the respect that teachers and students have for her. I share that respect.
Like her predecessor, Al Shanker, Sandra Feldman is an outstanding advocate for our Nation's students. I look forward to working with her on a variety of issues that will improve the quality of education our children receive, including making high standards a reality in every American public school.
