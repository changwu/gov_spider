    I ASKED Judge Kee and Secretary Acheson to meet with me this morning in order that I might canvass in a general way the overall situation on foreign policy legislation and at the same time express to Chairman Kee my appreciation for the arduous effort that he and the House Foreign Affairs Committee have been putting forth since the beginning of the session in considering the multitude of foreign policy measures that require the Committee's attention.
The Foreign Affairs Committee has been in almost continuous session since the first of the year and present indications are that there will be no respite from their toil for several more weeks. I thought it appropriate that I let Judge Kee know I am both cognizant and appreciative of the burden that he and his Committee are bearing.
