    Floyd County minister cites Dr. Paul's prolife stance and defense of traditional marriage in Congress
ANKENY, Iowa â€” 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul received the endorsement of Glen E. Bandel, Pastor of the Nora Springs Christian Church, located in Floyd County.
"I am giving my support to Ron Paul as he seeks to be the next President of the United States. Dr. Paul has shown his support of life for all unborn and to all living to old age. He is only for marriage of one man and one woman and would enforce the federal Defense of Marriage Act," said Pastor Bandel.
"Dr. Paul has the best foreign policy of any candidate seeking the office, namely one that ends interfering in the business of other countries, brings our soldiers home to protect our country, and pays our domestic debts using money we currently send around the world," said Bandel.
Pastor Bandel added that, in making his endorsement, he was acting as a private citizen and not necessarily speaking on behalf of Nora Springs Christian Church congregants.
"We appreciate Pastor Bandel's endorsement, as it adds to the growing number of religious, civic, and political leaders whose endorsement brings us closer to a strong top-three caucus finish," said Ron Paul 2012 Iowa Chairman Drew Ivers.
Mike Heath, Iowa State Director for the Ron Paul 2012 campaign, is visiting Christian churches across Iowa to do outreach and discuss Ron Paul's candidacy. To date, Heath has visited 256 houses of worship across the state toward that end. Heath is an ordained Christian minister.
If ministering in Iowa, local pastors interested in discussing an endorsement are invited to email the Iowa Director of Voter Outreach, Meghann Walker, at meghannw@ronpaul2012.com.
