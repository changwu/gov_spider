In-town pool report #3
White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere passes the following along:
Today, President Donald J. Trump participated in a call with thousands of State, local, and tribal officials to thank them for their partnership to respond to and mitigate COVID-19. The President and several other Federal leaders also underscored the Administration's commitment to empowering all levels of government to effectively respond to COVID-19. Senior officials from the Departments of Treasury, Health and Human Services, Education, Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Justice, and Transportation joined the discussion about the unprecedented communications, resources, and flexibilities that the Federal Government has provided to State, local, and tribal leaders to meet this shared challenge, which calls for solutions from every level of government. Federal officials also provided agency-specific updates on implementation of the unprecedented economic relief in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Since January 2020, the TrumpAdministration has held nearly 120 briefings with more than 60,000 State, local, and tribal leaders in every State and territory in the Nation.

In-town pool report #7 -- briefing concludes and lid
The briefing concluded at 7:30pm. Your pooler forgot to send a note mid-briefing when POTUS left, but my math tells me it was at approximately 6:40 pm.
