    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the Protocol Amending the Convention Between the United States of America and Canada with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Signed at Washington on September 26, 1980, as amended by the Protocols signed on June 14, 1983, and March 28, 1984, signed at Washington August 31, 1994. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol.
The Protocol further amends the Convention to reflect changes in U.S. and Canadian law and treaty policy and to make certain technical corrections to the existing Convention that are necessary because of the passage of time. It also improves the operation of the Convention and facilitates the flow of capital and technology between the United States and Canada.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, September 14, 1994.
