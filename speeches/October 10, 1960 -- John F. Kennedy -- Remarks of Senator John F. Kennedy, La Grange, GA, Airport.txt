    Senator KENNEDY. Distinguished guests, ladies, and gentlemen, I want to take this opportunity to thank you for a great Georgia reception. I must say you held out the hand of friendship, and I appreciate it very much, indeed, especially your coming to see us off. Georgia has much to be proud of, and among those things is the fact that in this ce ntury you did not vote for McKinley, and Georgia did not vote for Harding and Georgia did not vote for Coolidge, and Georgia did not vote for Hoover, and Georgia did not vote for Landon, Dewey, and I don't think in 1960 it is going to vote for Mr. Nixon. [Applause.]
In this century Georgia voted for Woodrow Wilson, and it voted for Franklin Roosevelt, and it voted for Harry Truman. [Applause.] And I believe as long as there are farmers who do not have the means of living off their land, as long as there are textile workers working 2 or 3 or 4 days a week, as long as there are older people who do not have the means of maintaining themselves and protecting their health, as long as there are people looking for work and can't find it, as long as there are natural resources that must be developed, as long as there is need for a stronger America, so long will there be need for the Democratic Party, and so long will Georgia stand with the Democratic Party. [Applause.]
We now say goodby, but I want you to know that we take you with us. Thank you. [Applause.]
