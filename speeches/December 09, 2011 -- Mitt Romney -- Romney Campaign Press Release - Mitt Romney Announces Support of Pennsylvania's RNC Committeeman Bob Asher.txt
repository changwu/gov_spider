    Mitt Romney today announced the support of RNC Committeeman for Pennsylvania Bob Asher.
"I'm happy to earn the support of Bob Asher," said Mitt Romney. "Throughout his time in Pennsylvania politics, Bob has fought for conservative principles like cutting taxes, growing our economy, and making sure we give all Americans the opportunity to succeed. In the months to come, I look forward to working with Bob to spread my message of job creation through a â€˜Simpler, Smaller, and Smarter' federal government."
"I am proud to support Mitt Romney for President," said RNC Committeeman Bob Asher. "For the last three years, the middle class has shrunk due to President Obama's rampant government spending and burdensome regulations that inhibit small businesses. The American people need someone in Washington who knows how the real world works. Mitt Romney has spent his life as a conservative businessman and he's the candidate we need to turn around this country."
