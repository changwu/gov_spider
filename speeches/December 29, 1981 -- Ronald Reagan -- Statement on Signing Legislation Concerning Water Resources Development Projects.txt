    I have before me today two enrolled enactments: H.R. 779, an Act "To authorize the Secretary of the Army to contract with the Tarrant County Water Control and Improvement District Numbered 1 and the City of Weatherford, Texas, for the use of water supply storage in Renbrook Lake, and for other purposes," and S. 1493, an Act "To deauthorize several projects within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers."
These two bills are linked together by the fact that they both contain similar, though not identical, provisions dealing with removal of certain structures at water resources development projects administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Inadvertently, one of the provisions, section 8 of S. 1493, as enrolled, is broader than its sponsors intended. Because of this, the Congress passed another, somewhat narrower provision in the form of section 6 of H.R. 779. It is clear from statements on the floor of both the House and Senate that the narrower provision, section 6 of H.R. 779, was intended to govern the Corps management practices. Therefore, in order to accomplish that intent, I will sign enrolled enactment S. 1493 before I sign H.R. 779, thereby making section 6 of H.R. 779 the provision to govern Corps management practices.
