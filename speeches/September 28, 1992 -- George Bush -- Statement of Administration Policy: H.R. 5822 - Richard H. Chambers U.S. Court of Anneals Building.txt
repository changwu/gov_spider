    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Moorhead (R) California and Roybal (D) California)
The Administration opposes H.R. 5822 because it inappropriately would name a Federal courthouse after a sitting judge. The Administration does not question the distinguished nature of the career of Judge Chambers, who is a judge in senior status on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. However, the Administration is concerned about the impression that might be conveyed to the public if a judge were to hear cases in a courthouse building named after him or her.
