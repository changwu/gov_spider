    We mourn the passing of Lieutenant General Calvin A.H. Waller, U.S. Army (Ret.), whose dedicated and exceptional career is admired by everyone who knew of his extraordinary courage, inspiring leadership, and selfless service. During a distinguished career which culminated in his service as Deputy Commander of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Storm, General Waller achieved prominence as a skillful and disciplined professional and a caring, enthusiastic commander. His rise from humble beginnings to one of the highest-ranking African-American officers in the U.S. military through stalwart determination and a record of excellence served as an inspiration to minority and nonminority officers. To General Waller's wife, Marion, his family and friends, and to the Army community, I extend my deepest sympathy. He will be remembered as one of America's finest soldiers and most capable military leaders.
