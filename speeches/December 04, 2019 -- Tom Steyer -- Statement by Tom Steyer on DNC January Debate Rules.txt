    (SAN FRANCISCO, December 4, 2019) — Today, Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer released the statement below — in anticipation of the release of the January debate rules — calling on the Democratic National Committee to ensure future debates include a wider field of candidates:
"Today, I'm calling on the DNC to open up the debate requirements for January so that more candidates can participate. One of the strengths of the Democratic Party is that it represents every community in our great nation. In order to defeat Donald Trump, Democrats need to engage voters from every part of the country, and that means making sure voters hear from a diverse group of candidates before they select our nominee. I know the party shares this goal, and I hope they'll give voters one more opportunity to hear from more candidates before they cast ballots. This is more important than any one campaign — this is about finding the best candidate to represent our party and lead our country forward."
