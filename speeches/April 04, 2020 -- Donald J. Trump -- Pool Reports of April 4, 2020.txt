Pool Report No. 1
Good afternoon from the White House. I'm your print pooler today.
It's a beautiful day here in Washington – 57 degrees, with the sun trying to peak out from the clouds.
The president is participating in a phone call with the Major League Commissioners at 12 p.m. – it is closed press. I'll let you know if that changes.
Today's briefing will be held at 3:30 p.m. Please shoot your questions my way and I'll try to get to them.
