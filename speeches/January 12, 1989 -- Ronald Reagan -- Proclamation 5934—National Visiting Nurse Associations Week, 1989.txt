  A Proclamation

The Visiting Nurse Associations of America have served homebound Americans since 1885 by offering excellent personalized home health care and support services in urban and rural communities.
These voluntary, independently operated Associations supply a wide range of services, including nursing care by registered nurses; homemaking, therapy, and social services by qualified specialists; friendly visiting services; and many other forms of assistance provided by volunteers in each community served by an Association.
The care provided by the Associations enables hundreds of thousands of Americans to recover from illnesses and injury in the comfort and security of their homes, regardless of their ability to pay. Thousands of patients with mental or physical handicaps or with chronically disabling illnesses would be unable to remain at home without the therapeutic benefits of the Associations' care and support services.
The Congress, by Public Law 100-493, has designated the week of February 19 through February 25, 1989, as "National Visiting Nurse Associations Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of February 19 through February 25, 1989, as National Visiting Nurse Associations Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities in appreciation of the important contributions of Visiting Nurse Associations to American life.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirteenth.

RONALD REAGAN
