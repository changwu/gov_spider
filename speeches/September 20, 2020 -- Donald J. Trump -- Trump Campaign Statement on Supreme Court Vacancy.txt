    "When there's a Supreme Court vacancy, the President selects a nominee and the Senate provides advice and consent. That's what the Constitution says and those are the only rules. There has been an open seat on the Supreme Court in a presidential election year 29 times in American history, and in every single case the president has nominated a candidate. Voters elected Donald J. Trump president in 2016 and gave Republicans an expanded majority in 2018, so the people already have spoken. The President has placed two well-qualified justices on the court so far and he is about to select a third. Americans can see the names on his list of potential nominees, while Joe Biden is hiding his list of people he would consider if he were president. Biden knows that he is an empty vessel for the radical left and that's why he's refusing to be honest with the American people about who he would want on the court. But make no mistake about this: The President has been clear that he will nominate a woman to fill that seat and the Senate should vote to confirm her."
- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
