    ONE of America's greatest heroes is dead.
General of the Army Douglas MacArthur fought his last fight with all the valor that distinguished him in war and peace.
I have given instructions that he be buried with all the honors a grateful nation can bestow on a departed hero.
But in the hearts of his countrymen and in the pages of history his courageous presence among us and his valiant deeds for us will never die.
At a time of increasing complexity, where ancient virtues are obscured by the rush of events and knowledge, his life has reminded us that the enduring strength of America rests on its capacity for such simple qualities of integrity and loyalty; honor and duty.
For the man that he was and the success he achieved, this Nation gives thanks to God for the 84 years he lived and served.
May his devoted wife and his young son know that on behalf of a grateful nation, Mrs. Johnson and I pray for God's grace on this great soldier and patriot.
