  A Proclamation

Since it was established in 1916, the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (Junior ROTC) has assisted in shaping the character and moral values of hundreds of thousands of high school students throughout the country. Participation in the High School Reserve Officer Training Corps has helped four generations of American young people to grow in self-discipline and responsibility, as well as awareness of the duties of citizenship in a democratic society.
With its emphasis on leadership, teamwork, individual initiative, civic pride, and respect for the United States, this program contributes substantially to the strength of our country and to the personal development of the high school students who participate.
To encourage the American people to learn more about the benefits of Junior ROTC and its many contributions to the Nation, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 58, has designated May 17, 1989, the seventy-third anniversary of the ROTC program's creation, as "High School Reserve Officer Training Corps Recognition Day," and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies ands activities.
Now, Therefore, I, George Bush, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 17, 1989, as High School Reserve Officer Training Corps Recognition Day. I call upon all Americans to participate in appropriate ceremonies and events and become actively involved with their local high school ROTC programs.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirteenth.

GEORGE BUSH
