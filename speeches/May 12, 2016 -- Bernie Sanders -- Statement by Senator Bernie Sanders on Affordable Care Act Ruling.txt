    PINE RIDGE, S.D. - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday released the following statement after a federal judge issued a ruling that would take health insurance subsidies away from 5.9 million Americans:
"At a time when the United States is the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all Americans - and 29 million people still lack insurance - it would be a disaster to throw millions of low-income Americans off health insurance. I fully expect that today's decision will be reversed.
"The last eight years have proven that Republicans have no interest in universal health care. Instead they have tried time and time again to take health care away from the 20 million newly insured Americans. We should be talking about how to make health care a right for all Americans, not finding new ways to make health care unaffordable.
"Instead of gutting the Affordable Care Act, we need to expand on the improvements that it has made to our health care system. The time has come for the United States to join every major country on earth in guaranteeing health care as a right to every man, woman and child."
