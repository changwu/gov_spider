    Today's Hanwha Q CELLS announcement to make the largest solar investment in U.S. history is a big deal for Georgia's working families and the American economy. And, this investment is a direct result of my economic plan and the Inflation Reduction Act.
Hanwha's Q CELLS investment will create thousands of good-paying jobs in Georgia, many of which won't require a 4-year degree. It will bring back our supply chains so we aren't reliant on other countries, lower the cost of clean energy, and help us combat the climate crisis. And it will ensure that we manufacture cutting-edge, solar technology here at home. It's a win for workers, consumers, and our climate.
Under my leadership, the United States can and will lead the world in manufacturing once again.
