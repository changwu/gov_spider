MORRISTOWN, NJ - Following Governor Christie's strong performance in last night's third Republican Presidential debate, twelve additional New Hampshire elected officials, community leaders and party activists joined his campaign's leadership team.
"Governor Christie showed the nation on TV last night what voters in New Hampshire have had the fortune to see in-person: at this pivotal time in American history, he is a leader who offers integrity, solutions, executive experience, and a fierce resolve to boldly confront a government that is neither working for the American people nor arresting the national decline," said former State Representative and United State Marine Corps Veteran John Cebrowski (R-Bedford). A former supporter of Governor Scott Walker, Cebrowski added, "Like Governor Walker, Governor Christie is a fighter who has the courage, the battle scars, the smarts, and the ability to work collegially in a fractious Washington culture to get results for us and this nation."
"Our country needs Governor Christie's straight talk and strong leadership," stated State Representative Russell Dumais. "Governor Christie's unique record of combating a Democratic Legislature in New Jersey while balancing every budget, cutting spending, vetoing more tax hikes than any Governor in American history, and creating nearly 200,000 private-sector jobs shows that he is ready to tackle the serious challenges our next President will face."
