    Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Lisa O. Monaco met at the White House today with the Netherlands Minister for Security and Justice Ivo Opstelten and National Coordinator for Security and Counterterrorism Dick Schoof. In this meeting, Ms. Monaco expressed the United States' appreciation for the Netherlands' contributions to the international coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and reaffirmed the U.S. government's commitment to continue cooperating closely with the Dutch on a range of counterterrorism priorities, particularly the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters. Ms. Monaco, Minister Opstelten and Mr. Schoof discussed opportunities for our two countries to strengthen collaboration to prevent and disrupt foreign terrorist fighter travel to Syria and Iraq and address the shared threat posed by returning foreign fighters.
