    Post-Detroit debate polling continues to show a noticeable increase for John Kasich in Michigan.
Comparing the three polls taken before the debate (NBC/WSJ, Trafalgar, CBS/YouGov) to the three polls taken after the debate, (ARG, Fox 2 Detroit, Monmouth), John Kasich's upward momentum is clear.
The most recent poll from Monmouth noted movement in Kasich's direction over the weekend:
"In interviews conducted Thursday and Friday, Trump held a solid lead with 39% support compared to 22% for Cruz, 17% for Kasich, and 14% for Rubio. The race was much tighter in Saturday and Sunday interviews at 32% for Trump, 26% for Kasich, 25% for Cruz, and 12% for Rubio."

[...]
"Trump's support may be dropping, while Kasich's star could be rising."

From POLITICO:
"Results shared by Monmouth showed a tightening race over the last several, with Kasich surging nine points in the period between Saturday-Sunday and Thursday-Friday. Trump, meanwhile, fell by seven points in the same time frame."
