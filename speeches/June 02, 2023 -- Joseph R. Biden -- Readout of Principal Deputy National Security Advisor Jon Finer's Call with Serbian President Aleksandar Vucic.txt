    Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer spoke with President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia today. Mr. Finer stressed the United States' concern about the tense situation in northern Kosovo and called for all parties to take steps aimed at de-escalating the situation. He urged the Government of Serbia to withdraw its armed forces stationed near the border and to lower their state of readiness, as well as to urge protesters to remain peaceful in northern Kosovo. Mr. Finer reiterated that the United States expects both sides to re-engage in the EU-facilitated Dialogue and to fully implement the normalization agreement reached in Brussels and Ohrid earlier this year.
