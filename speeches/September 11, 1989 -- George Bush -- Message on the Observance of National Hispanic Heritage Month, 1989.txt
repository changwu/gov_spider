    I am delighted to extend my warmest greetings and congratulations to the members of the Hispanic American community as you celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month, September 15 - October 15, 1989.
Perhaps no single ethnic group has had as profound an impact upon our Nation as Hispanic Americans. From the days of the first explorers in what is now Florida, Texas, and California, the Hispanic peoples have played a major role in taming this vast country and developing its abundant resources. Mexican Americans, Cuban Americans, Puerto Rican Americans, and other men and women of Hispanic descent have not only demonstrated the power of individual enterprise but also added to the cultural diversity that so enriches American life.
Today, Hispanic Americans continue to be leaders and pioneers -- in education, government, business, science, sports, and the arts. Every day, in communities across the United States, they remind their fellow Americans of the meaning of determination and hard work, as well as the importance of faith and devotion to one's family. The values passed from generation to generation in Hispanic American families are values central to the American experience, and our Nation is all the stronger because these individuals have recognized the importance of caring for one's neighbor, obtaining a good education, participating in one's church, and exercising one's rights as a citizen.
This month provides a wonderful opportunity for all of us to celebrate both our Nation's Hispanic Heritage and the beliefs that unite us. I encourage all Americans to take part.
Barbara joins me in offering Hispanic Americans best wishes for a memorable celebration and for every future happiness and success. God bless you, and God bless America.
