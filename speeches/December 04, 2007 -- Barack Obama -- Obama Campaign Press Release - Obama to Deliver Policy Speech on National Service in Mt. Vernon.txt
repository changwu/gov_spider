    Des Moines, IA -- Tomorrow, Wednesday, Barack Obama will detail his commitment to making national service an important cause of his presidency on the campus of Cornell College in Mt. Vernon.
In his campaign, Obama has enlisted hundreds of thousands of Americans to join him in working for change that America can believe in. As President, Obama will increase opportunities for Americans of all ages to serve their country. Obama will discuss the opportunity that was lost to call Americans to serve after 9/11, the benefits of public service, and his agenda for making the American people a part of the answer to America's problems.
After the policy speech in Mt. Vernon, Obama will hold a rally at the University of Northern Iowa and a town hall meeting at Wartburg College.
