    National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today at the White House with Mexico's Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard to discuss our common vision for North America and joint efforts to address global challenges. The two discussed accomplishments under the U.S.-Mexico High-Level Security Dialogue to disrupt transnational criminal organizations responsible for human smuggling and trafficking drugs and firearms. They discussed coordinated efforts to reduce irregular migration and promote legal pathways, including the October 12 announcement of expanded law enforcement cooperation coupled with an expanded legal pathway for Venezuelan nationals. The two also discussed how the United States and Mexico – in coordination with international partners – can continue to work together to address the humanitarian and security crises in Haiti.
