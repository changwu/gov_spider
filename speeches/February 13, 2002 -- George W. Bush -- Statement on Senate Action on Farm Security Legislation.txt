    I am committed to sound farm policy that supports America's farmers and ranchers and am disappointed that the Senate-passed bill doesn't get the job done. This bill front loads spending into the first 5 years, leaving vital programs underfunded in the years that follow. I look forward to working with conferees to produce a plan that will benefit farmers in the long term by encouraging conservation, establishing farm savings accounts, and promoting open markets and new opportunities for producers.
