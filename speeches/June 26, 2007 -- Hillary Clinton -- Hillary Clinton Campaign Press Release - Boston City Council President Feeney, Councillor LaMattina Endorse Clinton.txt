    Hillary Clinton received the endorsements of Boston City Council President Maureen Feeney and Councillor Salvatore LaMattina today, reflecting her growing support in the Bay State.
"We need to return strong, principled leadership to the White House," said Feeney, who has served on the Council since 1993 and is only the second woman to lead the body. "Hillary Clinton is the only candidate who has the experience to lead from her first day in office."
"Hillary Clinton has demonstrated time and again her commitment to the working families of Boston and the nation," said LaMattina, who chairs the City and Neighborhood Services Committee. "She is uniquely qualified to be our next President."
"I'm honored to have the support of these local leaders who are working on the frontlines everyday to keep their communities safe and expand opportunities for the people of Boston," Clinton said.
Clinton has received strong support in Massachusetts, winning the endorsements of Congressmen Jim McGovern and Richard Neal, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, Suffolk County Sheriff Andrea Cabral and 30 Massachusetts state legislators. This group of leaders will help spread Hillary Clinton's message for change throughout their communities and also help support her campaign's efforts in New Hampshire, an important early primary state.
