    I am pleased that Congress moved quickly and with strong bipartisan support to pass my request for our military and to bolster our homeland defenses during Operation Iraqi Freedom. The world is witnessing the liberation of Iraq and the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Iraqi people as a new day begins in their country. This legislation includes the resources necessary to win the war and help secure enduring freedom and democracy for the Iraqi people. I look forward to working with the Congress as we make progress in the war and in providing aid to the people of Iraq.
