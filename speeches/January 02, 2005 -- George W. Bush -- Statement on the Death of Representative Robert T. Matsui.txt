    Laura and I are saddened by the passing of Bob Matsui. Bob Matsui was a dedicated public servant and a good and decent man who served with distinction and integrity in the U.S. House of Representatives for more than 25 years. In the Congress, he was a leader of his party admired by colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Through long-time service on the House Ways and Means Committee, he helped pass important legislation on issues ranging from trade to small business to child welfare to mass transit. He was always devoted to California and his native Sacramento, where he served on the city council and as vice mayor in the 1970s. A third-generation Japanese American, Bob was interned along with his family during World War II. Four decades later, he played a leading role in Congress in securing passage of the landmark Japanese American Redress Act. Laura and I send our prayers and condolences to Doris, their son Brian, and the entire Matsui family.
