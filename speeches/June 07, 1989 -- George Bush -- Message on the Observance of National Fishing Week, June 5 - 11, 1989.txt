    America is a land blessed by bountiful natural resources. Enjoying our outdoor treasures has always been an indelible part of the spirit of our people. That is why it gives me great pleasure to pay tribute to one of our most popular outdoor leisure activities -- recreational fishing -- during National Fishing Week. For some, fishing is a full-time occupation. But for most of the 60 million Americans who fish, it is a means of renewing our bonds with nature and sharing special moments with family and friends.
Fishing is an especially valuable experience for our younger generation. Today, more than ever, it is important to instill in our children a sense of appreciation and responsibility for stewardship of our lands and waters. One brisk morning spent fishing on a misty lake can bring home to a child the beauty, drama, and fragility of our natural heritage in a way a thousand classroom presentations never could.
Our nation's public investment in fishery conservation, restoration, and enhancement is, in great part, paid for by fishermen through taxes on fishing equipment. Last year, government agencies working with many private organizations successfully completed a National Recreational Fisheries Policy. This effort was an important first step in focusing attention on the social and economic importance of sport fishing.
By continuing to work together, we can ensure that generations to come will have the opportunity to experience the pleasures found in fishing. As an avid fisherman, I'm happy to send a special salute to all my fellow "anglers" during National Fishing Week.
