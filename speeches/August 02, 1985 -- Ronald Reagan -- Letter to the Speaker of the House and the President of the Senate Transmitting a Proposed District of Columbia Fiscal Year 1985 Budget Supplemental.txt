    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, I am transmitting a fiscal year 1985 budget supplemental of the District of Columbia. This supplemental proposes a net increase of $35 million in the city's General Fund Budget, including $53 million in program increases and $18 million in rescission of budget authority of District agencies.
This increase is in District of Columbia funds and does not affect the Federal Budget.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
