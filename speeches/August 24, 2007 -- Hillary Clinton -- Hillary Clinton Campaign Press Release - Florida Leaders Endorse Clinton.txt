    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsements of more than 40 Florida legislators and community leaders, demonstrating Hillary's growing support in the Sunshine State.
"Hillary Clinton's deep understanding of the complex issues facing our nation at home and abroad make her uniquely qualified to be our next Commander in Chief," said State Representative Terry Fields of Duval County.
"Floridians are ready for change, and Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to deliver it. She can make history and inspire a generation of women in the process," said State Senator and former Senate President Gwen Margolis of Miami-Dade County.
"I truly believe Hillary Clinton has the necessary experience, dedication and commitment to lead our country in the right direction," said State Representative Martin David Kiar of Broward County. "Senator Clinton understands the issues affecting Floridians, from establishing a national catastrophic insurance fund to reforming and properly supporting our education system, she will fight for what's important to us."
"I am grateful for the overwhelming support I've received in Florida," Clinton said. "These local leaders will be critical in growing our grassroots support and spreading our message of change across the Sunshine State."
Today's endorsers join other leaders from across Florida in supporting Hillary, including Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Alcee Hastings, Kendrick Meek and Corrine Brown.
