    WELL, Candy, I thank you very much, and I am sure that the children of Washington will enjoy the deer.
Now I hope the deer likes its new home, too. But it may be like a lot of other folks that go to Washington, they find out they have left a lot behind.
I am sure if I were going away from these woods, along these lovely lakes and rivers, and had to go live in Washington, I would think twice, wouldn't you?
But I will take it down.
Good luck to you, and thank you very much.
