    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Hall (D) OH and 18 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2321. The bill would establish a national historical park consisting of four sites. According to a 1990 National Park Service (NPS) study, three of the four sites are adequately protected and do not need to be included in the National Park System.
H.R. 2321 would also create a costly and complex framework for cooperation among Federal, state, and local governments and the private sector. Such cooperation does not require the creation of a Federally authorized and funded commission with broad executive authority, as called for in this bill. In addition, the appointment of commission members (section 201) and the terms of the required coordination between the Secretaries of the Interior and Defense (section 107) raise constitutional questions.
