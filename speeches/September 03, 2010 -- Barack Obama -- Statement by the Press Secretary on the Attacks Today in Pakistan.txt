    The United States condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the terrorist attacks on a religious procession in Quetta and an Ahmedi worship center in Peshawar. We offer our sincere condolences to the families of the victims.
To target innocent civilians during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan at an already difficult time as the country is working hard to recover from terrible flooding caused by monsoons makes these acts even more reprehensible.
In line with the deepening partnership between our two nations, the United States government continues to assist and work closely with the Government of Pakistan in its efforts to rebuild and recover, and we will continue to stand with the people of Pakistan as they face these challenging times.
