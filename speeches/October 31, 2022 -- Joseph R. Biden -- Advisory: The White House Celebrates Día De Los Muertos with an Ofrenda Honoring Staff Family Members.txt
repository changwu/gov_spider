    In celebration of DÃ­a De Los Muertos, the White House is displaying an ofrenda in the West Garden Room to honor and celebrate the lives of loved ones who have passed. This year, the White House is partnering with the National Museum of Mexican Art (NMMA) in Chicago, Illinois and, for the first time in history, the ofrenda showcases photos of White House staff's loved ones who have passed to celebrate their lives and memories. First Lady Jill Biden initiated the collaboration with NMMA after she visited the museum in October 2021 as part of her series of charlas and listening sessions with Hispanic and Latino communities.
This ofrenda will be open for pre-credentialed media coverage on Tuesday 11/1 from 12:30 - 12:45 PM ET. For media interested in filming or photographing the exhibit, please RSVP HERE by Tuesday, 11/1 at 11:00 AM ET.
