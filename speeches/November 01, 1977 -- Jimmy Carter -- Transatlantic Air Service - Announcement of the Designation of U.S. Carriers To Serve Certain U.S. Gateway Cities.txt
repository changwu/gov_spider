    The President has approved the Civil Aeronautics Board's decision on one portion of the Transatlantic Route Proceeding, the designation of U.S. carriers to serve existing U.S. gateway cities.
At present, eight U.S. cities receive air service to London from two competing U.S. carriers. The Bermuda II agreement reduced the number of U.S. cities which may receive such competitive service from eight to two. The agreement requires the United States to indicate by November 1 which two cities will continue to receive competitive service to London, and which single carrier will serve each of the other six gateways.
This decision specifies that the cities to receive competitive service will be New York and, on an interim basis, Boston. The Board will consider further evidence on whether Los Angeles should replace Boston as the second city receiving competitive service.
For the other six cities, Pan Am will be the exclusive carrier for Washington, Detroit, and San Francisco, and TWA will serve Philadelphia, Chicago, and, pending the decision on whether it should receive competitive service, Los Angeles.
