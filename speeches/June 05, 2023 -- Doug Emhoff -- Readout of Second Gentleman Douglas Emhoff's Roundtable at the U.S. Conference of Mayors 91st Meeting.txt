During the roundtable, the Second Gentleman emphasized the importance of working together to broaden awareness and understanding of antisemitism in communities. He also highlighted the Administration's commitment to work with mayors and local leaders to improve safety and security for Jewish communities.
Senior Advisor to the President and Director of the Office of Public Engagement Steve Benjamin also attended the roundtable. Director Benjamin thanked the mayors for the work that they are doing to combat hate, extremism, and bigotry across the nation. He encouraged the mayors to continue building cross-community solidarity and taking collective action to counter hate of all kinds.
Last month, the Biden-Harris Administration released the first-ever U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism. The strategy outlines a whole-of-society approach to prevent and combat antisemitism, strengthen our democracy, and protect religious freedom. The strategy can be found here.
