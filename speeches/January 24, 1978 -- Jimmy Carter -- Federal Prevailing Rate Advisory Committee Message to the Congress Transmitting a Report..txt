    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with section 5347(e) of title 5 of the United States Code, I hereby transmit to you the 1976 Annual Report of the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee.
While not specifically addressed in the attached report, I want to express my concern that little progress appears to have been made in reforming the prevailing rate system for adjusting wages of Federal blue collar employees. In my February 22, 1977 message to the Congress, I strongly recommended early enactment of legislation to correct those provisions of current law that cause significant departures from the local prevailing rate principle, and result in an unfair competitive advantage for the Federal Government and unjustifiable payroll costs. A draft bill which would achieve these objectives was submitted to the Congress early last year. I am convinced that this bill will correct the most serious deficiencies in the prevailing rate system and I wish to reiterate my concern for its passage.
