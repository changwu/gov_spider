    Today, New Mexico Congressman and Assistant Speaker of the House Ben Ray Luján announced his endorsement of Joe Biden:
"I am deeply proud to endorse Vice President Joe Biden - a proven leader who will fight for impactful change for rural America and Hispanics. America needs a champion in the White House who understands New Mexico's values - hard work, treating others with respect and dignity, someone who will fight for better health care for our communities, lower prescription drug prices, a stronger education system, good-paying jobs, and immigration reform. Vice President Biden is a person of character and compassion and will bring us together. He'll champion all Americans - whether you live in rural counties, big cities, from North to South and East to West. We know Joe, and he knows us."
Luján joins New Mexico Senator Tom Udall and Congresswoman Deb Haaland in endorsing Joe Biden. Biden for President has previously announced more than 2,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
