    A new organizational system has been established for the NSC. In place of the previous seven committees, there will be only two. There will be a Committee on Policy Review, chaired by departmental officials, normally the senior departmental official.
There will be a Committee on Special Coordination dealing with cross-cutting issues, chaired by the President's National Security Adviser, Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski.
This system was devised and ordered by the President himself. It reflects his desire for more simplified and responsive organization throughout government.
