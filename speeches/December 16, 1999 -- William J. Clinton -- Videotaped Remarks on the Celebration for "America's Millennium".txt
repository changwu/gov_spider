    I want to invite all Americans to join Hillary and me for "America's Millennium," a spectacular 3-day celebration in our Nation's Capital to ring in a new year, new century, new millennium. Join us in honoring our past and imagining the future, by kicking off the celebration at 11 a.m. on December 31st with an opening ceremony at the Main Street Millennium stage at 12th and Constitution. Enjoy free performances and programs at many of the Smithsonian museums, and food and fun at the city's block party.
Usher in the year 2000 at America's Millennium Gala at the Lincoln Memorial, beginning at 9 p.m. It will include a stirring concert, a premiere of a film on the 20th century by Steven Spielberg, and a spectacular finale of lights and fireworks. All events are free and open to the public. For more information, call 1-888- 294-2100 or log onto Americasmillennium.gov.
From my family to yours, happy new year and a happy new millennium.
