    Judge Thomas has diverse and broad-based support across the country, including in minority communities. His record is distinguished and demonstrates his lifelong commitment to the rule of law and fidelity to the Constitution.
The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights' action today ignores this record and reflects their liberal political agenda. This predictable opposition simply shows again that they are out of touch with mainstream America.
We look forward to the September hearings where we are confident that Judge Thomas' outstanding record, experience, and extraordinary background will show once and for all why he will make an exemplary Justice of the Supreme Court.
