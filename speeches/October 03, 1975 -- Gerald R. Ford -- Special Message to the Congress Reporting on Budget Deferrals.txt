    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith transmit ten supplementary reports which extend previously reported deferrals of funds provided by the continuing resolution for fiscal year 1976. Eight of the deferrals are for programs of the Department of Agriculture and two deferrals are for programs in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The supplementary reports reflect an addition of $76.4 million in budget authority deferred when compared with their original reports.
Generally, the Congress considers the funds appropriate to each program only in the regular appropriations bill. The continuing resolution establishes certain categories and sets standard temporary appropriation levels that apply uniformly to the many programs within each of these categories. I am proposing-for the programs included in this message--levels that differ from the general levels allowed in the continuing resolution. The Congress is now in the process of considering, through the regular 1976 appropriations bills, my specific proposals for each of these programs. The deferrals I am reporting preserve the possibility of conducting these programs in 1976 at the levels I have recommended. The details of each deferral are contained in the attached reports.
