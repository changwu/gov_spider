    Rep. Howard joins growing list of SC leaders supporting Sanders.
COLUMBIA, SC â€“ In the latest in a string of announcements highlighting growing momentum in South Carolina, Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign today announced a major endorsement from SC State Representative Leon Howard.
With more than eight months before South Carolina's "First in the South" primary, Rep. Howard joins a growing list of elected officials and local leaders in the state who have publicly endorsed Sen. Sanders and his campaign. In fact, Sen. Sanders' public support among state and local elected officials alone has more than doubled since April.
"We're very excited to have Rep. Howard's support," said Bernie 2020 SC State Director Kwadjo Campbell. "He is a trailblazer and a fearless fighter for working families across South Carolina, particularly with regard to making quality healthcare affordable and accessible to all."
Having served in the SC House of Representatives since 1995, Rep. Howard is the senior member of Richland County's House Delegation. He also chairs the prestigious House "3M" (Medical, Military, Public and Municipal Affairs) Committee and is the only African-American to chair a standing committee in the state legislature.
SC State Representative Leon Howard (District 76):
"In this country, especially in this state which has not expanded Medicaid, we need to prioritize what's really important.
"Healthcare is a right! If you work all your life and can't afford to get proper medical and dental care, that says something is very wrong with our society.
"I support Medicare for All and I support Bernie Sanders for President."
