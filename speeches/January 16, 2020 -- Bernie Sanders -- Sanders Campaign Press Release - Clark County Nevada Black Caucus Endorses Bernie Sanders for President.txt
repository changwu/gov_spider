    LAS VEGAS, Nev. â€“ The Clark County Black Caucus (CCBC) today announced their endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders' candidacy for president of the United States. CCBC is committed to advancing public policy that supports equality for people of color at the state and local level.
"The Clark County Black Caucus represents the diverse coalition we're building in Nevada and I am proud to gain their support," Sanders said. "Their voice and leadership has brought meaningful change in the lives of the communities they serve, and together, we will fight against a government and political system that have historically oppressed African Americans. I look forward to winning the Nevada caucuses with them in February."
CCBC Chair Yvette Williams stated, "Bernie Sanders has been a lifelong advocate for civil rights and economic justice. His presidential campaign goes the furthest in addressing issues that impact the African American community nationally and here in Nevada. Nevada is the first state in the presidential nominating process to capture America's racial diversity. As representatives of this community, CCBC looks forward to working with Sen. Bernie Sanders to ensure our political system works for everyone."
