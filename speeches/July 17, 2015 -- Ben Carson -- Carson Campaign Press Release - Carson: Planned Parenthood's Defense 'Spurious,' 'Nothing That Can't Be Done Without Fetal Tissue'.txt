    Retired neurosurgeon and Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson stated that the argument that Planned Parenthood is obtaining fetal tissue for important medical research is "spurious" because "there's nothing that can't be done without fetal tissue" on Thursday's "Kelly File" on the Fox News Channel.
Carson said, in response, to the argument that Planned Parenthood uses fetal organs for medical research, "it's been over-promised what the benefits of fetal research would be. And very much under-delivered. And if you go back over the years, and look at the research that has been done and all the things that it was supposed to deliver, very little of that has been done, and there's nothing that can't be done without fetal tissue. So, it's a spurious argument, but, you know, what's really disturbing is the fact that we have become so callous that a lot of people don't even realize that this is shocking. To see the callousness, [with] which we are treating human life. It's interesting that there are so many people who are concerned about snail darters and little spiders and things, and yet, the human being inside of that mother's womb, just beyond, you know, 10 weeks, is much more sophisticated than many of these creatures that they're trying to preserve. And we've created a dichotomy in what should be a[n] almost sacred relationship between a mother and that baby, and a mother is a protector of that baby, and we've distorted things to the point where people believe that if the mother can't kill the baby, than anybody who's advocating that is an enemy of women. How can we be so foolish as to believe such a thing?"
