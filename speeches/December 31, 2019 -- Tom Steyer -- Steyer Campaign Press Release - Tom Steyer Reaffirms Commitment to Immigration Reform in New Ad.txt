    (SAN FRANCISCO, December 31, 2019) â€” Today, presidential candidate Tom Steyer launched a new ad campaign highlighting the moment during the last DNC debate in which he distinguished himself as the candidate vowing to undo Trump's attempts to racially divide our country through immigration. The new Every Right ad shows Steyer's commitment to reforming our country's broken immigration system and putting American values before racist practices.
"I think it's important to note that this president is not against immigration, he's against immigration of non-white people," Steyer said in the ad. "And it's led him to break the laws of humanity in our name. We have to reframe this argument completely. We have to go back to the idea that every American is worth being a full human-being on every right."
The new ad comes as Steyer continues to pick up momentum in the early primary states. The most recent Morning Consult poll showed him with 10% support in early caucus and primary states, where Steyer has primarily been on the ground with voters.
See below for the full script:
I think it's important to note that this president is not against immigration, he's against immigration of non-white people.
This is a racial argument by a racist president.
Who's trying to divide us. It's absolutely wrong.
And it's led him to break the laws of humanity in our name.
We have to reframe this argument completely. We have to go back to the idea that every American is worth being a full human-being on every right.
I'm Tom Steyer and I approve this message.
