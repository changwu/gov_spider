    Terrorists have once again targeted innocents this time in Indonesia. At least 182 innocent men and women have been murdered and hundreds injured in a cowardly act designed to create terror and chaos.
On behalf of the people of the United States, I condemn this heinous act. I offer our heartfelt condolences to the families of all the murder victims from numerous countries and our wish for the swift and complete recovery of those injured in this attack.
I offer our sympathy to our friends, the people of Indonesia, for this terrible tragedy. Our prayers are also with our friends and allies, the people of Australia, who are suffering a grievous personal and national loss.
The world must confront this global menace terrorism. We must together challenge and defeat the idea that the wanton killing of innocents advances any cause or supports any aspirations. And we must call this despicable act by its rightful name murder.
The United States has offered its assistance to the government of Indonesia to help bring these murderers to justice.
GEORGE W. BUSH
