    Today, in recognition of the sacrifices members of the U.S. Armed Forces are making in and around Bosnia, I signed a bill extending special tax benefits to military personnel serving in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Macedonia.
During Vietnam and the Gulf war, tax relief was granted to individuals serving in "combat zones." By extending similar tax benefits to those supporting peace efforts in the former Yugoslavia, this legislation recognizes the unique hardships and risks members of the U.S. Armed Forces face in non-combat missions like the one in Bosnia.
I wish to thank Congress for their overwhelming support and timely passage of this legislation and also for their recognition of the hardships encountered by American troops serving in Operation Joint Endeavor.
