    I am today signing this legislation to provide for the continuing operation of the Government for the brief period between now and October 5, 1992, during which legislation is enacted providing for annual appropriations. I note that in some cases this bill incorporates by reference appropriations levels determined by action by one or both houses of Congress as of October 1, 1992. Because laws can be enacted only by the action of both houses and the President, see U.S. Const., Art. I, sec. 7; INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983), I sign this bill on the understanding that no action taken on that date subsequent to my approval at 8:10 a.m. o'clock E.D.T. is incorporated. For the same reason, section 106(b) can be effective only if interpreted to mean enactment of the referenced appropriations bills into law.
George Bush
The White House,
October 1, 1992.
