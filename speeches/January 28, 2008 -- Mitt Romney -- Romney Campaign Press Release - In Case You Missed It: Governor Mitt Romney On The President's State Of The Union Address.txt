    Governor Romney Reacts To The President's State Of The Union Address (NBC, 1/28/08):
Governor Romney: "Well, primarily I saw that you had a President of the United States who is not running for re-election. His political career is over, and he has decided that he has a number of things he wants to say to the American people. He said them honestly and forthrightly. I was disappointed that in many cases the Democrats wouldn't stand and acknowledge the importance of some of the issues he raised. But I saw a President who recognizes that Washington has been unable to deal with many of the problems we face. And whether that's the ongoing threat from al Qaeda or whether it's the need to reform Social Security or the need to finally secure our borders and have an immigration policy that works. This was a President saying, 'You know what? Washington ought to get the job done.' Washington is broken, and I think that's one more reason for us to see a change in direction in our nation's capital."

Governor Romney On Cutting Wasteful Earmarks (Fox News, 1/28/08):
Governor Romney: "My record as the Governor of Massachusetts has been to veto over 800 items, and I would take my veto pen with me to Washington and do the exact same thing. I've said that if I get spending bills, which in discretionary accounts raise our spending by more than inflation less one percent, I'll veto them. I believe the President's executive order specifically saying don't spend these earmark accounts â€“ if they haven't been voted on by congress, don't spend the money, that makes a lot of sense to me. It's a policy I'd maintain going forward. We're going to have to rein in these earmarks, rein in the pork barrel spending. I think that's essential."
