Travel pool report # 4- Church departure / grave visit
POTUS exited St. Joseph on the Brandywine at 5:54pm. He was masked.
He briefly stopped to speak to a family and removed his mask to pose for a picture. POTUS was then handed a bouquet of white flowers as he put his mask back on. Pool was escorted back to the van.
Following mass, the President left flowers at the gravesite of his mother, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden in honor of Mother’s Day, according to the WH.
Pool also spotted a bucket of single roses sitting on a table outside the church (presumably to pass out for Mother's Day).
