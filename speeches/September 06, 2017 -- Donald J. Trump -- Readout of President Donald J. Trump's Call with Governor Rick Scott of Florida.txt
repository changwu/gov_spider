    President Donald J. Trump spoke today with Governor Rick Scott to express his support for the Governor as the State prepares for Hurricane Irma and to thank him for his leadership in preparing the residents of Florida. The President confirmed that the Federal Government has been actively readying for the Hurricane Irma response even as the Government continues to support the States of Texas and Louisiana following Hurricane Harvey. FEMA will continue to coordinate with Florida's emergency management staff and will work with other Federal partners to help support the State's efforts.
