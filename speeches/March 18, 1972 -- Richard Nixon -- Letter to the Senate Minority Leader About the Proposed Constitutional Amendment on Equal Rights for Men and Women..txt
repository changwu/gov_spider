    Dear Hugh:
This is in response to your inquiry requesting my stand on the Equal Rights Amendment currently under consideration by the Senate.
As you remember, as a Senator in 1951 I cosponsored a Resolution incorporating the original Amendment; in July of 1968 I reaffirmed my support for it as a candidate for the Presidency.
Throughout twenty-one years I have not altered my belief that equal rights for women warrant a Constitutional guarantee-and I therefore continue to favor the enactment of the Constitutional Amendment to achieve this goal.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[Honorable Hugh Scott, Minority Leader, United States Senate, Washington, D.C.]
