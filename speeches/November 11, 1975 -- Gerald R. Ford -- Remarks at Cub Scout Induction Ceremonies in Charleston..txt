    Mr. Walls, Governor Moore, all of you wonderful Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, Scouters, et cetera:
It is just great to be here. This is the kind of gathering I love to come and say just a word or two.
For a good share of my life, beginning a good many years ago, I spent a tremendous amount of time, starting as a Tenderfoot and going on through there, on through to a troop commissioner and a counsel--whatever they call them--and I was darned proud of my association with scouting from the beginning to the end. And I am proud of all scouting today and you should be, too.
I don't think there was a prouder moment in my life than when I was privileged to become an Eagle Scout. And I still have the merit badge sash, and I still have that Eagle badge. It means a great deal to me today, as it did then.
There is something about scouting that leaves an impression on you, an impression that is wholesome and is good, and it is a stimulant for greater effort--all the scout oaths and the scout laws--and I could almost repeat them without a mistake.
But I can say to you, you will enjoy yourself, you will do better, you will be happier, you will just make a greater contribution to your country, to your State, to your city, to your family, to yourself, if you live by the scout oath and the scout laws. They are good for you today, and they will be good for you tomorrow, and they will be good for you a long time from now.
So, enjoy what you are doing, but make a big effort to do the best today as a scout. If you do, you will do a better job for your country in the years ahead.
Good luck. God bless you. Thank you very much.
