    Washington, D.C. Commemoration
Frederick Douglass was one of our country's most renowned and paramount leaders in the abolitionist movement. He was a great American who fought to end slavery and champion the rights and freedoms for both African Americans and women.
I join Americans today to commemorate Frederick Douglass Day during this Black History Month.
It is important that we not forget the history that helped transform our country and I hope for as long as America exists, we continue to learn and speak of the legacy of this great American treasure.
