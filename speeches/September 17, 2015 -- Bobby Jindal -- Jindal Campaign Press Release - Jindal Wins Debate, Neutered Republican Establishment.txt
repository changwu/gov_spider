    "In tonight's debate, Governor Jindal neutered the Republican establishment in D.C.
"The Republican establishment in D.C. is the surrender caucus. They backed down on repealing Obamacare, stopping a dangerous Iran deal, and defunding Planned Parenthood.
"Republican voters are angry at Republicans in D.C. and they should be. It's time for us to fight for what we believe in."
