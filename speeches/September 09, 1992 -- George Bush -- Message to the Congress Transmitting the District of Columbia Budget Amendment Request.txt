    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, I am transmitting the District of Columbia Government's 1993 Budget amendment request.
The District of Columbia Government has submitted a request to increase its FY 1993 capital authority by $60 million and to reprogram $20 million of capital authority from an existing project. The requested increase in authority is needed to fund the District's share of the remaining 13.5 miles of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Metrorail system in accordance with the construction schedule adopted in the Fifth Interim Capital Contributions Agreement.
George Bush
