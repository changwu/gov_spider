MANCHESTER, N.H. – Following a series of powerful TV and digital ads released in October, Bernie 2020 this week is launching its first television ad in New Hampshire.
The ad, "Fights for Us," highlights Sanders' unwavering dedication to causes that improve the lives of all Americans. "Whether it was Wall Street, the drug companies, or other powerful special interests, Bernie has taken them on for us." the narrator says.
The ad was produced entirely in-house. The $1 million buy will start on Thursday and run for two weeks. The spot will also be distributed digitally.
The 60-second version of the ad can be seen here and a transcript is below:
'Growing up in a family that struggled economically powerfully influenced my life and my values.
Bernie Sanders — fighting to raise wages for American workers, leading the fight to guarantee healthcare for all, standing up for civil rights, seniors, veterans and our children's future.
Whether it was Wall Street, the drug companies, or other powerful special interests, Bernie has taken them on for us.
Now, our country is at a turning point. A dangerous demagogue, tearing our nation apart, hard working people betrayed by Trump, a healthcare system that makes enormous profits for drug and insurance companies, and a planet on the brink of a climate disaster.
In this moment, we need a fighter. Bernie Sanders — we know he'll fight for us as president because he always has.'
