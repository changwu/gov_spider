    I am delighted to send greetings to members of the Jewish community in the United States and around the world as you celebrate Hanukkah.
As you commemorate the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem more than 2,000 years ago, you call to mind the many great spiritual and political struggles that have been borne by the Jewish people -- a people of faith and resolve. When it burned miraculously for eight days instead of one, the small cruse of oil that was found in the reclaimed Temple by Judah Maccabee and his followers symbolized the power of prayer and the unfailing wisdom of the Almighty.
Now, as you once again light the menorah, in keeping with centuries-old Judaic law and tradition, know that countless others join with you in praying for peace and for the expansion of religious liberty and tolerance around the world. During this time of renewal, we pray especially that the Middle East peace talks will lead to a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace between Israel and her Arab neighbors.
Barbara joins me in sending best wishes for a Happy Hanukkah.
