    Today, President Biden took another important step forward in strengthening our nation's cyber capability. He announced his intent to nominate Chris Inglis as National Cyber Director and Jen Easterly as the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency. If confirmed, Chris and Jen will add deep expertise, experience and leadership to our world-class cyber team, which includes the first-ever Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology Anne Neuberger, as well as strong, crisis-tested professionals from the FBI to ODNI to the Department of Homeland Security to U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency. I'm proud of what we are building across the U.S. government when it comes to cyber. We are determined to protect America's networks and to meet the growing challenge posed by our adversaries in cyberspace â€“ and this is the team to do it.
