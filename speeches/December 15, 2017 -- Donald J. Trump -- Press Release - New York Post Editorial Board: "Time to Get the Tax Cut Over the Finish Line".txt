Time to get the tax cut over the finish line

It's this close: Republicans in the House and Senate have struck a $1.5 trillion tax-cut deal that could put the economy on a fast track for years.
All they need is to put the final touches on the bill and pass it in both chambers. President Trump could sign it by Christmas.
That would be a major win — not just for Trump and the GOP, but for America.
...
Overall, the bill calls for big-time relief:

?A chop to the corporate-tax rate, from 35 percent to 21 percent.
?Breaks for small businesses.
?Trims to rates for individual taxpayers.
?A near doubling of the standard deduction for middle- and low-income taxpayers.

The idea is not just to let working folk keep more of their money but to encourage investment in America and keep companies from fleeing to lower-tax sites abroad.
...
This is no time for spoilers. Americans need this tax cut. Pass it, guys — now.
