    Q. Mr. President, can you tell us any more about the Bosnian sanctions that you're putting on today?
The President. No, we'll have more to say.
Q. Are these going to be unilateral or through the United Nations?
The President. We'll put it outâ€”I'm not-everything we've done on the sanctions so far is, and all of the things I've explored with our allies has pretty well been supported by everyone.
Q. Are the Russians sending arms to Serbia, sir.?
The President. I'm in a photo op. [Laughter]
