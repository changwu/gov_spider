    "President Trump and Brad Parscale have built an unprecedentedly strong campaign based on data and technology and Brad will remain heavily involved. We have a better team, better voter information, a better ground game, better fundraising, and most importantly, a better candidate with a better record. With 109 days left, our goal is clear â€“ to win each day we have left until election day. If we win more days than Joe Biden wins, President Trump will be re-elected. We will expose Joe Biden as a hapless tool of the extreme left and contrast his failures with the undeniable successes of President Trump. The same media polls that had the world convinced that Hillary Clinton would be elected in 2016 are trying the same trick again in 2020. It won't work."
- Bill Stepien, Trump 2020 campaign manager
