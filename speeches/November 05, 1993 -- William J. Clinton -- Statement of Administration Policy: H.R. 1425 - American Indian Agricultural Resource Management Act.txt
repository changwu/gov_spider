    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Richardson (D) NM, Johnson (D) SD, and Williams (D) MT)
The Administration supports H.R. 1425.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 1425 could affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is zero. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
