    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the NLRB's decision to drop its suit against Boeing:
"The National Labor Relations Board's decision to drop its suit against Boeing is a welcome step. But the fact that the Board acted at the request of the union bosses tells us all we need to know about who is calling the shots. While it is good news for the people of South Carolina, it does little for workers and businesses around the country who depend on a fair and impartial U.S. government. Thanks to President Obama's appointees, the NLRB has become a rogue agency that tramples on the rights of American workers and businesses, injecting job-killing uncertainty into the economic climate."
