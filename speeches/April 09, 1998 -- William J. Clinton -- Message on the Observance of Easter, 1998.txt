    Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Easter.
Just as nature renews the earth each spring, so does the celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ enliven our spirits. During this holy season, Christians across America and throughout the world rejoice at the good news of salvation and the re-creation of God's perfect world.
On this day of hope and joy, we are also in the midst of one of the most challenging and exciting periods in our nation's history. From the life of Jesus, we can draw strength for the vital tasks that lie before us: to unite our nation of diverse races, cultures, and backgrounds; to widen the circle of opportunity for all our people; and to build lasting bridges of understanding and respect among the nations of the world.
As Americans gather at sunrise services and in churches across the country, Hillary joins me in extending best wishes for a blessed Easter.
