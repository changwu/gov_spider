    President Obama called President Alassane Ouattara today to congratulate him on assuming his duties as the democratically elected President of Cote d'Ivoire. President Obama offered support for President Ouattara's efforts to unite Cote d'Ivoire, restart the economy, restore security, and reform the security forces. The President reiterated his admiration for the extraordinary potential of the Ivorian people, and the two leaders discussed the importance of reestablishing normal trade and assistance relationships to jumpstart the Ivoirian private sector. The two leaders also reiterated the importance of ensuring that alleged atrocities are investigated and that perpetrators – regardless of which side they supported – are held accountable for their actions, and committed to support the roles of the United Nations commission of inquiry and the International Criminal Court in investigating abuses. President Obama welcomed President Ouattara's commitment to provide security and advance the aspirations of all Ivoirians, and said that the United States will be a strong partner as President Ouattara forms an inclusive government, promotes reunification and reconciliation, and responds to the current humanitarian situation.
