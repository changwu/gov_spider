POTUS Foreign Pool Report #1 (9/28/22)-Schedule
Good afternoon from the White House.
My name is Taka Abe with Japan's Nippon Television. It's my pleasure to be your foreign pool reporter today covering day one of the first ever U.S.-Pacific Island Country Summit on the first day.
Your pool was COVID tested earlier today.
Since POTUS is not planning to attend the summit today, I will not actually cover any events today as the foreign pool, but I would like to share some information.
According to a senior administration official, the schedule of the summit is as follows:
Today, Wednesday Sep. 28
The Biden-Harris Administration releases the first-ever U.S. Pacific Island Strategy.
Sec. Blinken hosts the Pacific Island leaders at the State Department.
Sec. Raimondo and Amb. Bianchi meets with the leaders to discuss about economic, investment, and trade ties.
Special Presidential Envoy for Climate Kerry hosts a lunch with the leaders to discuss climate issues.
The leaders attend a dinner at the Coast Guard HQ to discuss maritime issues including enhancing maritime domain awareness and countering illegal fishing. The participants include NSA Sullivan, and Sec. Mayorkas.
Tomorrow, Thursday Sep. 29
Pacific Island leaders meets with business groups at the Chamber of Commerce.
Speaker Pelosi hosts the leaders for lunch with a bipartisan and bi-cameral group.
President Biden hosts in the U.S.-Pacific Island Country Summit at the State Department.
President Biden welcomes Pacific Island Leaders to the White House, and hosts a dinner for them.

POTUS Foreign Pool Report #2 (9/28/22)-General Background Information
I would like to share some general background information about the U.S. Pacific Island Country Summit. Hope it helps.
The U.S. Pacific Island Country Summit Up Till Now:
President George Bush hosted the Pacific Island Nations-United States Summit in Hawaii in 1990. President Obama also met leaders from the Pacific Islands and delivered remarks at the Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders (PICL) in Hawaii in 2016.
Today and tomorrow the Biden-Harris Administration hosts the first U.S.-Pacific Island Country Summit, and it will be the first time for Pacific Island leaders to visit the White House.
I believe there are several definitions of the Pacific Islands countries, but at least the following countries should be included as the ones; Cook Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, Kiribati, Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Caledonia, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.
According to an administration official, all Pacific Island countries have been invited. Leaders from Cook Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, Micronesia, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Tuvalu participate in the summit. Nauru and Vanuatu send their representatives.
Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) Secretary General attends as observers.
Guam is a member of the U.S. delegation.
The same official said that since it's very challenging, and a long way for these leaders to travel from the region, the United States is very grateful with the participation.
The Goal of the Summit:
According to a senior administration official, the goal of the summit is fundamentally to meet the Pacific Island leaders where they live. Kurt Campbell, Deputy Assistant to the President and Coordinator for the Indo-Pacific, also said that the goal of the summit is not just listen to the leaders of the Pacific Island countries, but put substantial resources and commitments in dozens of areas. He said that this is a region that has been disappointed before. Sometimes expectations get raised and unfulfilled. What the United States is going to try to do is to fulfill those expectations.
Biden-Harris Administration's engagements with the Pacific Island Countries:
Some of the engagements in the past are below.
Sec. Austin met President Kabua of Marshall Islands at the Pentagon. (Sep. 27, 2022)
Sec. Blinken chaired the first ministerial meeting of the Partners in the Blue Pacific (informal mechanism to support the Pacific Islands region among Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the UK, and the US) in New York (Sep. 22, 2022)
Deputy Sec. Sherman attended the 2022 Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders (PICL) in Hawaii (Sep. 13, 2022)
John Kirby, NSC Coordinator for Strategic Communications, said that the United States was disappointed in the Solomon Island's decision not to provide diplomatic clearance to the Coast Guard Cutter Oliver Henry for a stop there for refueling and resupply on Aug. 23. However, the United States was pleased the US Navy hospital ship, Mercy, received diplomatic clearance and was able to take port there on Aug. 29. (His virtual gaggle on Aug. 29, 2022)
Deputy Sec. Sherman visited Samoa, Tonga, Solomon Islands, Australia and New Zealand (Aug. 3-9, 2022) . On the visit of Solomon Islands, Deputy Sec. Sherman led a US delegation including U.S. Amb. to Australia Caroline Kennedy to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Guadalcanal (Aug. 6-8, 2022)
VP Harris participated virtually in the annual leaders' meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum, which took place in Fiji (July 12, 2022)

Amb. Joseph Yun, Special Presidential Envoy for Compact Negotiations, visited the Republic of the Marshall Islands for the first round of the negotiations. Compact is U.S. economic assistance to the country, and it will be expired next year. (June 2022)
A high-level U.S. delegation led by NSC Indo-Pacific Coordinator Kurt Campbell and AS Daniel Kritenbrink visited Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and Solomon Islands. (April 2022)
Sec. Blinken visited Fiji. (Feb 12, 2022)



September 28, 202215:30

POTUS Foreign Pool Report #3 (9/28/22)-Some Facts
I would like to add some diplomatic and economic facts as my last background information.
Diplomacy:
As I mentioned on my previous pool report, leaders from Cook Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, Micronesia, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Tuvalu participate in the summit. Nauru and Vanuatu send their representatives.
Countries in the Pacific region that do not have formal diplomatic ties with the United States are;
Cook Islands, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, and Niue
Countries in the Pacific region that have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan are;
Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, and Tuvalu
The Solomon Islands and Kiribati switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 2019. The Solomon Islands signed a security agreement with China on April, 2022.
Economy:
The United States has the Compact of Free Association (COFA) agreements, U.S. economic assistance, with Micronesia, Marshall Islands, and Palau. The agreements with Micronesia, and Marshall Islands will be expired next year, and the one with Palau in 2024. An administration official said the United States will fulfill its historic commitments by completing these negotiations successfully.
That's all from me virtually covering the 1st day of the U.S. Pacific Island Country Summit.
Have a great afternoon to all.
