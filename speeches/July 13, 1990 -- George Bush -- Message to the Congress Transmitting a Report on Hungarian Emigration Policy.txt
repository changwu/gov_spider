    To the Congress of the United States:
In October 1989 I determined and reported to the Congress that Hungary meets the emigration criteria of the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974. This determination allowed for the continuation of Hungary's most favored nation (MFN) status without the requirement of an annual waiver.
As required by law, I am submitting a formal report to the Congress concerning emigration laws and policies of the Republic of Hungary. You will find that the report certifies continued Hungarian compliance with U.S. and international standards in the areas of emigration and human rights policy.
