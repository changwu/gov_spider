    Endorsements Announced Ahead of Sanders Events with Farmers and Rural Leaders on Thursday, Friday and Saturday
DES MOINES -- A group of 38 Iowa farmers and rural activists on Thursday endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders for president. The endorsements come as Sanders is set to speak tonight at the Organic Farmers Association and Iowa Organic Association Forum in Story City, the Iowa Farmers Union Presidential Forum on Friday in Grinnell and his Farmer and Rural Economy Town Hall in Iowa Falls on Saturday.
"Rural agriculture is the victim of corporations at both ends of the spectrum," Delaware County farmer Randy Marquardt said. "After 49 years I am considering an exit, not due to health or wanting to retire but rather a desire to do something whereby I can actually make a living. I know Bernie Sanders will fight for families like mine, because he always has."
"Our grassroots movement is earning the support of rural Iowans because we are the only campaign with the vision, courage, and the people power required to save small-town America from corporate greed," Bernie 2020 Iowa State Director Misty Rebik said. "These Iowans are tired of watching corporations swallowing up their farms and local economies. They understand that Bernie Sanders is the candidate they can trust to take on these predatory monopolies, and win."
Sen. Sanders' Revitalizing Rural America plan and his Green New Deal would boost rural economies, mitigate water pollution and promote sustainable farming practices across the country. Sanders will also use antitrust authority to combat abusive corporate monopolies strangling family farms.
