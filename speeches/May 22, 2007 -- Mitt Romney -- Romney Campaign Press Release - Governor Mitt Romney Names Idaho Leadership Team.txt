Boston, MA - Governor Mitt Romney today announced the first 25 members of the Romney for President Idaho Leadership Team, a group of leading Idaho business and community leaders who will support Governor Romney as he campaigns in the state and across the nation. Lt. Governor James E. Risch will serve as Chair of the effort.
"I am excited to join with these leaders from across the state of Idaho to talk about the need to bring real change to Washington," said Governor Romney. "Idaho will be an important state in our campaign to end the status quo and prepare our nation to face a new generation of challenges."
Lt. Gov. James Risch added, "Governor Romney has proven he is a leader who can get the job done whether in business, at the 2002 Olympics, or as the chief executive of his state. We don't have to take him at his word, we can look at his record and know he won't raise taxes, that he will bring spending under control, and that he'll reduce the size of the bureaucracy in our nation's capital. He is the candidate that will make sure our nation remains a world leader."
