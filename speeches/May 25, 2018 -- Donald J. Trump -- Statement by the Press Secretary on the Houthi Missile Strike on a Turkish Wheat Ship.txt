    The United States is alarmed by the Houthi missile strike against a Turkish cargo ship 70 miles off the coast of Yemen that was attempting to deliver 50,000 metric tons of wheat to Yemen's Saleef port near Hudaydah. This proves yet again that missile proliferation in Yemen is a real threat to all countries and underscores the need to fully enforce United Nations Security Council Resolution 2216. Additionally, reporting indicates that the Houthis have attempted another attack against an oil tanker in the Red Sea. By risking the spill of millions of barrels of oil, which could further disrupt commerce and destroy fisheries upon which many Yemenis depend for their food and livelihoods, this action further reflects the Houthis' disregard for the Yemeni people. We deplore the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' diversion of the Iranian people's wealth to exacerbate conflicts in other countries and threaten international commerce. Areas under the Houthi control are suffering. The Houthis should engage meaningfully with the United Nations Special Envoy in order to provide a better future for all Yemenis.
