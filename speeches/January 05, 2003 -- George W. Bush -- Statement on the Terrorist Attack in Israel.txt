    Today terrorists struck again in Israel, murdering and injuring scores of civilians in Tel Aviv. I condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms. It is a despicable act of murder, and I express my condolences to the Government and people of Israel and especially to the families of the victims. Secretary Powell has already spoken to Prime Minister Sharon to convey the condolences of the American people. The United States remains determined to continue our efforts toward peace in the Middle East, a goal that the terrorists seek to destroy. All who genuinely seek peace in the region must join in the effort to stop terror. The United States is determined to continue the global fight against terrorism and against the terrorist organizations that conduct operations such as the murders in Israel today.
