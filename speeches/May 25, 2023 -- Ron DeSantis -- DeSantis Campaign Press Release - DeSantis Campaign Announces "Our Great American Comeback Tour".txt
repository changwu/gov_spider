    Governor DeSantis to Blitz Early States Next Week in First Campaign Events
Governor Ron DeSantis will travel to Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina next week to share his vision for revitalizing America in what will be the initial stops of "Our Great American Comeback Tour." The four-day swing across 12 cities and towns will mark the governor's first public campaign events since his Wednesday night announcement.
"We are laser-focused on taking Governor DeSantis' forward-thinking message for restoring America to every potential voter in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina," said campaign manager Generra Peck. "Our campaign is committed to putting in the time to win these early nominating states.  No one will work harder than Governor DeSantis to share his vision with the country --- he has only begun to fight."
During the tour, Governor DeSantis will conduct speeches, stops, and fireside chats. The events will run from May 30 to June 2 and begin with a campaign kickoff in Des Moines, Iowa.
