    Today, California Congressman Jim Costa issued the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"It's time for Democrats to come together to focus on supporting the best candidate for victory in November. That's why I am joining many of my colleagues to endorse, my friend, Joe Biden for President.
"I've known Joe for many years and he is clearly the most qualified candidate. His experience and extensive domestic and foreign policy background is what our country needs today.
"Above all else, we must have a person that has the empathy and compassion to heal the wounds and bring the divisions in our country together again.
"Vice President Joe Biden best represents the values that offer the hope and promise for America's future."
Costa's endorsement builds on the wide support for Joe Biden in California, which includes prominent leaders like Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steingberg, Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia, Los Angeles County Supervisor and former Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, Congressman Tony CÃ¡rdenas, Congressman Ami Bera, Congressman John Garamendi, Congressman Lou Correa, Congressman Jerry McNerney, and more than 50 others.
Biden leads the field in congressional endorsements with support now from 56 U.S. representatives and seven U.S. senators, including the most endorsements from members of both the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus. The support reflects the broad and diverse coalition Biden has been building to ensure we unite the party, unite the country, and beat Trump.
Biden for President has announced more than 1,500 endorsements from national, state and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, and community leaders.
