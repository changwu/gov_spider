    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Skaggs (D) CO and 42 cosponsors)
The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution would recommend a veto of H.R. 3281 if it were presented to the President in its current form.
H.R. 3281 interferes with the authority and autonomy of the Smithsonian's Board of Regents and duplicates a site selection process the Board has already completed. The General Accounting Office has stated that the Board complied with generally accepted business practices in making its selection.
