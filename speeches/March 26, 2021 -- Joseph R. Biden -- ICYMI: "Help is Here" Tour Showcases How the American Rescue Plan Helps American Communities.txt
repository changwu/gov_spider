    Yesterday, the "Help Is Here" tour highlighted how President Biden's American Rescue Plans helps American communities ? communities in all 50 states and U.S. territories, communities from big cities to rural America, Native American communities to small towns ? recover from the effects of the pandemic.
The direct aid for state, local, territorial, and Tribal governments brings much-needed resources to municipalities and empowers them to ramp up vaccinations, safely reopen their schools, lift up their small businesses, and move their communities forward. Bipartisan governors, mayors, county officials, and local leaders across the country have expressed appreciation for the relief package direct investments in communities struggling in the wake of COVID-19, especially communities that have suffered disproportionately in recent months.
