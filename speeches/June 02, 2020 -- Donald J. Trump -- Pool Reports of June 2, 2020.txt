in-town pool report #11 - Kellyanne Conway gaggle 
Your pooler missed it, but Patsy Widakuswara of VOA took part in a gaggle with Kellyanne Conway a little while ago. Her summary is below, and she notes that C-SPAN has video of the gaggle. Thank you, Patsy!
* Trump did not make the decision on how to secure his movement to St John's yesterday. The authorities made them and already decided to expand the retreat.* Photo op? - you're looking in somebody's heart and second guessing their intention... just because a picture was taken? Called it "sesame street word of the day"* Said EO on international religious freedom has been signed.* Said "it's absolutely the case that there's institutional racism" and inequality for all people in this country but would not say whether Trump believes institutional racism exists.* Phase 4 possible but would not clarify.* No decision on RNC but POTUS wants to keep it in Charlotte.* What was done to Floyd was murder.* No decision on Insurrection Act and nobody wants to get to that point where it's necessary. Dismissed questions on the tone of Trump's remarks as "opinion".* Trump Putin call discussed many issues not just G7 but would not say who initiated.
C-Span has video of the gaggle.
