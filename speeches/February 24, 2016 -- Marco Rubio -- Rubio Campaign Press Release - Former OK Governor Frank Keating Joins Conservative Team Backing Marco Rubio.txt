Former Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating is backing Marco.
Heading into Oklahoma's March 1 primary, conservatives are rallying behind Marco. The former Governor is joining Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe and Congressman Markwayne MullinÂ in endorsing Marco.
Here's why Keating is joining the team:
Before the privilege of serving as Governor of Oklahoma, I had the honor to work in the Reagan administration and witnessed how President Reagan inspired so many when talking about the greatness of our country," Governor Keating said. "Marco Rubio speaks about America the same way. He understands that we are a unique and exceptional nation, and I'm supporting him because I know he is determined to preserve that.
America faces great challenges and we need a president willing to confront them. I have been particularly focused on the high cost of housing that continues to crush middle and lower income Americans and our criminal justice system that is in need of desperate reform. Having looked at Marco's record and listened to what he plans to do as President, I'm confident that he will put forward bold and meaningful solutions that address both of these pressing challenges.
I hope all Oklahomans will join with me in voting for Marco on March 1st so that we can have a nominee that can win this fall and bring back Reagan-style principles back to the White House.
Frank Keating was the Governor of Oklahoma from 1995 to 2003, and held critical positions in the Reagan Administration and the H. W. Bush Administration. Keating was a strong fiscal conservative as governor, who turned conservative principles into action.
Governor Keating, welcome to Team Marco!
