    Spence Abraham has been a valued member of the Cabinet and a strong and steady leader of the Department of Energy. He helped develop our National Energy Policy to reduce our country's reliance on foreign sources of energy and to provide reliable, affordable, and environmentally sound energy for America's future. He launched new technological research initiatives that will lead to the next generation of pollution-free automobiles and clean coal powerplants. In the war on terror, Spence Abraham played a pivotal role in keeping the most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the most dangerous people through his work on nuclear nonproliferation.
I am very grateful for Spence's service and thank him for his sacrifice and hard work for America. I wish him and Jane all the best.
