    To the Congress of the United States:
Public Law 99-190, 99 Stat. 1319, which took effect on December 19, 1985, authorized the President to deny normal trade relations (NTR) tariff treatment to the products of Afghanistan. On January 31, 1986, President Reagan issued a proclamation denying NTR treatment to Afghanistan.
I have determined that it is appropriate to restore NTR treatment to the products of Afghanistan. Restoration of NTR treatment will support U.S. efforts to normalize relations with Afghanistan and facilitate increased trade with the United States, which could contribute to economic growth and assist Afghanistan in rebuilding its economy. Therefore, in accordance with section 118 of Public Law 99-190, I hereby provide notice that I have issued the attached proclamation restoring NTR tariff treatment to the products of Afghanistan. The Proclamation shall take effect 30 days after it is published in the Federal Register.
GEORGE W. BUSH
