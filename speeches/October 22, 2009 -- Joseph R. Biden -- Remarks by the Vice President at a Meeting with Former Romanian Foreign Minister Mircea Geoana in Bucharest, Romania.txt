    VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, thank you. I'm glad to see you again, happy to be with you. The main message that President Obama wanted me to communicate as I tour Central European nations is that Romania is a good friend. We are committed to the strategic partnership, or relationship. We think Article 5 means something. We believe very strongly in building the relationships, and quite frankly, looking to Romania to not only be a bridge to the Caucuses, but to be an example to other Eastern European nations as to how to move towards free-market economies and democracy. And you set a powerful example.
And I'd be remiss if I didn't say to the Romanian people how proud we are to stand with Romanian forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Your soldiers are genuine warriors, they are warriors. There are no caveats. There are no limitations on them. They are brave, and they're the troops that American forces want to (inaudible) with. You should be incredibly proud of your troops, and we are incredibly proud and thankful for their service alongside us in the ISAF forces, particularly in Afghanistan.
So thank you to the mothers and fathers, and husbands and wives, and children of those 1,100 warriors who are taking risk of their time and their life on behalf of freedom. And we want to thank you. We want to thank those families.
