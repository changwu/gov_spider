    As Americans go back to work in record numbers, voters should ask: why would anyone allow Joe Biden – who oversaw the slowest "recovery" since the Great Depression – to spoil it?
Key Takeaways:

The economy added back an incredible 1.4 million jobs in August, the fourth highest one-month job gain in U.S. history

In total, the economy has added back 10.6 million jobs over the last four months, nearly half of all the jobs lost due to the pandemic
The unemployment rate fell to 8.4 percent, seeing the second-largest one month decrease in U.S. history
President Trump's efforts to protect American workers and businesses during the coronavirus epidemic have clearly worked


Experts have consistently and wrongly said such a quick recovery would not happen

The Congressional Budget Office projected the unemployment rate would be 16 percent right now, and that unemployment wouldn't fall below 9.5 percent even in 2021


The American economy is coming back strong, with today's jobs numbers being the latest good news

Weekly jobless claims are trending downwards, beating expectations and falling to their lowest level since mid-March
American manufacturing has grown for four straight months
The stock market has rebounded, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both achieving new record highs
Retail sales have increased three months in a row


President Trump has built the strongest economy in U.S. history, and he will do it again

Joe Biden would be the worst person to put in charge of the economy, having presided over the worst recovery since the Great Depression as Vice President
The economy has recovered 48 percent of the jobs lost due to the coronavirus in the last four months; during Biden's "recovery," it took 27 months to do the same?
The 1.4 million jobs added in August is more than twice as many in the best month of Biden's "recovery"

Under that projection, the unemployment rate at the end of 2021 would be about 6 percentage points higher than the rate in CBO's economic projection produced in January 2020, and the labor force would have about 6 million fewer people."
