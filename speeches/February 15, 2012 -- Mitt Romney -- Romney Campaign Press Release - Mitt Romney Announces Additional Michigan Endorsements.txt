    Mitt Romney today announced the endorsements of former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox, former Senate Majority Leader Mike Bishop, and additional members of the Michigan Legislature and Michigan Republican State Committee.
"I am honored to have such overwhelming support from leaders across Michigan," said Mitt Romney. "Michigan has been home to me. I remember when Michigan was the envy of the nation — I look forward to working with these leaders to bring jobs back and restore Michigan's economy."
"Michigan and the rest of the country can't afford four more years of failed policies from President Obama," said former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox. "Mitt Romney is the Republican Party's best chance to defeat President Obama, repeal Obamacare, cut spending, and appoint Supreme Court Justices who respect the Constitution. Conservatives who are concerned about the direction of our country should join our growing Michigan team in supporting Mitt Romney — four more years of President Obama could be devastating for the country."
Announcing his support, former Senate Majority Leader Mike Bishop said, "Mitt Romney is a conservative businessman — he knows that Washington can't keep spending more than it takes in and mortgaging our children and grandchildren's future. As governor, he balanced his state's budget every year and turned a $3 billion deficit into a $2 billion rainy day fund. That is the exact leadership we need in the White House. It will take someone with Mitt Romney's lifetime of leadership to bring fiscal sanity back to the federal government."
