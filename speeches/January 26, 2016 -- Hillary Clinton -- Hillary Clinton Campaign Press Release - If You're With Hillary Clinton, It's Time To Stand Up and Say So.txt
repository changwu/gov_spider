This is it: We are only six days from the Iowa caucus, the first contest of this campaign.
So if you're standing with Hillary Clinton, it's time to tell her, tell your friends, and tell the world. Your mission for today: Commit to caucus—or vote—for Hillary.
Here's how:
Committing is easy: First, type in your email and ZIP code. Then, add your name and location to complete your personalized commit card. And finally, tell all your friends on social media that you're caucusing (or voting) for Hillary.
Thousands of Americans have already committed—because Hillary is the person we need to fight for our families, protect, and build on President Obama's progress and keep our country moving forward.
But we also know we've got a tough fight on our hands! That's OK—I know this team is ready to fight, ready to win, ready to shatter the highest glass ceiling in America, make some noise, and make some history.
It starts today, and we need you to be a part of it. Let's show our fearless leader that we're ready to take her all the way to the White House.
