    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act, as amended by the Social Security Amendments of 1977 (P.L. 95-216; 42 U.S.C. 433(e)(1)), I transmit herewith the Supplementary Agreement between the United States of America and the Italian Republic on the matter of social security, signed at Rome April 17, 1984.
The U.S.-Italy social security agreement is similar in objective to the social security agreements in force with Belgium, Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Such bilateral agreements, which are generally known as totalization agreements, provide for limited coordination between the United States and foreign social security systems to overcome the problems of gaps in protection and of dual coverage and taxation for workers who move from one country to the other. The present Supplementary Agreement with Italy would amend the original agreement to update and simplify several of its provisions which have caused both countries unforeseen and unnecessary administrative difficulties.
I also transmit for the information of the Congress a comprehensive report prepared by the Department of Health and Human Services, which explains the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement, as well as the effect on social security financing as required by the same provision of the Social Security Act.
The Department of State and the Department of Health and Human Services join with me in commending the U.S.-Italy Supplementary Social Security Agreement and related documents.
