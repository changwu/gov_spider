    Almost 150,000 New Donors Contributed to Harris' Campaign During the Second Quarter 
Average Donation Was $39; Average Online Donation Was $24
Senator Kamala Harris's presidential campaign raised nearly $12 million from more than 279,000 people in the second quarter of 2019. She has raised more than $23 million in this campaign. Almost 150,000 new donors contributed to Harris's campaign during the second quarter.
Harris brought in more than $7 million through her digital program alone. The campaign's average contribution was $39, and the average online contribution was just $24. Harris launched her campaign on January 21 with a promise to reject money from corporate PACs and federal lobbyists.
Harris' campaign brought in nearly half a million dollars this quarter from its online store, which has already sold 1,400 "That Little Girl Was Me" t-shirts that feature a now-viral photo of Harris as a young girl. This was the single best-selling item in the month of June, despite not being available until June 28.
"The momentum Kamala Harris is seeing right now is buoyed by hundreds of thousands of grassroots supporters who believe in her 3AM Agenda to address the issues keeping people up at night," said Harris Campaign Manager Juan Rodriguez. "As it has been from the beginning, this campaign is powered by the people. These resources will help expand Kamala's growing strength in this primary and put her position to win the Democratic nomination."
