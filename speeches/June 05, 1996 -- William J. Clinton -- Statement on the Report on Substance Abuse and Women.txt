    The report by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University (CASA) on "Substance Abuse and the American Woman" reveals the distinctive characteristics of alcohol, tobacco, and drug abuse by women. The report, based on a 2-year study, provides valuable new insights into this pressing problem and documents long-term trends that show young women closing the gender gap with young men in substance abuse.
The report also points out a unique consequence of substance abuse among women, the effect of alcohol, tobacco, and drug use on newborn children. My administration is determined to do all we can to curb alcohol, tobacco, and drug abuse by young Americans, and this report will contribute to that effort. I congratulate Joe Califano, the president of CASA, and the center for their fine work in combating substance abuse. I especially salute Betty Ford for her courage and commitment in devoting her life to helping America deal with drug and alcohol abuse and addiction.
