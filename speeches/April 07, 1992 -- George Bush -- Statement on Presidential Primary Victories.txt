    Today's results are another endorsement of our proposals for fundamental reform. While the Democrats offer only confusion, we are earning a mandate to change America as we changed the world.
This is the message I will continue to take to the American people. We must have schools where students can learn. We must restore reason to our legal system. Quality health care should be available to all. A productive America must be free to compete in world markets. And finally, a Congress frozen in gridlock must be made to work.
