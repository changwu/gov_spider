    WASHINGTON â€“ Today, President Joe Biden announced his intent to nominate David Chipman for Director, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives
David Chipman, Nominee for Director, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives
David Chipman has dedicated over 30 years to public safety and counterterrorism, first as a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and then as an expert on gun violence prevention. As a father, public servant, gun owner, and decorated law enforcement professional Chipman has spent his life serving the public, combating violent crime, and striving to make our nation and our communities safer every day. David spent 25 years in his career in service of ATF's unique mission of enforcing firearms and explosives laws that protect communities from people perpetuating violence and criminal activities, investigating acts of arson, bombings, and terrorism, and combating the illegal trafficking of alcohol and tobacco products.
Throughout his 25-year career at ATF, David also managed complex firearms trafficking cases, including busting organized criminal groups involving the transportation of guns to New York in exchange for illegal drugs in the Tidewater Virginia area. His work building cases against organized criminal groups resulted in significant seizures of firearms and drugs. In honor of his efforts to keep dangerous weapons out of communities, David was awarded the Attorney General's Award for Outstanding Contributions to Community Partnerships for Public Safety.
Since his retirement from the ATF in 2012, David has served as an expert advising organizations at the forefront of gun violence prevention. He was also an appointed member of the International Association of Chiefs of Police's Firearms Committee after helping them establish national gun violence prevention priorities in 2011. Raised in Detroit, David received an undergraduate degree from American University and a master's degree in management from Johns Hopkins University.
