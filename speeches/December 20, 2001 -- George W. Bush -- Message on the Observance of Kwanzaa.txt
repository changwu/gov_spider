    I am pleased to send warm greetings to all who are celebrating Kwanzaa.
Established in 1966, Kwanzaa represents an African-American and Pan-African holiday celebrating family, community, and culture. The seven-day observance, beginning December 26 and ending January 1, serves as a special time to recognize and reaffirm the Nguzo Saba, or Seven Principles, of African culture. These are unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith.
Kwanzaa provides an opportunity for people of African heritage, regardless of their religious background or faith, to come together and to show reverence for their Creator and creation, to commemorate the past, to recommit to high ideals, and to celebrate the good in life. These life-affirming traditions take on particular resonance this year, as the United States and the world face new challenges to peace. As individuals, families, and communities take part in this celebration of unity and of enduring values, I extend best wishes to people throughout the globe for a wonderful and memorable Kwanzaa.
Best wishes on this special occasion.
GEORGE W. BUSH
