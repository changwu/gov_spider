    Memorandum for the United States Trade Representative
After considering various private sector requests for review concerning worker rights in certain beneficiary developing countries, and in accordance with section 502(b)(7) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the Act) (19 U.S.C. 2462(b)(7)), I have determined that the following beneficiary developing countries have taken or are taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights (as defined in section 502(a)(4) of the Act): Thailand, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and Turkey. I am continuing to review the status of such worker rights in another beneficiary developing country, the Central African Republic.
These determinations shall be published in the Federal Register.
