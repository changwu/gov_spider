Gov. Mitt Romney Was Graded A "C" By The Cato Institute In 2006. "[R]omney will likely also be eager to push the message that he was a governor who stood by a no-new-taxes pledge. That's mostly a myth. His first budget included no general tax increases but did include a $500 million increase in various fees. He later proposed $140 in business tax hikes through the closing of "loopholes" in the tax code. … In his budget for 2006, he proposed $170 million more in business tax hikes … If you consider the massive costs to taxpayers that his universal health care plan will inflict once he's left office, Romney's tenure is clearly not a triumph of small-government activism."
