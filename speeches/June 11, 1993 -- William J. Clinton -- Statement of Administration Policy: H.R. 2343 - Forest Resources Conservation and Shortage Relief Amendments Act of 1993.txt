    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 6/14/93)(House)(Unsoeld (D) WA and 15 others)
The Administration has no objection to H.R. 2343.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2343 could increase receipts to the Federal Government; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate is that the pay-as-you-go effect of the bill is zero.
