    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the tragic loss of American soldiers in today's helicopter crash in Afghanistan:
"I was deeply saddened to learn that we lost seven souls in Afghanistan today. Each of them volunteered to serve, knowing we are at war. We owe them deep thanks, unyielding gratitude, and a responsibility to keep the memory of their lives, their virtue, and their valor alive. My thoughts and prayers are with their families and their fellow service members."
