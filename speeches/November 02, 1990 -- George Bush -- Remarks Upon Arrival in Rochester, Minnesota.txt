    I just wanted to say to the people of Minnesota that being here for [Senator] Rudy Boschwitz is something I feel strongly about. Here's a man that had the guts, the courage to stand up and do what was right: getting this deficit down. And he's shown that kind of leadership for Minnesota for a long time. And this is a priority race for us, and I couldn't be more supportive. And I'm just delighted to be here.
