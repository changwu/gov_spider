    
  By Every Measure, Giuliani Is The Real Fiscal Conservative

"There is one Republican candidate in the race with a track record of cutting taxes 23 times and that is Rudy Giuliani. No amount of political spin can help Mitt Romney re-write the history books. Mitt Romney failed to pass a single tax cut as Governor and the Cato Institute gave him a 'C' for his handling of the economy as Governor. Mitt Romney can repackage himself as many times as he wants but his failing fiscal record speaks for itself."

  – Katie Levinson, Communications Director
