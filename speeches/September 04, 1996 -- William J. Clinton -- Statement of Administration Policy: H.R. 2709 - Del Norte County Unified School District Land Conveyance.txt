    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICYThis Statement Has Been Coordinated by OMB with the Appropriate Agencies
(House)(Riggs (R)CA)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 2709, but will work in the Senate to make technical amendments and to require payment of fair market value for conveyance of the land to the Del Norte County Unified School District in California. The failure to require fair market compensation or a land exchange of equivalent value is contrary to Administration policy and would set an undesirable precedent for such land conveyances.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2709 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is zero. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
