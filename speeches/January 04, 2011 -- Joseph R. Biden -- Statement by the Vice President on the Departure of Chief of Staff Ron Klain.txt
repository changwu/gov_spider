    Vice President Joe Biden issued the following statement in response to the announcement by his chief of staff, Ron Klain, that Klain is leaving his post later in January:
"For 25 years, Ron Klain has been my friend and advisor. As my chief of staff in the White House, Ron has done an exceptional job of building my team, implementing my direction on top priorities, and providing invaluable counsel. He has also played a key role in establishing the strong, positive relationship that exists between my staff and the President's team. I am proud of the successes we have had over these two years, and am grateful for the role Ron played in achieving them. I wish him the best of luck as he takes this next step in his career."
