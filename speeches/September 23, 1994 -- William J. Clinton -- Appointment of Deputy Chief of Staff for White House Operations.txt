    The President today named Erskine B. Bowles, currently the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, as his Deputy Chief of Staff for White House Operations. Mr. Bowles, who will also be an Assistant to the President, will take over his new responsibilities on October 3.
In the new White House staff structure, also announced today by Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta, Mr. Bowles will be responsible for internal White House operations as well as the dayto-day activities of the President and will oversee access to the Oval Office.
The offices reporting to him will be the Office of Scheduling and Advance, the Office of Management and Administration, the Office of Presidential Personnel, and the Office of the Staff Secretary, as well as the Director of Oval Office Operations.
"I am very excited that Erskine is coming to the White House," the President said. "As SBA Administrator, he turned around an agency that previous administrations had neglected. It has become a beacon of support for the Nation's small businesses, and it now responds with incredible speed and sensitivity to major disasters. Erskine will undoubtedly bring to the White House the same vigor and creativity with which he has headed the SBA."
