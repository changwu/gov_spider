Des Moines, IA â€“ Citing her strength and experience, and calling her the Democrats' best chance to win the White House, Congressman Leonard Boswell today endorsed Hillary Clinton for President.
Boswell, who has served in Congress for the past decade and is a Vietnam veteran, praised Clinton for her 35 years of experience fighting for change. "Our next leader must have the vision and the know-how to make our country energy independent, bring healthcare to the uninsured and end the war in Iraq," he said. "We need someone with the strength and experience to take on the toughest challenges. We need someone who's got a lifetime record of getting results. I know just the person: my friend, Hillary Clinton."
Boswell also called Clinton the most electable candidate in the race. "The country cannot afford for the Democrats to lose another election. There's too much at stake. She's the most qualified candidate and has the best chance at winning back the White House."
Boswell made his endorsement this morning at a news conference with Clinton in Des Moines. A video announcement was also e-mailed to supporters across Iowa.
"I honored and thrilled to have Congressman Boswell's support," Hillary Clinton said. "As the longest serving Iowa Democratic Member of the House, he understands what is most important to Iowans and their families. We share many of the same values and goals for our country; such as restoring America's standing around the world, ending the war in Iraq and ensuring that every American has health care."
