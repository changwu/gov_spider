    House Armed Services Chairman and California Congressman Buck McKeon today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's foreign policy speech:
"Today, Governor Romney offered a clear alternative to Mr. Obama's 'lead from behind' approach that has left America insecure.  Romney's peace through strength philosophy is a welcome return to American leadership in the world.  Around the globe, our embassies have been besieged, our troops are challenged by scarce resources, and our allies question America's commitment. Mitt Romney understands these aren't 'bumps in the road,' but signs that we are on the wrong track.  While the incumbent is willing to use our national security as leverage for tax increases, Governor Romney is prepared to face our challenges head on and not compound a debt crisis with a national security crisis.  From a clarity of purpose in defense of freedom, to a Defense Department set to meet the threats of the future, the contrast with the path we are on could not be more clear. I am proud to support Mitt Romney.  I know he is the right choice to keep America safe."
