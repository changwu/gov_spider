    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
I have just designated the month of March as Red Cross Month in a Presidential Proclamation. It is a period when we should reflect on the vital role the American Red Cross plays in this nation. We count upon the Red Cross for vital health and safety knowledge, the collection and distribution of blood, services to members of the Armed Forces, veterans and their families, and training our young people to undertake leadership responsibilities.
There are three things we can do to help the Red Cross during March:1. Become a Red Cross volunteer2. Donate blood3. Support your Red Cross chapter's membership and enrollment efforts.
Within the Federal Government, the Red Cross is a part of the Combined Federal Campaign, but more than half of its 3,000 chapters raise all their funds in March. All chapters use the month to inform the public of Red Cross services and to recruit new blood donors and volunteers.
As President of the United States and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, I urge all civilian employees of the Federal Government and members of the Armed Forces to support this voluntary effort to the best of their ability.
