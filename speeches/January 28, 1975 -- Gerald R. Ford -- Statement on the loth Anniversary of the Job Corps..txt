    FOR TWO centuries, America has stood for freedom and opportunity--a land where every boy and girl could advance in life as far as their talents carried them.
Despite this proud national heritage, skin color, language barriers, poverty, or other factors beyond their control have denied many of our fellow citizens the chance to share fully in the American dream.
For hundreds of thousands of these disadvantaged Americans, the national Job Corps over the past decade has opened a path to a better life. By giving them a chance to prepare for meaningful and rewarding employment, it has offered the disadvantaged a chance to help themselves.
In the 10 years since its founding, the Job Corps has provided 500,000 young people with opportunities to learn marketable job skills. It has provided special education, vocational training, work experience, avocational activities, health care, and counseling.
With the support of business, labor, religious, civic, and fraternal groups, the Job Corps over the past decade has opened a path to a better life. By giving them a chance to prepare for meaningful and rewarding employment, it has offered the disadvantaged a chance to help themselves.
On this 10th anniversary, I welcome the opportunity to call upon all my fellow citizens to join in saluting the Job Corps, its dedicated staff, and all those who have been associated with its worthwhile activities.
