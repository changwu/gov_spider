HOUSTON, Texas — U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, drew the same amount of Facebook interactions on the day of his Presidential campaign launch as the next four ranked GOP candidates combined on their respective announcement dates. According to data provided by Facebook to POLITICO, Sen. Cruz leads the Republican field in both unique mentions and interactions on the social networking site.
"Social media is the new 'coffee shop' where neighbors, friends, colleagues, and family gather to discuss issues, talk about the candidates, and influence others," Cruz campaign manager Jeff Roe said. "That is the most important space to succeed as a candidate, especially early on. The opinions of your friends on Facebook or Twitter are far more influential than what any pundit may say on TV. Headcount matters more than headlines."
A recent study conducted by George Washington University and Zignal Labs showed that Cruz's "share of voice" on social media during his launch was 27 percent, nearly triple that of his closest GOP rivals during their respective launches. That means that better than one-in-four discussions about the presidential race included a mention of Cruz, while others lagged by about one-in-ten.
"That's a great sign for us because that's where you start to create volunteers, supporters, donors, and ultimately the people who show up and vote for you on Election Day," Roe added. "Our strong positioning across social media mirrors growing ground operations we are building in the states, both early states and beyond."
In recent weeks, Sen. Cruz has announced dozens of volunteers who have joined our on-the-ground campaign operations in nine states: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada, Michigan, California, Tennessee, New Jersey, and North Carolina.
