Boston, MA - Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement regarding Cuban Independence Day, which takes place on Sunday:
"On this 105th anniversary of Cuban Independence, we remember the Cuban patriots who set Cuba on her path to freedom. We also honor the extraordinary contributions of Cuban-Americans to our nation. Their patriotism, talents and family values have made America a stronger nation.
"While we commemorate the spirit and values that drove Cuba's Independence movement, we also deplore the Castro regime's contempt for the Cuban people's dignity and inherent right to be free. Fortunately, the legacy of Cuba's founding fathers lives on in the courage of today's pro-democratic movement, which serves as an inspiration to the world. They give us great hope that the dark cloud that continues to hang over Cuba, even on festive days, will soon be gone."
