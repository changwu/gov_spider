    On this Yom HaShoah, I join people of all faiths in the United Sates, in the State of Israel, and around the world in remembering the 6 million Jews—innocent men, women, and children—who were senselessly murdered during the Holocaust, as well as all the victims of Nazi brutality and violence.
Even as we mourn those whose lives were taken, this day also provides us with an opportunity to honor those who emerged from the darkness of the Shoah to rebuild their lives in new communities around the world. I am honored to have the opportunity to address survivors of the Holocaust, along with many of those who have worked so hard to preserve their testimony and share their stories, when I speak at the Shoah Foundation next week. On this Yom HaShoah, let us recommit ourselves to the task of remembrance and to always oppose anti-Semitism wherever it takes root. Together, we must give enduring meaning to the words "never again."
