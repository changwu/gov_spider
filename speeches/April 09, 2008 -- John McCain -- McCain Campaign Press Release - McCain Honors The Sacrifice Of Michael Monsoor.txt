    Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator John McCain today attended a Medal of Honor ceremony at the White House in honor of Michael A. Monsoor, a Navy SEAL who sacrificed his own life in order to save his comrades. Following the ceremony, Senator McCain released the following statement:
"It was a privilege to be present today as the Medal of Honor was posthumously bestowed on Navy SEAL Michael Monsoor. Faced with the choice of saving his own life or the lives of others, he forswore his own safety for those of his comrades. His sacrifice is an inspiration to me and bears testament to the bravery and commitment of our men and women in uniform.
"Michael Monsoor embodied the meaning of the word 'honor.' It is a privilege beyond measure to live in a country served so well by such selfless patriots. His life, and his sacrifice, will not be forgotten."
