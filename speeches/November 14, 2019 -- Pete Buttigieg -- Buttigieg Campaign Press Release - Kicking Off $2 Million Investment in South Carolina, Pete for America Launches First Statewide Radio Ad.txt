Here's Democrat Pete Buttigieg:
This country cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump.
We know that he is going to do everything he can to hold onto power. But if you nominate me, his playbook isn't going to work this time around.
I don't have to throw myself a military parade to see what a convoy looks like 'cause I was driving one around Afghanistan right about the time this president was taping Season 7 of The Celebrity Apprentice.
But I didn't just come here to end the era of Donald Trump, I am here to launch the era that must come next.
To do something about gun violence, to tackle systemic racism wherever we find it until your race in this country has no bearing on your health, or your wealth, your life expectancy or your relationship with law enforcement.
An American experience defined not by exclusion, but by belonging.
I am Pete Buttigieg and I approve this message. Paid for by Pete for America
