    Yesterday, the Florida LGBTQ+ Democratic Caucus President Stephen Gaskill announced his endorsement of Joe Biden. Gaskill's endorsement came as he delivered opening remarks at the Florida LGBTQ+ Democratic Caucus Winter Conference, which Jill Biden attended.
Gaskill's endorsement followed the Florida LGBTQ+ Democratic Caucus' internal survey, which showed Biden receiving 84% of the vote from its membership.
On Friday, Vice President Biden released his plan to advance LGBTQ+ equality in America and around the world.
Gaskill join more than 50 leaders across Florida that have endorsed Joe Biden for President, including former Senators Bill Nelson and Bob Graham, and current Members of Congress Kathy Castor, Charlie Crist, Val Demmings, Ted Deutch, Lois Frankel, Alcee Hastings, Al Lawson, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Darren Soto, and Frederica Wilson. Biden also has the most support from more Members of Congress of any candidate in the race, with more than 80 members backing him. Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,700 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
Biden's endorsements showcase the diversity of support for Vice President Biden in Florida and across the country, as well as the trust that these leaders have in his ability to beat Donald Trump, restore the soul of this nation, rebuild the middle class, and bring the country together.
