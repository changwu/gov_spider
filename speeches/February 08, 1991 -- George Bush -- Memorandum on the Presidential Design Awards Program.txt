    Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
Every year the Federal Government helps design products that become a part of daily American life. Professional designers working for Federal departments and agencies are instrumental in the production of everything from postage stamps to highways. Our Nation has good reason to take pride in the high standards of quality and innovation these designers have set.
For almost two decades the National Endowment for the Arts has helped to promote design excellence through the Federal Design Improvement Program, and I am delighted to further those efforts by announcing today Round Three of the Presidential Design Awards. These awards, first established in 1983, publicly recognize exemplary achievements in Federal design work and honor those individuals in Federal service and private industry who have pursued excellence in design.
I have asked Chairman John Frohnmayer of the National Endowment for the Arts to implement the Presidential Design Awards Program. I know he will enjoy your full and enthusiastic support. Please designate an individual with an appropriate background and position to be your liaison with the Endowment to help ensure the success of this program.
George Bush
