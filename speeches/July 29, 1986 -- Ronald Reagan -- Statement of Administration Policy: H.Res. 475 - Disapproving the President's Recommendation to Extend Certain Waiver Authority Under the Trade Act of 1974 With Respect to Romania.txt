    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Crane (R) Illinois and 34 others)
The Administration opposes H.Res. 475. In extending most favored nation (MFN) status to Romania, the President recently concluded that continuation of MFN status to Romania would not only substantially promote the objectives of the Trade Act concerning emigration, but also would enable us to continue to have an impact on human rights concerns, and to help strengthen the extent of religious observance in Romania.
In addition, even a temporary suspension of MFN status would induce Romania to rely on other trading partners and would irrevocably destroy business relationships which have taken years to develop.
The President remains very concerned about the situation in Romania. He has ordered the Secretary of State to report to him on the situation on religious freedom in Romania every six months and to continue to submit periodic reports on Romanian emigration and human rights performance.
Finally, the Department of Justice advises that under the Supreme Court's decision in INS v Chadha, the one House veto device in Sec. 402 (d) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2432 (d)) is unconstitutional, and therefore H.Res. 475 would have no legal force and effect to alter the President's determination of June 3, 1986.
