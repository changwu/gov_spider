    Dallas, Texas -- Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee issued the following statement today:
"The shootings in Colorado were horrific. Janet and I want to extend our thoughts and prayers -- first and foremost, to the victims and their families, as well as to all of those whose lives were touched by this needless tragedy. I want to also commend Security Guard Jeanne Assam for her bravery and act of heroism. Ms. Assam's statements that she was guided by the Holy Spirit, in the face of great danger, are inspiring and remind us of what we mere mortals can achieve when we allow ourselves to be instruments of our Creator. Now is the time for healing. May God bless those who were affected by this tragedy, and our great nation."
