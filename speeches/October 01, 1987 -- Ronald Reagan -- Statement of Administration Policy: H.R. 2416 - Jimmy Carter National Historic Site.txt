    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Ray (D) Georgia and 9 others)
The administration opposes H.R. 2416. The proposed Jimmy Carter National Historic Site in Plains, Georgia is unnecessarily large, including the 12-acre Plains High School site, which needs $1.5 million in repairs. In addition, the bill's preservation district, which includes 525 acres in which the Secretary of the Interior would be authorized to acquire preservation easements, is unnecessary and would cost about $3.75 million. Finally, the administration believes that, in lieu of H.R. 2416, Congress should enact legislation to preserve properties associated with all three living former Presidents in a single comprehensive bill, such as the substitute bill offered to the House Interior Committee by the Department of the Interior in its testimony on H.R. 2416.
