    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Hollings (D) South Carolina and 32 others)
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recently published a proposed rule restricting seating in the exit rows of aircraft to persons able to perform certain functions necessary in emergency evacuations. The proposed rule furthers safety for all passengers, and applies neutrally to all persons unable to perform these functions, regardless of the reason. Just as it would be discriminatory to subject only the blind to this test, it would be discriminatory against other functionally impaired persons to exempt the blind. The Administration, therefore, opposes enactment of S. 341.
