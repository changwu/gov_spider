    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Young (D) Missouri and 3 others)
The Administration does not support House passage of H.R. 2416, but supports the approach in S. 1706, a related Senate bill, which would require the Architect of the Capitol, in cooperation with the Union Station Development Corporation, to report to the Congress on alternatives for an office building for the administrative agencies of the Federal Judiciary.
