    Clinton Campaign Posts Web Video Responses To Questions From Young Voters
The Clinton Campaign continued its outreach initiative targeted at young voters today, posting a web video featuring Hillary answering questions posed by young voters around last week's ABC/Facebook debate.
Thousands of questions poured in after the campaign reached out to Facebook and "Hillblazers" supporters, asking them to pose questions directly to Hillary.
"I'm excited that so many young people are engaging in the democratic process and making their voices heard this year," Clinton said. "I want to hear from them directly about their hopes and concerns for the future, and let them know I will go to work on Day One to make change happen for them in the White House."
Five of the most popular questions were selected for Hillary to answer, on issues ranging from Darfur, to college affordability, to America's energy policy.
Hillary's answers are now posted at http://www.hillaryclinton.com/video/101.aspx.
The web video is the latest in a series of campaign efforts to reach young voters. Last week in New Hampshire, Hillary held a conversation and roundtable with young, undecided voters to discuss the most pressing issues facing them.
