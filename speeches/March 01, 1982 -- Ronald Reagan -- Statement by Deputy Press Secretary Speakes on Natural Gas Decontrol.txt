    The President announced today that he will not ask Congress to accelerate the current schedule of partial natural gas decontrol at this time. After extensive consultation with congressional leaders and groups representing producers and consumers, the President concluded that much-needed changes to the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 would overload an already heavy legislative agenda.
In making this announcement, the President stressed that natural gas decontrol remains an essential component of a sound energy policy.
