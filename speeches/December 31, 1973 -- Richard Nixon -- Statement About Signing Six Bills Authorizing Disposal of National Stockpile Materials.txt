    I HAVE signed six bills (S. 2413, S. 2316, S. 2498, S. 2551, S. 2493, and S. 2166), which will give the General Services Administration the authority to sell approximately $900 million of aluminum, copper, zinc, molybdenum, silicon carbide, and opium which are currently stockpiled by the Federal Government but which are no longer needed for national defense purposes.
The Congress, and particularly the Armed Services Committees, deserve appreciation and commendation for their constructive review of the supply and demand factors which make these disposals possible without detriment to our national security interests.
In order to facilitate a timely review of other unneeded materials which have been proposed for disposal, I am requesting the General Services Administration to provide the Congress with data on them comparable to the information presented in connection with the disposal bills I have signed into law.
