    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesSubject: Red Cross Month, 1983
March has just been designated Red Cross Month by Presidential Proclamation. It is a period when the American Red Cross will seek to swell its ranks of volunteers to carry on its vital service to this Nation. We depend upon the Red Cross for the collection and distribution of blood, for vital health and safety knowledge, for services to members of the military, veterans and their families, for help in times of disaster, and for training young people to undertake the responsibilities of leadership.
We, as Federal employees, can do much to assure that Red Cross Month is a success by becoming a Red Cross volunteer, by donating blood and by supporting our Red Cross chapter's membership and enrollment efforts.
Within the Federal government, the Red Cross is a part of the Combined Federal Campaign, while more than half of its 3,000 chapters raise all of their funds during March. All chapters, however, will use the month to inform the public of Red Cross services and to recruit new blood donors and volunteers.
As President of the United States and as Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, I urge all civilian employees of the Federal government and members of the Armed Forces to support this voluntary effort.
RONALD REAGAN
