    IN 1943, four chaplains died heroically in a gesture of unselfish love for others. In the disaster which befell the transport ship Dorchester, they gave up their lives in order to save other fellow countrymen on board.
It is most appropriate that Civitan International has dedicated the week of February 1-7, 1976, to commemorate the supreme sacrifice of these four chaplains and in this way to honor clergymen everywhere. I am sure that the members of Civitan are joined by all Americans at this time in expressing appreciation to those who continue to work humbly and to serve both God and man.
