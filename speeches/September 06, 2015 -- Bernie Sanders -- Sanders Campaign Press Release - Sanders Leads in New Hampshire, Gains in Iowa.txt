    BURLINGTON, Vt. â€“ A new pair of NBC News/Marist polls released on Sunday showed Sen. Bernie Sanders has at least a nine-point lead in New Hampshire and has gained ground among Iowa voters.
"Bernie is leading the fight to rebuild the disappearing American middle class and take on the greed of the billionaire class. These new polls confirm that the more voters get to know Bernie the better they like him and what he stands for," said Sanders' spokesman Michael Briggs.
In New Hampshire, NBC News said Sanders has the support of 41 percent of Democratic voters, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gets 32 percent and Vice President Joe Biden gets 16 percent. Without Biden in the race, Sanders leads by 11 points, 49 percent to 38 percent. The last time the poll was conducted in July, Clinton was ahead of Sanders in the Granite State by 10 points.
In Iowa, Sanders showed dramatic improvement in his margin of support since the last NBC News/Marist poll and has now pulled to within 11 points of the front-runner.
