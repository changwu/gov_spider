    Campaign plans to be on the air for next four weeks in Iowa
WASHINGTON â€“ Congressman John K. Delaney's second campaign spot is on the air in Iowa. The ad, titled "Early" can be viewed online here. On Sunday, Delaney ran his first commercial, "Dirty Word" in the Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, Davenport and Sioux City markets during the Super Bowl.
The two ads are part of a million-dollar, month-long Iowa television buy from the Delaney campaign that will include multiple ads. Delaney made his sixth campaign trip to Iowa this weekend.
The ad's script:
Voice over:
Most Iowans understand the concept of starting early
After all
There's an awful lot of work to be done
John Delaney:
How do we bring our country together?
How do we begin to heal a fractured nation?
Voice over:
The work starts now
