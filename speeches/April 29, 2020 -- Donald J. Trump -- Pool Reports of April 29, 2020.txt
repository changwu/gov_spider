In-town pool report #2 - Gilead
Pool was ushered into Oval Office at 11:41 a.m., where POTUS was meeting with Louisiana Gov. Edwards.
Trump and Edwards were seated in chairs in front of the fireplace. A chart with PPE numbers was set up between them.
In the room sitting on couches were Drs. Fauci and Birx, VP Pence, economic adviser Kevin Hassett, and Dr. Blythe Adamson, senior quantitative scientist at Flatiron Health, who Trump introduced as having helped the administration temporarily.
Question about Gilead trials, but Trump deferred to Fauci. Gilead Sciences has been reporting positive results for its remdesivir.
Fauci rough transcript:
So that's something that will go with 31% improvement, doesn't seem like a knock out, 100%, it is a very important proof of concept.
This is very optimistic, the mortality rate trended towards being better in the sense of less deaths in the REM designate group. 8% versus 11% in the placebo group.
So bottom line. You're going to hear more details about this this will be submitted to a peer reviewed journal, and will be peer reviewed appropriately.
"But certainly it's a, it's a positive it's a very positive event," Trump said in response.

In-town pool report #9
Trump started speaking about 4:18 p.m. at a long table with participants well-spaced.
Trump's initial remarks were generally about working well with governors and everyone wanting to open up businesses and get back to work.
VP Pence said as we come to the end of this mitigation period, states across the country at all embrace the same social distancing efforts & the American people have put them in practice.
Testing will be a part of how we move to the next stage, Pence said. We expect by next month, very quickly, the capacity to do more than 2 million tests a week, he said.
Chris Nassetta, CEO of Hilton, was the first industry executive to speak, and he described the deep-cleaning precautions the hotel chain was using to reassure guests.
Walt Ehmer, CEO of Waffle House, said some dine-in restaurants in Georgia were able to open this week and it was welcomed by the public. Ehmer said additional social distancing is now in place, with restaurants at about half-capacity.
Some debate about whether WH stands for White House or Waffle House.
Chris Reynolds at Toyota said 100+ new safety protocols were being put in place for factory workers to contain the virus. Plan to open May 11, but slowly, and with staggered shifts, he said.
Trump asked about Toyota facilities in Japan, where some facilities were open in some places.
Matt Maddox, CEO of Wynn Resorts, said he was urging phase one opening soon in Nevada, and hopefully the Vegas strip could open by Memorial Day.
Josh Bolten of the Business Roundtable said this was a critical time and opening will depend on several elements, but safety first. Bolten said more detailed guidance for reopening is needed now. And more testing and monitoring is needed.
Larry Kudlow predicted markets would rebound next year.
Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia said UI benefits were now being delivered in all 50 states. Working on guidelines for employers and are hearing from workers who are concerned about returning to work, he said.
I'm response to a question, Trump said there is tremendous pent-up demand to get out to restaurants and hotels.
On whether FDA should grant emergency use authorization for Gilead's drug remdesivir, Trump said he wanted the agency to move quickly.
On whether he was open to deal to let US Postal Service borrow from Treasury without raising shipping rates for packages, Trump appeared disinclined.
Trump declined to put a date on when he wanted to see the country reopened, other than as soon as possible. He noted most businesses are opening slowly with reduced seats or other limits.
"This virus is going to be gone," but have to wait till it's gone, Trump said.
A lot of progress is being made on a vaccine, Trump said. Looking for therapeutics as well. Unclear whether full opening will happen before or after vaccine.
Trump said he was not going to let oil companies get in trouble, saving other industries. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said looking at several strategies, such as potentially storing additional oil. Trump said a plan could be announced shortly.
Trump said he was traveling to Arizona next week for an industry event, but it's too soon to be able to hold huge political rallies.
Said it would be a terrible thing to lose 65,000 people, but could have been worse without early action.
After making additional general remarks on reopening, Trump ended his comments at 5:30 p.m.
