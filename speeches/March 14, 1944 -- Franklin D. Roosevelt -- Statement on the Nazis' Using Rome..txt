    Everyone knows the Nazi record on religion. Both at home and abroad, Hitler and his followers have waged a ruthless war against the churches of all faiths.
Now the German army has used the Holy City of Rome as a military center. No one could have been surprised by this—it is only the latest of Hitler's many affronts to religion. It is a logical step in the Nazi policy of total war—a policy which treats nothing as sacred.
We on our side have made freedom of religion one of the principles for which we are fighting this war. We have tried scrupulously-often at considerable sacrifice to spare religious and cultural monuments, and we shall continue to do so.
