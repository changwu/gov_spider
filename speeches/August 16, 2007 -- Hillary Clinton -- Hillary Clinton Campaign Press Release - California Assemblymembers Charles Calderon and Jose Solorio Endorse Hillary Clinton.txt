    The Clinton Campaign announced today the endorsement of two California State Assemblymen, Charles Calderon and Jose Solorio who stated that Senator Clinton's breadth of experience makes her the strongest of all the presidential candidates.
Assemblyman Solorio, Chairman of the Assembly Public Safety Committee, represents the 69th District of California. Throughout his term, Solorio has been an advocate for the fight against gang violence. He noted Senator Clinton's approach to healthcare and education is commendable and corresponds with much of his own platform.
"I support Senator Clinton for President because she's the most qualified. She was extremely accomplished as the First Lady of the United States, and based on her broad background, she's in the best position to rebuild our country's image abroad as well as get our country back on track here," said Solorio.
Assemblyman Calderon of California's 56th District threw his support behind Senator Clinton as well. He has been a leader in California government since 1982. Calderon has been elected as both an Assemblymember and a State Senator, and has recently been appointed California Health Care Commissioner. He was also the first Latino elected as Senate Majority Leader in 1996. Calderon said that Senator Clinton is someone who will lead America with fresh perspective.
"We need a new vision and direction for America that we can trust," Calderon said. "Hillary will bring a new and different view of domestic and world issues, but it will be one guided by her 35 years of experience. I believe in Hillary Clinton; she gives me hope for the safety and future of our country."
