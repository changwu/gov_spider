    Vice President Biden met today with President Ivo Josipovic of Croatia to emphasize continued U.S. engagement in promoting progress and stability in Europe. The Vice President commended President Josipovic for Croatia's progress on domestic reforms, especially in strengthening the rule of law and fighting corruption. The U.S. is confident that these reforms are irreversible, and strongly supports Croatia's aspiration to conclude its European Union accession negotiations in the near future. The Vice President noted that Croatia's further European integration would send a positive message to the rest of the region of the value of undertaking reforms and supporting reconciliation. The Vice President also expressed U.S. appreciation for Croatia's important work as a NATO ally, including its contributions to the International Security Assistance Force, where its military and police are helping train Afghan forces, and playing a leading role at the Afghan Military Police Academy in Kabul. The two leaders also discussed the political situation in southeast Europe. The Vice President praised President Josipovic's leadership in healing wounds and building bridges in that region.
