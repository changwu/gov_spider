Pastor Andrew Brunson released by Turkey will be with me in the Oval Office at 2:30 P.M. (this afternoon). It will be wonderful to see and meet him. He is a great Christian who has been through such a tough experience. I would like to thank President @RT_Erdogan for his help!Retweets: 16916Favorites: 75130

There was NO DEAL made with Turkey for the release and return of Pastor Andrew Brunson. I don't make deals for hostages. There was however great appreciation on behalf of the United States which will lead to good perhaps great relations between the United States & Turkey!Retweets: 24261Favorites: 101249
