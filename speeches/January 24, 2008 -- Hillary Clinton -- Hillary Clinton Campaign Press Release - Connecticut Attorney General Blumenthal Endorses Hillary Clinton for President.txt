    HARTFORD â€“ Continuing to build on her momentum here in Connecticut, Hillary Clinton was endorsed today by Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal at a press conference this morning outside of the Capital.
"I have known Hillary for over 35 years, and I know the compassion, energy, and intellect that she would bring to the White House," said Blumenthal. "Hillary has the experience and determination to be a historic leader for our country. Now, more than ever, we need a President ready to lead on Day One and I know that candidate is Hillary Clinton."
Blumenthal was elected Attorney General of Connecticut in 1990 and is currently serving in his 5th term. Blumenthal has dedicated his career to standing up for the people of Connecticut, especially children. As Attorney General, he has been a leader on protecting our children from online predators, environmental stewardship, labor rights, consumer protection, and the fight against big tobacco.
"I am grateful to have such strong support in Connecticut, especially from such a well respected leader like Dick," said Senator Hillary Clinton. "Dick and I share the same concerns when it comes to this country's future, especially when it comes to children and families. I look forward to working closely with him both in this campaign and as President."
Blumenthal's endorsement comes after several announcements this week from the Clinton campaign. Yesterday, the campaign unveiled its first television for Connecticut, "Warned." In recent days the campaign has also announced a growing list of supporters including a Connecticut Women for Hillary Council, the Connecticut chapter of AFT, and the endorsements of former State Democratic Party Chair George Jepsen, Stamford Mayor Dan Malloy, and Bridgeport Mayor Bill Finch.
