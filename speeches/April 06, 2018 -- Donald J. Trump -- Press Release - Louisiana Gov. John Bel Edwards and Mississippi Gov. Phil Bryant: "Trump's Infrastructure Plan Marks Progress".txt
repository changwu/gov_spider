The president's infrastructure proposal validates the struggles governors, mayors and local business and industrial leaders are facing in rural communities in our states. This plan demonstrates a commitment to improving rural infrastructure through a block grant process that prioritizes community needs while engaging local leaders. A large percentage of rural state highways in this region serves as the backbone of an agriculture network that fuels and feeds the world.
