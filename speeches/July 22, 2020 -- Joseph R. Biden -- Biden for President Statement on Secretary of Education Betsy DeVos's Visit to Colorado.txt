    In response to Secretary Betsy DeVos's virtual closed-door event with the Federalist Society in Colorado, Biden for President Colorado State Director Ernie Apreza released the following statement:
"Betsy DeVos has consistently proven that she is unfit to deliver for Colorado's educators, students, and their families. Instead of putting students and educators first, Betsy DeVos and Donald Trump are bent on pushing localities to rush students back to school amidst a global health pandemic and furthering the exploitative practices of for-profit schools. With Joe and Jill Biden, educators will get two partners in the White House. A Biden Administration will fight tooth and nail to support educators and invest real resources in our schools."
