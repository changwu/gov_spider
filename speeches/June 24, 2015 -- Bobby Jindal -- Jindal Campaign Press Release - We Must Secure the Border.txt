    President Obama is responsible for keeping America safe, and he has repeatedly failed at the simple task of securing our southern border. We have a flood of illegal immigrants sweeping across the border and President Obama's naive assumption that they are all friendly workers is downright dangerous. We need to strictly monitor who enters and exits our country. Sign the petition if you believe America needs secure borders.
