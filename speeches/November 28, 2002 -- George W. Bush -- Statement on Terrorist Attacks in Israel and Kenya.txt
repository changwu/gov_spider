    I condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the terrorist attacks today at the Likud Party polling place in northern Israel and the Paradise Hotel in Mombasa, Kenya, as well as the attempted attack on a civilian airliner shortly after it took off from Mombasa's international airport. I want to extend my condolences to the victims and their families, and to the governments and peoples of Israel and Kenya. Today's attacks underscore the continuing willingness of those opposed to peace to commit horrible crimes. Those who seek peace must do everything in their power to dismantle the infrastructure of terror that makes such actions possible. The United States remains firmly committed, with its partners around the world, to the fight against terror and those who commit these heinous acts.
