    Julie Edwards, Oregon Communications Director: "If Senator Obama was committed to ending our dependence on foreign oil and preserving our environment, why did he vote for Dick Cheney's boondoggle energy bill? Not only did the bill give away billions to oil and gas companies, it undercut the ability of states like Oregon to have a say in where liquefied natural gas lines and terminals will be located."
Today, Sen. Obama's Oregon campaign is holding events to highlight his record on environmental issues. However, these events will leave out his vote on the most important environmental issue Obama faced during his time in the Senate - his support of Dick Cheney's 2005 Energy Bill.
Critically for Oregon, the energy bill Sen. Obama supported also cut states out of the loop in deciding where liquefied natural gas (LGN) lines and terminals will be located.
Hillary Clinton opposed the bill, which was written in secret with the oil industry. She has a plan to eliminate oil industry tax breaks, and would require oil companies to contribute to a $50 billion strategic energy fund to jumpstart research and investment in clean energy technologies.
Hillary announced a series of initiatives in Oregon earlier this month to address the twin challenges of global warming and our reliance on foreign oil. Her plan will work with states like Oregon that are leading the green revolution to help unleash a wave of private sector innovation and create at least 5 million new green collar jobs over the next decade.
