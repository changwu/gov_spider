    I welcome the Senate's passage of the department of education bill.
Education is a key factor in the development not only of individual citizens but of the country as a whole. Yet it is often overlooked or, at best, given second-rate attention in important policy discussion. I believe that this is unacceptable in a nation where all levels of government spend ever-increasing amounts of money for education while getting less results in the actual performance of our students.
Creation of a department of education, which I set as a priority in this year's State of the Union address, is one important step we can take to improve education in America. It will bring to the Cabinet the leadership needed to direct broad attention to education matters. It will establish Cabinet-level accountability for Federal education programs, exposing them to far greater scrutiny by the President, the Congress, and the public.
Decisions on the running of local school systems need to be made at the community level, as close as possible to the control of the parents themselves. A department of education will enable the Federal Government to do a better job of helping States and local communities carry out their educational responsibilities.
I want to thank Majority Leader Byrd and Chairman Ribicoff for their leadership in gaining Senate passage of the department of education bill. I urge the House of Representatives to act promptly on this measure.
