She is a third rate reporter who has nothing going. A Fake News "journalist". https://t.co/SopsC7uMMfRetweets: 17378Favorites: 69256

I love Michigan, one of the reasons we are doing such a GREAT job for them during this horrible Pandemic. Yet your Governor, Gretchen "Half" Whitmer is way in over her ahead, she doesn't have a clue. Likes blaming everyone for her own ineptitude! #MAGARetweets: 10235Favorites: 40807

Such Fake reporting by the @nytimes, @washingtonpost, @CNN & others. They use a small portion of a sentence out of a full paragraph in order to demean. They really are corrupt and disgusting. No wonder the media is, according to polls, record setting low & untrusted. #MAGARetweets: 34951Favorites: 143195

So much of the Lamestream Media is writing and broadcasting stories with facts that are made up and knowingly wrong. They are doing it by quoting unnamed sources that simply do not exist. These are very dangerous & corrupt people, who will do anything to win. NAME YOUR SOURCES!Retweets: 44740Favorites: 200619

One of the reasons that Fake News has become so prevalent & far reaching is the fact that corrupt "journalists" base their stories on SOURCES that they make up in order to totally distort a narrative or story. When you see, "five sources say", don't believe the story, it is....Retweets: 38076Favorites: 170207

....very often FAKE NEWS. Lamestream Media should be forced to reveal sources, very much as they did in the long ago past. If they did that, the media would be trusted again, and Fake News would largely be a thing if the past!Retweets: 8018Favorites: 33741
