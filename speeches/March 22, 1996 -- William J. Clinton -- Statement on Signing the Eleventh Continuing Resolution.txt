    Today I have signed into law H.J. Res. 165, the eleventh continuing resolution for fiscal 1996.
House Joint Resolution 165 provides for a temporary extension of appropriations—March 23 through March 29—for activities funded in four of the five appropriations bills that have not been enacted into law. For AFDC/Foster Care, funding is provided through April 3 to avoid disruption of payments to States, which are normally made on the first of each month. The District of Columbia receives no new Federal funds, but retains authority to use local funds.
The reason that I must sign yet another continuing resolution is that the Congress still has not passed five of this year's appropriations bills in acceptable form. If I do not sign this measure the Government will shut down for a third time.
Six months through the fiscal year, almost three-quarters of the nondefense budget of the Federal Government is being provided through this continuing resolution rather than through enactment of freestanding appropriations bills. For the sake of school districts and others who depend on these funds, this cannot continue. As we work to balance the budget and control discretionary spending, we must protect our Nation's investments in education, the environment, law enforcement, and technology.
Therefore, I urge the Congress to send me legislation for the remaining fiscal 1996 appropriations bills in acceptable form, and to do so before it adjourns for the Easter recess. We must work to resolve our differences over this legislation. I am committed to doing so.
