    Nancy and I are pleased to send warmest greetings to all those celebrating this Lunar New Year, 4682, the Year of the Rat.
This is a special time for Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese Americansâ€”a time for reflection on the accomplishments of the past year and planning for continued success in the year to come. All of us should look to the future with renewed hope, ready to dream new dreams for the betterment of all peoples.
I commend you for preserving your rich cultural heritage by participating in this joyous festival. You have given much to our country. Your talent, hard work, and initiative helped build this nation and have rewarded you with success and prosperity.
We wish you the very best for an enjoyable season and for peace and happiness in the year to come.
RONALD REAGAN
