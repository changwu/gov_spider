    In honor of International Holocaust Remembrance Day on Saturday, January 27, 2018, First Lady Melania Trump visited the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum today to pay respect to the six million Jews lost in the Holocaust and the millions of other victims of Nazi persecution.
"My thoughts and prayers are with the people whose lives and families were broken by the horrors of the Holocaust. Yet it is also through our shared humanity that we come together now in commemoration, strength, and love. My heart is with you, and we remember."
Mrs. Trump participated in a tour of the museum, accompanied by Holocaust Memorial Museum Director Sara Bloomfield. The tour recounted the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany from 1933 through 1939, the evolution of the party through the 1940s and its policies toward the Jewish people, and the liberation of Nazi concentration camps in 1945 by the Allied forces.
The First Lady concluded her tour at the Hall of Remembrance, participating in a moment of silence by the Eternal Flame Memorial, followed by a lighting of a candle at the Prayer Wall.
