    To the Senate of the United States:
I am transmitting for the Senate's advice and consent to ratification the Consular Convention between the United States of America and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, along with the Agreed Memorandum and related exchange of notes, signed at Prague on July 9, 1973. I also am transmitting, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
The signing of this Convention is a significant step in the gradual process of improving and broadening the relationship between the United States and Czechoslovakia. Consular relations between the two countries have not previously been the subject of a formal agreement. This Convention will establish firm obligations on such important matters as free communication between a citizen and his consul, notification of consular offices of the arrest and detention of their citizens, and permission for visits by consuls to citizens who are under detention.
The people of the United States and Czechoslovakia enjoy a long tradition of friendship. I welcome the opportunity through this Consular Convention to improve the relations between our two countries. I urge the Senate to give the convention its prompt and favorable consideration.
