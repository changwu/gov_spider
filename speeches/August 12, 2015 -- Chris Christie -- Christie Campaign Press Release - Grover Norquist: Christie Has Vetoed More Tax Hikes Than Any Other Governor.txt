    Today, Governor Christie signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge to the American people. Building on his record in New Jersey, this pledge is confirmation to the American people he will not raise taxes as President.
Christie's record in New Jersey:

Six years with no new taxes including repeatedly vetoing income and business tax increases
$2.3 billion in targeted, job-creating business tax cuts
Closing $13 billion in combined deficits in his first six months
Holding discretionary spending $2.3 billion below 2008 levels
Nearly 9,400 fewer state government employees
Sweeping pension and benefits reform saving taxpayers over $120 billion
More pension contributions than any Governor in history - $4.2 billion
A 2 percent property tax cap resulting in the slowest rise "in more than two decades"
A cap on arbitration awards to union employees, reining in the cost of government
