    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, signed at Washington on March 3, 1973. The report of the Department of State is enclosed for the information of the Senate. This Convention is designed to establish a system by which States may strictly control the international trade in specimens of species in danger of becoming extinct and monitor the trade in specimens of species which, because of present or potential trade in them, might be expected to become endangered.
The international community has realized that steps must be taken to halt the rapid depletion of wildlife. The present Convention constitutes a major step in this direction. I strongly recommend that the Senate give prompt consideration to this Convention and consent to its ratification.
