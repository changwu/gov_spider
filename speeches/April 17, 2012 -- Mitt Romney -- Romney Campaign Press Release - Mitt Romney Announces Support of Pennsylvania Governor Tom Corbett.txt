    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett.
"I'm extraordinarily proud to earn Tom's support," said Mitt Romney. "Tom has been a wonderful leader for Pennsylvania and shares my values of spurring economic security through scaling back the size of government and promoting pro-growth policies. There is no doubt that Pennsylvania will be a crucial state in November. With Tom's help, I know that I will be able to share my vision of restoring American greatness to Pennsylvania voters."
"Now that the long primary season has ended, it is time for Republicans to come together and unite around the one candidate who can defeat Barack Obama and institute a bold conservative vision that we need in Washington," said Governor Tom Corbett. "That is why I am heartily endorsing Mitt Romney. Our country needs a president who will reverse President Obama's failed policies and ensure an opportunity for all Americans to prosper. Mitt Romney will restore fiscal sanity to Washington by cutting spending, lowering taxes, and reforming entitlements."
