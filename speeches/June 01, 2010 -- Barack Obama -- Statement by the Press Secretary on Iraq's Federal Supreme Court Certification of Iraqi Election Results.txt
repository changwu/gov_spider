    The United States welcomes today’s action by Iraq’s Federal Supreme Court to certify Iraq’s election results. This is an important step forward as Iraqis continue to take control of their own future. We congratulate the newly elected members of the Council of Representatives and look forward to working with them in pursuit of our shared goals of expanding peace and security in Iraq and in the region. It is now time for Iraq’s political leaders to accelerate their negotiations on the formation of an inclusive and representative government that is responsive to the needs of the Iraqi people. The United States will continue to work with our Iraqi partners to advance a political process that brings Iraqis together, and that allows Iraq to ease old conflicts and build a future of greater peace and prosperity for all of its people.
