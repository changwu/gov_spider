    To the Congress of the United States:
Supervisors and management officials in GS-13, 14, and 15 positions throughout the Federal government are covered by the Performance Management and Recognition System as required by Chapter 54, Title 5, U.S. Code, unless otherwise excluded by law.
Upon proper application from the heads of affected agencies and upon the recommendation of the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, I have excluded, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5402(b)(1), three agencies, units of agencies, and classes of employees from coverage under the Performance Management and Recognition System.
In accordance with Section 205(d) of P.L. 98-615, any agency or unit of an agency that was excluded from merit pay immediately prior to enactment of this legislation is excluded from coverage under the Performance Management and Recognition System for the 12-month period beginning on the date of enactment. However, such exclusion may be revoked at any time in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5402(b)(5). Upon request of the heads of the affected agencies and upon recommendation of the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, I have revoked the exclusion of seven agencies and units of agencies so that they may implement the Performance Management and Recognition System in fiscal year 1986.
Attached is my report describing the agencies to be excluded and the reasons therefor. I am also providing the names of those agencies for which the exclusion is revoked.
