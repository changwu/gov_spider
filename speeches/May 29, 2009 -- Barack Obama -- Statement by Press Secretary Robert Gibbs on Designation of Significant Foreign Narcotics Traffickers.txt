    On May 28, 2009, the President identified Daniel Rendon Herrera (Colombia), the Haji Juma Khan Organization (Afghanistan), Walid Makled Garcia (Venezuela), and Imam Bheel (Pakistan) as Significant Foreign Narcotics Traffickers as appropriate for sanctions under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (the "Kingpin Act").
This action underscores the President's commitment to targeting the world's top drug traffickers and trafficking organizations, particularly their financial infrastructures.
The Kingpin Act, which became law in 1999, targets significant foreign narcotics traffickers, their organizations, and associates who act on their behalf, denying them access to the U.S. financial system. Further, it prohibits all trade and transactions between the traffickers and U.S. companies and individuals, and immobilizes any assets they may have within U.S. jurisdictions. The Kingpin Act does not target the countries in which these foreign individuals and entity operate or the governments of such countries.
Since the naming of the first Significant Foreign Narcotics Traffickers pursuant to the Kingpin Act on June 1, 2000, a total of 78 persons or entities have been identified by the President for sanctions under the Act. Yesterday's announcement brings that number to 82.
