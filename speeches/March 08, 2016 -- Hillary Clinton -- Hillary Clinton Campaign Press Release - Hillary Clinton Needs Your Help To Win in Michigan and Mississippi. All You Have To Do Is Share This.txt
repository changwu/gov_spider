    
Could. Not. Be. Easier.
The early states are behind us. Super Tuesday has come and gone. And Hillary Clinton's leading Bernie Sanders in votes, delegates, and states. But winning isn't the same as won—and Hillary needs your help to get out the vote in Michigan and Mississippi today.
Here's how you can help, in three easy steps:
1. Click here to find your Facebook friends in Michigan or here to find your friends in Mississippi.
Think you don't know anyone in those states? Give it a shot anyway. I bet you do.
2. Send them a message.
Everyone has their own reason why they're supporting Hillary. But if you're looking for a little inspiration, here are two things I think every Democratic voter should see in these two states:
Michigan
Hillary was back in Flint, Michigan, Sunday night for the 7th Democratic debate—and she nailed it. Your friends in Michigan should see what she had to say. Here's a link to a blog post summing it all up:?hrc.io/1W6q1cj
Mississippi
Civil rights activist and Mississippi native Myrlie Evers-Williams just threw her support behind Hillary Clinton—and it's one of the most powerful endorsements I've ever read. Here's a link to Myrlie's endorsement: hrc.io/1X7fZb6
3. Ask them to join you in reaching out to their?friends.
Make sure they know how easy it is—and how important.
