    Dear Pat:
Your letter of January 31, expressing your desire to return to the teaching profession, reached me today. I will, of course, accede to your wishes. with the deepest regret and reluctance.
In your letter you mentioned the years you have devoted to public service in the last two decades. You did not mention the enormous positive impact that those years have had.
In every task you have undertaken you have consistently elevated public discourse by puncturing pretense and by eloquently advocating the cause of reason. Nowhere has this been more evident than in your service at the United Nations, where you have asserted our position forcefully, cogently and honestly. In doing so you have not only reminded Americans that we take that institution seriously but also that we take ourselves and the principles for which we stand seriously.
For this service, which most appropriately you have rendered on the occasion of our 200th year, your fellow citizens owe you a debt that can never adequately be repaid. On their behalf Betty and I offer our profound thanks to you and Elizabeth for your service to the Nation.
With warmest personal regards,
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
[The Honorable Daniel P. Moynihan, U.S. Representative to the United Nations, New York, New York 10017]
