They committed to continue working together on Albania's remediation efforts and cybersecurity measures. In addition, Mr. Sullivan expressed appreciation for Albania's generous hosting of Afghan nationals who have fled Afghanistan, many of whom assisted U.S. efforts there. They also discussed our ongoing partnership on regional and global issues, including at NATO.
