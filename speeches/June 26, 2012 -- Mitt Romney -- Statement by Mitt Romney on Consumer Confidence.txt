    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the news that consumer confidence has fallen for the fourth straight month:
"Today's report on the decline in consumer confidence is the latest in a string of poor indicators for job growth and the economy. Last week, the Federal Reserve again downgraded expectations for economic growth and the Labor Department revealed there are nearly four unemployed Americans for every new job opening.It's clear that the American people know President Obama's policies aren't working, despite his claim that the private sector is 'doing fine.' We need a new direction for our economy, with pro-growth policies that will finally give businesses and consumers the confidence they need to get our country back on the right track."
