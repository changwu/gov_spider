TRANSCRIPT:
TIM SCOTT: I'm Tim Scott, and I want to wish you a Happy Fourth of July.
We are blessed to live in the greatest nation on God's green earth.
Our founding fathers were geniuses who should be celebrated, not canceled.
Only in America could the son of a single mother rise from poverty to become a candidate for president.
America is the land of opportunity, not a land of oppression. I know it because I've lived it.
To the patriots who fought on the battlefield for freedom, I say thank you.
God Bless our United States of America, and happy Independence Day.
