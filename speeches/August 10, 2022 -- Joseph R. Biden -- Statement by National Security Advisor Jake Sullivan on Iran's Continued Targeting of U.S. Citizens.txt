    Today the Department of Justice unsealed charges against an individual affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The charging document outlines allegations regarding Iran's continued attempts to carry out an assassination against former National Security Advisor John Bolton on American soil.
We have said this before and we will say it again: the Biden Administration will not waiver in protecting and defending all Americans against threats of violence and terrorism. Should Iran attack any of our citizens, to include those who continue to serve the United States or those who formerly served, Iran will face severe consequences. We will continue to bring to bear the full resources of the U.S. Government to protect Americans.
We commend the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their diligence and professionalism in this matter.
