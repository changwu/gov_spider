    WELL, it is a great weekend in Michigan, of course--first, the Cherry Festival in Traverse City,1 and then coming up to Mackinac Island--with a tremendous opportunity to see Interlochen and to hear the wonderful music by the talented young people, and the inspirational efforts by all of those who follow in the best tradition of Dr. Maddy; but then to come to the Upper Peninsula and have an opportunity to see Kincheloe, which is a very important and vital installation in our overall national security setup.
1 The President and Mrs. Ford participated in the Cherry Royale Parade of the National Cherry Festival in Traverse City on the afternoon of July 11, 1975.
I am delighted to praise the people in the military who do such a superb job, and I am most grateful for their warm welcome. They do something that most Americans need to appreciate. They are on alert. They are in the frontline of maintaining the peace, and we should be most grateful for the long hours and the dedication that they do for all of us.
And I would simply say to the people of Kincheloe and K. I. Sawyer and Wurtsmith Air Force Bases that we are just proud of them and thankful for the contribution that they make. It is a great place to come, and we will try to come back as often as we can.
