    Alexandria, Va. - December 15, 2015 - Today, Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and 2016 Republican presidential candidate, announced that Chairman & CEO of LendingTree, Doug Lebda, will lead his North Carolina Finance Committee. Lebda is a successful businessman, entrepreneur and revolutionary in the finance industry.
After receiving a BA in Business Administration from Bucknell University, Lebda experienced the challenges and complexities of the mortgage process. His desire to help consumers navigate the dreaded loan process and its frustrations became the genesis of LendingTree. Founded in 1996, LendingTree revolutionized how consumers shopped for loans and forced banks to compete for customers' business through an online lending marketplace. After launching nationally in July 1998, Lebda and his team have facilitated more than 32 million loan requests.
"I am excited to announce Doug as our North Carolina Finance Chairman. He operates with excellence in each of his organizations and I know that he will lead my North Carolina finance team with excellence," said Dr. Ben Carson. "We have already raised over Fifty-One Million Dollars and through his leadership we will continue to set unprecedented records in fundraising."
"Doug's energy and professionalism will drive North Carolina to be a leading state in our efforts to put Dr. Carson in the White House," said Dean Parker, national finance chairman for the Ben Carson for President 2016 Campaign. "It is a great honor to have him on our team."
"I am honored to be apart of Dr. Carson's campaign and excited to help in leading his campaign to win the GOP nomination," said Lebda.
