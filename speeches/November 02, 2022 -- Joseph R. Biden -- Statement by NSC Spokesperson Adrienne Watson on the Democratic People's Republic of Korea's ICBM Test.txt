    The United States strongly condemns the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) for its test of an Intercontinental ballistic missile. The President and his national security team are assessing the situation in close coordination with our allies and partners. This launch, in addition to the launch of multiple other ballistic missiles this week, is a flagrant violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions and needlessly raises tensions and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region. This action demonstrates that the DPRK continues to prioritize its unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs over the well-being of its people. We urge all countries to condemn these violations and call on the DPRK to cease its destabilizing actions and engage in serious dialogue. The United States will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the American homeland and Republic of Korea and Japanese allies.
