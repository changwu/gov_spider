    Mr. Prime Minister, if I might offer a toast. Thank you for your hospitality. I'm honored to be in the presence of the leaders of three important allies and friends of the United States: Croatia, Macedonia, and of course, our host, Albania.
We thank you for your strong leadership. We join you in your aspirations to join Euro-Atlantic institutions. We appreciate you working for peace. Thank you for the Adriatic Charter. May God bless your nations. May God bless you all.
Thank you.
