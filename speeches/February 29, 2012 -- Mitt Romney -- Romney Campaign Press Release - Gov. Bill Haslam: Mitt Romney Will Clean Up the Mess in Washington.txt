    Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam made the following statement on Tennessee's upcoming primary:
"With two strong victories in Arizona and Michigan, Mitt Romney continues to prove that he has what it takes to defeat President Obama in November. Gov. Romney has a solid track record of turning around troubled situations like the one we face in Washington.  He did it in the private sector, as leader of the Salt Lake City Olympics, and as governor of Massachusetts.  He has the kind of common-sense approach this country needs to turn the economy around and put people back to work.  I encourage Tennesseans to join me in casting their vote for Gov. Mitt Romney in Tuesday's election."
