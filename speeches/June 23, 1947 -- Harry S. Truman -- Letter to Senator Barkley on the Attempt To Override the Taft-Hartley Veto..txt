    Dear Senator Barkley:
I feel so strongly about the labor bill which the Senate will vote on this afternoon that I wish to reaffirm my sincere belief that it will do serious harm to our country.
This is a critical period in our history and any measure which will adversely affect our national unity will render a distinct disservice not only to this Nation but to the world.
I am convinced that such would be the result if the veto of this bill should be overridden.
I commend you and your associates who have fought so earnestly against this dangerous legislation.
I want you to know you have my unqualified support and it is my fervent hope, for the good of the country, that you and your colleagues will be successful in your efforts to keep this bill from becoming law.
Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
