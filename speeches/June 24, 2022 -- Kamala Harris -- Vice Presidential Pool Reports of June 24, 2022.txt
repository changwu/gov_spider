VP travel pool report #6 / VP speaks on Roe v. Wade
The VP spoke at the Avery Family YMCA about the Supreme Court's decision to overrule Roe v. Wade for 7 minutes in front of a crowd of over 100 people.
She described the Dobbs decision as a "health care crisis" and the first time in American history where a constitutional right was taken away. She also said the ruling could lead to other rulings that affect access to contraception and gay marriage and said the expansion of American freedom is not inevitable. Harris did not take questions from reporters after she spoke. Highlight quotes are included below.
Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Rep. Lauren Underwood also spoke at the event.
The VP finished speaking at 2:30 pm and her motorcade departed for Swissotel Chicago, where the VP is set to make remarks at the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO) conference.
Quote highlights from VP Harris's Plainfield speech on Roe v. Wade:

"This is a health care crisis, because understand millions of women in America will go to bed tonight without access to the health care and reproductive care that they had this morning, without access to the health care, reproductive health care that their mothers and grandmothers had for 50 years."


"This is the first time in the history of our nation that a constitutional right has been taken from the people of America. "What is that right?" some might ask. It is the right to privacy. Think about it as the right for each person to make intimate decisions about heart and home. Decisions about the right to start a family, including contraception and the morning after pill. Decisions about whether to have a child, including.. through in vitro fertilization. Decisions to marry the person you love."


"Today's decision calls into question other rights that we thought were settled, such as the right to use birth control, the right to same-sex marriage, the right to interracial marriage."


"The great aspiration of our nation has been to expand freedom. But the expansion of freedom clearly is not inevitable. It is not something that just happens, not unless we defend our most fundamental principals, not unless we elect leaders who stand up for those principals.


"You have the power to elect leaders who will defend and protect your rights... So, this is not over."

VP travel pool report #7 / VP departs NALEO conference
The VP spoke at Swissotel for 24 minutes in front of hundreds of people gathered for the NALEO conference.
She talked about the Biden/Harris administration's work to support Latino communities during the pandemic and thanked NALEO members for their work. She spoke about inflation, immigration and gun violence too. The VP also discussed the Supreme Court's decision to overrule Roe v. Wade, mostly using language she used earlier in the day in Plainfield. Quotes from her speech are attached below.
The VP departed Swissotel at 5:06 for Midway International Airport, where she is set to fly back to DC.
Quotes from VP Harris's speech at NALEO below:
"The great aspiration of our nation has been to expand freedom. It's something many of us have spent our careers fighting for. But the expansion of freedom clearly is not inevitable, and it certainly is not something that just happens."
"We believe that anyone should be able to have a dream and achieve that dream, a future where immigrants have the opportunity to have what they deserve in terms of a pathway towards citizenship. We believe in a nation and in a future where protecting the freedom to vote is not a partisan issue. We believe that women should be able to make decisions about their own bodies." [loud applause at end]
"There is no question that we are still facing a number of serious challenges, and today I'd like to talk about three of the issues which I believe are among the priorities of everyone in this room. One, lowering costs for families, building a fair and humane immigration system, and protecting people from gun violence."
"It is a tragedy that we can't pull this together as a nation and pass legislation creating a legal pathway for them, for farm workers, for TPS, and understanding what this means to families."
"There's a throughline between these tragedies: an epidemic of hate that touches us all."
"I think many of us agree that our country needs sensible gun safety laws, that yesterday's Supreme Court decision which struck down one of those laws defies common sense and defies the constitution."

VP travel pool report #9 / VP leaves Chicago for DC
AF2 lifted off from Chicago’s Midway International Airport at 7:19 headed for DC. The plane spent an hour and 50 minutes on the tarmac with the VP aboard before takeoff.
A White House official shared this on background:
Prior to the Vice President’s arrival, Air Force 2 was refueled for take off. The plane’s weight along with the temperature outside caused the rear landing gear to sink into the asphalt.
An airport tug was used to move AF2 out of the divots and to a new location for taxi. Mechanics are conducting final checks prior to our takeoff. The landing gear was inspected with no issues found prior to takeoff.
