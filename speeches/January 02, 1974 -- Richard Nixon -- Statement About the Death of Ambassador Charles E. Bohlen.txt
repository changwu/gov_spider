    I HAVE learned with deep sorrow of the death of Ambassador Charles E. Bohlen. During the course of his nearly 40 years in the Foreign Service, Ambassador Bohlen participated in some of the historic events of this century. The many Presidents and Secretaries of State he served greatly valued his wise counsel, his intimate knowledge of the Soviet Union, and his sure grasp of world affairs. As Ambassador in such diverse posts as Moscow, Manila, and Paris, he rendered outstanding service to his country and earned the loyalty and affection of his colleagues. His death deprives the Nation of one of our most distinguished diplomats and a truly outstanding public servant. Mrs. Nixon joins me in extending our deepest sympathy to his family.
