    AUSTIN â€” Texas Gov. Rick Perry today issued the following statement on the bombing outside a courthouse in New Delhi:
"Today's bombing in India and the tragic loss of life are graphic reminders that al-Qaeda and similar groups remain committed to murder, terror and attacking freedom across the globe. America must remain vigilant, and work to reinvigorate our economy so that we can remain militarily strong and uphold effective foreign policy. We mourn with the people of New Delhi, especially the families of those killed and injured, and to our friends and allies in India."
