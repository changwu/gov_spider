    President Obama called President Donald Tusk today to congratulate him on his first day as President of the European Council. President Obama underscored the importance of continued U.S.-EU cooperation and noted the need for policy action to strengthen European economic growth. The two leaders affirmed their determination to achieve an ambitious and comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) agreement. They also reiterated the U.S. and EU commitment to work with international financial institutions to provide the financial support Ukraine needs as it stabilizes its economy, implements necessary reforms, and seeks to resolve the conflict in the eastern part of the country. They agreed that sanctions against Russia cannot be eased until Russia meets its commitments under the Minsk agreements, and reiterated the joint U.S. and EU condemnation of Russia's occupation and attempted annexation of Crimea. The leaders assessed what further actions may be necessary in response to Russia's destabilizing actions in eastern Ukraine and Crimea. They also discussed combined efforts to support governments in western Africa as they seek to arrest the spread of Ebola, provide treatment to those infected, and partner on global health security.
