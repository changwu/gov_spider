    During his remarkable life, Ambassador James Hormel made history â€“ and he made the world a better place. Jim's kindness and commitment to human rights, including his efforts to help found the Human Rights Campaign and advocate for those living with HIV/AIDS, changed lives and inspired generations of leaders. As our country's first openly gay ambassador, Jim's distinguished service represented the very best of America and paved the way for others.
I will always be grateful for Jim's friendship and counsel over many years. He will be missed. Doug and I send our condolences to Jim's husband Michael, children Alison, Anne, Elizabeth, Jimmy, and Sarah, and grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
