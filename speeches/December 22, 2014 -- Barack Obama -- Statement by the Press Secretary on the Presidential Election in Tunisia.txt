    President Obama congratulates President-elect Beji Caid Essebsi on his victory and the people of Tunisia on the successful conclusion of the first presidential election under the new constitution, a vital step toward the completion of Tunisia's momentous transition to democracy. The United States looks forward to working closely with President-elect Caid Essebsi and the new government as they work to uphold the ideals of the Tunisian revolution and to meet all Tunisians' aspirations for security, economic opportunity, and dignity. The United States intends to continue to strengthen and expand our strategic partnership with the Tunisian people.
The strong commitment by Tunisia's leaders and the Tunisian people to inclusive political dialogue, consensus-building, and democratic values has been crucial to the success of the political transition and will be equally important during the next phase of Tunisia's history. This historic moment is an opportunity for the international community to reaffirm and deepen its commitment to Tunisia. The United States stands at the forefront of this effort.
