    DES MOINES, IA — Following the conclusion of the first Democratic presidential primary debate, three of Senator Amy Klobuchar's Iowa endorsers released statements on Senator Klobuchar's behalf.
Amy for Iowa Campaign Chair Dr. Andy McGuire:"Amy showed us tonight what a real progressive looks like. She's the candidate with solutions to the problems Iowans face and she has real plans to move our country forward. Tonight, Amy proved that she has what it takes to win."
State Representative Ruth Ann Gaines:"Amy is someone who can accomplish real change for Iowa and the country. Her attention to the bread and butter issues that affect all of us – like increasing access to mental health care – is why I am so proud to support her."
State Representative Marti Anderson:"Tonight's debate proved Amy is a fighter. Amy believes if you want to call yourself a progressive, you have to make progress. You have to bring people together to make real change, take on major issues, and get things done. In the last Congress, Amy was ranked the most effective Democrat and was the lead on more than 100 bills passed into law including legislation to improve school safety, fund rural broadband, and combat human trafficking. That's why she's the best candidate to win back the White House in 2020."
Next week, Senator Klobuchar will return to Iowa for her ninth trip since announcing her candidacy for president. She'll travel the length of the state, stopping in eight counties in southwest and southeast Iowa.
