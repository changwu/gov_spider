    Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. released the following statement in response to the Arizona Police Association's (APA) endorsement of President Donald J. Trump's re-election. APA represents more than 12,000 members including local, county state, and federal law enforcement professionals.
Bob Paduchik, Trump 2020 Senior Advisor for Law Enforcement and Labor Unions issued the following statement:
"While Joe Biden shamelessly defames law enforcement and would 'Yes! Absolutely!' defund the police, President Trump always has and always will stand with the men and women of the Thin Blue Line. Never before in American history has a candidate for president so boldly incited hate and resentment toward police officers, the individuals who put their lives on the line every day to protect America's communitiesâ€”but that's Joe Biden's M.O. With President Trump in office, the Arizona Police Association and each of their counterparts across the nation can be confident they have an advocate in the White House who proves every day his commitment to America's law enforcement officers, all citizens' safety, and the rule of law."
