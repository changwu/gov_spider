    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question. The previous report covered progress through July 31, 1995. The current report covers the period August 1, 1995, through September 30, 1995.
I can assure you of my continuing interest in helping find a solution to this long-standing issue, but I also believe that peace can result only through the will and determination of the parties themselves. I remain concerned about the current lack of progress. My Administration is working to ensure that preparations for Special Emissary Beattie's renewed effort later this year will be successful.
We continue to believe strongly that the European Union (EU) accession process for Cyprus can have a positive impact on efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement. In that context, there are substantive questions arising from prospective EU membership. Accordingly, the EU must maintain frequent contacts with both Cypriot communities to address these key questions. This subject is a constant theme in our discussions with EU representatives.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
