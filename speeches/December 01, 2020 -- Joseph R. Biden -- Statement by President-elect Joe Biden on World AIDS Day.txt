    Today, Jill and I join with communities around the globe to remember those we have lost and to recommit ourselves to ending AIDS as a public health threat.
COVID-19 is a reminder that we cannot let up in our efforts to fight other epidemics, so many of which - including HIV/AIDS - have been exacerbated by this pandemic. We will pursue bold solutions and increase our collaboration with affected communities around the globe. We will redouble our efforts to tackle health inequities that impact communities of color, LGBTQ+ people, and other marginalized groups, including women and children. We will work with activists and advocates to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS, human rights, and listen to scientists, nurses, and other public health experts who have saved countless lives. We will reinstate the Office of National AIDS Policy, release a new comprehensive National Strategy on HIV/AIDS, and expand support for bipartisan programs like the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Together, we will change the tide of rising infections, expand treatment, and support health security around the world.
This year, World AIDS Day honors the resilience and impact of advocates, activists, and frontline workers who have spent decades treating people with dignity, fighting for human rights, and saving lives. Because of their work, an AIDS-free generation is not only imaginable, it is within our reach. And under a Biden-Harris Administration, America's response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in this moment will match their unparalleled example.
