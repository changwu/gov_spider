    14 viewing parties planned to watch Obama's 2002 speech; drive time visibility in 11 spots will show support for Obama's early opposition to the war
Manchester, NH -- On October 2, 2002, as a candidate for U.S. Senate, Barack Obama stood up and opposed the war in Iraq before it began. On the five-year anniversary of that speech, his supporters in New Hampshire are planning a day of grassroots activities to show their support for Obama's early and consistent opposition to the war.
During morning drive time, supporters will hold visibility events at 11 roadside locations. And at viewing parties in the afternoon and evening, supporters will gather in 14 towns to watch a DVD prepared for the day. The disc contains clips from the 2002 speech and other instances of Obama's early opposition to the war, the full video of his speech outlining his plan to end the war, and a new video of New Hampshire veterans of the war in Iraq sharing why they support Obama to be the next Commander in Chief.
Canvassers going door to door in the afternoon will carry video clips of the speeches on handheld PDAs, so that they can share Obama's words with voters-right on their doorsteps.
The full content of the DVD will be available for viewing online tomorrow.
