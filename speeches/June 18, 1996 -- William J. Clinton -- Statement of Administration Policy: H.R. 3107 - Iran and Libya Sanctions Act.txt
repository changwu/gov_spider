The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 3107, as reported by the House Committee on Ways and Means.
The United States Government strongly objects to the unacceptable behavior of Iran and Libya, particularly each regime's support of international terrorism and pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. The Administration has, therefore, consulted closely with Congress to develop sanctions legislation that would be effective and enforceable, while minimizing unnecessary costs to U.S. economic and foreign policy interests.
H.R. 3107 will assist the United States in pursuing two important foreign policy objectives. First, by deterring investment in the development of Iran's petroleum industry, H.R. 3107 would deny Iran the resources to support international terrorism and pursue weapons of mass destruction. Second, the bill would assist the United States in obtaining full compliance by Libya with UN Security Council resolutions, including an end to its support for international terrorism.
