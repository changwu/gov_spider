    Governor Anderson, and all Americans participating in the ceremony at Fort Randall Dam this morning:
It is both an honor and a privilege to be able to gather with you people by the means of this long distance cable in dedicating the first power unit that Fort Randall Dam will operate.
The occasion is significant not only to the individuals who will benefit directly from the flood control features, the navigation, the power, the irrigation--everything that will come from this dam. It is a symbol also of what we all over America must do about our most precious natural resource. By this I mean water. Water uncontrolled, improperly used, can cause us more damage in this country, possibly, than almost any other single element. Properly used, properly harnessed, it can be our greatest resource.
It is one of my most earnest ambitions, an ambition shared so far as I know by every political leader of both parties in Washington and elsewhere and by all of my associates in the Cabinet--to make certain that we find the best and most intelligent ways of participating through a combination of Federal, State, and local assets in developing the water resources of our country so as to be of lasting benefit for the whole Nation, now and always.
And now, my friends, with these very few, but very earnest remarks, it is my privilege to press the key that will start in operation this first power element at Fort Randall Dam.
