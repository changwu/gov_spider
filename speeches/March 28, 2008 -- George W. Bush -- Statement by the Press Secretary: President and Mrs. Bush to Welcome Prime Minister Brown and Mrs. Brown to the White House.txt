    President and Mrs. Bush will welcome British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Mrs. Sarah Brown to the White House on April 17, 2008. The United States and the United Kingdom share a special partnership that enables our countries to more effectively confront the key strategic challenges facing our two nations. The President looks forward to continuing his regular consultations with the Prime Minister on our shared goals of advancing freedom and strengthening security and democracy in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere; increasing international pressure on Iran to prevent it from obtaining the means to build nuclear weapons; and improving our efforts to combat international terrorism. The two leaders will also discuss our work to address poverty, disease, and climate change, as well as the promotion of free-market trade around the world.
