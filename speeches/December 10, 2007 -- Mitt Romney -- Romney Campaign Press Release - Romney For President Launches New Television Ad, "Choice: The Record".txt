Boston, MA â€“ Today, Romney for President launched its newest television ad, "Choice: The Record." The ad highlights the very important choice voters will have to make when it comes to confronting illegal immigration. While Governors Romney and Huckabee both believe in protecting life and traditional marriage, they have very different records on enforcing our immigration laws. In Massachusetts, Governor Romney stood up and vetoed in-state tuition for illegal immigrants and opposed driver's licenses for illegal immigrants. In Arkansas, Governor Huckabee supported in-state tuition breaks and taxpayer-funded scholarships for illegal immigrants.
The ad will begin airing tomorrow as part of the campaign's rotation in Iowa. Script and viewing links are below.

- Governor Romney Has Been Recognized For His Pro-Life Leadership In Massachusetts. "Mitt Romney was a great Governor, who served with honor and distinction. But most importantly, he was a pro-life Governor. He vetoed a number of pro-abortion pieces of legislation and made many pro-life appointments. He was always there for us. He's a busy man these days and we are extra fortunate that he and his wife Ann could be with us. Governor, you have been an inspirational leader in many ways. And if I may say so, Mitt, you're looking very presidential. Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming our friend, Governor Mitt Romney, to the podium as our 2007 Mullins Award Winner for Outstanding Political Leadership." (Kevin Jourdain, Remarks, Agawam, MA, 5/10/07)
- Governor Romney Supports A Constitutional Amendment Defending Traditional Marriage. "While Romney is willing to generally leave it to states to decide how to set up health care coverage plans, he said it shouldn't be left to states to decide same-sex marriage issues. 'It's a status that lasts a lifetime. And so, if somebody is married in one state and they move to another state, that status travels with them. And so, if you have gay marriage in one state, whether you want it or not, you have gay marriage in all states,' Romney told reporters after speaking at a Greenville, S.C., restaurant." (Amy Lorentzen, "Iowa Gay Marriage Ruling Stirs 2008 Race," The Associated Press, 9/1/07)

"Other than the highway plan, the only bill in the governor's 21-bill legislative package that failed to win legislative approval was a proposal to make the children of illegal immigrants eligible for state-funded scholarships and in-state tuition to Arkansas colleges. After passing the House relatively early in the session, the bill faltered in the Senate where it was amended to remove the scholarship provision but fell just short of passage Tuesday and Wednesday. Huckabee said his office worked throughout the day Wednesday for the two Senate votes needed to pass the bill."
