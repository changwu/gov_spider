    At the Villages, Marco Calls Out Trump's Dangerous Rhetoric 
March 14, 2016
Marco made a campaign stop at the Villages, one of Florida's biggest retirement communities, this past weekend — his second stop there of the campaign, in fact.
He drew more than 600 people — 400 in the main room, and more in overflow rooms.

Marco talked a bit about the disturbing events surrounding the Trump campaign recently, and why a president has to be much more responsible with his rhetoric than Trump's been.

  Rubio criticizes "a new brand of leadership that isn't leadership at all ... that says, 'Yes, get angry.'"
