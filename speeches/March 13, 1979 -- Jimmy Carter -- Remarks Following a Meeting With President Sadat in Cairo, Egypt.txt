    I have a statement to make which I consider to be extremely important.
I have just given to President Sadat a full report on my discussions in Israel. During that visit the United States made proposals for resolving a number of outstanding issues, proposals which were accepted by Prime Minister Begin and his Cabinet.
President Sadat has now accepted these proposals. Based on discussions in Egypt and Israel, I have also presented United States proposals to President Sadat and to Prime Minister Begin for resolving the few remaining issues.
Earlier today, Prime Minister Begin agreed to present these proposals to his Cabinet for consideration. This will be done at the earliest opportunity.
President Sadat has carefully reviewed all these remaining issues and has accepted these same proposals. I have just informed Prime Minister Begin by telephone of President Sadat's acceptance.
I am convinced that now we have defined all of the main ingredients of a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, which will be the cornerstone of a comprehensive peace settlement for the Middle East.
Thank you.
