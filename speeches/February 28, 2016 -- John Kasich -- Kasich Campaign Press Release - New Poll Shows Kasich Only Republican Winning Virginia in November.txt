    Remind us, are Virginia and Ohio important states to win in November?
Absolutely.
And right now John Kasich is the only Republican able to defeat the Democratic nominee in both.
Not Trump. Not Rubio. Not Cruz. Only John Kasich.
From a new poll by Hampton University in Virginia:
"If the election were held today, Ohio Governor John Kasich is the only Republican contender whose numbers are better than former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders..."
And of course, John Kasich is polling significantly ahead of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders in Ohio, leading by 17 and 19 points, respectively.
In addition, and once again in both Ohio and Virginia polls, John Kasich has the highest net favorability rating of any candidate of either Party.
The Virginia poll noted John Kasich came in as the most trustworthy of all candidates of either party with +45.7 percent. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is at -39 percent.
Virginia has sided with the winner of each of the past four presidential races and no Republican has won the presidency without winning Ohio.
Without a doubt, John Kasich is by far the best option for Republicans if they want to win back the White House in November.
