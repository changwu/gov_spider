    "The Obama team refuses to take a stand on whether Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. After initially claiming in 2008 that Jerusalem should remain the capital, President Obama and his advisers have shamefully ducked and dodged on the President's position. As president, Mitt Romney would ensure Israel has a steadfast ally in the United States, including support for its capital, Jerusalem." — Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman
The Obama White House Repeatedly Refused To Say Whether Jerusalem Is The Capital Of Israel:

QUESTION: "What is the position? What's the capital?" CARNEY: "You know our position." QUESTION: "I don't." QUESTION: "No, no, she doesn't know. She doesn't know. That's why she asked." CARNEY: "She does know" QUESTION: "I don't." QUESTION: "She does not know. She just said she doesn't know. I don't know." (White House Press Briefing, 7/26/12)
When Pressed Later In The Briefing, Carney Again Ducked The Questions On Israel's Capital. QUESTION: "Tel Aviv or Jerusalem?" CARNEY: "You know the answer. Yes."

(White House Press Briefing, 7/26/12)
But During His 2008 Campaign, Candidate Obama Claimed Jerusalem Was The Capital Of Israel:
Candidate Obama, In 2008: "Israel I Think Has A Historic Claim On Jerusalem." OBAMA: "Israel I think has a historic claim on Jerusalem. I think that obviously there are sacred sites in the Old City that are central to not just Judaism but also to Islam and Christianity. I think it is very important for us to find a way in which all those claims are respected. This is something that I think is very important for the parties themselves to decide, but I believe that it is not an acceptable option for Jerusalem to be severed from Israel along the lines of the 1967 borders. That is not going to be an option." (Senator Barack Obama, Remarks In A Q&A Session, Philadelphia, PA, 4/16/08)
Candidate Obama, In 2008: "Jerusalem Will Remain The Capital Of Israel, And It Must Remain Undivided." (Senator Barack Obama, Remarks At AIPAC, Arlington, VA, 6/4/08)

CNN'S CANDY CROWLEY: "I want to ask you about something you said in AIPAC yesterday. You said that Jerusalem must remain undivided. Do Palestinians have no claim to Jerusalem in the future?" OBAMA: "Well, obviously, it's going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues." (CNN's "The Situation Room," 6/5/08)
