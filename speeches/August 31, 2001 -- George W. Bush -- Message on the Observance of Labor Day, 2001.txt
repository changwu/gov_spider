    I am pleased to join my fellow Americans in observing Labor Day on September 3, 2001.
The great strength of our Nation's economy is our workforce. From teachers and entrepreneurs to factory workers and scientists, hardworking Americans serve in a wide and diverse range of professions that are vital to protecting our health, wellbeing, and quality of life. By providing important goods and services and building and generating wealth, American workers help lay the foundation for our continued progress and advancement.
Falling on the first Monday in September, Labor Day serves as a time to honor and celebrate the achievements of our workforce and to reaffirm our commitment to ensuring opportunity for every American worker. Workers must have the education and training they need to succeed, and they are entitled to expect fair treatment from their employers. We owe workers the chance to build a nest egg that will help them maintain a high standard of living in their retirement years. The last barriers to full participation in the workplace for Americans with disabilities must be removed. The Office of the 21st Century Work Force at the Department of Labor and my New Freedom Initiative reflect my Administration's commitment to furthering these important goals.
As our Nation observes Labor Day this year, I salute every hardworking American for your role in helping this country to grow and thrive and for your innovation, creativity, and energy on the job. I also encourage you as you strive to keep in balance the demands of work alongside vital responsibilities to family, friends, and the community. Your efforts carry on the proud traditions of past generations of American workers and demonstrate your adaptability and enthusiasm for meeting the challenges of the 21st century.
Best wishes for a memorable observance.
