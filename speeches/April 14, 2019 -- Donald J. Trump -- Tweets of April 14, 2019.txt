The New York Times Sanctuary Cities/Immigration story today was knowingly wrong on almost every fact. They never call to check for truth. Their sources often don't even exist a fraud. They will lie & cheat anyway possible to make me look bad. In 6 years they will be gone........Retweets: 20125Favorites: 79977

....When I won the Election in 2016 the @nytimes had to beg their fleeing subscribers for forgiveness in that they covered the Election (and me) so badly. They didn't have a clue it was pathetic. They even apologized to me. But now they are even worse really corrupt reporting!Retweets: 20458Favorites: 92430

I never offered Pardons to Homeland Security Officials never ordered anyone to close our Southern Border (although I have the absolute right to do so and may if Mexico does not apprehend the illegals coming to our Border) and am not 'frustrated.' It is all Fake & Corrupt News!Retweets: 19662Favorites: 83218

....So interesting to see the Mayor of Oakland and other Sanctuary Cities NOT WANT our currently 'detained immigrants' after release due to the ridiculous court ordered 20 day rule. If they don't want to serve our Nation by taking care of them why should other cities & towns?Retweets: 33596Favorites: 133074

Democrats must change the Immigration Laws FAST. If not Sanctuary Cities must immediately ACT to take care of the Illegal Immigrants - and this includes Gang Members Drug Dealers Human Traffickers and Criminals of all shapes sizes and kinds. CHANGE THE LAWS NOW!Retweets: 29716Favorites: 109143

RT @WhiteHouse: No law that kicks 180 million Americans off their plans is acceptable. While Democrats abandon Obamacare for more socialism'Retweets: 12041Favorites: 0

Just out: The USA has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to Sanctuary Cities. We hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level especially by the State of California which is well known or its poor management & high taxes!Retweets: 43044Favorites: 166463

If the Fed had done its job properly which it has not the Stock Market would have been up 5000 to 10000 additional points and GDP would have been well over 4% instead of 3%...with almost no inflation. Quantitative tightening was a killer should have done the exact opposite!Retweets: 22630Favorites: 97655
