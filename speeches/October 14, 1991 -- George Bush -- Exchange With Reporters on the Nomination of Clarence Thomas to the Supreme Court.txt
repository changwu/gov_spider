    Q. Mr. President, sir, did you personally approve the idea of the attacks on Anita Hill?
Q. Are you going to make any phone calls, Mr. President?
The President. I'm not going to have yet another press conference, but I will say this: I am very pleased with the way the support all across the country is holding strong for Judge Thomas. It is important to note that among Afro-Americans, black Americans, that the support is very, very strong. That is significant, and I think highly important. So, it appears to be holding, and now a vote will take place. And I think that is about all I care to say about it right now.
