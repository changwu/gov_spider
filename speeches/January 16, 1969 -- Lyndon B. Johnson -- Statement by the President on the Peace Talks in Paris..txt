    WE ARE all pleased that certain basic procedural problems in Paris have been solved and new talks on the substance of peace in Southeast Asia can open.
There are three lessons of our experience since March 31st.
First, we must be clear and firm in pursuing with our allies the limited but vital objectives we seek in Southeast Asia.
Second, we must be patient and face the hard fact that fighting is likely to continue as the negotiations are carried forward.
Third, we should be confident that an honorable peace is possible if we here at home remain steady.
We have had three crises in these negotiations since they opened 9 months ago: on the place for the talks, on the terms for a bombing cessation, and on the procedures for the new talks. In each case, patience, firmness, and fair-mindedness achieved a satisfactory result.
We must pursue peace as diligently as we have fought aggression. And this year we have made steady progress toward the peace we all devoutly pray for.
I deeply believe that if we only remain united and stay together on this path we will achieve honorable peace in Southeast Asia.
