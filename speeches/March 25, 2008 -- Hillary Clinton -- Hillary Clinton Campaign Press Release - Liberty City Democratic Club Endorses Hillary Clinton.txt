    Philadelphia, PA â€“ The Liberty City Democratic Club, a key LGBT political group in Pennsylvania, overwhelmingly endorsed Hillary Clinton for President with two-thirds of the members voting for her.
This club's endorsement further demonstrates Hillary Clinton's strong support in the LGBT community. The Liberty City endorsement follows a string of endorsements from grassroots LGBT groups like the Steel City Democrats, the Houston Stonewall Democrats, Dallas Stonewall Democrats, and 27 of the 39 members of Board the National Stonewall Democrats.
"We are proud to endorse Senator Hillary Clinton in this important primary cycle," said Matthew Woodcock, Endorsement Chair of the Liberty City Democratic Club. "Her record of accomplishment is proof positive that she'll be a fighter for the LGBT community in the White House and that's what we need. We need her experience working for us."
Hillary has been a longtime ally of the LGBT community. She fought against the Federal Marriage Amendment (FMA) both times and has worked on legislation that would promote equality for LGBT Americans. As President, Hillary will work to ensure that gay and lesbian couples in committed relationships have the same legal rights and responsibilities as all Americans. She will also work to end discrimination in adoption laws, sign hate crimes legislation and ENDA into law, and put an end to the failed policy of Don't Ask, Don't Tell.
"I am honored to receive the support of the Liberty Democratic Club," said Clinton. "LGBT Americans have been a part of this campaign from the start and I look forward to working with members of the Liberty Democratic Club to ensure that their voices are heard in this important Pennsylvania primary. We need to end the divisive politics of the current administration. As President, I will do just that and will continue fighting for equality for all Americans."
