Campaign now seeking to raise an additional $217,000 today
Newark, NJ â€” Nine days after alerting supporters in an urgent memo that the campaign had to raise $1.7 million by September 30th in order to put itself on a trajectory to compete for the Democratic nomination, Cory 2020 announced it had met its goal -- more than a day ahead of its self-imposed deadline.
The campaign crossed the $1.7 million threshold at approximately 8:16pm ET Sunday night, and as of 11:59pm ET, has raised $1,783,504.44 since sending the memo on Saturday, September 21.
"When we made the decision to be completely honest with folks about where we stood and what we needed to raise to put this campaign on a path to be successful, we didn't know how people would respond," said Cory Booker. "I've been overwhelmed by the response, and I couldn't be more grateful to everyone who pitched in. This moment is a testimony to the power of what's possible when people unite in common purpose and work toward a shared goal.
"Thanks to this outpouring of support, we see a viable path forward to continue growing a winning campaign. I'm staying in this race -- and I'm in it to win. But this won't be the last mountain we have to climb on our way to the nomination -- we have a lot more money to raise to continue being competitive with the better-funded campaigns in this race. I'll be asking more of my supporters as we move forward in this campaign together.
"That's why I'm betting we can raise an additional $217,000 by the end of the day today -- putting us over the $2 million mark. To help, visit corybooker.com/together."
During the push to $1.7 million, Cory 2020 received more than 40,000 donations from all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Cory 2020 also saw its best online fundraising day of the campaign to-date on Saturday, September 21.
And now, thanks to the influx of support over the past 9 days -- the best 9 day stretch of fundraising for the campaign -- Cory 2020 is on track to have its best fundraising quarter to date.
On Tuesday, October 1, Cory 2020 Campaign Manager Addisu Demissie will host an on-the-record conference call with reporters to readout the final results of the campaign's push to $1.7 million and discuss the next moves for the campaign. To participate in this conference call, please RSVP here.
