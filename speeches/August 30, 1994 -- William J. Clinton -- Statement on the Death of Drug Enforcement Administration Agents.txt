    I join the American people in mourning the deaths of five young agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration, lost when their plane crashed in Peru this past weekend. Agents Frank Fernandez, Jay Seale, Meredith Thompson, Frank Wallace, and Juan Vars demonstrated a true devotion to duty and a commitment to ridding our country of the scourge of illegal drugs.
Every day, dedicated men and women risk their lives in the international war against drugs. Working with officials from many nations, our DEA agents have made great progress in this struggle. But, as we have seen this week, this war is not an easy one. Even our most valiant young soldiers fall victim.
These courageous agents served to make America's streets safer for our children, and, in their names, we rededicate ourselves to fighting drug production, trafficking, and use.
On behalf of a grateful nation, I extend deepest sympathies to the families of these heroic individuals. Their bright lives will remain inspirations to all of us.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
