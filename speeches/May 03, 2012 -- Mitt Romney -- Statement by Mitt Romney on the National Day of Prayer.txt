    Mitt Romney made the following statement on the National Day of Prayer:
"Today I join with people of all faiths to express devotion and gratitude to the Lord, who has so richly blessed us.  On this National Day of Prayer, we are reminded of those who have sacrificed so much to give us the freedom to worship freely and to speak openly about our faith.  As I travel across this country every day, I see God's grace and faithfulness in the lives of so many Americans who share their stories.  And it is my prayer that as we strive to better America and to protect her from those who would do her harm, the Lord will keep us strong and free and we will remain one nation under God."
