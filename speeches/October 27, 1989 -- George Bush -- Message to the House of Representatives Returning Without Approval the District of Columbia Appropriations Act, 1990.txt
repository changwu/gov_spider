    To the House of Representatives:
I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 3026, the "District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 1990."
I informed the Congress earlier that I would veto this bill if it permitted the use of appropriated funds to pay for abortions other than those in which the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term. The limitation I proposed is identical to the one included in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for 1989 (Public Law 100 - 462).
This year, regrettably, the Congress has expanded the circumstances in which Federal funds could be used to pay for abortions. Moreover, unlike Public Law 100 - 462, H.R. 3026 would also permit payment for abortions with local funds, which under current law must be appropriated by the Congress. Thus, H.R. 3026 would not restrict the use of such funds for abortion in any way.
I am, therefore, compelled to disapprove H.R. 3026.
George Bush
