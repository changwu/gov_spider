    The small medical investment firm where Joe Biden's son-in-law is an executive received a loan in April from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) – the very program Biden's campaign derided as a "cronyism" scheme for President Trump's associates, and which Biden himself said was not focused on small businesses. The PPP is a program aimed at making sure workers did not miss paychecks during the coronavirus crisis and is credited with saving more than 51 million jobs.
Biden's son-in-law, Dr. Howard Krein, is the chief medical officer at StartUp Health, a company which received a PPP loan of between $150,000 and $350,000 to protect 18 jobs. Krein also serves as an informal advisor to Biden's campaign, specializing in coronavirus-related issues.
Will Biden's family return the loan?
"Is Joe Biden dishonest or just out to lunch? While his son-in-law's company received a PPP loan to support the workers at his small business, Biden falsely claimed the program only helped big corporations," said Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 director of communications. "Now we know he was publicly bashing the program while his son-in-law – an advisor he talked to daily – was privately taking advantage of it. It's certainly plausible that Biden had no clue what was going on right under his nose, but now that this hypocrisy has come to light Biden needs to come clean. He should admit that he knew about the loan and lied about the program anyway, or call on his family to return the money to the taxpayers."
