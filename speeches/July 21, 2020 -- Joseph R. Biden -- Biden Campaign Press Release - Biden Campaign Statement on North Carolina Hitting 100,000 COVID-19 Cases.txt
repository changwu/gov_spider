    Today, North Carolina hit the stark milestone of 100,000 COVID-19 cases across the state, according to the DHHS. In North Carolina, over 1,600 people have died as a result of the pandemic. As Governor Roy Cooper continues working to halt the state's rise in cases, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield issued the following statement:
"Today marks a grim milestone for North Carolina, and we are devastated for all the families who have lost their loved ones and those who are fighting to safeguard their health as cases rise. Amidst this unprecedented global pandemic, North Carolinians are looking for a leader in the Oval Office who has the empathy and trusted experience to deliver the necessary resources to keep our schools, frontline workers, and families safe. As President, Joe Biden would be the partner in Washington that North Carolina needs to tackle COVID-19 - with actions like increasing testing capacity, providing sufficient personal protective equipment like masks and gowns, and setting up a contract tracing task force - while empowering North Carolinians to make the best decisions for their state."
