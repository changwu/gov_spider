    In place of fancy dinners or celebrity photo-ops, Edwards offers supporters the chance to help build One America
Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards announced today that he will be going to help rebuild an area of New Orleans devastated by Hurricane Katrina and offered supporters the chance to join him. Between today and the end of September, Edwards supporters will be able to enter their names in a drawing by visiting the John Edwards campaign website. No contribution is necessary to enter the drawing. In the beginning of October, five names will be selected at random for the opportunity to go with Edwards to help rebuild New Orleans.
"The challenge of building One America starts in New Orleans," said Edwards. "Instead of offering you a fancy dinner or photo-ops with celebrities, we're giving you the opportunity to create the change we need to see in this country."
Rebuilding New Orleans is a challenge Edwards cares deeply about. He led over 700 college students on an alternative spring break to help rebuild a New Orleans neighborhood in 2006, and also launched his presidential campaign there. Since then, Edwards has returned numerous times, including the July launch of his "Road to One America" tour, to meet with people who are struggling to rebuild their lives and to raise awareness of the sad state of recovery efforts that have resulted from the disastrous incompetence of the Bush administration.
"More than two years after Hurricane Katrina, the Bush administration continues to ignore New Orleans," said Edwards. "This is a prime example of how the system in Washington is rigged to serve special interests and big corporations and ignore hard-working people struggling to get by and rebuild their communities."
