    America and Ohio lost a great man today, Governor Jim Rhodes. Laura and I share in this time of mourning with the people of Ohio. Jim was a dedicated, honorable public servant. His distinguished career included representing Ohio and its people longer than any other Governor in the State's history. Our thoughts and prayers are with his daughters, Suzanne and Sharon, and his entire family.
