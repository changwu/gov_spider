    After receiving the endorsement of the Alliance for Retired Americans, a national grassroots organization with more than 4.4 million members, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement:
"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of the Alliance for Retired Americans.
"I have fought for my entire career to protect Americans' right to retire with dignity and security after years of hard work, and to secure universal health care. As President, I will stand up to any and all Republican efforts to weaken, undermine, or privatize Social Security and Medicare, which form the bedrock of our nation's commitment to the well-being of older Americans.
"We shouldn't be cutting Social Security, we should be expanding it–and that is what I will fight to do, starting by strengthening benefits for those who are treated unfairly by the current system, including women who are widows and caregivers who took time out of the paid workforce to look after children, aging parents, or ailing family members. And I will take on prescription drug companies for their price gouging and fight to make health care more affordable, including by capping monthly out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs and allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices.
"Keeping Social Security and Medicare strong will keep our families strong–and when our families are strong, America is strong."
