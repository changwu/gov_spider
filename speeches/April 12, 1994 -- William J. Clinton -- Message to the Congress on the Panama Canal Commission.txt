    To the Congress of the United States:
As required by section 3522 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (Public Law 102-484; 22 U.S.C. 3611 note), I transmit herewith the recommendations for changes to the Panama Canal Commission. I have determined that the adoption of these recommendations would facilitate and encourage the operation of the Canal through an autonomous entity under the Government of Panama after the transfer of the waterway on December 31, 1999, pursuant to the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 and related agreements.
In accordance with the law cited above, an extensive study of the governance and financial management structure of the Panama Canal Commission was conducted. The study and its recommendations were then considered and discussed among representatives of the Departments of State, Defense, the Treasury, Commerce, Transportation, and Justice, as well as the Panama Canal Commission. The study, and the process that followed it, formed the basis for my recommendations, which are contained in the attached document.
