    After consultation with the Senate leadership, the President has asked Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd to delay consideration of the SALT II treaty on the Senate floor.
While the President continues to believe that ratification of SALT II is in the national security interest of the United States, he has concluded that the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, in defiance of the United Nations Charter, has made consideration of the SALT II treaty inappropriate at this time.
The President has asked that the delay continue while he and the Congress assess Soviet actions and intentions and devote their attention to legislative and other measures required to respond to the crisis created by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
