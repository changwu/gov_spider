HOUSTON, TexasÂ - After a sweeping victory in Colorado, Presidential candidate Ted Cruz issued the following statement:
"Today was another resounding victory for conservatives, Republicans, and Americans who care about the future of our country. Utah, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and tonight's incredible results in Colorado have proven this: Republicans are uniting behind our campaign because they want a leader with real solutions who will bring back jobs, freedom, and security.
"This election is about the hope that our children can still have a more promising landscape of opportunity than generations past. It's about bringing together Americans from all backgrounds who know that we will be stronger, more prosperous, and infinitely more free if we return power in Washington back to the people. So that Americans are free to create better jobs, live and worship freely, and once again proudly defend 'the last best hope of earth.'
"Thank you, Colorado, and we ask moms and dads, students and retirees across this country to join us so that together we make this election a turning point for the nation."
