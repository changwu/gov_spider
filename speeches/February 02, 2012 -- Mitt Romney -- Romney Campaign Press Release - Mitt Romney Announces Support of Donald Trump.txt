    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Donald Trump. Mr. Trump joins a growing list of over 2,500 elected officials, leaders and activists from across the country who have endorsed Mitt Romney.
"I am humbled by the endorsements I have received from Republicans across the political spectrum. Donald Trump's endorsement of me today sends a strong signal that he believes we have the best chance to make President Obama a one-term president," said Mitt Romney. "We share both a background in the private sector and a belief that Washington needs to get out of the way of small business. His support is a sign that business leaders are fed up with Washington and want someone with actual experience creating jobs and working in the real economy in the White House."
