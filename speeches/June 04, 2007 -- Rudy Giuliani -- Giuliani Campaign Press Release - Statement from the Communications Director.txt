    Below is a statement from Giuliani Communications Director Katie Levinson regarding tonight's Republican debate:
"Tonight, Rudy Giuliani once again demonstrated why he should be the next President of the United States. Whether it's staying on offense in the terrorists' war against us, securing our nation's borders or keeping our economy strong, Rudy knows what it takes to make government accountable and efficient. He is the strong, optimistic and proven leader our country needs during these challenging times."
