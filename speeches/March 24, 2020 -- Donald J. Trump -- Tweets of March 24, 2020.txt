This is the way the @nytimes finished a story on me. "You can see the contrast between the steady, assured, informed and strong leadership that VP Biden (Sleepy Joe) has shown, and the bungling, chaotic and dishonest start-stop approach that Mr. (not Pres.) Trump has shown....Retweets: 18940Favorites: 84487

....us since the beginning of this crisis." They meant the opposite? Forgot to mention that I closed our Country to China (and Europe) very early, long before it was considered acceptable to do so. Sleepy Joe said I was "xenophobic", but I saved thousands of lives! Fake News!Retweets: 15286Favorites: 74254

Republicans had a deal until Nancy Pelosi rode into town from her extended vacation. The Democrats want the Virus to win? They are asking for things that have nothing to do with our great workers or companies. They want Open Borders & Green New Deal. Republicans shouldn't agree!Retweets: 49112Favorites: 196419

This is not about the ridiculous Green New Deal. It is about putting our great workers and companies BACK TO WORK!Retweets: 45714Favorites: 211686

Congress must approve the deal, without all of the nonsense, today. The longer it takes, the harder it will be to start up our economy. Our workers will be hurt!Retweets: 40795Favorites: 192761

Our people want to return to work. They will practice Social Distancing and all else, and Seniors will be watched over protectively & lovingly. We can do two things together. THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM! Congress MUST ACT NOW. We will come back strong!Retweets: 55156Favorites: 277516

Price transparency is so important for the people of our Country. In many ways, it will prove to be as important as healthcare itself. A great issue for both Republicans and Democrats. Hopefully it will be approved!Retweets: 20767Favorites: 103919
