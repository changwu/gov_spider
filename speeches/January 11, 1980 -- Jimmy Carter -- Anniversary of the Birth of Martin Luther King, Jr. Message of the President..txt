    DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., BIRTHDAY
January 15, 1980
As we celebrate the fifty-first anniversary of the birth of Martin Luther King, Jr., the principles and causes for which he gave his life are being challenged at home and abroad. There have always been voices that urged violent repression in the name of religion. There have always been people who were willing to sacrifice others to further their own causes. Martin Luther King, Jr., taught us a different lesson. He taught us to live up to our highest principles of freedom and equal justice, to love and respect the tiniest spark of humanity in the most unlovable and find ways to fan that tiny spark into a lasting flame that would light the way to a better day.
At this time when the forces of tyranny and terrorism are engaging in violence, often in the name of religion, it is important that we remember the power of nonviolence to change both institutions and the hearts of individuals.
As we face the challenges of a new decade, we are strengthened by the memory of all the losing battles that went into the great triumphs of Martin Luther King, Jr. May we have the same courage to fortify our convictions, the same love and will to hold out to the final victory.
JIMMY CARTER.
