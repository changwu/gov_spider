    SANTA FE, NM- New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson today issued the following statement regarding former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack's announcement that he is withdrawing from the race for the 2008 Democratic Presidential Nomination:
"While I respect and understand Tom's decision, he will be missed from the campaign. He is a good friend, and a man of integrity and tremendous ability. As Governor, Tom accomplished a great deal for the people of Iowa. He was a leader among Governors as a former Chair of the Democratic Governor's Association, and I know that he will continue to be a strong force in the national Democratic Party."
