    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Sen. Paul, R-KY)
The Administration strongly opposes passage of S.J.Res. 65, a joint resolution disapproving arms sales to Bahrain. This joint resolution relates to a Foreign Military Sales case for 120 Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) pods and 110 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) pods worth $300 million to the Kingdom of Bahrain. This system is intended for the territorial defense of Bahrain, which is home to U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, forward-deployed U.S. Marine Central Command, and the Combined Maritime Force. The utilization of this ground-based system would enhance Bahrain's ability to protect itself against threats to territorial sovereignty, particularly from Iran. Furthermore, this system will bolster a Bahraini defense infrastructure that supports United States activities and priorities related to countering Iran's regional destabilizing activities and anti-piracy efforts in the Arabian and Red Seas.
Apart from negatively impacting our bilateral relationship with the Kingdom of Bahrain, the joint resolution would hamper our ability to build and maintain security cooperation relationships, and sustain our pressure campaign against al-Qa'ida and ISIS. Bahrain also plays a critical role in countering and exposing harmful Iranian activities and proxies in the region.
If the President were presented with S.J.Res. 65, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the joint resolution.
