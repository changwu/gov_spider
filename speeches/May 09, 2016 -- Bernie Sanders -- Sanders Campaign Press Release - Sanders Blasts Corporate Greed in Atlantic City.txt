    ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. - Speaking to supporters in this economically suffering seaside city, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday said he is fighting for workers who have seen greedy Wall Street hedge fund managers and corporate raiders cut their pay and destroy their pensions and health care.
"That greed is not acceptable," Sanders told a crowd of more than 2400 at Boardwalk Hall located across town from the Taj Mahal, a casino once owned by Donald Trump, the likely Republican presidential candidate. "That greed is destroying America and you are looking at somebody who if elected president will take these people on," Sanders said.
After Trump's casino went bankrupt, another billionaire, Carl Icahn, last February added the property to his collection of two other Atlantic City casinos.

Workers at the Taj Mahal have seen their paychecks cut by more than one-third, their pensions eliminated and their high-quality health insurance plan eliminated.
Icahn has endorsed Trump, who in turn put the billionaire on his list of potential treasury secretaries.
Before the rally, Sanders met with rank-and-file members of UNITE HERE! Local 54. The Vermont senator has been endorsed by the union representing 10,000 housekeepers, bartenders, servers, cooks and dishwashers in Atlantic City.
