    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Clarke (D) NC and 3l others)
The administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 1495, but will seek amendments in the Senate to (1) delete subsection 4(b)(2), which would forgive repayment of a $2 million loan made to Swain County, North Carolina, by the Farmers Home Administration for construction of a high school; (2) change the bill's wilderness designations from 465,000 acres to 418,200 acres of wilderness and 46,500 acres of potential wilderness (which would become wilderness upon termination of incompatible use or rights); and (3) make the wilderness designation effective upon enactment.
