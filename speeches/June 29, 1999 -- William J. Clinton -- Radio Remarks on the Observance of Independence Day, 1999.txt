    This weekend, as we celebrate the 223d anniversary of the Declaration of Independence and the birthday of our great Nation, let us reflect on what it means to be an American.
Let us remember the visionaries, the patriots, and the soldiers who were inspired by a single ideal, that we are all created equal; and let us strive to honor that ideal today and every day by building a world where every individual can make the most of his or her talents and know what it truly means to live and breathe free.
On this, the last Independence Day of the 20th century, Hillary and I wish you a happy and memorable Fourth of July.
