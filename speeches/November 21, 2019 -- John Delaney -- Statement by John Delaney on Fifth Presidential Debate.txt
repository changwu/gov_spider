    FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD - John Delaney releases the following statement:
"What was missing from the debate last night was a real discussion about jobs. Jobs and economic security remain the priority for American families and we need a candidate that has plans to encourage entrepreneurship, bring jobs to struggling rural communities, and grow wages - that's how we beat Trump and that's how we help hardworking Americans. As the only candidate who was successful in business and in government, I have real solutions to these issues."
