    The President spoke today with Prime Minister Cameron of the United Kingdom to consult about the crisis in Ukraine. The leaders welcomed the news that separatists have agreed to implement the ceasefire declared unilaterally by President Poroshenko. They re-emphasized the need for Russia to stop the flow of weapons and militants across the border and to use its influence over separatist groups to encourage them to take immediate concrete steps to implement President Poroshenko's peace plan. They agreed that should Russia fail to take these immediate steps to deescalate the situation in eastern Ukraine, the United States and the European Union would work to implement additional coordinated measures to impose costs on Russia. The leaders also discussed the situation in Iraq and the threat posed by ISIL.
