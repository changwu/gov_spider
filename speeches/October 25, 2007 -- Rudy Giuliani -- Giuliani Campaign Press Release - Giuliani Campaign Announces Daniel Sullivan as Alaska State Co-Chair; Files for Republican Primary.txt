    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that Anchorage Municipal Assemblyman Daniel Sullivan has joined Team Rudy. He will serve as State Co-Chair for the Mayor's Alaska campaign. In his new role, Assemblyman Sullivan also filed official paperwork today to place Rudy Giuliani's name on Alaska's Republican primary ballot.
"The Mayor is the only Republican who can win in the general election because he is a proven leader capable of running an effective 50 state campaign," said Sullivan. "Alaskan voters want a candidate like Rudy, a candidate we can trust, a candidate with executive leadership experience and a clear vision for America."
"Dan is a welcomed addition to the Mayor's campaign and will provide valuable insight into the issues important to Alaskan voters," said Giuliani's Deputy National Political Director Rick Wiley.
