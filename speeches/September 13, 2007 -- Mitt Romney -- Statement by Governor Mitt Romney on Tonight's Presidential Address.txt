Boston, MA – Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement on President Bush's address to the nation:
"President Bush understands that our most crucial objective in Iraq is to make sure it does not become a safe haven for al-Qaeda and Jihadist terrorists. But that's just what would happen if Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards have their way. Our troop presence has emboldened Sunni leaders to resist al-Qaeda. This is progress – important progress.
"Today's assassination of Sheik Abdul-Sattar Abu Risha, who recently met with President Bush, underscores how serious Jihadists like al-Qaeda take this struggle, and we must do the same. Also of concern to all Americans is the growing evidence of Iran's role as an active antagonist in Iraq. The United States must craft an assertive and comprehensive strategy to get Iran to back off."
