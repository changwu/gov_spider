    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Tauzin (D) Louisiana and 9 others)
The Administration supports H.R. 3786.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 3786 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of the pay-as- you-go effect of this bill is that it would reduce the deficit by less than $500,000 over FYs 1994-1998.
