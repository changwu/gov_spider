    NEW YORK â€” Israel is the closest and most reliable U.S. ally in the Middle East. As president, Mike will do everything possible to ensure its enduring existence. Mike will ensure our commitment to Israel remains unshakeable, and our commitment to Israel's security, prosperity and democracy is based on shared values.
Mike has been a strong supporter of Israel for decades. He has visited Israel over 10 times since 2001, including traveling on an El Al flight when the FAA banned American carriers from flying to Israel during the Gaza conflict in 2014.
Unlike Trump, Mike opposes politicizing relations with Israel, such as using military aid to pressure Israel to make political concessions. As president, Mike will:

Support removing the UN Human Rights Council's Agenda Item 7, so that the Council considers Israel in the same manner as every other country.
Work to make the strongest deal possible to constrain the Iranian regime's aggression and territorial ambitions.
Reaffirm our country's bipartisan commitment to Israel and support a two-state solution.
Put an end to Iran's nuclear program because the world must never allow Iran to threaten Israel, and the whole region, with nuclear war.
Maintain Jerusalem as the location of the U.S. embassy in Israel. Jerusalem is and must remain the undivided capital of the state of Israel.
Oppose the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement.
