BOISE, Idaho â€” 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul was endorsed today by Idaho State Representative Phil Hart (R-Hayden). Representing the 3rd District, Rep. Hart serves an area comprising Hayden and the northern part of Kootenai County including parts of Coeur d'Alene.
For the second presidential election in a row, State Representative Phil Hart has endorsed 12-term Texas Congressman Ron Paul for president.
According to Rep. Hart, "Ron Paul is the only candidate who understands our economic problems. He is also the only frontrunner candidate who is not propped up by those who have caused our economic demise."
With regard to Dr. Paul's foreign policy, Rep. Hart said, "Those Americans who understand our foreign policy the best, our active military men and women, support Ron Paul overwhelmingly. America needs a paradigm shift, and Ron Paul is the only candidate for President who can deliver on that."
Mr. Hart is owner of an engineering company licensed to perform structural engineering in 14 states and two Canadian provinces. He graduated with a degree in civil engineering from the University of Utah and an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Hart is a proud member of Gun Owners of America and the National Rifle Association, and is active in the chamber of commerce.
Rep. Hart is currently serving his fourth term in the Idaho House of Representatives.
Providing a strong boost to Ron Paul's Idaho organization, such endorsements present Ron Paul as the conservative alternative to Mitt Romney. They also demonstrate that the 12-term Congressman from Texas has the only campaign organization capable of maintaining a 50-state competition with the moderate-establishment Romney.
