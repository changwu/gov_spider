    Today I have signed into law H.R. 3807, the "Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty Implementation Act of 1991." The Act supports the United States Government's program to transfer Conventional Forces in Europe treaty-limited equipment within the NATO Alliance. Implementation serves U.S. security interests and achieves Administration objectives.
However, I have concerns over two provisions of the Act. Section 401(c) requires that the Inspector General of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency submit a report on certain matters to the President, the Speaker of the House, and the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Because prior review of executive branch reports is integral to the President's constitutional authority to supervise and control decision-making within the executive branch, H.R. 3807 shall not be interpreted to encroach upon that authority.
Section 402 requires additional congressional oversight of On-Site Inspection Agency (OSIA) activities. The existing review by the House and Senate Armed Services and Appropriations Committees provides sufficient congressional oversight of OSIA activities. Expanding the review to include other committees of the House and Senate will unnecessarily burden the budget review and oversight process. The requested report and budget documentation for the Committees on Foreign Affairs and Foreign Relations will be submitted merely to provide notice.
