    MANCHESTER, NH- Senator Rand Paul has reached a milestone in the Granite State as he received 500 endorsements from New Hampshire public officials, business leaders, and activists. "With 500 members on our leadership team, this announcement illustrates that Rand Paul has assembled the largest, most robust ground game in the Granite State. Our team has made hundreds of thousands of phone calls spreading Rand's message of liberty across the state. Earlier this week, we experienced back-to-back standing-room-only town halls that far outpaced our rivals' events. You can feel the momentum on the ground. It's clear, Rand Paul's message is resonating. We will shock the Washington Machine and the media elite." says Mike Biundo, Senior Advisor to the Rand Paul for President campaign.Click HERE to read the Union Leader's coverage.
