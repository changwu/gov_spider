    The Street.com's John Fout: "Former Mass. Gov. Mitt Romney, who I think won the debate, was best prepared to answer the question. He suggested everyone had to pitch in to help the economy, including business and government. He recognized the need to fix schools, invest in technology, encourage free trade and keep taxes down. He took a shot at Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, a Democrat, by jokingly suggesting he was 'nervous she would put a tax on the debate.'"

The New York Times' Adam Nagourney And Marc Santora: "Mr. Romney was sharpest in attacking Mr. Giuliani for efforts against the line-item veto. 'Mayor Giuliani took the line-item that the president had all the way to the Supreme Court and took it away from the president of the United States,' he said. 'I think that was a mistake.'" (Adam Nagourney and Marc Santora, "Romney and Giuliani Spar as New Guy Looks On," The New York Times, 10/10/07)

Jennifer Granholm for the recent budget-balancing tax hikes." (Editorial, "GOP debate validates state's primary decision," Detroit News, 10/10/07)
ABC's Brett Hovell And Christine Byun: "Romney delivered the line of the debate with his analysis of the actor's entry onto the stage. 'Is this our sixth debate, I think, something like that?' Romney began. 'This is a lot like "Law & Order," Senator. It has a huge cast, the series seems to go on forever, and Fred Thompson shows up at the end.'" (Brett Hovell and Christine Byun, "Romney Vs. Giuliani On Taxes," ABC News, http://abcnews.go.com/, 10/9/07)
The New York Sun's Seth Gitell: "The former Massachusetts governor also scored early in the debate by bringing up the tax increase supported by Governor Granholm of Michigan, an issue of intense interest to Republicans in the Great Lake State, where Mr. Romney's father, George Romney, once served as governor."

The Politico's Jonathan Martin: "Romney was at his best in citing his native's state economic troubles and explaining to appreciative Michigan Republicans in the audience what he thought part of the problem was.

Detroit News' Henry Payne: "Romney made a sharp joke at the outset about Governor Granholm's tax reflex, but for Democrats it's not funny.
