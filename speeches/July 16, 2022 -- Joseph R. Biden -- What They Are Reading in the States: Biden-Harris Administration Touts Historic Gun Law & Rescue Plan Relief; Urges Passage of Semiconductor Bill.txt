This week, Americans are reading about how Members of Congress, state and local leaders, gun violence survivors, families, and advocates joined President Biden at a White House event commemorating the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act â€“ the most significant legislation to reduce gun violence in 30 years.
Governors, mayors, and local leaders joined Vice President Harris, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling, and White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs Director Julie Rodriguez for a White House American Rescue Plan Summit. Following the half-day Summit, elected officials spoke to local reports about how more than $40 billion of American Rescue Plan funds have been committed to strengthening and expanding our workforce in the states.
Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu also traveled to Milwaukee, Wisconsin and spoke with local press outlets about President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which is rebuilding infrastructure in the Badger State by improving roads and bridges, replacing lead pipes to provide clean water, expanding high speed internet, and creating millions of good-paying union jobs that don't require a college degree.
And Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo led a White House Regional Press Call for reporters in Indiana, Missouri and Ohio to underscore the urgent need for Congress to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act, which will spur American manufacturing, strengthen our supply chains, and help lower costs for families.
See a round-up of the local coverage below.
