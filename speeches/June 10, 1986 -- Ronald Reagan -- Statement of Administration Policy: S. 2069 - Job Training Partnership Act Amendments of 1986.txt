    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Quayle (R) IA and 3 others)
While the Administration does not believe amendments to the Job Training Partnership Act are necessary, it has no objection to Senate passage of S. 2069. However, the Administration would prefer that section 6 of S. 2069 authorize rather than require remedial education programs in the summer youth employment program.
