    The "Futurework" report, released today by the Department of Labor, underscores the need for an even stronger commitment to education and training to help workers thrive in an economy that is changing faster than ever before. Now more than ever, American workers must learn the new skills needed to face the challenges of the 21st century economy.
The Republican tax proposal, because it would force cuts in education and worker training of roughly 50 percent in 2009, would deny millions of Americans the chance to gain these skills. Now is not the time to shortchange the future opportunities of American workers by enacting an irresponsible tax plan that fails to allow adequate investment in education and training.
