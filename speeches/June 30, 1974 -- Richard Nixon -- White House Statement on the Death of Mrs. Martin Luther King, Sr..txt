    THE PRESIDENT and Mrs. Nixon were most distressed to learn of the tragic death of Mrs. Martin Luther King, Sr., the death of one of her parishioners, and the wounding of another.
It is a terrible irony that a family whose devotion to nonviolence has so greatly advanced the cause of social justice in the United States should have two of its own members struck down in this fashion.
The President's prayers are with Dr. King, Sr., in this hour of his bereavement, and with the members of the Ebenezer Baptist Church upon whom this tragedy falls with a special force.
