    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Scheuer (D) New York and 14 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2427 unless it is amended to: (1) delete Title IV (establishment of a National Agricultural Weather Information System in the U.S. Department of Agriculture); (2) delete new restrictions on the Commerce Department's ability to manage effectively the National Weather Service through closings or consolidations of offices; and (3) authorize appropriations totalling $738 million instead of $863 million for FY 1990, and such sums as may be necessary for FYs 1991 and 1992.
Title IV would duplicate existing Federal, State, and private sector programs. It would also be inconsistent with current law, which designates the Department of Commerce (National Weather Service) as the lead Federal agency for providing agricultural weather and climatological services.
