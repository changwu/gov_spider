Pool report 5 -- Ida remarks 
President Biden entered the South Court Auditorium and began speaking at 12:09 pm. His comments were streamed live on the White House website.
He apologized for the delay and said he was getting "further updates" on Hurricane Ida, which the president said was the fifth-largest hurricane in U.S. history. He said he has been in touch this morning with the governors of Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey, which were all hit with flooding from Ida's rains last night. He noted he approved a disaster declaration for California last night for the Caldor fire, at the request of its governor.
Highlights from his remarks. Please check quotes against livestream/transcript:
"I want to express my heartfelt thanks to all the first responders and everyone that's been working through the night."
"I've seen these firefighters up close. Their courage is astounding. They are some of the bravest people I know."
On the response to Ida:
He praised multi-billion dollar federal investment in New Orleans' levees: "It held. It was strong. It worked."
Mr. Biden said he had been assured by the governor of Louisiana that his visit to New Orleans tomorrow would not disrupt relief efforts.
He said the government still needs to do more to restore power, cell phone service and other lifelines to the region. "I get hourly updates on progress from FEMA, well into the night," he said.
"This is complicated and really dangerous work. And we're working as fast as humanly possible to get it done."
He noted the region hit by Ida includes large oil and gas production areas, and reiterated steps the White House has previously announced -- like relaxing limits on daily hours driven for truck drivers transporting gasoline -- in an effort to avoid gas shortages.
He called on insurance companies to pay relocation costs for customers who were not under mandatory evacuation orders, citing reports that some companies could deny claims for customers who were under voluntary evacuation orders. "No one fled this killer storm because they were looking for a vacation or a road trip," he said. "So I'm calling the private insurance companies, right now -- don't hide behind the fine print. Do your job."
Mr. Biden said the past few days of floods, fires and the hurricane are another reminder that "the climate crisis is here," saying he will press later this month for Congress to approve a large spending bill that carries much of his "Build Back Better" agenda, including efforts to fight climate change.
Mr. Biden concluded at 12:26 p.m. He did not respond to shouted questions.
