    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 504(h) of Public Law 98-164, as amended (22 U.S.C. 4413(i)), I herewith transmit the third Annual Report of the National Endowment for Democracy, which covers Fiscal Year 1986.
It is with pleasure and pride that I commend this report to your attention. Nineteen hundred and eighty-six was an encouraging year for democracy. The Endowment played an important role in this democratic resurgence, supporting significant efforts in the Philippines, Haiti, and many other key countries. Although the Endowment has been in operation for only 3 years, the enthusiasm and support with which the world's democrats have greeted this initiative have already been overwhelming. The program that the Endowment has undertaken , as you will see in this report, is further proof that democracy is an idea whose time has come.
