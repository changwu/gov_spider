    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Udall (D) AZ and Waxman (R) CA)
The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4600 because it would:
— expand unnecessarily the broad array of health services already provided to eligible Indians by creating new programs, such as catastrophic health emergencies and juvenile alcohol and drug abuse, and by making new categories of individuals eligible for IHS services.
— unnecessarily and wastefully disrupt the organization of the Indian Health Service (IHS) by moving it from its present location with other health services programs in the Health Resources and Services Administration of the Public Health Service to the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
— maintain redundant sanitation construction authorities already in the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
— require numerous burdensome and costly reports, studies, and other new program responsibilities unrelated to the IHS basic health services delivery mission.
