    I AM GRATIFIED by the reports, just issued by the Departments of Commerce and Labor, that unemployment was cut by nearly 600,000 between August and September. This is a much larger decline than could be expected at this time of year, and reflects the accelerating rate of recovery in our economy, which began last April.
It is encouraging that large numbers of persons are being called back to their jobs in the manufacturing industries that were most affected during the decline. This is reflected in the reports of the Bureau of Labor Statistics which show an over-all increase in non-agricultural employment of approximately 550,000 in the month of September alone. This is larger by 100,000 than the increase that might be expected for seasonal reasons.
There are also good reasons for expecting a continuing recovery in our economy during the months ahead. This will mean further improvements in job conditions and job prospects.
It is noteworthy that the improvement in employment conditions revealed by these reports has been accomplished while the cost of living has been virtually stable. However, we must not for a moment relax our efforts to keep the recovery unmarred by inflationary. developments.
