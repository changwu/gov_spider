    The President and the Prime Minister met for 2 hours and 10 minutes and discussed a full range of international issues facing the North Atlantic alliance. Their warm and productive conversation focused on German reunification; NATO; the status of conventional forces in Europe talks; East-West relations, particularly the situation in Lithuania; Iraq; and the status of COCOM.
President Bush and Prime Minister Thatcher have mutually supportive views on these issues. The special relationship between our two countries was evident as they considered a strong and steady Western response to the changes in Eastern Europe.
