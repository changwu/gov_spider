Statement by Senator John McCain on "Stand Up to Cancer" Event
"I applaud ABC, CBS and NBC coming together tonight to air an unprecedented one-hour program titled 'Stand Up to Cancer' which will bring prominent individuals from the worlds of TV, film, music, sports, science and journalism with the singular goal of raising awareness and funds to win the fight against cancer.
"Despite achieving many life-saving advances, the war against cancer is an ongoing struggle that continues every day. Nearly 1,500 Americans die every day from this devastating disease. The doctors and researchers engaged in the heroic battle to win this fight are counting on a sustained national commitment to find new treatments and cures.
"As President, I will lead the effort for stronger and more coordinated public and private research efforts. I have worked in the past to double NIH funding, and will also work for greater focus on healthy living, early detection, and ensuring access to quality and affordable care for all Americans, especially those who are denied coverage because of a devastating disease like cancer. This is a fight we must and will win as a nation."
