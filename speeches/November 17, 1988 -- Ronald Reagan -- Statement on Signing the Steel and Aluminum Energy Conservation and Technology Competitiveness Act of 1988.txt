    I have today approved S. 2470, the "Steel and Aluminum Energy Conservation and Technology Competitiveness Act of 1988." The Act provides a legislative framework for implementing the Department of Energy's Steel Initiative Management Plan. This Act also provides for the establishment of public-private sector partnerships to undertake scientific research and development of technology of significance to industry, utilizing the expertise of industry scientists and scientists from Federal laboratories, universities, and other organizations.
I have approved S. 2470 with the understanding that section 5(b) of S. 2470, regarding ownership of inventions resulting from these partnerships, will be interpreted in a manner consistent with the Bayh-Dole Act (Pub. L. 96-17, 94 Stat. 3019) and Executive Order No. 12591.
Finally, it should be understood that Federal funding of the Steel Initiative Program will be undertaken within budget constraints and that the program will be implemented to maximize non-Federal cost-sharing and to focus Federal funds on projects that could not be undertaken by industry without additional Federal support.
