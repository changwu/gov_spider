VP Pool Report #3 - Remarks
Vice President Harris offered remarks on vaccinations, international leadership and support of vaccine distribution on a global scale, small business aid, American Jobs and Family Plans, workers' rights, and addressing root causes of migration in the Northern Triangle
The Vice President highlighted that CEOs across the country are working with the administration to develop support for the Northern Triangle region.
A funny moment took place when an attendee forgot to mute themselves. The VP made a joke and continued on with her opening remarks.
Rough quotes include (please check with the official transcript): 
We are bringing CEOs and private corporations in the US together to think about their support, and then again back to the point about agriculture and understanding that we are looking all over the world and particularly in this region, extreme climate incidents like the two hurricanes that devastated that region, and combining that with what we're seeing, such as drought in Guatemala. What that means to the economic base of this region, particularly because a large part of their economic strength has been in their agricultural industry, which have been directly impacted by the extreme weather. So this is some of the work that we can do together, and, and to address what I call, not only the root causes of the root causes of the migration, and, and just close my comments by saying, the impact of all these issues, we, the poverty, extreme, food insecurity, violence, domestic violence in the treatment of women and girls. So many of these issues are long standing.
Handing off pool duty.
