On June 10th the United States will impose a 5% Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico and into our Country STOP. The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied..Retweets: 39633Favorites: 162835

Hard to believe that with the Crisis on the Border the Dems won't do the quick and easy fix. Would solve the problem but they want Open Borders which equals crime!Retweets: 19394Favorites: 81206

Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades. Because of the Dems our Immigration Laws are BAD. Mexico makes a FORTUNE from the U.S. have for decades they can easily fix this problem. Time for them to finally do what must be done!Retweets: 22145Favorites: 92051

In order not to pay Tariffs if they start rising companies will leave Mexico which has taken 30% of our Auto Industry and come back home to the USA. Mexico must take back their country from the drug lords and cartels. The Tariff is about stopping drugs as well as illegals!Retweets: 23128Favorites: 93202

90% of the Drugs coming into the United States come through Mexico & our Southern Border. 80000 people died last year 1000000 people ruined. This has gone on for many years & nothing has been done about it. We have a 100 Billion Dollar Trade Deficit with Mexico. It's time!Retweets: 29155Favorites: 109598
