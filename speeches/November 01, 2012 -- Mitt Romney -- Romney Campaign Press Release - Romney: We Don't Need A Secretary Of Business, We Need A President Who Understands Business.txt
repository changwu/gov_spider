This isn't the time for small measures. This is a time for greatness. This is a time for big change, for real change." â€” Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "Now, I know the president's been trying to figure out some way to suggest he's got some new ideas, because with all these people out of work, with 3 million more women in poverty today than when he took office, with 15 more million people on food stamps than when he took office, he's got to find something to suggest it's going to be better over the next four years. And so he came up with an idea last week, which is he's going to create the department of business. I don't think adding a new chair in his Cabinet will help add millions of jobs on Main Street. I mean, unfortunately, what you've seen before your very eyes is a campaign that keeps on shrinking and shrinking and shrinking to smaller things. I mean, he's been out talking about how he's going to save Big Bird and then playing silly word games with my last name and then -- or first, and then attacking me day-in and day-out. Attacking me doesn't make an agenda, doesn't get people back to work. We don't need a secretary of business to understand business; we need a president who understands business, and I do. That's why I will be able to get this economy going. This isn't the time for small measures. This is a time for greatness. This is a time for big change, for real change. And that's why, just as your next senator said, this is a time where from day one he's going to make changes, I'm going to make real changes, I'm going to get this economy going. From day one, we're making changes."
