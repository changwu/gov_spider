    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 4/9/92)(Senate)(Owens (D) NY)
The Administration has no objection to Senate passage of H.R. 4712, provided section 111 is amended. Section 111 would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make legislative recommendations to Congress. Such a requirement would contravene the President's exclusive authority under Article II, section 3 of the Constitution to recommend to Congress such measures as he deems necessary and expedient.
