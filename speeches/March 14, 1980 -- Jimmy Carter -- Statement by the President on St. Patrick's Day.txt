    Rosalynn and I rejoice with those who celebrate St. Patrick's Day, and we share your pride in the great Irish heritage it honors.
The fact that this observance has such national participation is perhaps the truest measure of the influence of the Irish on American life.
Rosalynn and I are pleased to have this annual opportunity to salute the positive effects of Irish culture and customs throughout our society and in every area of endeavor.
We hope this day will be especially happy and memorable for all our fellow citizens of Irish descent and for all who join them in the "wearin' o' the green."
