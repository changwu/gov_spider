    The President is extremely pleased at this example of cooperative spirit between the Congress and the executive branch. He expresses his deep respect to Congress and particularly to the House for their action, which sends a solid signal of U.S.. resolve to support friends in this hemisphere. The President looks forward to working with Congress to take the next step in the process, which is to appropriate the funds this vote authorizes.
