    Castro a top-three choice for Latinx Democrats in new Univision poll
SAN ANTONIO, TX (September 10, 2019) – In a Univision News poll released today, voters in Texas support Secretary Julián Castro over Donald Trump by three points in a general election match up. The poll also highlights that Secretary Castro, who served as Mayor of San Antonio, Texas is a top three choice among Democratic Latinx voters, and has the third highest favorability ratio amongst 2020 Democratic candidates.
"There's no question that Texas is in play in 2020," said campaign manager Maya Rupert. "With the right candidate we can win Texas's 38 electoral votes, beat Donald Trump, and turn the Lone Star State blue for at least a generation. Secretary Castro is that candidate."
The new poll was released just ahead of the third Democratic presidential primary debate, this Thursday in Houston, hosted by ABC News in partnership with Univision and after Secretary Castro's latest endorsements from former Texas State Senator Leticia Van de Putte, Houston Controller Chris Brown, and Texas State Representative Christina Morales. Secretary Castro now has more than 30 endorsements from Texas officials since announcing his candidacy for president in January.
