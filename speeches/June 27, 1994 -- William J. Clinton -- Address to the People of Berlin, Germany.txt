    On July 11 and the 12th, I will have the honor to be the first American President to visit Berlin as the capital of a free, democratic, and unified Germany.
Berlin has stood for decades as a great symbol of freedom. Hundreds of thousands of Americans in our military and other walks of life have been symbolic citizens of your city during nearly half a century of peace.
Over the past two generations, Berlin's place in history has been the dividing line between East and West. Today Berlin is poised to play an even greater role in history, as a place that can help bring East and West together for all time.
There are few greater points of pride for the American people than the partnership we have enjoyed over these two generations with Germany and with Berlin. Now we are once again joined in partnership as we work together to build a future for the whole of Europe, democratic, united, prosperous, and free.
On July 12th, I look forward to heralding that future when I speak before the Brandenburg Gate to the people of Berlin and of all of Germany. I hope all Berliners who can will join me there on that occasion.
