    Ahead of multi-presidential candidate event in Monroe County on February 17th, Delaney picks up endorsement from neighboring county's Democratic Chair
DES MOINES, IA â€“ John Delaney announced a new endorsement today from Iowa's Lucas County Democratic Party Chair and newly-elected Lucas County Caucus Chair Joan Amos. Chair Amos' support continues a surge of early endorsements from three Iowa Democratic County Chairs in counties spanning the state.
"My husband John and I believe that John Delaney is the best candidate to stand up against Donald Trump, bring our country together, and really get things done in Washington," said Chair Amos. "John Delaney's policies will improve people's lives and can get passed right away. We intend to caucus for him, and we encourage fellow Democrats to look into his policies and hear him speak."
Delaney is the first Democratic presidential candidate to have visited all 99 Iowa counties since 2008. He is drawing attention for his unique bipartisan approaches that aim to quickly pass legislation for universal healthcare, universal pre-k and community college, climate change, automation, and infrastructure. He has six field offices in Iowa and has made more than 20 visits to the state.
