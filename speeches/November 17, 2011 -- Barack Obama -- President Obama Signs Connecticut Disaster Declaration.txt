    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Connecticut and ordered Federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the area affected by a severe storm during the period of October 29-30, 2011.
Federal funding is available to state and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storm in Fairfield, Hartford, Litchfield, Middlesex, New Haven, Tolland, and Windham Counties.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide, including the tribal lands of the Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan Tribal Nations.
W. Craig Fugate, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Stephen M. De Blasio Sr. as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
FEMA said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
