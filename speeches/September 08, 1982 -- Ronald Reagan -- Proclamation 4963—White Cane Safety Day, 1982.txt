  A Proclamation

The white cane symbolizes safety and independence to many thousands of blind and other severely visually handicapped individuals.
It enables them to engage in normal activities of daily living as well as to manage businesses or perform tasks involved in employment with confidence and efficiency.
The white cane serves notice to the nation's drivers to be cautious and to the pedestrians to be courteous and considerate of the special needs of the severely visually handicapped. It may also in a special way be considered an extension of their bodily functions, providing courage, strength, confidence, hope and independence as well as mobility.
To make all Americans more fully aware of the special significance of the white cane and the need for extra care and courtesy when approaching its user, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved October 6, 1964, has authorized the President to proclaim October 15 each year as White Cane Safety Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 1982, as White Cane Safety Day.
I ask all Americans to mark this day with concern and respect for the special needs of the severely visually handicapped and, especially, to note the white cane, in order that our busy streets will be safer for all.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 8th day of Sept. in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.

RONALD REAGAN
