    Fernley, NV - Today, Senator Barack Obama released the following statement on the Fernley levee break.
"Early this Saturday morning, a 30-foot section of the Truckee Canal levee broke, sending waves of water into the town of Fernley and trapping nearly 4,000 people in their homes. Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to the victims of this sudden disaster, and we honor the swift and heroic response from rescue organizations, including the Fallon Naval Air Station. I have asked my staff and supporters in the area to take time out from campaigning this weekend to assist in the relief efforts."
