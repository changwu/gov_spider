    WASHINGTON - On Thursday, May 27, President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will host the first ever White House reception in honor of Jewish American Heritage Month.
The reception serves as an opportunity to highlight and celebrate the range and depth of Jewish American heritage and contributions to American culture, with guests representing the many walks of life that have helped weave the fabric of American history. Invitees include a range of community leaders and prominent Jewish Americans from Olympians and professional athletes to members of Congress, business leaders, scholars, military veterans, and astronauts.
Since taking office, President Obama has continued the tradition started under the previous Administration of proclaiming May Jewish American Heritage Month.
In this year’s proclamation, President Obama said, “The Jewish American story is an essential chapter of the American narrative. It is one of refuge from persecution; of commitment to service, faith, democracy, and peace; and of tireless work to achieve success. As leaders in every facet of American life -- from athletics, entertainment, and the arts to academia, business, government, and our Armed Forces – Jewish Americans have shaped our Nation and helped steer the course of our history. We are a stronger and more hopeful country because so many Jews from around the world have made America their home.”
Further details about the reception will be announced as they become available.
