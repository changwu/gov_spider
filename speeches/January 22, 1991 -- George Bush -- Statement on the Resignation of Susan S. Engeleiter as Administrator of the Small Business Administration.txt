    I have today regretfully accepted the resignation of Susan Engeleiter as Administrator of the Small Business Administration, to be effective on or before May 1, 1991. Susan has notified me that she intends to return to the Midwest to pursue a career in the private sector.
When I asked Susan to join my administration in May 1989, I gave her the assignment of revitalizing the SBA and setting it upon a stable course for the future -- a course of encouraging entrepreneurship and helping men and women of all ethnic and economic groups utilize small business ownership as a path to full participation in the American economy. She has certainly accomplished that important mission.
In addition, she has been an effective advocate for women and minorities in this administration, serving as Chairwoman of the National Women's Business Council, a member of the President's Commission on Minority Business Development, and successfully expanding the Women's Network for Entrepreneurial Training to a nationwide mentoring program for new business owners.
Administrator Engeleiter has been a forceful advocate for small businesses throughout the country and a valued member of this administration. I sincerely thank Susan for her service. Both Barbara and I wish her the very best as she returns home to the Midwest.
