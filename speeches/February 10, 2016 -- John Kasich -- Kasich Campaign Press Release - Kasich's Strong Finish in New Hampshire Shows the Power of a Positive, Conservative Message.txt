    Tonight in New Hampshire Governor John Kasich took a major step toward winning the Republican nomination with a strong, second place finish in the New Hampshire Republican primary.
Kasich's dominant finish came despite being outspent by millions and having more than $7 million in negative ads targeted at him by those he overcame. Ultimately what carried the day, however, was Kasich's positive, conservative vision of bringing people together to create a jobs-friendly climate, rein-in Washington and move America forward.
"Governor Kasich is now the leading governor in the race and the only one with a realistic chance at the nomination," said Senior Strategist John Weaver. "He showed that a conservative with a positive message will succeed and, in fact, that's the only way for Republicans to win the White House. As the governor of Ohio he knows how to do it."
Kasich is leaving for South Carolina tonight where he will hit the ground running leading up to the state's Feb. 20 primary. He is now in a key position to accumulate delegates in the early primary calendar before winning Michigan and taking the nomination battle to the Midwest, the home turf where he will win the nomination.
John Kasich is a successful, conservative governor from a key swing state who knows how to bring people together and solve problems without leaving anyone behind. Not only did he work with Ohioans to turn around their state, cut taxes by $5 billion and create 400,000 private sector jobs, he won re-election with 64 percent of the vote. With 18 years on the U.S. House Armed Services Committee, he has more national security experience than any other candidate and is the only candidate to successfully balance budgets at both the state and federal levels.
John Kasich is a change agent with the record, experience and proven ability to bring people together that America needs. He will hit the ground running as president on Day One.
