    THE Second Supplemental Appropriations Act for 1974, which I signed into law last Saturday, makes available funds for summer job opportunities for needy youth. Together with the $91 million we have already obligated, the new appropriation under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act brings total program funding for summer youth opportunities to $397 million. These funds, together with the Administration supported adjustments for increases in the minimum wage law and for recreation and transportation assistance, provide the program level which was requested of Congress in my budget submission in February of this year. As a result of this appropriation, States and localities will be able to generate over 700,000 job opportunities this summer.
It is important to note that this summer, for the first time, these activities will be carried out under the direction of States and localities in their role as prime sponsors under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA). This means that although this year we still have separately identified program funding for summer job opportunities, in succeeding years the States and localities will plan the summer program as part of their regular activity under CETA. This marks a major step forward in the direction of decentralization and decategorization which is so essential for effective social programs.
I urge all responsible elected officials to take the necessary steps as rapidly as possible to insure that their program plans are in order so that all those who should benefit from these funds are able to do so.
In addition to the appropriation of these funds, the following programs to expand opportunities for youth are also underway:
FEDERAL SUMMER EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM
The Federal Government will create 70,700 jobs in Federal agencies for disadvantaged youth. Administration of the program is the responsibility of the Civil Service Commission.
YOUTH CONSERVATION CORPS
Up to 10,000 summer jobs will be provided to youth for conservation work in Federal and State forests and parks. The work will include trail building, stream clearing, and timber trimming under the auspices of the Departments of Agriculture and Interior.
EMPLOYMENT SERVICE YOUTH PLACEMENT
State employment service agencies estimate their youth placements at 210,000 for 1974.
NATIONAL ALLIANCE OF BUSINESSMEN SUMMER HIRES
For 1974 the National Alliance of Businessmen has set a goal of developing 200,000 summer jobs in private industry for disadvantaged youth. In 1973 the
