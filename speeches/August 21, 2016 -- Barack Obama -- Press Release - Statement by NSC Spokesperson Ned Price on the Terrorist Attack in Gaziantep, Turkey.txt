    The United States condemns in the strongest possible terms yesterday's terrorist attack in Gaziantep, Turkey. The perpetrators of this barbaric act cynically and cowardly targeted a wedding, killing dozens and leaving scores wounded. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones of those killed, and we wish a speedy recovery to those injured. We stand with the people of Turkey as they defend their democracy in the face of all forms of terrorism. We are in close touch with Turkish authorities, and Vice President Biden will visit Ankara on Wednesday, August 24 to reaffirm our commitment to work together with Turkey, our valued NATO Ally and partner, to confront the scourge of terrorism.
