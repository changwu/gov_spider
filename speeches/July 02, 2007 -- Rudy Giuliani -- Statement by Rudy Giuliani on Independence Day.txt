    Mayor Rudy Giuliani released the following statement on Independence Day:
"This Independence Day we are once again reminded how fortunate we are to live in a country that values freedom and liberty. Our nation is the greatest in the history of the world because we believe in individual opportunity and embrace the collective strength of Americans. We have been given the gift of a free nation from God, and it has been preserved and expanded by the sacrifices of the brave men and women who have served our nation throughout history. Today we should honor those who are currently serving our country so we can pass America's liberty on to the next generation."
