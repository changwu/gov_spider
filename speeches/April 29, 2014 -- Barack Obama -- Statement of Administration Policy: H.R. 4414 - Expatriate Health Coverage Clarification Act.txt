(House)
(Rep. Carney, D-Delaware, and 24 cosponsors)
The Administration does not support House passage of H.R. 4414, the Expatriate Health Coverage Clarification Act, in its current form, because it would reduce consumer protections and create even more loopholes in the tax code.
The Affordable Care Act gives people greater control over their own health care. Since October 1, eight million have signed up for private insurance and millions more have been enrolled in Medicaid. Because of the Affordable Care Act, Americans who have previously been denied coverage due to a pre-existing medical condition now have access to coverage. Additionally, the law helps millions of Americans stay on their parents' plans until age 26, and helps provide access to free preventive care like cancer screenings that catch illness early on.
The Administration remains willing to work with the Congress to improve H.R. 4144 to address these issues and to maintain basic consumer protections for all workers. There are straightforward changes to the legislation, which we have shared with the Congress, that would satisfy these goals, and the Congress should pursue a solution.
