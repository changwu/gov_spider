    I enjoyed our discussion Thursday concerning the 1996 Presidential Debates and look forward to working with you. In that regard, it is our intention to come to the next meeting prepared to discuss all issues and reach closure on the debate structure.
To that end, we are prepared to move the first proposed debate from September 25th to September 26th, with St. Louis remaining as the location. In 1992, you said, "It is in the public interest for the Presidential Debates to go forward this fall as scheduled." We agree with this, and see no reason why anything should have changed since 1992. We look forward to talking about this with you further.
I look forward to seeing you.
Sincerely,
Carroll Campbell
