    Las Vegas, NV - Barack Obama's Nevada campaign launched Generation Obama with events in Las Vegas and Reno on Saturday evening. Generation Obama is a diverse group of young professionals who will hold regular events in the days leading up to the January caucuses. Between the two events, over 75 young supporters came together to network with one another, organize, brainstorm, and define what motivates them to play an active role with Generation Obama.
At the Las Vegas Barbeque for Barack, hosted by Summerlin's Miriam Makhyoun, over 45 young people gathered to turn their enthusiasm and support for Barack Obama into action among young professionals and young voters in Southern Nevada. One of Generation Obama's group leaders, Gabriel Shepherd from Southwest Las Vegas, outlined the importance of organizing this key voter group, as well as the myriad of ways Generation Obama will expand upon the campaign's existing organization. From online and professional networking to grassroots fundraising and precinct leadership, Shepherd emphasized approaches that work particularly well with young people, by making gains where traditional campaigns often fall short.
Special guest State Senator Steven Horsford then proceeded to rally attendees to action, declaring, "We are our country's future. Senator Obama is this country's future. Let's work together to bring about the change we know we need."
In Reno, the Generation Obama launch took place at Ceol's Irish Pub, where over 30 people gathered to network, organize and recruit new supporters. During the event, GO members brainstormed ideas for upcoming events and activities, including monthly networking happy hours and a fall fundraiser. In the coming months leading up to the state's Democratic caucuses on Saturday, January 19th, Generation Obama will continue organizing, fundraising and mobilizing young voters across Nevada.
