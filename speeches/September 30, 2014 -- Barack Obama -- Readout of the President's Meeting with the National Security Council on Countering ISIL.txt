    This afternoon, the President met with his National Security Council to discuss our comprehensive strategy to counter the threat posed by ISIL in Iraq and Syria. He received an update on the airstrikes in Iraq and Syria undertaken by the U.S. military and our international partners, and the impact of these operations on ISIL. The President discussed with his national security team the importance of making progress on implementing the non-military aspects of the strategy, including organizing partner nation contributions along the multiple lines of effort that underpin our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. The President was also briefed on the effects of U.S. airstrikes in Syria on the Khorasan Group.
