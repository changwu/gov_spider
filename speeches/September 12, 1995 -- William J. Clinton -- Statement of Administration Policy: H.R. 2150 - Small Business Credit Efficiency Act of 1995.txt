    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Meyers (R) Kansas)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 2150.
The Administration will, however, continue to seek an amendment to provide for continued consistency in the guarantee percentages of export promotion loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration and the Export-Import Bank.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring 
As currently drafted, certain fees established by H.R. 2150 could be interpreted to apply not only to new loans but also to existing loans. If interpreted to apply retroactively, H.R. 21.50 would increase receipts, making the bill subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. If the bill is not retroactive, it would have no paygo impact.
