    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Kansas and ordered Federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms, hail, flooding and tornadoes beginning on April 21, 2001, and continuing.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected individuals and local governments in Barton County.
Assistance can include disaster housing, grants, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
Federal funding also is available to eligible local governments on a cost-sharing basis for the repair or replacement of public facilities damaged by the severe storms, hail, flooding and tornadoes. Federal funding is also available on a cost share basis for hazard mitigation measures.
Joe M. Allbaugh, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), named Carlos Mitchell as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The Agency said that damage surveys are continuing in other areas, and additional counties may be added after the assessments are completed.
