    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Visclosky (D) Indiana)
If H.R. 975 were presented to the President in its current form, his senior advisors would recommend that it be vetoed. The attached March 10th letter from White House Chief of Staff John Podesta to the House Ways and Means Committee addresses more fully the reasons for the Administration's strong opposition to H.R. 975.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 975 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB has not yet developed pay-as-you-go estimates for this bill.
