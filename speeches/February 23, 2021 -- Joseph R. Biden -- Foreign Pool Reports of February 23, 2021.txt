Foreign Pool Report - French portion of the Canadian comments 
Hello,Eli, the print pooler, has been covering the English portion of the Canadian comments.PM Trudeau and Deputy Prime ministre Christa Freeland also commented in French.Some of her words were hard to understand through her mask.
     Prime Minister Justin TrudeauIt's a great pleasure to sit down with you, President Biden and Vice-President Harris, to obviously talk about Covid, to talk about economic reconstruction and jobs creation for Canadians and Americans in months and years to come, and the fight against climate change which remains an essential element of our future, but also of today.
     Deputy Prime Minister Christia FreelandMadam Vice President, be it your (inaudible) ...or your old friends in Montreal, all Canadians are extremely proud of you!And when Covid-19 will be over, il will be a great pleasure for me to welcome you one more time in Canada.I read your biography – excellent! – and (inaudible) I am also an English-speaker and I agree with you that French is difficult to learn, but it's worth the effort.

Foreign Pool Report #2 
Two portions of PM Trudeau's statement were in French:
As for Covid-19, we also talked of our strict measures concerning trips in order to protect people on both sides of the border.However, even if our most important priority is to secure people safety, we must also think of our future.As you said, Mr President, we must rebuild better.The last year revealed all sorts of inequalities in our societies; more than ever, it's time to act.The moment has come to rebuild stronger economies from which everyone will be able to benefit.
Innovation and clean energy will occupy a crucial place in our plan to rebuild our economies.The President and I discussed the importance of clean growth in order to create new opportunities for Canadians and Americans, and also to protect the environment and fight climate change.We must continue to take meaningful action to respect the Paris Accord and reach our objectives in terms of carbon neutrality.Finally, we also talked about the different ways of building a stronger and more peaceful world: to protect our citizens and our communities, we must work together.In particular, we must strengthen continental defense and fight extremism. Everywhere in the world, we will protect our shared values, for instance by renewing alliances and supporting multilateral institutions. In this regard, I would like to thank President Biden for his support for the release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor from arbitrary detention in China.
(At the end, after PM Trudeau's last "Merci!", the President answered back "Aurevoir!", before walking away from the lectern.)
