  PAUL RYAN: "[President Obama's] good at giving great speeches. He's just really bad at creating jobs. Here's the problem: When you think that the road to success and prosperity is more borrowing, more spending, more taxing, more regulating, a government-centered society with a government-run economy, these are the kinds of results we get, and if we want the next four years to be any different than the last four years, we need a new president."
