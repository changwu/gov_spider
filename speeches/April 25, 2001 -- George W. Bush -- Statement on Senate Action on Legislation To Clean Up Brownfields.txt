    I am pleased that the Senate has passed legislation to clean up the Nation's brownfields. Environmental reforms must set high standards and get results. This legislation will allow communities to reduce environmental and health risks, capitalize on existing infrastructure, and create jobs. I commend the Senate for their bipartisan approach to this important environmental reform.
