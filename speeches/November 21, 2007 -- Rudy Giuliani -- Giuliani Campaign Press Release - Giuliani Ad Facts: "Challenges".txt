The Washington Post's Mark Shields Cited Then-U.S. Attorney Giuliani's Accomplishments In New York City As Reason He Should Be George H.W. Bush's Running Mate In 1988. . "As the 1988 Republican nominee, Vice President George Bush will lug with him a long list of political liabilities. … But with the right choice [for Vice President] … Bush could simultaneously turn disadvantage to advantage and the political world on its ear. … Now admittedly Rudolph Giuliani is not a household name, but if you need references … [G]iuliani led the prosecution of the 'pizza connection' in which eight New York Mafia chiefs were convicted and jailed. Who put corrupt executives from Wedtech … behind bars? It was the same man who put Bronx Democratic boss Stanley Friedman away and the prosecutor who risked the wrath of editorial writers, organized labor and politicians by moving for a takeover of the corruption-ridden Teamsters' union. There is a strong argument against putting any first-time candidate on a national ticket. Nobody, it's argued, is prepared for the scalding scrutiny. But you know that Rudolph Giuliani, who has terrorized dirty cops, sleazy politicians and criminals on Wall Street, has been investigated by all of them in an effort to discredit him. Death threats have not slowed him down. He's clean as a hound's tooth; he's gone after all the big boys; he's tough as nails, incorruptible and as untouchable as Eliot Ness. How about it, Mr. Vice President?" (Mark Shields, Op-Ed, "A Prosecutor For VP," The Washington Post, 7/12/88)

Well, he already has. As mayor of New York, Giuliani used similar reforms to reverse the city's decline and rejuvenate its finances."
