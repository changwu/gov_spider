    Today, U.S. Special Presidential Coordinator Amos Hochstein and Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland co-hosted the inaugural meeting of the U.S. â€“ Canada Energy Transformation Taskforce. The Taskforce is a key outcome of President Biden's March 23-24 visit with Prime Minister Trudeau in Ottawa. The Taskforce will work with departments and agencies across both governments to accelerate cooperation on critical clean energy opportunities and supply chains, including but not limited to, securing and strengthening renewable energy and electric vehicle supply chains, critical minerals, grid integration and resilience, current and next generation civil nuclear technologies, and other areas that advance our collective energy security, and to avoid and reduce disruptions to our integrated and complementary supply chains.
At the Taskforce meeting, the United States and Canada affirmed their commitments to our shared priorities to deploy clean energy solutions at scale, electrify our economies, and support the development of critical mineral and electric vehicle supply chains that will fuel the future North America automotive industry. The co-chairs further refined strategic priorities and next steps for the year-long Energy Transformation Taskforce.
