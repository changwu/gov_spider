    Today I am signing into law H.R. 2538, a bill which will improve the Coast Guard's ability to enforce laws aimed at stopping illegal drug trafficking on the high seas. This legislation was introduced by Congressman Mario Biaggi (D-N.Y.), Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Coast Guard and Navigation.
The Coast Guard, the U.S. Customs Service, and the Drug Enforcement Administration have greatly increased their efforts to stop drug trafficking on the high seas, particularly in the Caribbean. In many instances, however, current law makes it difficult to prosecute drug traffickers once they are apprehended. By closing a loophole in our maritime enforcement laws, H.R. 2538 will improve the ability of our Federal enforcement agencies to reduce international drug trafficking. This legislation makes it a crime to illegally possess or distribute drugs on the high seas and applies to all United States citizens, to all persons aboard any United States vessel regardless of their nationality, to individuals who intend to unlawfully import a controlled substance into the United States, and to all persons aboard vessels within the 12-mile territorial limits.
I am particularly pleased to sign this bill which will help us control the possession and distribution of drugs on the high seas. It is an excellent example of close coordination and cooperation between the administration and the Congress who worked on this legislation. I especially want to thank Congressman Biaggi for his efforts in having this bill passed. I also welcome this opportunity to reiterate my strong personal commitment and that of this administration to stemming the flow of illicit drugs throughout the world and to reducing the health and social costs to the citizens of our country caused by drug abuse.
