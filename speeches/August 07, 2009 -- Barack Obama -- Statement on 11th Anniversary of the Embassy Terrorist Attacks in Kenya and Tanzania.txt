    Today marks the 11th anniversary of the terrorist attacks against the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. In Kenya, 218 people lost their lives and over 5,000 were injured; the blast in Dar es Salaam killed 11 people and wounded more than 85 others. Our thoughts are with those who were injured and the families and loved ones of those who were lost in these tragic events.
These attacks in East Africa are sad examples of Al Qaida's determination to kill innocent men, women, and children in many countries, regardless of their religion, race, or nationality. The memory of the attacks in Kenya and Tanzania remind us that we must always be vigilant in working with our allies to bring these terrorists to justice, to prevent these types of attacks from happening again, and to advance peace and security for Americans, Kenyans, Tanzanians, and people around the world.
