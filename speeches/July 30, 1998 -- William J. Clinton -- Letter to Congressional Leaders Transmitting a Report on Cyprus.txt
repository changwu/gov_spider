    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question covering the period April 1 to May 31, 1998. The previous submission covered events during February and March 1998.
My Special Presidential Emissary for Cyprus, Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke, accompanied by Special Cyprus Coordinator Ambassador Thomas J. Miller, traveled to Cyprus in early April and held a series of intensive talks with the leaders of both communities. In early May, they returned to the island at the request of both leaders and encouraged them to begin serious negotiations toward a bizonal, bicommunal federation. Unfortunately, the Turkish side took the position that talks could not begin unless certain preconditions were satisfied, including recognition of the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" and the withdrawal of Cyprus' application to the European Union.
Although progress was not possible during Ambassador Holbrooke's May visit, he assured both parties that the United States would remain engaged in the search for a solution.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
