I look forward to working with them in the months and years ahead to deliver a government that's more affordable, effective and efficient."
The President's Management Advisory Board (PMAB) was established by Executive Order on April 19, 2010 to provide advice on how to implement best business practices on matters related to Federal Government management and operation, with a particular focus on productivity, the application of technology, and customer service. The Board will hold their first meeting at the White House on Friday morning. This is part of the President's ongoing commitment to cut waste and get the most from taxpayer dollars.
The Board, chaired by the Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Jeffrey Zients, will advise both the President and the President's Management Council, an interagency group that includes the deputy secretaries from the major executive departments and agencies.
The establishment of PMAB builds on the work of the President's Accountable Government Initiative and the 2010 White House Forum on Modernizing Government, which brought together 50 of the country's top Chief Executive Officers, who shared ideas about adapting their proven techniques and practices to spark improvements in efficiency and effectiveness across the government.
