    I am gratified that the California gray whales have been released to the open sea. The human persistence and determination by so many individuals on behalf of these whales shows mankind's concern for the environment. It has been an inspiring endeavor. We thank and congratulate the crews of the two Soviet icebreakers who finally broke through to the whales. They were part of a remarkable team effort by governments, individuals, and business. Due to all these efforts, the whales have returned to the sea.
