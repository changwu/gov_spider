    The compromise reached by the House and Senate appropriators on Mexican trucking is an important victory for safety and free trade. We must promote the highest level of safety and security on American highways while meeting our commitments to our friends to the South. The compromise reached by the conferees will achieve these twin objectives by permitting our border to be opened in a timely manner and ensuring that all United States safety standards will be applied to every truck and bus operating on our highways.
