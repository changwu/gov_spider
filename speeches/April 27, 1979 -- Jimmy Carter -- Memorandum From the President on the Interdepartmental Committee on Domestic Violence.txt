    Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Director of the ACTION Agency, the Chairman of the Commission on Civil Rights, the Director of the Community Services Administration
Each year three to six million acts of severe violence occur in American homes. Victims, who represent every race and socio-economic status, are often seriously injured. This Administration is committed ultimately to the cessation of such violence and immediately to the relief of those who suffer its consequences.
To address this growing crisis I am asking the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to chair an Interdepartmental Committee on Domestic Violence to coordinate a review of federal programs which currently provide or could provide assistance to victims of domestic violence, and to formulate a work plan by June 15 to guide our future actions. Please designate a policy-level member of your department or agency to serve as a member of this committee with Secretary Califano.
This directive manifests my personal concern that. the tragedy of domestic violence be eliminated and its victims be comforted and assisted wherever possible.
