    PAT GRAY is an able, honest, and dedicated American.
Because I asked my Counsel, John Dean, to conduct a thorough investigation of alleged involvement in the Watergate episode, Director Gray was asked to make FBI reports available to Mr. Dean. His compliance with this completely proper and necessary request exposed Mr. Gray to totally unfair innuendo and suspicion, and thereby seriously tarnished his fine record as Acting Director and promising future at the Bureau.
In view of the action of the Senate Judiciary Committee today, it is obvious that Mr. Gray's nomination will not be confirmed by the Senate. Mr. Gray has asked that I withdraw his nomination. In fairness to Mr. Gray, and out of nay overriding concern for the effective conduct of the vitally important business of the FBI, I have regretfully agreed to withdraw Mr. Gray's nomination.
I have asked Mr. Gray to remain Acting Director until a new nominee is confirmed.
