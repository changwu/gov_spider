    I AM pleased that the Senate has voted to sustain my veto of H.R. 9803, the Child Day Care Services under title XX of the Social Security Act.1
1 For a statement on House action overriding the President's veto, see Item 424.
As I have said before, this legislation would have run counter to a basic principle of government important to all Americans--the vesting of responsibility in State and local government and the removal of burdensome Federal regulations in areas where State and local government can best meet the needs of their citizens.
I congratulate the Members of the Senate from both parties who resisted heavy pressure to vote for this bill and voted instead for good government and fiscal responsibility.
