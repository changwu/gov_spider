    Dear Mr. Petersen:
It is with deep regret and even deeper appreciation of your contributions to government that I accept your resignation as Assistant Attorney General, effective December 31, 1974. Your three decades at the Department of Justice represent the highest standards of both the Federal career service and appointive office. The record of those years is one in which you can take great pride--it is a record of unique achievement. Your ability, integrity, candor and good humor will be sorely missed but fondly remembered by those with whom you served. More importantly, you leave with the respect and admiration of all who were privileged to be your colleagues.
As you move on to private life, you have my best wishes for continued success and satisfaction.
Sincerely,
JERRY FORD
[The Honorable Henry E. Petersen, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C. 20530]
