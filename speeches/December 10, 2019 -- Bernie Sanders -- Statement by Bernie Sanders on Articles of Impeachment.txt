    WASHINGTON, December 10â€”Today, Sen. Sanders (I-V.t.) issued the following statement regarding the announcement of articles of impeachment:
"Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in history, and he must be held accountable. Let me be clear: while the announcement of articles of impeachment is not a moment for celebration, I strongly believe they are appropriate and necessary, and I call on the full House of Representatives to pass them.
"Once the House proceeds to impeachment, Leader McConnell must quickly schedule a full trial in the Senate, where I will uphold my constitutional responsibility as a juror."
