    Earlier today, Governor Christie made his 34th visit to Camden to show the country how local officials and the community have worked together to get results. While President Obama and others are just waking up to the challenges facing our cities because it's politically comfortable, Governor Christie has been working to overhaul a broken criminal justice system by showing up and focusing on communities that matter even though there is nothing to gain politically - a city where Governor Christie only received 6% of the vote in 2009 and 19% in 2013.
In his fifth in a series of substantive policy addresses, Governor Christie spoke about the model Camden has become for the rest of the country when it comes to community and law enforcement relations, as well as reforming our bail system and changing the stigma that surrounds addiction. He closed the speech by sharing a personal story of a friend who fell victim to the disease of addiction.
