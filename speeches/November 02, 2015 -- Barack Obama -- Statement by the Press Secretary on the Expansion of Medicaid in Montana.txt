    Today, 70,000 Montanans who otherwise would go without health insurance can rest easier knowing they will have access to quality, affordable health care. Montana becomes the 30th state, along with the District of Columbia, to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which helps ease the burden of uncompensated costs currently shouldered by hospitals and businesses throughout the state. Today, Montana has chosen to put people over politics, and we hope that the remaining states will join Montana and the other 29 states that have designed programs to meet the needs of their residents who need health care.
