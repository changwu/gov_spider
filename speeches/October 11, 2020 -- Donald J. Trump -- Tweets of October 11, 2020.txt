.@NateSilver538 The Trump 2016 Victory was the most shocking political development of my lifetime. That's only because you got it so wrong. This time there is far more ENTHUSIASM even than 2016.

In 2016, the ABC News/Washington Post Poll was such a complete disaster that these two Fake News Organizations changed the numbers prior to the Election. Now these haters are trying the same thing, though on a lesser scale, again. Will have a bigger win than even 2016!Retweets: 22353Favorites: 90362
