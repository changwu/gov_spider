    Today, I join the people of Northern Ireland as you gather together in a mass vigil for peace. From where I stood last November in Belfast, to cities on both sides of the Atlantic, citizens are standing up for an end to violence and for the right of the people of Northern Ireland to a normal life.
The bombs that shattered the cease-fire and murdered and maimed innocent people in London must not be the path of the future. As today's outpouring of support underscores, the people want peace. They deserve peace, and we must all work to help them achieve this goal. Those who seek to use violence and terror should hear the voices of today's vigil being conducted across our lands: no to violence, yes to peace.
The United States continues to work with the Irish and British Governments and the parties to help the people of Northern Ireland achieve that goal. I commend all those who are standing today for peace. My hopes and prayers are with you in that effort.
