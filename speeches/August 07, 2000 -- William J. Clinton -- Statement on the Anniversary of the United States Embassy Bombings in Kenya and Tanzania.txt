    I join all Americans in remembering the lives lost 2 years ago today in the bombing of our Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. Twelve dedicated Americans perished on that day, together with 44 Kenyan and Tanzanian citizens working to support our diplomatic efforts, and more than 200 other innocent people. The targets of this crime were doing so much good: helping Africans and each other to promote peace and democracy, to fight poverty and disease, to protect the environment, and to aid American citizens in need. I believe they were targets precisely because they were dedicated to principles of tolerance, understanding, and cooperation across frontiers. The terrorists took from us our colleagues, friends, and loved ones, but they have failed utterly to deter us from advancing these principles around the world.
Today we remember that, in many ways, the men and women who serve America in our diplomatic missions endure as much danger and hardship as the men and women who serve America in our military. As long as the world is as it is, we cannot eliminate the risk. But we can and must give them the support they need to minimize that risk, and the backing they deserve to achieve America's goals in the world.
