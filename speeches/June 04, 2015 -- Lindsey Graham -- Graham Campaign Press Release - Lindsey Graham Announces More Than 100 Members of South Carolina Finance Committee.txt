    One day after launching his campaign for president in the 2016 election, Senator Lindsey Graham released the names of his South Carolina Finance Committee, which includes more than 100 top business and community leaders from across the Palmetto State.
"This list is a ‘Who's Who' in the South Carolina business and professional community," said Graham's Finance Committee Chairman David Wilkins, former U.S. Ambassador to Canada. "There has never been a more impressive Finance Committee for a presidential campaign in South Carolina. Bringing this group together is a remarkable statement about how much these top leaders respect and support Lindsey Graham and the unique qualifications he brings to this presidential race."
Graham's S.C. finance committee includes top fundraisers for numerous campaigns going back nearly 20 years, including top finance leaders for Bush for President, McCain for President, Romney for President, DeMint for Senate, Sanford for Governor and Haley for Governor.
"The members of our team know that Lindsey Graham is a leading voice on national security and foreign policy," Wilkins said. "We are living in a very dangerous world, and Lindsey Graham is ready to serve as Commander in Chief on Day One."
Anita Zucker, CEO of the InterTech Group and co-chair of Graham's finance committee added her reasons for backing Graham. "Our nation needs a president with the courage to take action on the most difficult issues facing America," Zucker said. "Lindsey Graham embodies the governing qualities we need to put our country back on the right path."
In releasing the names of his S.C. finance team, Lindsey Graham expressed his personal gratitude. "I'm deeply honored to have the support of all these major job creators and community leaders from across South Carolina," Graham said. "This team has delivered for past Republican presidential nominees, and I appreciate their tremendous efforts as we launch this new campaign for America's future."
