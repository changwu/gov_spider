    It was another busy week on the campaign trail for Scott Walker, with stops in Iowa, Nevada, and then on to California for the second Republican debate. With all that was going on, here are four things you might have missed during the week.


There are only 490 days left until President Obama leaves office and one thing all Republicans can agree on is that putting an apprentice in the White House has done terrible things to our country -- a mistake that we just can't make again. At the debate Wednesday, Governor Walker not only pointed out that fact but made it even clearer when he took on Donald Trump.

By the end of the three hour debate, it was clear that only one candidate offered the big, bold ideas needed to get this country back on track.

In Nevada, Scott Walker demonstrated why he is best prepared to be president by releasing another detailed plan to take on Washington on his first day in office. His newest day one plan focuses on increasing freedom and fairness in the workplace by putting employees and employers back in charge and eliminating the constrictive, top-down approach currently in place by big-labor from Washington.

      As President, on #DayOne I will abolish the @NLRB which has become a proxy for the big union bosses. - SW #Walker16 pic.twitter.com/Z3VJ3GseSl — Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) September 14, 2015
    


There's nothing better than tailgating at a college football game. That's why Scott Walker spent Saturday playing bag toss and tailgating with Iowa football fans at the big rivalry game between the Iowa Hawkeyes and the Iowa State Cyclones.

Hardly a week goes by without Hillary Clinton attacking Scott Walker. This time she criticized his "Power to the People" plan to take on the special interests and upend the status quo in Washington. You know Scott Walker can't be intimidated and he didn't back down.

That's it for "This Week with Walker."
