    The Obama Transition team launched its new "Open for Questions" tool today on Change.gov. This new tool will allow anyone to ask and vote on questions they have for the Transition team. Popular questions selected by the community of web users on Change.gov will be answered on a regular basis by the Obama team.
Open for Questions is yet another step to open up the transition process to the millions of Americans who are following closely -- encouraging them to take part in the process and make their voices heard during this important time.
The new "Open for Questions" tool can be viewed at http://www.change.gov/openforquestions.
