    I commend the Senate Republican leadership for its commitment to jobs and growth and for acting quickly to pass a budget resolution, in sharp contrast to last year when the Senate did not even pass such a resolution. It is unfortunate that the full Senate has failed to pass a budget that provides for my entire economic growth-and-job creation plan. The House budget took the bold steps necessary to boost our economy, and we will work to ensure that the final House-Senate budget provides the growth measures American workers deserve.
