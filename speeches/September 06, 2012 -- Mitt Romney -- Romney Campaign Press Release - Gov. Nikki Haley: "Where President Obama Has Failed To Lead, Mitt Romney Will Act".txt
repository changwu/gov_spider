    South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley made the following statement on President Obama's remarks to the Democratic National Convention:
"The last time Barack Obama spoke before the Democratic National Convention, he told us of hope and change that we could believe in. What a difference four years makes. Today, with Americans around this country hurting, with 23 million of our family, our friends, and our neighbors struggling for work, empty words and empty rhetoric of the kind we heard tonight will no longer sway us. We need leadership, and we need a plan for a real recovery. Where President Obama has failed to lead, Mitt Romney will act. He has a comprehensive plan to get our economy going again and generate good jobs for everyone who seeks them. Where President Obama has disappointed us, Mitt Romney will keep faith with the American people. We aren't better off than we were four years ago, but with Mitt Romney as president, we'll have a much brighter story to tell four years from now."
