    Des Moines, IA – After a Democratic debate that failed to put forward a coherent strategy to win back places Democrats have lost, or pay more than lip service to the issue of our time — money in politics — Montana Governor Steve Bullock released the following statement.
"This election is about making our economy and our democracy work again for the millions of Americans that Washington has left behind. That will be virtually impossible if we can't end the toxic influence of money in politics, and there wasn't a single question asked about how we're going to accomplish that," said Montana Governor Steve Bullock. "I'm the only candidate in this field who has led the fight against money in politics and with real victories to show for it. If we want to get anything done, we need to start by getting the corrupting influence of money out of our elections. This is the fight of our time, and it's been the fight of my career — and I'm going to keep fighting until we win."
