Tim Scott: The one thing we all should realize, and take a step back from the pundits who tell us that the progressive story of America is one that is filled with racism, it is a lie from the pit of hell, what we can believe is the story of evolution.
America is the one country on earth that fought the big fight so that we could all live together. I'm not talking about the civil war, I'm talking about the fight that happens every single day, where everyday Americans show up for each other. That is why my Faith in America tour reinforced my confidence that believing in each other is our best path forward.
Here is what we know about the Biden Administration, they weaponize race to hide their failures, to hide their insufficiencies. If you do that, you cheapen the journey of my grandfather. You cheapen the story of evolution, and you make young kids today believe the only way forward is to be an exception. But Today's rule was yesterday's exception, so all things are possible in America. And the best news is that the future of this country is not defined by the color of your skin, it is the quality of your education. We must continue push quality education in every zip code in this great nation.
Tim's op-ed on FOX News.com, America is the land of opportunity, not a land of oppression, outlines how Biden and the radical left's view of America continues to divide our nation.
