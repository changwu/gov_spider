    Sanctuary jurisdictions deliberately imperil the safety of the American people by releasing criminal aliens onto city streets â€“ instead of handing them over to Federal authorities. Since taking office, President Trump has made clear that his Administration would not allow these lawless jurisdictions to heartlessly inflict pain and suffering onto our communities. Today's unanimous decision by the Second Circuit upholds the Department of Justice's lawful authority to require jurisdictions that receive Federal grant money under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program to obey the law and not impede the removal of criminal aliens. We are pleased by the Court's decision and remain committed to ensuring that no jurisdiction has license to nullify Federal law or deprive American Citizens of their fundamental rights.
