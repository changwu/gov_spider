    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Rockefeller (D) West Virginia and 60 others)
The administration believes that the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards in the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act should be repealed rather than modified. However, the administration would support enactment of S. 1518 if it (l) were amended to substitute a simpler method for calculating the fuel economy effects of dual fuel vehicles and (2)  contains only the CAFE provision.
If S. 1518 were amended to (1) require the government purchase of dual-fueled vehicles, (2) require the retail selling of methanol, (3)  establish additional bus and truck demonstration programs — all of which would be required by H.R. 3399 — or (4) otherwise subsidize alternative fuels, the President's senior advisors would recommend a veto of the bill.
