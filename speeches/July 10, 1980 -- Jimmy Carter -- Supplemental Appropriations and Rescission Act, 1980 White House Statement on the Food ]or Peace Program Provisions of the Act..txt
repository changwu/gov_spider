    President Carter signed, during his trip to Tokyo, a supplemental appropriation bill which provides an additional $143 million for the Food for Peace (P.L. 480) program during the fiscal year which ends September 30, 1980. The additional funding is expected to purchase approximately 530,000 metric tons of food commodities, primarily wheat and wheat flour, corn and vegetable oil.
A substantial part of this food will go to countries in East Africa which are experiencing serious drought problems and increasing numbers of refugees. The funds also will provide additional food assistance to meet acute refugee needs in other areas of the world, particularly Kampuchea and Pakistan. This cooperative action by the Congress and the executive branch thus will help to meet important humanitarian needs on a global basis.
Approximately $123 million will be used in the title II program, which provides grant food assistance through the World Food Program, Government-to-Government programs, and private voluntary agencies. Through this title, U.S. religious and other private groups play a vital role in averting starvation. The remaining $20 million will be used in the title I program, which provides food assistance through concessional loans to the developing countries for purchase in the United States of 'the needed commodities.
