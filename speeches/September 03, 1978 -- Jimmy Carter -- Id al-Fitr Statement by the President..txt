    Rosalynn and I are pleased to extend warmest good wishes to our fellow citizens of the Muslim faith who will be celebrating Id al-Fitr. May this joyous occasion bring each of you the fullest measure of happiness and satisfaction.
You can take great pride in the constructive influence you have on American life by your devotion to the moral and spiritual values of your faith.
My family joins in your prayer that we will see continued progress toward the goal of peace and a greater realization of your very deep belief in the dignity and worth of every individual.
