    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Massachusetts House Speaker Salvatore DiMasi.
"It's time to restore strong, competent leadership to the White House and Hillary Clinton is ready to do the job from her first day in office," Speaker DiMasi said. "Senator Clinton has the experience and vision to lead America at home and abroad in these trying times."
DiMasi, first elected to the House in 1978 to represent Boston, has served as Speaker since 2004. He was instrumental in passing Massachusetts' landmark healthcare legislation that provides coverage to nearly every resident. For his role in passing the state's healthcare plan, Governing Magazine named DiMasi one of its Public Officials of the Year in 2006.
DiMasi previously crafted a reorganization of the Massachusetts courts, making them more user friendly and authored legislation that streamlined interstate banking. He is now a leading voice for energy reform, offering a detailed plan to promote cleaner, more renewable energy.
"We need more leaders like Speaker DiMasi, who brings everyone to the table to hammer out solutions to our toughest problems," Clinton said. "I'm honored to have his support as we take our message of change across Massachusetts and the nation."
Clinton has received strong support in Massachusetts, winning the endorsements of Congressmen Jim McGovern and Richard Neal, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, State Auditor Joe DeNucci, State Senate President Therese Murray, Suffolk County Sheriff Andrea Cabral, Boston City Council President Maureen Feeney and 30 Massachusetts state legislators. This group of leaders will help spread Hillary Clinton's message for change throughout their communities and also support her campaign's efforts in New Hampshire, an important early primary state.
