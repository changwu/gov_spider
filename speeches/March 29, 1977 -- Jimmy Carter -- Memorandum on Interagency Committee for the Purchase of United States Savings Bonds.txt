    Memorandum to the Heads of Departments and Agencies
Attached is the Executive Order which establishes and explains the Federal Interagency Committee for the purchase of United States Savings Bonds.
I have appointed Bert Lance, Director of Office of Management and Budget, as Chairman of the Committee. I assigned him one of the most crucial tasks in the entire Federal establishment; that of making the Federal Government the leader in the Savings Bonds Program. I am confident he will succeed and that all Department and Agency heads will shoulder their full share of the responsibility towards that end.
Savings Bonds are both prudent and patriotic, because they strengthen the security of our families and help protect the value of the dollar. At the present time, outstanding Savings Bonds represent approximately one-fifth of the privately held portion of the Public Debt.
THE EXECUTIVE ORDER STATES IN PART:
"Members of the Committee may designate an alternate, who shall serve as a member of the Committee whenever the regular member is unable to attend any meeting of the Committee. The alternate member may be authorized to act for the regular member in all appropriate matters relating to the Committee. In the case of an executive or military department, a Deputy Secretary or an Under Secretary may be designated as an alternate member. In the case of any other Federal agency, the alternate member shall be designated from among the officials thereof of appropriate rank."
In order that the Committee can become functional at the earliest possible date, please send Director Lance the name of your alternate as soon as one has been selected.
Under your personal leadership and encouragement, I am certain that your employees will respond with enthusiasm and that together we may attain a new high level of participation in this important program.
