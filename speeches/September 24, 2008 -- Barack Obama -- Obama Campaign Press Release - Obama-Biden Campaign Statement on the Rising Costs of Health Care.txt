"This morning's Kaiser Family Foundation report shows that premiums have risen 5 percent over the past year - more than doubling since George W. Bush took office - bringing the cost that an average family pays for a health care plan to $12,680. With so many Americans struggling to pay their medical bills, we can't afford the McCain plan that would make you pay taxes on your heath care for the first time, offers a tax credit of less than half the value of average family health insurance plans, and gives insurance companies an even freer hand over what they charge, who they cover, and what they'll cover. Barack Obama and Joe Biden will finally solve our health care crisis by making health care affordable and accessible for all Americans, while cutting health care costs," said Obama-Biden spokesman Bill Burton.
