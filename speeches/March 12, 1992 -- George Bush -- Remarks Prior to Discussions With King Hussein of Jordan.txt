    Q. Mr. President, may we ask King Hussein whose side he's on in the latest confrontation with Iraq?
The President. We agreed that we weren't going to take any questions, just because we want to get into the business side. I just want to say here, though, I will say this, that I am just delighted to see His Majesty again. For years we've had strong relations with Jordan. We know there were difficulties. He is my friend, and I welcome him back here.
And I might point out in a positive way that Jordan has taken a very courageous and forthright position on the peace talks, recognizing we should talk for peace. And now we want to develop more on that and talk more about that. So, we're looking to the future. And I'm very pleased he's here. And I hope that will -- it didn't exactly answer your question, but we're not going to take questions. And I just want to make sure that people know across this country how pleased I am to see His Majesty again.
Thank you all very much.
