    On behalf of the United States, I congratulate my friend King Abdallah bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud on assuming the Saudi throne and the position of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. We wish Saudi Arabia peace and prosperity under his leadership. I have spoken today to the new King, and the United States looks forward to continuing the close partnership between our two countries.
