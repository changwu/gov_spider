    ARLINGTON, VA -- The McCain-Palin presidential campaign today announced the endorsement of Miguel D. Lausell, Senior Political Advisor to Hillary Clinton, and Clinton Delegate-at-Large Luchy Secaira.
"Although I supported Hillary during the primaries, I now support John McCain and Governor Palin because I am putting my country first," said Secaira, former Hillary Clinton Florida Delegate-at-Large. "They have the experience and judgment to lead America through these difficult times, and I trust them to work with Democrats to do the right thing for our country."
Lausell, who advised Senator Clinton on a variety of issues including international trade, telecommunications and Latino affairs, added, "John McCain has a long record of reforming government and working across the aisle to achieve bipartisan results. His courageous leadership is exactly what we need in the White House, and I am convinced that John McCain is the right leader at the right time for our nation."
Both Lausell and Secaira supported Sen. Hillary Clinton during the primaries, but they will campaign for the McCain-Palin ticket.
Lausell has served as President and CEO of the Puerto Rico Telephone Company; Executive Director of the Puerto Rico Telephone Authority; a member of the Governor of Puerto Rico's Economic Strategic Council; President of the Export Policy Commission of Puerto Rico; and Undersecretary of the Department of the Treasury of Puerto Rico. He served on the National Finance Board of the Gore 2000 Committee and was a member of the Democratic National Committee's Leadership 2000 Board.
Secaira, who is of Dominican descent, traveled to eight states to coordinate grassroots efforts for Senator Clinton, has a doctorate of neuropsychology and was trained at New York University.
