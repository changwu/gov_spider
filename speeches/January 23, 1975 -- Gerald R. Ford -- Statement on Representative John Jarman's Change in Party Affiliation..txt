    THE ANNOUNCEMENT by Congressman John Jarman, of Oklahoma, that he is changing his political party affiliation from the Democratic to the Republican Party reflects the sincere conviction of a dedicated Member of Congress.
I have known John Jarman throughout his 24 years of service in the U.S. House of Representatives. His career has been marked by a devotion to his district and dedication to reflecting accurately the views of those people he represents.
John and I have discussed his becoming a Republican during recent days, and he has indicated his belief that he can better represent and serve his district under the banner of the Republican Party.
As President, I look forward to working with John during the 94th Congress. His experience, integrity, and long seniority will be of great benefit to the Administration and the GOP Congressional delegation.
As a Republican, I am delighted that John is changing his party affiliation and welcome him to the ranks of the GOP on behalf of all Republicans.
