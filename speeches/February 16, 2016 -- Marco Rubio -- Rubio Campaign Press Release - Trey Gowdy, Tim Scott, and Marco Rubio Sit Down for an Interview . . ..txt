Hannity asked Senator Scott about why he chose Marco. The answer comes down to who is ready to be Commander-in-Chief:
Well I had the good fortune of hosting 12 of the presidential candidates in a one-on-one forum. And without any question, head and shoulders above the other 11 candidates, was Marco Rubio. When I think about the fact my brother is a Colonel in the Air Force, I think about the guy I want leading this country on day one as commander-in-chief, my answer was simply, Marco Rubio.

Rep. Gowdy was asked about the campaign's expectations in the Palmetto State:
Well, Sean, he had such a great night Saturday night. He looked so presidential. He may be the youngest from a chronological standpoint but he sure seemed like an adult Saturday night in Greenville during the debate. He's also got the most popular elected official in the entire state in Tim Scott supporting him and going around the state. I think when people get to meet Marco, we had a fabulous crowd yesterday in Easley. We had a great crowd this morning. When people get to hear him and meet him and ask him questions they wind up supporting him. It's my job and Tim's job to get him in front of as many people throughout the state between now and election day.

Marco's debate victory on Saturday has helped fuel huge crowds across the state.
With the help of Rep. Gowdy and Sen. Scott, momentum is truly building for Marco ahead of the the primary this Saturday!
