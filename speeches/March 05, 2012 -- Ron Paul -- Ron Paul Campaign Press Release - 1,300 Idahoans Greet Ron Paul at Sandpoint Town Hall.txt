BOISE, Idaho — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul drew a crowd of 1,300 supporters in Sandpoint, Idaho today, demonstrating his popularity among voters in the crucial northern region of the Gem State. The crowd gathered expressly for the 12-term Congressman from Texas as he spoke at the Bonner County Fairgrounds Main Exhibition Hall on 4203 North Boyer Road at 12:00 p.m. PST. The town hall followed a tour of Quest Aircraft.
Notably, the massive crowd left the comfort of their homes in the town of 7,400 out of a county with only 41,000 residents. This contrasts with less-inspiring candidates struggling with diminished interest, including small crowd sizes for Rick Santorum in much larger Coeur d'Alene, which neighbors Spokane. The "leading" competing candidate drew a paltry 600 there on February 15th, and turnout for the Paul town hall event also contrasts with turnout for a previous Sarah Palin book signing in Sandpoint — her hometown — that drew about 750.
Event organizers noted that Dr. Paul touted provisions of his path-breaking 'Plan to Restore America' and conversed with supporters and undecided Idaho voters.
