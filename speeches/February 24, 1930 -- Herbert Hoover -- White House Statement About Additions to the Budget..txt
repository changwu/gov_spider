    THE DIRECTOR of the Budget, under instruction of the President, has prepared a survey of the various projects which have been presented to Congress and the administration, which will involve additional expenditure beyond the present authorizations and beyond the present budget.
These demands are being made upon Congress and the administration from different sections of the country and from different interested groups. The amounts below are a summary of these projects and are given in the amount of additional expenditures that would be imposed upon the Federal budget during the first year of their operation. These are not the totals projected which are very much larger, but simply the annual addition to the budget. Many of the items would be permanent and increasing annually:
Public Roads $350, 000, 000
Rivers and Harbors 35, 000, 000
Compensation to property owners for rights-of-way
in flood control 100, 000, 000
Loans to Levee Districts 100, 000, 000
Protection to Forests 10, 000, 000
Eradication of Pests 20, 000, 000
Expansion of Agricultural services 20, 000, 000
Scientific Research 5, 000, 000
Development of Columbia River 45, 000, 000
Reclamation Service 100, 000, 000
National Parks and Memorials 50, 000, 000
Indian Service 5, 000, 000
Naval Construction 50, 000, 000
Military Aviation 25, 000, 000
Increased Army and Navy pay 80,000,000
Army-Navy Hospital Barracks and Posts 15,000,000
Employment services 5,000,000
Disaster Relief 15,000,000
Increase in Spanish War Veterans Service 45,000,000
Increase in Civil War Veterans Service 40,000,000
Increase in World War Veterans Service 400,000,000
Increase Civil Service pensions 20,000,000
Increase Civil Service pay 100,000,000
Education 100,000,000





Total 1,735, 000, 000



The present Federal income is approximately $4 billion per annum and such a program would imply an increase in taxes of 40 percent.
      In addition to the above list, other projects are being urged but are not regarded as imminent, which would impose a further expenditure of fully $1,500 million per annum.
