    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with the requirements of section 502(a)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974 (the Act), I am notifying the House of Representatives (Senate) of my intention to suspend, pursuant to section 504 of the Act, the designation of Afghanistan as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the Generalized System of Preferences. The suspension will be effective sixty days from the date of this letter.
This decision is based on my determination that, as the result of the Soviet invasion, the United States no longer has reasonable access to the commercial markets of Afghanistan and it is not in the national interest of the United States to continue preferential duty-free treatment for Afghanistan. I will consider reinstating Afghanistan as a beneficiary developing country for the purpose of the Generalized System of Preferences when the Soviet troops are withdrawn from the country.
In reaching this conclusion, I have considered the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c), as required by section 504 of the Act.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
