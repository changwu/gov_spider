    Virginia Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling made the following statement on Mitt Romney's plan for real change:
"On November 6, Virginia will help elect Mitt Romney as the next President of the United States because he is the candidate who will bring real change and a real recovery. Barack Obama promised us this, but he failed to deliver. Governor Romney understands what it takes to bring people together to solve challenges, create jobs, and restore the strength of our economy, our military, and our position in the world. When Mitt Romney is president, the next four years will be better than the last four years."
