For years, Joe Biden fought to cut your Social Security and Medicare—a fact which Joe falsely denied last night. This video (Joe Biden's own words) was created by Bernie Sanders earlier this year to expose Joe Biden's atrocious record and egregious lies!  https://t.co/womMTc70RPRetweets: 46106Favorites: 130608

Joe Biden is a corrupt politician and he’s COMPROMISED. China is desperate for Biden to win because if Biden Wins, CHINA WINS – and China will OWN AMERICA. This corruption is EXACTLY why I decided to run for President in the first place...Retweets: 60148Favorites: 264880

If I do not sound like a typical Washington politician, it's because I'm NOT a politician. If I do not always play by the rules of the Washington Establishment, it's because I was elected to fight for YOU, harder than anyone ever has before! https://t.co/gsFSgh2KPc https://t.co/kNuIW02DfcRetweets: 33434Favorites: 148543

The Fake News is talking about CASES, CASES, CASES. This includes many low risk people. Media is doing everything possible to create fear prior to November 3rd.
