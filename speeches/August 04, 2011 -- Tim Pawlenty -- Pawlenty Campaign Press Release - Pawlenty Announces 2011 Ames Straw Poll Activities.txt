    Gov. Tim Pawlenty's supporters at the Ames Straw Poll will hear two popular bands while eating BBQ and ice cream inside his tent, the Pawlenty campaign announced today.
Governor Pawlenty's tent will feature the popular American Christian worship band SONICFLOOd and local favorites The Nadas. Famous Dave's BBQ will provide meals, and the campaign will offer Dairy Queen Blizzards.
"I am excited SONICFLOOd and The Nadas are joining us for this fun and important day," Gov. Pawlenty said. "I'm looking forward to enjoying an afternoon of great music and food with family, friends and supporters. I know what a commitment it is for our supporters to spend the day at the Straw Poll and we want to make it fun and enjoyable. The Ames Straw Poll is an important benchmark in the process of electing our next president, and I'm confident our campaign will show we have built a strong foundation in preparation for the caucus."
