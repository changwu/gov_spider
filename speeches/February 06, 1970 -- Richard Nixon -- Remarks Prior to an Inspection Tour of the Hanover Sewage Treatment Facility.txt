    I want to express regret that we are late. As we were saying before the reporters got here, we had a little weather problem here this morning. The reason we selected this district--as you know, we could have selected a number of places in the country--is because it has a record and a reputation of being one of the model districts in the whole country.
Incidentally, I think you would be interested to know that during my years of traveling as a political official and as a campaigner, I have been to many facilities. This will be my first tour of this kind of a facility. So it will be educational for me, and I hope you and your colleagues can tell me all about it when we go in, and also the members of our Cabinet who are here with us.
