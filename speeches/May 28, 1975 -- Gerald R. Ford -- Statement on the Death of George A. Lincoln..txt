    I JOIN with the many friends and colleagues of the late Gen. George A. Lincoln in paying tribute to this patriotic American who dedicated his life to the service of our country. General Lincoln was a renowned West Point scholar in the social sciences for more than 20 years and was a respected educator throughout our country. His wise counsel assisted Secretaries of Defense and the Army, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a succession of Presidents.
General Lincoln will be missed by all of us, here in Washington as Director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness and a member of the National Security Council, and around the world where Army officers he taught are now serving our country with the same devotion he exemplified.
