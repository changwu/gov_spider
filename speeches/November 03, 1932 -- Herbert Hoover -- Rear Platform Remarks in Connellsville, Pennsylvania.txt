    Friends in Connellsville:
I find it difficult to express the very great appreciation that both Mrs. Hoover and I have for your coming in such enormous numbers to greet us here this morning. It is the most generous and the most courteous reception that we have received. It is heartening and encouraging. And it is an indication of what the people of Connellsville will do on the 8th of November next.
I thank you for coming.
