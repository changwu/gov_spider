    Tells Supporters Pennsylvania is Hillary Country!
The Clinton campaign today released a new video of Pennsylvania Congressman John Murtha on the trail with Hillary Clinton in the Keystone State. In the video, Murtha expresses his belief that Hillary is the only candidate who can responsibly end the war in Iraq and restore fiscal responsibility to our government.

Following is the script for the video:
Let me tell you something. I've served with seven Presidents. I am convinced that we're in probably one of the worst situations that I've seen in the 35 years I've been in Congress. We need a person with experience, a person that understands the policy.
When the Clinton administration left, there was a $250 billion surplus. Now, there's almost a $3 trillion deficit.
The military has been so depleted by this war. We're spending $343 million dollars a day to build roads in Iraq and we're not spending money on the projects that are so important.
And who can solve that problem – Hillary! 
Finally, a person that listens to the people, listens and works with people, and can get the country together and reunite us, restore our credibility, restore our military, and put us back in a fiscal policy worth the United States history.
The next President of the United States – Hillary Clinton!
This is Hillary country. She's had a tremendous reception here in Fayette County – she's going to get that kind of reception all over Pennsylvania. There is no individual that can do this more effectively than Hillary Clinton and I support her wholeheartedly.
