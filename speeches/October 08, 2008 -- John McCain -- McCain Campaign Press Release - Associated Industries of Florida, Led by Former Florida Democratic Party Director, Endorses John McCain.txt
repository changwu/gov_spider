TALLAHASSEE, FL -- The McCain-Palin campaign today announced the endorsement of Associated Industries of Florida. In its final endorsement announcement before the election, Associated Industries of Florida (AIF) today announced its backing of Sen. McCain and the McCain economic plan.
"We need a White House equipped to get our nation out of the economic crisis it is currently facing," said Barney Bishop, President and CEO of AIF and former Executive Director of the Florida Democratic Party. "John McCain is a proven leader who has demonstrated he has the experience necessary to quickly and decisively bring about real reform and set our nation back on a path to prosperity."
"Nearly three-quarters of AIF's members have 25 employees or less," added Bishop. "Associated Industries stands behind John McCain because we know he will stand up for the needs of Florida's small businesses. He has been involved with economic issues throughout his long and distinguished public service career and I believe he knows what we must do now to stabilize and grow our economy. Unfortunately, Sen. McCain's opponent offers no real solution to our economic crisis and would prefer to tax businesses to the brink of financial starvation."
John McCain's economic plan offers support and relief to the millions of small businesses that are the foundation of America's economy. John McCain will keep taxes low, allowing small businesses to remain in business and grow, creating more jobs and increasing job security.
