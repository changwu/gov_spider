Segment From "The Sean Hannity Show":
Sean Hannity: "I think it surprised a lot of people, his answer on immigration and then his comment that if you don't agree with me on that particular issue that in-state tuition breaks ought to be given to the children of illegal immigrants, illegal themselves, that you don't have a heart. What did you think of that?"
Mitt Romney: "I think the position is really unfortunate. I fundamentally don't believe that we should give a break to illegal aliens to go to college in the United States at a cost of approximately $22,000 a year. I think that makes no sense at all. The idea that illegal immigrants would get a $22,000 a year break on tuition whereas American citizens from other states would not get that advantage, I think that is very hard to explain. I think it was hard for the governor to explain. I understand he has apologized for using the 'you don't have a heart' phrase. But the question here is whether the policy makes any sense. I had a bill like that reach my desk in Massachusetts to give in-state tuition credits to illegal aliens and I vetoed it and the legislature, despite being Democrat, they sustained my veto. I think the American people recognize, we like legal immigration, we will however stop illegal immigration."
