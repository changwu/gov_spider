(House)
(Rep. Rogers, R-KY)
The Administration supports House passage of H.J. Res. 124, making continuing appropriations for fiscal year (FY) 2015, and for other purposes. The Administration appreciates the strong bipartisan effort that produced the amendment that provides authorities that are essential in equipping the Administration with the tools necessary to provide a comprehensive and sustained counterterrorism strategy to address the growing threat from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.
The Administration appreciates that the House bill allows critical Government functions to operate without interruption and avoids a damaging Government shutdown. While the Administration acknowledges that the bill reauthorizes the Export-Import Bank, the Administration encourages the Congress to pass a long-term extension to provide certainty to job-creators that export U.S.-made products and services. The Administration appreciates efforts to address the Ebola epidemic and support prevention efforts.
The Administration urges the Congress to establish spending levels for FY 2015 in comprehensive full-year appropriations legislation that appropriately funds national security requirements, while also funding critical domestic priorities that promote economic growth, opportunity, and innovation. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on legislation for the remainder of the fiscal year that balances these priorities and excludes ideological provisions that are intended to advance a narrow political agenda.
