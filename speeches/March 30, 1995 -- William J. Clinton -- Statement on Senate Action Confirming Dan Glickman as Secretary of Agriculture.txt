    I am pleased the Senate today overwhelmingly voted in support of Dan Glickman as the new Secretary at the Department of Agriculture.
Dan Glickman will be a strong voice and advocate for farmers, working families, and American agriculture.
During the past 2 years, the Agriculture Department has broken new ground on expanding trade opportunities, developing empowerment zones for distressed rural areas, and streamlining a major Federal agency that now runs more efficiently. However, our work is not done, and we must still tackle other important issues facing rural communities, farmers, and ranchers.
Next month will be especially important as we convene in Ames, Iowa, for the National Rural Conference to discuss the development of our Nation's economy, jobs, trade, and preservation of the family farm. It is important to hear firsthand from ordinary Americans, and I am pleased Dan is starting the job with his sleeves rolled up.
