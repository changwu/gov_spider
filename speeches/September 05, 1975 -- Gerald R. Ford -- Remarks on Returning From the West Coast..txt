    IT IS nice to be home and especially real good to see Betty and Steve and Jack and to see all of you.
We had a great trip--just a fraction of a second or two that disturbed things, but everything else was superb, and I am most grateful that you all came out here. I don't know why all the bother. [Laughter]
It was a very successful visit in Washington, Oregon, California, and Sacramento. Particularly the people were wonderful, and just a single incident I don't think we should feel was a distraction in the overall things that were done in a very affirmative way.
I want to thank, especially, the Secret Service and the other law enforcement people.
I particularly was impressed with the wonderful reception we got in California and in Sacramento, especially. I wouldn't under any circumstances let one individual's efforts undercut the warmth that we felt from the people of California.
Let me say with emphasis: We are going to be among the people in all of our States, because I think it is highly important that a President has an opportunity to meet people from all parts of our country and to let them have an opportunity to express to me their views, whether I agree or disagree. This is one of the great assets, I think, in a country such as our own.
Thank you very much.
