    I WAS deeply saddened at the death of the President of the Republic of China. Chiang Kai-shek. His passing marks the end of an era in Chinese history.
President Chiang was a man of firm integrity, high courage, and deep political conviction. The last surviving major Allied leader of the Second World War, he will be remembered by people from all walks of life and from every part of the world for his dignity and dedication to principles in which he believed.
Mrs. Ford joins me in behalf of all Americans in expressing our sincere condolences to Madame Chiang, to President Chiang's family, and to his countrymen in this time of sorrow.
NOTE.: Chiang Kai-shek was President of the Republic of China from 1948 until his death in Taipei, Taiwan, on April 5, 1975. The statement was released at Palm Springs, Calif.
Vice President Rockefeller headed the U.S. delegation to the funeral of President Chiang in Taiwan on April 16.
