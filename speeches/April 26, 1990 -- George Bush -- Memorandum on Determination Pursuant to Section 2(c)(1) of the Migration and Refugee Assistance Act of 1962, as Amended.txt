    Presidential Determination No. 90-19
Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Pursuant to Section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(c)(1), I hereby determine that it is important to the national interest that $7,000,000 be made available from the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund (Emergency Fund) to meet unexpected urgent needs of Palestinian refugees. This $7,000,000 would be contributed to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) for its programs of relief, education and health care for Palestinian refugees. Without the $7,000,000, UNRWA would be forced to cut essential services to the refugees.
You are authorized and directed to inform the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the appropriate committees of the Congress of this Determination and the obligation of funds under this authority, and to publish it in the Federal Register.
