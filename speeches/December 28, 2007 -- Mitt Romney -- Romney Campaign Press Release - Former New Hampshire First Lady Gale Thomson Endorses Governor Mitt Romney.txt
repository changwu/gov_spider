Boston, MA â€“ Today, former New Hampshire First Lady Gale Thomson announced her endorsement of Governor Mitt Romney. Mrs. Thomson is the wife of late New Hampshire Governor Meldrim Thomson Jr., who's "Ax the Tax" platform inspired future state and national candidates to take a pledge against raising taxes. She joins her son, anti-tax advocate Tom Thomson, who had previously announced his support of Governor Romney.
"Governor Romney strongly believes that through fiscally conservative policies, we can grow the economy, create better jobs and build a stronger America for future generations. He fought for those principles as Governor and he'll do the same as our nation's president. My husband always said, 'low taxes are the result of low spending,' and Mitt Romney embodies this vital conservative principle. I would encourage all Granite Staters to join me in supporting Governor Romney's campaign," said Gale Thomson.
Upon the announcement, Governor Romney said, "I am honored to have the endorsement of Gale Thomson, one of New Hampshire's most respected leaders. She and her husband faithfully served the people of the Granite State and worked to bring fiscally responsible policies to the State Capitol. I look forward to working with her to bring conservative change to Washington."
