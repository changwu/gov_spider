    Mitt Romney today released the following statement on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech at the United Nations: 
"I join in Prime Minister Netanyahu's call for a Middle East of progress and peace. And I join his urgent call to prevent the gravest threat to that vision—a nuclear-armed Iran.  I, like the rest of the American people, applaud the bravery of the people of Israel and stand with them in these dangerous times. The designs of the Iranian regime are a threat to America, Israel, and our friends and allies around the world."
