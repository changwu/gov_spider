    Helena, MT – After tonight's Democratic debate, Montana Governor Steve Bullock released the following statement:
"Missing from tonight's debate was any meaningful discussion on how we are going to win back the places we lost in 2016," said Montana Governor Steve Bullock. "In just the last two weeks, our Party has won big races in deep-red states by going everywhere and focusing on serious solutions that impact America's' daily lives. That's how I was re-elected the same year that Trump won Montana by 20 points, and it's how I'm going to win back the places we lost — and beat him in 2020."
