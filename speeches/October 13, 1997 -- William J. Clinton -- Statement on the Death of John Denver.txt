    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of John Denver. His soaring music evoked the grandeur of our landscape and the simple warmth of human love. He was a dedicated champion of the environment, spending many hours on the vital work of protecting natural heritage. And he opened many doors to understanding among nations through his tours of the Soviet Union, China, and Vietnam. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and to his millions of fans.
