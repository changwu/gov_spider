IT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO CUT TAXES IN NEW YORK CITY THAN IN WASHINGTON D.C.
When Mayor Giuliani Took Office, The New York City Council Had 44 Democrats And Just Seven Republicans. (Steven Lee Myers, "Dog And Elephant Days: Giuliani Woos G.O.P.," The New York Times, 8/4/94)
In New York City, Democrats Outnumbered Republicans 5-To-1. (R.W. Apple Jr., "While Not A Natural, Giuliani Has Learned To Work A Crowd," The New York Times, 10/25/97)
"Before [Giuliani's] Time In Office No Mayor Of New York City Had Ever Made Tax Cutting A Priority …" (Collin Levy, Op-Ed, "The Prosecutor And The Salesman," The Wall Street Journal, 10/12/07)
In 1993, Giuliani Rejected Dinkins Panel Plan To Raise Taxes. "Sketching a grim portrait of New York City's fiscal condition, a panel appointed by Mayor David N. Dinkins reported yesterday that the city's long-term budget problems were more severe than previously estimated. The committee also outlined what it called a 'menu' of Draconian and politically unpalatable measures — including … increases in the sales tax and in property taxes for single-family homeowners … from which city officials could choose to achieve long-term budget balance. … But Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani rejected the panel's proposal for tax increases and reiterated his pledge to phase out several business taxes including the hotel tax and the commercial rent tax to spur the local economy." (Alan Finder, "Dinkins Panel Has Grim View Of Fiscal Gaps," The New York Times, 12/3/93)
The New York Times Criticized Giuliani For Rejecting Panel's Recommendations To Raise Taxes. "Mayor-elect Rudolph Giuliani was too quick to reject new proposals to end the annual agony of closing New York City's budget gap. … Tax increases are only a fraction of the advisers' proposals, smaller than their recommendations for increased state aid to the city, and smaller still than the proposed spending cuts. But Mr. Giuliani campaigned on the comfortable promise of tax cuts. It would be hard for him to do the reverse at this time, but wise for him to examine his revenue needs and the possibility of delaying reductions until the budget is in better shape." (Editorial, "Budget Advice For The Mayor-Elect," The New York Times, 12/4/93)
Under Mayor Giuliani, The "First Marginal Tax Cut In Memory" Was Passed. "Toppling liberal bastions isn't easy, but you can get there if you hammer away enough at the ramparts. That at least seems to be the theory of New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and his city council, who this week forced through the first marginal tax cut in memory." (Editorial, "Even In New York," The Wall Street Journal, 11/19/98)
Steve Forbes: "While Lots Of Politicians Make Promises About Cutting Taxes Mr. Giuliani Delivered, Overcoming The Initial Resistance Of The Overwhelmingly Democratic City Council." (Steve Forbes, Op-Ed, "Rudy's The One," The Wall Street Journal, 3/30/07)
