    Presidential Action
The President's Citizen Corps initiative that he announced on January 30, 2002 to involve Americans in service activities that will make their communities safer and better prepared to respond to emergencies has been met with strong interest in our Nation's communities. Today, the President will travel to Knoxville, Tennessee to discuss his Citizen Corps initiative. The President will announce that:
- More than 40 local leaders in cities and counties around the country have launched Citizen Corps Councils to offer citizens opportunities to help make their communities safer, stronger, and better prepared for preventing and handling threats of terrorism, crime, and other emergencies and disasters. Fourteen of those local leaders joined him in Knoxville to demonstrate their commitment to coordinating, expanding, and creating volunteer opportunities through Citizen Corps.
- America's mayors, local government leaders, and governors will today receive the comprehensive Citizen Corps: A Guide for Local Officials. This guide will instruct them on how to start Citizen Corps Councils in their communities to build upon their existing crime prevention, disaster preparedness, and public health response activities through volunteer service.
- To support the Citizen Corps programs and the creation of Citizen Corps Councils, so communities can get them up and running as soon as possible, he has requested $50 million for Citizen Corps in his supplemental budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2002. He has already requested $230 million for the Citizen Corps initiative in his fiscal year 2003 budget.
- The Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal agencies have begun examining ways to include Citizen Corps activities as a factor in awarding grants to local and state governments from existing and proposed emergency preparedness and response programs.
Background on Citizen Corps
Citizen Corps is a component of President Bush's USA Freedom Corps initiative that will create opportunities for individuals to volunteer and participate in community emergency preparation, prevention and response activities. Citizen Corps includes five national programs that can be used at the local level by Citizen Corps Councils. They include:
- Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) Training
- Medical Reserve Corps
- Neighborhood Watch
- Operation TIPS (Terrorism Information and Prevention System)
- Volunteers in Police Service (VIPS)
Citizen Corps was created to offer those who want to devote their energy and skills, in the aftermath of September 11, to helping their country and their communities by getting involved in activities that support emergency, crime, and natural disaster prevention, preparedness and response. Since it was launched, more than 25,000 Americans in all 50 states and territories have signed up to volunteer through Citizen Corps by calling 1-877-USA-Corps or logging on to www.citizencorps.gov.
Citizen Corps will be coordinated at the local level by Citizen Corps Councils that will bring together local elected officials, first responders, educational institutions, medical facilities, faith-based and community organizations, and civic, business, and industry leaders. The Councils will build a web of volunteer support for first responder activities by drawing on existing programs in their communities and helping to create new opportunities.
Local government leaders from: Arlington Heights, Illinois; Charlotte, North Carolina; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Knoxville, Tennessee; Laredo, Texas; Los Angeles, California; Orange County, California; Orlando, Florida; Placentia, California; Redondo Beach, California; Santa Fe County, New Mexico; Tucson, Arizona; and Washington, D.C. joined President Bush in Knoxville, TN today for his announcements on Citizen Corps.
In Our Communities
More than 40 communities around the country are launching Citizen Corps Councils to coordinate volunteer support for emergency preparedness, prevention and response. The Councils will coordinate the work already being done by citizen volunteers in communities around the country to create a platform for strengthening and expanding those volunteer activities. Highlights of activities underway include:
- Knoxville Tennessee's Citizen Corps Council met for the first time on March 28, 2002, bringing together a broad-based group of community leaders who represent Knoxville's public and private sectors, emergency management agencies, and faith-based community. Knoxville's Citizens? Police Academy was one of the community models for the Citizen Corps? Volunteers in Police Service (VIPs) program.
- Through the "Mayor's Matching Grant Program," seven Orlando, Florida neighborhood associations have created Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT) and purchased emergency equipment. Orlando also has a robust Neighborhood Watch program, as well as the Citizen Observer Program to recruit and train volunteers to help the Orlando Police Department reduce crime in neighborhoods.
- Through Citizen Corps, Charlotte, North Carolina leaders are identifying ways to assist local law enforcement agencies and working to create a strategic communication plan for use in the event of a terrorist threat or attack, including development of a homeland security web page, amateur radio network, and a fax/e-mail network.
- The Village of Arlington Heights, Illinois has a 20-year track record of using volunteers to support law enforcement and first responders. Arlington Heights already maintains a comprehensive network of mutual aid agreements and an active neighborhood watch program that includes 80 individual groups. They are now working to coordinate its efforts through a new Citizen Corps Council.
- The City of Fort Wayne, Indiana and Allen County are working to create a Citizen Corps Council that will incorporate the activities already underway at the Fort Wayne Regional Community Policing Institute, a comprehensive program offering innovative community policing education and training to community members.
- Santa Fe County, New Mexico is creating a Citizen Corps Council with the help of local non-profit organizations and community leaders who are working to attract more citizens to volunteer to make their community safer.
- The call for Citizen Corps volunteers has already gone out in Placentia, California, where they have stepped up recruiting for their Neighborhood Watch, Community Emergency Response Team, Volunteers in Police Service, Police Explorers, and Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Services programs.
- Orange County, California has a Citizen Corps Advisory Council involving agreements with 113 community affiliates, including city governments, school districts, and special jurisdictions, such as the airport and other transportation and water districts. Their Citizen Corps Council will also include two new programs: the Professional Services Reserves and Private Sector Terrorism Response Group.
- Two weeks after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Mayor Robert Walkup started "Operation Safe Tucson," which now serves as the local Citizen Corps Council.

- The City of Los Angeles, California's Citizen Corps Council will be working with a number of local programs including their Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), Neighborhood Watch program, and SafetyNET program. Los Angeles developed what is now the nationally used CERT program in 1985 as a way of offering basic training in disaster preparedness and rescue skills in the event of an earthquake. SafetyNET is the city's volunteer neighborhood emergency training program.
- The City of Laredo, Texas has been a leader in ?mutual aid? between cities, partnering with Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico to increase first responder and volunteer collaboration to ensure the safety of their residents.
