    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:) 
Pursuant to section 502(f)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2462(f)(1)), I am providing notification of my intent to end the suspension of Argentina's designation as a beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. I have carefully considered the criteria set forth in sections 501 and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2461, 2462). After considering those criteria, in particular the criteria set forth in section 502(b)(2)(E) (19 U.S.C. 2462(b)(2)(E)), I have determined that it is appropriate to add Argentina to the list of GSP beneficiary developing countries in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) of the United States.
In addition, pursuant to section 502(d)(3) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2462(d)(3)), I am advising you of my intent to suspend the duty-free treatment accorded under the GSP program to certain eligible articles that are the product of Ukraine. After considering the criteria set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2462(c)), including, in particular section 502(c)(5) (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)(5)) on the extent to which a designated beneficiary developing country is providing adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights, I have determined that it is appropriate to suspend the duty-free treatment accorded under the GSP program to certain eligible articles that are the product of Ukraine.
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
