    On Cinco de Mayo, Americans gather with friends and family to commemorate the history of the Mexican people and the anniversary of the Battle of Puebla. On May 5, 1862, Mexican forces, under the command of General Ignacio Zaragoza, bravely repelled the invading army of Napoleon III at the town of Puebla de Los Angeles. Though they were outnumbered and facing one of the strongest militaries in the world, the determined Mexican soldiers overcame the French force and proved their place in history as valiant defenders of Mexico's liberty and right to self-government.
On this anniversary, we remember the courage of the warriors who won the Battle of Puebla and the legacy they have passed down through the generations. Today we honor the heritage of our neighbors to the south, and we celebrate the significant contributions of Mexican Americans to the United States.
Melania joins me in sending our best wishes for an enjoyable day. Feliz Cinco de Mayo.
