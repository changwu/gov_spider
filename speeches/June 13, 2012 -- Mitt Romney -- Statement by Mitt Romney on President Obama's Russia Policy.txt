    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on President Obama's failed Russia policy:
"President Obama's 'reset' policy toward Russia has clearly failed. Russia has openly armed and protected a murderous regime in Syria, frustrated international sanctions on Iran, and opposed American efforts on a range of issues. This is an unfortunate failure of President Obama's foreign policy."
