    MARLOW -- Governor Bill Richardson announced today that he will become the first ever presidential candidate to visit Marlow, New Hampshire. Marlow, a small town located in northern Cheshire County, has never received a visit from a presidential candidate in its entire 246-year history.
"I am excited to be the first ever presidential candidate to visit Marlow," said Governor Richardson. "The New Hampshire primary is about meeting voters one-on-one, looking them in the eye and answering their questions. It's about time the people of Marlow had an opportunity to directly participate in this process."
Local organizers were energized by the news of Governor Richardson's impending visit, to be held at four o'clock. this Thursday at Jones Hall, a renovated theatre on the National Registry of Historical Sites.
"I am thrilled that a presidential candidate has finally chosen to visit Marlow," said Mary Blank, president of the Marlow Historical Society. "In an era where campaigns are increasingly dominated by polls, fundraising and political consultants, to have a major candidate like Governor Richardson come to Marlow boosts my faith in the political process."
Governor Richardson's stop will come in the midst of a busy three-day, ten-town swing through the Granite State. In addition to his visit to Marlow, the Governor's campaign stops will include the Independence Day Fireworks in Manchester, the UPS warehouse in Nashua and Fourth of July parades in Amherst, Merrimack and Greenville.
