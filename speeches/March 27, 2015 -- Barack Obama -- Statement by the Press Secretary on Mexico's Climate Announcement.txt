    The U.S. welcomes the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) submission by President Pe√±a Nieto earlier today and applauds Mexico for being the first major emerging economy to formally submit its INDC. Mexico is setting an example for the rest of the world by submitting an INDC that is timely, clear, ambitious, and supported by robust, unconditional policy commitments. In particular, Mexico's target to peak its emissions by 2026 and drive them down thereafter is a landmark step in the global transition to a low-carbon economy. Mexico's submission is in keeping with the Lima Decision calling on all parties to submit their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions well in advance of COP21 in Paris this December. We hope that Mexico's actions will encourage other economies to submit INDCs that are ambitious, timely, transparent, detailed, and achievable.
