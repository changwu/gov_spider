Democrat Senator Mark Warner is acting and talking like he is in total control of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Their is nothing bipartisan about him. He should not be allowed to take 'command' of that Committee. Too important! Remember when he spoke to the Russian jokester?Retweets: 17169Favorites: 66517

North Korea fired off some small weapons which disturbed some of my people and others but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me & also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Bidan a low IQ individual & worse. Perhaps that's sending me a signal?Retweets: 12028Favorites: 48502
