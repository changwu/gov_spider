    On behalf of the American people, I send my warmest wishes to those, both in the Dominican Republic and here in America, that are celebrating Dominican Republic National Day. The United States values the cooperation and positive relations it enjoys with the Dominican Republic. Here at home, we honor the contributions that Dominican Americans across the country make in all facets of our national life and join them in celebrating their heritage.
