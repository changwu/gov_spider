    DES MOINES, IOWA â€” Beto O'Rourke announced today that he will participate in a televised CNN Town Hall at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa on Tuesday, May 21st at 10 PM EDT/9 PM CDT. The town hall will be moderated by CNN Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash.
This will be Beto's fourth trip to the Hawkeye State as a presidential candidate. During previous visits, he has held 60 town halls and other public events in 34 counties to meet with, listen to, and learn from Iowans in every corner of the state. Beto has visited more Iowa counties than any other presidential candidate this cycle. This will be his third nationally televised town hall.
As flooding and President Trump's trade war continue to devastate farms and communities in the Heartland, the CNN Town Hall will provide a national platform for impacted Iowans to raise the issues that matter most to them.
After releasing an ambitious plan to tackle climate change last month, Beto recently toured flood damage in southwest Iowa and met with residents and local officials to discuss the impacts of climate change on their communities. Inspired by the conversations he has had with Iowans all across the state, Beto unveiled new elements of his climate plan that leverage opportunities to partner with Iowans to combat the effects of climate change and build a more resilient and green future. He first outlined these new proposals during a climate change roundtable with local activists, academics, and elected officials at the Des Moines Public Library last week. A fact sheet detailing the proposals is available here.
Since launching his candidacy for President of the United States in March, Beto has hosted 150 events with tens of thousands of Americans in 116 cities across 14 states and the District of Columbia. He has personally driven over 6,150 miles as his grassroots campaign has criss-crossed the United States answering more than 1,000 questions from voters.
