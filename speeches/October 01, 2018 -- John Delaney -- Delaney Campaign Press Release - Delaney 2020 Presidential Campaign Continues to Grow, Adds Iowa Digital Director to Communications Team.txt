    WASHINGTON â€“ Today, John Delaney's 2020 Presidential campaign announced the hiring of Greg Hauenstein as Iowa Digital Director.
Greg Hauenstein is a digital media producer and strategist. He moved to Iowa from Canandaigua, New York in 2007 where he began working on Obama's successful 2008 Iowa Caucus campaign and went onto become the first Digital Director of the Iowa Democratic Party starting in 2009. Since 2012, Greg has been the lead web developer at GPS Impact, a public affairs and political strategy firm in Des Moines.
"We are thrilled to welcome Greg to our team. Greg and his work are well respected by political professionals in Iowa and around the country," said Monica Biddix, Iowa Communications Director. "He not only brings his skills and talents to our operation but also years of Iowa experience including work in several caucus cycles. Greg has an incredible, creative vision and a tenacious work ethic. He will be a valuable asset to our team."
"I'm very excited to join this team. I love this country and want to help a leader like John pull us back from the morass of excessive partisanship. We need more than 'not Trump' and I see that in John Delaney. I look forward to helping John get his message out through digital media and energizing Democrats to caucus for him in February 2020," said Hauenstein.
Greg lives on the South Side of Des Moines with his wife Emily Holley and daughter Eloise.
