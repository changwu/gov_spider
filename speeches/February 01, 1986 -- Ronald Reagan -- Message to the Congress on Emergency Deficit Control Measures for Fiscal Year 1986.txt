    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, I herewith report the issuance of the Order to affected agencies to suspend automatic spending increases and sequester or reduce budgetary resources consistent with the Comptroller General's January 21 sequestration or reduction determinations required by the Act, to eliminate the $11.7 billion deficit excess for Fiscal Year 1986. This Order is effective March 1, 1986, unless modified by enacted alternative deficit reduction legislation. A copy of the Order is enclosed.
Heads of Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branch agencies have further calculated and are sending to the Congress detailed reports of the base and reduction or sequestration amount by programs, projects, and activities. These calculations are in compliance with the Comptroller General's report.
