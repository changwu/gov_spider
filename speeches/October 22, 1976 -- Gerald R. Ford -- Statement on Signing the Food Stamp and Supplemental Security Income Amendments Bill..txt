    I HAVE signed H.R. 13500, amendments to the Food Stamp and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs.
This Food Stamp amendment gives to the States needed flexibility in deciding how to manage their food stamp programs. It makes optional a previous legislative requirement which was often inappropriate because of its complexity, cost, and the occasional unintended hardships it created.
The bill also has a provision which guarantees that the aged, blind, and disabled recipients of Supplemental Security Income benefits will receive annual cost-of-living increases from the Federal Government. Under current law, these increases do not always get passed on to the recipient. However, I think it is important that this guarantee be available. SSI recipients are particularly vulnerable to the ravaging effects of inflation. This bill will at least provide this deserving group a minimum level of protection.
