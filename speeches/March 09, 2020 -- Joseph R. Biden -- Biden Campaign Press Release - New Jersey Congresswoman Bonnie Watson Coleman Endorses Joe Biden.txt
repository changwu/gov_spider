    Today, New Jersey Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"As a former Chair of the New Jersey Democratic State Committee, I recognize the importance of Primaries in allowing everyone's voice to be heard, but as the party begins to coalesce around the Vice President, it's time for us to unify and get on to our first priority as Democrats, which is to beat Donald Trump. I am endorsing Joe Biden today because he is the best person to lead our country forward. I am also endorsing now because we cannot afford to allow Donald Trump to have another moment where he is allowed to build momentum unchallenged. The stakes for our nation's future are simply too great.
"I have known Vice President Biden for many years and consider him to be a friend and a strong ally in the fight to advance our Party's progressive values. Joe Biden was on the frontlines working for Democrats across the country well before he was Barack Obama's selection for Vice President and his dedication and commitment to strengthening our middle class and lifting those who need our help has only intensified these past few years."
Congresswoman Watson Coleman joins prominent New Jersey leaders backing Biden, including Senator Cory Booker, Congressman Andy Kim, and Congressman Tom Malinowski. Biden leads the field in congressional endorsements with support from more than 80 U.S. Representatives and 14 U.S. Senators, including the most endorsements from members of both the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,700 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
