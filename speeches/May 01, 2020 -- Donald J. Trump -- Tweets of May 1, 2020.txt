Cryin' Chuck Schumer was on a late night show using a false talking point over & over again. "We don't have enough testing ," he would repeat, when he knows we have done a great job on Testing, just like we have on Ventilators and everything else. He lied, gave NY SALT. Run AOC!Retweets: 25324Favorites: 110033

Cryin Chuck Schumer, compared to what other Senators have brought home to their states, has brought very little back to N.Y. A totally overrated loser, the one thing he has given them is SALT. He never even called me to stop it. No wonder Cuomo & most others can't stand him. AOC!Retweets: 21049Favorites: 90556
