    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay, well, I got the booster shot, and I want to encourage everyone to do the same when you are eligible. And as we have said from the beginning, the vaccines are free, they're safe, and they will save your life.
And we've all seen the videos of folks who are in an ICU bed, who were not vaccinated, with tears, begging people -- including their family member -- to get vaccinated. And what we know at this point in our country is the vast majority -- I'm told well over 90 percent of the people -- who are in an ICU or are dying from COVID are unvaccinated.
So, let's everybody get vaccinated and get through and beyond this pandemic. So, thank you all. Thank you.
