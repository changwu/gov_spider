    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Sharp (D) Indiana)
The Administration supports a simple extension of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act and has no objection to House passage of H.R. 1699 which would extend Title I (Strategic Petroleum Reserve) and Part B of Title II (International Energy Program) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. The Administration will, however, work in conference to delete the bill's provisions requiring a test sale of SPR oil. A test sale under current market conditions would not be meaningful.
