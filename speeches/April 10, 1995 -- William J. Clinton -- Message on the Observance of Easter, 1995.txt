    Warmest greetings to everyone observing Easter Sunday.
On this day of great hope and promise, Christians the world over celebrate God's redemptive grace as manifested in the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. This day symbolizes the victory of good over evil, hope over despair, and life over death. Rejoicing in the miracle of Easter, we pledge anew to hold in our hearts Christ's message of peace and joy.
As springtime returns to our corner of the earth, we are reminded of the beauty of new beginnings. Our faith in God lifts our spirits, and many Americans step back from the concerns of daily life to reflect on the power of our religious traditions and on the values they teach us. During this time of renewal, let us all thank God for the countless wonders of creation and rededicate ourselves to the common ideals that have made ours a land of infinite blessings.
Hillary joins me in extending best wishes to all for a joyous Easter celebration.
