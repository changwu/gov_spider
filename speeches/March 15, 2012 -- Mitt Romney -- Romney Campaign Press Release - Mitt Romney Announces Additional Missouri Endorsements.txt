    Mitt Romney today announced additional endorsements in Missouri.
"I am proud to see more Missouri leaders coming to my campaign," said Mitt Romney. "These leaders support my vision for more jobs, smaller government, and less debt and with their support over the next couple of days and in November, we can defeat President Obama and bring conservative change to Washington."
"Mitt Romney is the only candidate who can win in November and put in place conservative policies that will jump-start the economy," said Jefferson City Mayor Eric Struemph. "It is time for Republicans to unite behind Mitt Romney and work our hardest to defeat President Obama in November. This election is too important to allow President Obama to have four more years in the White House."
