Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders share a lot of big progressive goals—but they differ in how they plan to achieve them.?
Here's how The New York Times put it in their recent endorsement:


  " In the end, though, Mr. Sanders does not have the breadth of experience or policy ideas that Mrs. Clinton offers. His boldest proposals — to break up the banks and to start all over on health care reform with a Medicare-for-all system—have earned him support among alienated middle-class voters and young people. But his plans for achieving them aren't realistic, while Mrs. Clinton has very good, and achievable, proposals in both areas."New York Times

For example, on preventing gun violence:


Don't take our word for it. Just ask the gun lobby:

Wayne LaPierre, NRA CEO and Executive Vice President

And here are their plans for addressing ISIS and the threat of global terror.


And when it comes to ending the nation's substance abuse epidemic, only one candidate has a plan.


And as far as reining in Wall Street?


We need a president who knows how to deliver real results—and that's exactly what Hillary's campaign is all about. Read more about her policy proposals here.
