    Newton, IA - At an event in Newton today, Michelle Smith, chair of the Jasper County Democrats, officially endorsed Cory Booker for President. Smith joins fellow county Democratic Party chair Bryce Smith and more than 100 other high profile Iowa elected officials and activists in supporting Cory's campaign for the Iowa Caucuses.
"Jasper County is sick and tired of Democrats and Republicans fighting rather than getting stuff done. When I looked around at all the candidates in this election, I knew we'd need someone who could bring everyone together and talk about what we have in common as Americans and Iowans." said Michelle Smith. "Cory is the candidate we need to flip Iowa blue and bring in a new generation of leadership that finally gives real opportunity to rural America. I'm proud to endorse him and can't wait to work with his team to make him the next president of the United States.
In addition to being a leading Jasper County Democratic activist, Michelle Smith is a fierce advocate for those suffering from mental illness and Iowa's homeless residents.
Smith endorsed Cory in Newton, IA on the "Cory Booker for America Tour," a four-day bus tour across the state of Iowa. Find more details about the tour here.
