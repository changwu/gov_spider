    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Nadler, D-NY, and 160 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports passage of H.R. 8404, the Respect for Marriage Act. This legislation would secure marriage equality in the United States. The right to marriage confers vital legal protections, dignity, and full participation in our society. No person should face discrimination because of who they are or whom they love, and every married couple in the United States deserves the security of knowing that their marriage will be defended and respected.
H.R. 8404 would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, an unconstitutional and discriminatory law, and would enshrine the right to Federal recognition of marriage for same-sex and interracial couples. This legislation would strengthen civil rights, and ensure that the promise of equality is not denied to families across the country.
