  A Proclamation

Americans are thankful for the inspiration and achievements of the millions of us who have disabilities. Through the years, and in more and more spheres of endeavor, disabled Americans have demonstrated their capabilities and their desire to make the most of the opportunities life can offer. Still, much more remains to be done by each of us so all citizens with disabilities can reach their potential.
To reach this goal, for the past 20 years a partnership between governments at all levels and the private sector, including groups and individual volunteers, has fostered opportunity for disabled citizens. National Disabled Americans Week, 1988, allows each of us to salute efforts aimed at developing and utilizing the skills and insights of disabled peopleâ€”and to honor the spirit and accomplishments of Americans with disabilities in these efforts and in communities everywhere.
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 319, has designated the period beginning November 6, 1988, and ending November 12, 1988, as "National Disabled Americans Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this occasion.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the period beginning November 6, 1988, and ending November 12, 1988, as National Disabled Americans Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirteenth.

RONALD REAGAN
