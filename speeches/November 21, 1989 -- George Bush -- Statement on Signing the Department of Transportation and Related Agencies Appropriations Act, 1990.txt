    Today I signed into law H.R. 3015, the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1990. I want to take this opportunity to thank the Congress for addressing concerns raised by the Administration and for presenting me with a bill in which the funding levels are generally consistent with the Administration's requests.
This Act provides appropriations for a number of critical programs under the Department of Transportation, as well as emergency drug funding to combat illegal drugs.
I particularly want to commend the Congress for providing the additional resources needed to fund all the elements of my anti-drug initiative and crime initiative. With these additional resources, the Federal Government will be better able to continue our war on drugs and to address the enforcement, prevention, and treatment aspects of this scourge.
