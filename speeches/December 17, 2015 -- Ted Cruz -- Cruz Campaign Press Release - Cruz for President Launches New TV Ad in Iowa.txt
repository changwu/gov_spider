CRUZ: Securing our borders and stopping illegal immigration is a matter of national security.
That's why I fought so hard to defeat President Obama and the Republican establishment's Gang of 8 amnesty plan.
Their misguided plan would have given Obama the authority to admit Syrian refugees, including ISIS terrorists.
That's just wrong.
When it comes to radical Islamic terrorism I think we need to rediscover Ronald Reagan's strategy: We win, they lose.
I'm Ted Cruz and I approved this message.
