    I strongly condemn the bombings in Mumbai, India, which killed dozens of innocent people and injured many more. Acts of terror are intended to sow fear and chaos among free peoples. I hope that the perpetrators of these murders will be identified quickly and brought to justice.
On behalf of all Americans, I send condolences to all affected by today's tragedy and to the Government and people of India.
