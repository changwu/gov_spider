    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revised)
(House)(Penny (D) MN and Smith (R) NJ)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4088 because it is unnecessary. The veterans readjustment appointment system was modified as recently as December 1989 (P.L. 101-237). Additional time is needed to assess the effect of these modifications and to determine if the major revisions proposed in H.R. 4088 are needed to address veterans' employment needs.
The Administration, however, would have no objection to enactment of one minor modification proposed in H.R. 4088. That modification would restore eligibility for veterans readjustment appointments to those Vietnam Era veterans who were excluded by P. L. 101-237.
