Out of Town Pool Report # 4 - Bike Ride, Gaggle and Lid
POTUS rode a bicycle along a path in Gordon's Pond State Park flanked by agents. He went past the pool, which is positioned in the parking lot at 4:39 PM and again at 5:30 PM
He was wearing a helmet and took some questions from the pool. Some quotes below. Please check against transcript.
On meeting with leaders Tuesday he said "I think so."
On leaving for the G7: "That's my plan as it stands now."
On tougher work requirements he said that he voted for the "tougher aid programs" in the law now but "For Medicaid it's a different story, so I'm waiting to hear what their exact proposal is."
Turkey election: "I hope whoever wins wins. There's enough problems in that part of the world."
How he feels on debt ceiling talks with GOP: "It's never good to characterize a negotiation in the middle of the negotiations. I remain optimistic because I am a congenital optimist. But I really think there is a desire on their part as well as ours to reach an agreement. And I think we'll be able to do it."
On how Border is going "Much better than you all expected."
On plans to visit the border: "Not in the near term no. It would just be disruptive."
He said numbers at the border have gone down but "We have a lot more work to do. We need some more help from the Congress"
Said he got FLOTUS an orchid for Mother's Day and that his daughter is here.
He departed and at 5:38 PM we got a lid.

Out of town pool report #4b - clarification
Just a note to clarify that I misnumbered the reports and skipped from 2 to 4. So there was no 3.
Apologies. Good night all.
