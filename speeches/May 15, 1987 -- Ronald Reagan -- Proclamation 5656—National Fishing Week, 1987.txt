  A Proclamation

It is most fitting that we take time to salute the role of fishing in the lives of Americans. Fishing greatly aids our economy, is a source of healthful food, promotes respect for sound conservation and for the bounty and wonder of our natural resources, and introduces millions of people to the benefits of outdoor recreation.
Today, roughly a quarter of all Americans call sport fishing one of their favorite outdoor activities. Fishing represents a fine opportunity for all of us, especially children and young adults, to discover a wholesome, relaxing, and enjoyable pastime. Fishing can teach us the importance of clean water and a stable aquatic environment. Recreational fishing also contributes much to our economy, and each year provides millions of dollars in revenue for fishery restoration projects. Fishermen take pride in our abundant fishery resources and work diligently for their continued well-being.
In recognition of all that recreational fishing and the commercial fishing industry do for America, the Congress, by Public Law 100-22, has designated the week of June 1 through June 7, 1987, as "National Fishing Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in its observance.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of June 1 through June 7, 1987, as National Fishing Week. I encourage all Americans to join with anglers and all who treasure our Nation's fisheries as they work to ensure superior fishing opportunities for our children and for generations to come.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.

RONALD REAGAN
