    Achievement marks critical step towards qualifying for January 14 DNC debate in Iowa
(SAN FRANCISCO, CA, January 3, 2020) — Today, presidential candidate Tom Steyer's campaign officially surpassed the 225,000 unique donor mark. The achievement places Steyer squarely across the Democratic National Committee's required threshold to qualify for the January 14 presidential debate in Iowa.
"Today's achievement is a clear reflection of what we are seeing in the early states — voters are responding to Tom's messages of tackling the climate crisis and building an economy that creates prosperity for all Americans," said Campaign Manager Heather Hargreaves. "I want to thank all of our supporters for fighting to make sure Tom is on the debate stage January 14th so voters across this country can hear firsthand how he'll go toe-to-toe with Trump on the economy and expose him for what he is: a fraud and failure."
In order to qualify for the January debate, the DNC is requiring that candidates reach either 5% in four polls or 7% in two early-state polls. However, as of today, it has been 45 days since a qualifying early state poll was last taken. In an eventful campaign environment in which support shifts significantly over short periods of time, the lack of polling is poised to yield a field that is unrepresentative of voters' current support. This is underscored by Morning Consult's latest early state tracking, conducted in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada between December 23 and 29, which shows Steyer with 10% of support among Democratic primary voters.
Today's news comes on day three of Steyer's five-day People Over Profits bus tour in Iowa, where Steyer is traveling from Council Bluffs to Newton to talk with Iowans about the issues they care about and how he will take action on them.
