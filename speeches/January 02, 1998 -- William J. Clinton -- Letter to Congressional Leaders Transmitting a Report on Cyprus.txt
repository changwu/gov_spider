    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question. The previous submission covered progress through July 31, 1997. The current submission covers the period August 1, 1997, to September 30, 1997.
Highlights of the reporting period include the U.N. sponsored talks between President Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash held in Glion-sur-Montreux, Switzerland; U.S. Special Cyprus Coordinator Miller's trip to the region; and U.S. success in convening direct talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders on security issues.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
