    Despite being the last candidate to enter the race, Kasich is the undisputed NH Town Hall Leader
Today, at a town hall meeting in Goffstown, Ohio Gov. John Kasich held his 75th town hall meeting in New Hampshire, the most of any other candidate. In addition to his town halls, John Kasich has also held or participated in dozens of forums, house parties, meet and greets, and speeches in the state.
John Kasich declared his candidacy for president in Columbus, Ohio, on July 21, 2015. That same day, the governor flew to New Hampshire and held his first New Hampshire town hall at Rivier University in Nashua. Over the following two days, Kasich held additional town hall meetings in Portsmouth, Center Harbor, Wolfeboro and North Conway.
"Seventy-five town halls in six months is a big milestone, and I appreciate everyone who has come out from all over New Hampshire to hear what I have to say," said Kasich. "The town hall meeting has long been the critical component to elections in this state, where voters are less likely to be persuaded by television ads or political mail pieces. Rather, New Hampshire voters expect candidates to be accessible and approachable, answer their questions face-to-face, and understand their concerns."
