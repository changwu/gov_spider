    Today, Dr. Elias A. Zerhouni announced that he will resign from his position as Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) at the end of October.
For over six years, Dr. Zerhouni has led the NIH toward scientific discoveries that improve Americans' health and save lives. During his tenure, the NIH has accomplished groundbreaking work in the area of genetic research, including mapping the human genome, and also helping to ensure the passage of genetic non-discrimination legislation. The NIH developed a life-saving anti-cancer vaccine, which helps protect women from becoming infected with the human papillomavirus. Dr. Zerhouni has also led the NIH's fight against heart disease, championing the successful Heart Truth campaign and pioneering an important study regarding the early signs of heart disease in women.
President Bush is grateful to Dr. Zerhouni for his service to our Nation, and wishes the Zerhouni family all the best in the future.
