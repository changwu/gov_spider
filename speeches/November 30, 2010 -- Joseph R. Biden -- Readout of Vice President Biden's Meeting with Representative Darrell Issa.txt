    The Vice President and Representative Issa met today to discuss Recovery Act oversight and opportunities to apply some of the lessons learned to other federal programs. They identified some areas of agreement, including the need to enforce full compliance with reporting by recipients of Recovery Act funds, and to have follow-up conversations about other areas where they can work together.
