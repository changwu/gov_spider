    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Brooks (D) Texas and Horton (R) New York)
The President's senior advisers will recommend a veto of H.R. 3077 because of provisions which would create a statutory Inspector General in each of the Departments of Justice and the Treasury. By establishing statutory Inspectors General pursuant to the Inspector General Act of 1978 (the Act), H.R. 3077 would infringe upon the law enforcement responsibilities of both departments and monetary policy responsibilities of the Department of the Treasury which have not traditionally been the subject of Inspectors General inquiries. Further, the bill fails to take account of the effective mechanisms in place at both Departments to investigate allegations of impropriety and to conduct audits.
The Administration is also concerned with provisions of H.R. 3077 that would extend certain responsibilities of the Act to audit units in many smaller agencies. Expanding the scope of the Act in this fashion fails to take account of differences in staff size, expertise, and responsibilities, and would be unduly burdensome on smaller agencies and audit offices.
