    Des Moines, IA – In response to the first Democratic Debate, Montana Governor Steve Bullock released the following statement:
"As the only candidate who has won a Trump state, it was clear that a critical voice was missing from the debate stage tonight. I've been focused on winning back the places we lost. That's why tonight I spoke directly with voters in a televised town hall in Iowa and will do the same in New Hampshire tomorrow. If we don't change our strategy — if we don't both turn out Democrats and win back some of the voters we lost in the last election — we will lose to Trump again and we will deserve to."
Today, Governor Bullock held a televised Town Hall in Des Moines hosted by WHO-HD. Tomorrow he will hold a televised New Hampshire Town Hall in Manchester hosted by WMUR.
