"We're thrilled to earn the support of these Iowa leaders and community activists. They know that Senator Klobuchar has real solutions to the problems Iowans face and has a proven record of getting results," said Lauren Dillon, Amy for Iowa State Director. "These endorsements, along with our support from Iowa State Representatives Ruth Ann Gaines and Marti Anderson and former IDP Chair Dr. Andy McGuire, are just another example of Senator Klobuchar's growing momentum in the state."
These endorsements come on the heels of Senator Klobuchar's most recent swing through Iowa where she "doubled down" on "differentiat[ing] herself from Trump" and was praised for "her ability to get things done."
Earlier this year, Senator Klobuchar earned the endorsements of Iowa Representatives Ruth Ann Gaines and Marti Anderson and former IDP Chair Dr. Andy McGuire.
