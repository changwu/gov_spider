    Arizona State Treasurer and Former CEO & Chairman of Cold Stone Creamery, Inc., Doug Ducey today made the following statement on the July employment report:
"Twenty-three million Americans are struggling for work and today's jobs report doesn't give them hope that there's light at the end of the tunnel. Through higher taxes and overregulation, President Obama has created a climate where job creators are hesitant to hire, and it's the American people who suffer. Governor Romney's Plan for a Stronger Middle Class, on the other hand, will create 12 million new jobs and restore America as the best place in the world to start and grow a business."
