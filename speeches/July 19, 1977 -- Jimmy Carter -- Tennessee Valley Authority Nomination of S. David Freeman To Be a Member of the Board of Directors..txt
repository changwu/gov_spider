    The President today announced his intention to nominate S. David Freeman of Bethesda, Md., to be a member of the board of directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority.
Freeman was born in Chattanooga, Tenn., on January 14, 1926, and earned a civil engineering degree from Georgia Institute of Technology and a law degree from the University of Tennessee.
From 1949 to 1954, he worked for the Tennessee Valley Authority as an engineer designing steam electric powerplants and hydroelectric stations. After time out for law school, he rejoined TVA in 1956 as an attorney, serving in that capacity for 5 years.
From 1961 to 1965, he was assistant to the Chairman of the Federal Power Commission, and from 1967 to 1971 he served in the President's Office on a Government-wide basis. From 1971 to 1976, Freeman was a special energy and resources consultant to the Senate Commerce Committee, serving also, from 1971 to 1974, as director of the Ford Foundation's Energy Policy Project.
Last year, Freeman worked in the Carter campaign and later in the Carter-Mondale transition. Since January he has been an assistant to Dr. James Schlesinger in the Energy Policy and Planning Office of the Executive Office of the President.
