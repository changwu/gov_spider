    Today, Nevada Speaker of the Assembly John Hambrick and University Regent Michael Wixom announced they have joined Governor John Kasich's presidential campaign as members of the Kasich for America leadership team.
Hambrick, who had previously endorsed Jeb Bush said, "Our country faces big challenges ahead. From our growing debt to emerging terror threats abroad, we need an experienced and proven leader that will put us back on track and keep America safe. The leader we can trust to get the job done is Gov. John Kasich."

John Hambrick is the former Chairman of the Clark County Republican Party. Elected to the Nevada Assembly in 2008, he is currently serving his first term as Speaker. Before entering public office in Nevada, Hambrick spent almost 30 years in federal law enforcement as a member of the Presidential Protection Detail for the United States Secret Service, as an agent for the Immigration and Naturalization Service and with the federal Inspector General's office.
Michael Wixom currently serves as Vice Chairman of the Board of Regents and as a member of the ad hoc Committee on Athletics. Wixom served two terms as Chairman of the Board and also as Chair of the Business and Finance Committee and Vice Chair of the Investment and Facilities Committee.
Responding to these key endorsements, John Kasich said, "I would like to thank Speaker Hambrick and Regent Wixom for their support. They are deeply respected leaders in their home state with remarkable records of public service. They will be an incredible asset to our team in Nevada."
