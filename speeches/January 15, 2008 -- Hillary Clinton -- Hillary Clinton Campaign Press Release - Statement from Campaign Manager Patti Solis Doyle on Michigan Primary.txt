    "Tonight Michigan Democrats spoke loudly for a new beginning. You spoke out for an economy that would honor the middle class, not punish it. You spoke out for a President who will fight to create good paying jobs at a time when so many families are struggling to make ends meet. You spoke out for an end to the war in Iraq. You spoke out for a quality, affordable health care system that works for all Americans.
"For that, we thank you.
"Your voices matter. And as President, Hillary Clinton will not only keep listening, but will make sure your voice is always heard."
