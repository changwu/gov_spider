    Colorado Attorney General John Suthers made the following statement on the Supreme Court decision on President Obama's healthcare law:
"The Supreme Court decision handed down today is a blow to federalism and to the people of Colorado, as a future of higher costs, fewer choices, and less control over healthcare is inevitable under the current healthcare plan. Obamacare forces the unique state of Colorado and its citizens into a 'one size fits all' approach and stifles innovation and personalized solutions. Our state is faced with a future of oppressive regulations instead of a system that allows its people and its local economy to flourish. But, hope is not lost. As Governor Romney has said many times, no matter what happens in court, we must dedicate ourselves to repealing this law, and he has promised to do just that, starting on day one of his administration. With Governor Romney's leadership, we can replace Obamacare with healthcare solutions that put the citizens of Colorado and their doctors in charge of their own healthcare solutions instead of relying on unelected bureaucrats in Washington."
