    Former Ambassador John Bolton today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's foreign policy speech:
"Mitt Romney understands that the best way to preserve international peace and security is for America to lead from the front.  President Obama believes that American strength is provocative, that we are too much in the world, and that a U.S. recessional is necessary and appropriate.  This is exactly opposite of what we need.  It is not our strength that is provocative, but our weakness, which our adversaries worldwide interpret to mean it is safe to challenge us. We need to reverse this dangerous American decline, and return to Ronald Reagan's philosophy of 'peace through strength.'  It has worked throughout our history, and it will work again under President Romney."
