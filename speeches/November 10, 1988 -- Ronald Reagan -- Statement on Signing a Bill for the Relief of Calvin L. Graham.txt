    I have today approved H.R. 610, "An Act for the relief of Calvin L. Graham." Mr. Graham is a veteran of Navy and Marine Corps service who has honorably served his country.
Section I of the Act provides that, for purposes of service-connected disability compensation, the dental injuries that Mr. Graham incurred in the Battle of Guadalcanal will be considered to be a permanent service-connected disability incurred in the line of duty. Section 1 also provides for reimbursement of Mr. Graham for costs he incurred for the treatment of those injuries.
Section 2 of the Act provides for a total lump-sum payment of $4,916.99 to Mr. Graham. That amount represents back pay, mustering-out pay, and interest. Section 2(b) of the Act provides that the payment of the $4,916.99 shall be in full satisfaction of any claim against the United States that Mr. Graham may have for basic pay for the period from September 17, 1942, through April 5, 1943, and for mustering-out pay with respect to his separation from service on April 5, 1943.
