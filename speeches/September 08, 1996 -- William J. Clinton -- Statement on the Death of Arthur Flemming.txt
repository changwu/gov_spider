    Arthur Flemming was a close friend to me and the First Lady. He was a wonderful human being and great public servant who thought of nothing more than the health and well being of his fellow Americans. He transcended party, generation, and race in search of consensus on some of the great issues of our day. The First Lady and I, and the country, will greatly miss him.
