Picking Winners or Losers.
Fellow Iowans,
I am so tired of hearing certain talking heads recount Iowa's history of not picking the candidate that ended up winning. They say things like: "Iowa picks losers..." - or - "Iowa picks corn, not presidents."
God help us if we fall for that mindless drivel based on the faulty premise that winning the election is the end goal. Since when did the ultimate winner of the election serve as proof positive of being "correct?" I thought the good of the nation was the end goal. Case and point: Just look at the condition of our nation and we can see that Obama is a loser, even though he won an election.
Who ultimately wins the nomination is not proof of who I should have supported. If that was the case, then I should have supported Mit Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008 for the nomination. Well, I did not and I am glad I didn't. Neither of those guys represented my values.
I'm not suggesting we always get it right. But I believe we Iowans have a pretty good record of picking winners while the rest of the process goes on to pick a loser to be the nominee? I believe that is exactly what happened in 2008 when Mike Huckabee won the Iowa Caucus and we ended up with John McCain as the nominee. I picked Mike Huckabee in 2008 and I am picking Mike again in 2016. Why? Because I already know he is a winner!
