    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME). AFSCME is the nation's largest public sector union, representing more than 1.4 million workers.
"As our President, Hillary Clinton will help rebuild America's middle class and make sure that everyone shares in our country's prosperity. She has a record of leadership, of bringing people together for more than 30 years. Hillary Clinton inspires our members. She sparks the flame we need to win," said AFSCME President Gerald W. McEntee.
McEntee said after 10 months of polling and interviewing members and scrutinizing candidates' records, Clinton stood out from the pack.
"We had the most talented and diverse field of Presidential candidates we've seen in years. But when all was said and done, among our members Hillary Clinton clearly emerged as the best candidate to take back the White House for America's working families," he said
AFSCME said it would activate a 40,000-member volunteer army to mobilize its members, and launch an unprecedented GOTV effort in Iowa, where it represents 30,000 workers.
"I am honored to receive the support of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees," Clinton said. "In my administration, America's working families will again have a partner in the White House."
Clinton has been endorsed by other leading national unions, including the American Federation of Teachers, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, National Association of Letter Carriers, International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers and the United Transportation Union.
