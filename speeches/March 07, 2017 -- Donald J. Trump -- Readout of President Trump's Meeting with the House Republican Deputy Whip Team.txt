    President Donald J. Trump welcomed the House Republican Deputy Whip Team to the East Room of the White House on Monday to discuss coordinated efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare.
Obamacare, the President noted, is collapsing. Insurers continue to flee the exchanges while premiums and deductibles skyrocket. He stressed the need to take action now to deliver on Republicans' long-standing promise to repeal the disastrous law and replace it with a system that adheres to principles he outlined in his recent address to a joint session of Congress.
House Majority Whip Steve Scalise thanked the President for following through on his promise to rescue people from the Obamacare disaster, and lauded last week's address, calling it "One of the best speeches I have heard from a President."
The group discussed strategy to ensure the healthcare bill passes the House and Senate. The President assured the Deputy Whip Team members that he has their back in their efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, and he reiterated his desire for Congress to move swiftly to deliver results for the American people.
The President said he plans to reconvene the group next week to continue working closely to pass this important bill.
