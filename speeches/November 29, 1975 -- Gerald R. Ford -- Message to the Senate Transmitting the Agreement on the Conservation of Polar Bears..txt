To the Senate of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit for the Senate's advice and consent to ratification the Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears, done at Oslo, November 15, 1973.
I am also transmitting, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the agreement.
This agreement, negotiated by the five circumpolar nations, the United States, Canada, Denmark, Norway and the Soviet Union, provides a plan of protection for polar bears consisting of a prohibition of hunting, killing or capturing the mammals subject to specified exceptions. It also provides for the countries involved to cooperate and consult with each other on research involving management and conservation of polar bears.
This agreement implements one of the mandates of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 which, in Section 108, calls for development of bilateral or multilateral agreements for the protection of marine mammals, including polar bears. No legislation is necessary to implement the agreement, since the protections of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 exceed the requirements of the agreement.
In addition to being the first international agreement to focus on the conservation of polar bears, this agreement is the first to be negotiated by the circumpolar nations exclusively. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this agreement.
