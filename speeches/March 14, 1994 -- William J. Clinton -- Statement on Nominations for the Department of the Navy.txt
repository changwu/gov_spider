    I am pleased to announce that I have nominated Admiral Jeremy M. Boorda to succeed Admiral Frank A. Kelso II as Chief of Naval Operations.
Admiral Boorda is currently serving as Commander in Chief, U.S. Naval Forces, Europe/ Commander in Chief, Allied Forces, Southern Europe where he is responsible for coordinating and planning NATO military actions over Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas.
Admiral Boorda brings to the job of Chief of Naval Operations a keen appreciation of operational requirements in the post-cold-war world and an outstanding ability to work with our allies in complex and challenging circumstances. He has distinguished himself as one of the foremost military leaders serving in the armed services today, and his counsel and guidance on the many national security issues facing our Nation will be of great value.
Admiral Boorda assumes the post of Chief of Naval Operations at an important time in the history of the United States Navy. I will depend on him to continue the progress that Admiral Kelso has made in restructuring the Navy to meet the new domestic and international security environments.
I have also nominated Vice Admiral Leighton W. Smith, Jr., U.S. Navy, to relieve Admiral Boorda and be promoted to the rank of admiral. As the former Director for Operations, U.S. European Command, and the current Deputy thorough understanding of NATO structure and Chief of Naval Operations, Plans, Policy and the requirements of the European theater of Operations, Vice Admiral Smith possesses a operations.
