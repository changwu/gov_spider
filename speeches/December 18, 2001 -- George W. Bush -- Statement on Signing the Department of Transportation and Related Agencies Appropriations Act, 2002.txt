    Today I have signed into law H.R. 2299, the "Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002."
I appreciate the bipartisan effort that has gone into producing this Act. The bill abides by the agreed upon aggregate funding level for Fiscal Year 2002 of $686 billion and supports several of my Administration's key initiatives with:

$140 million for border safety to ensure an open border for trade between the United States and Mexico through the establishment of an inspection and certification system that will ensure a high level of motor carrier safety;
$5 billion for Coast Guard operations and capital expenses, including $243 million to support expanded drug interdiction efforts as authorized in the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act;
$1.2 billion for the newly created Transportation Security Administration to enhance airport and aircraft security;
$32.8 billion for key highway infrastructure and safety initiatives in compliance with authorized levels;
$10.2 billion for aviation operations and airport improvement grants to expand safety, security, and capacity; and
$6.7 billion for mass transit grants and capital programs.

Several provisions in the bill purport to require congressional approval before executive branch execution of aspects of the bill. I will interpret such provisions to require notification only, since any other interpretation would contradict the Supreme Court ruling in INS v. Chadha.
