    I want to offer my deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those who were injured or killed in yesterday's train crash in London. This incident was particularly tragic because it happened in such an everyday setting, as commuters headed towards another day at work. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Americans who were among the injured and all the victims and their families.
