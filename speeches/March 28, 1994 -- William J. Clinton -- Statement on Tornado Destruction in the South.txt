    I was deeply saddened to learn of the severe losses incurred by people and communities across the South as a result of the tornadoes which swept the region this weekend. Hillary and I want to express our sympathy and offer our prayers for all of those affected by the storm's devastating power, particularly those families who have lost someone to the destruction.
I spoke to James Lee Witt, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, yesterday to get an update on the situation. I instructed him to report back to me after working with the affected States to assess the damage and evaluate appropriate actions.
