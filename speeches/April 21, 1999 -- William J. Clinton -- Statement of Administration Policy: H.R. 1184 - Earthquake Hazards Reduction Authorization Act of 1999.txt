    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Smith (R) MI and Morella (R) MD)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1184, which would authorize appropriations for earthquake preparedness and research activities under the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977, but will seek amendments to:

Conform the authorization levels to those recommended in the President's Fiscal Year 2000 Budget, which strikes a delicate balance among many critical programs; and


Narrow the scope of the Advanced National Seismic Research and Monitoring System to eliminate overlap with the duties of the U.S. Geological Survey's existing National Seismic Network.
