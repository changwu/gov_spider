FOR
EXTRAORDINARY HEROISM
The 37th Ranger Battalion and attached units distinguished themselves by extraordinary heroism in action against hostile forces in the Republic of Vietnam on 22 November 1965.
While the 37th Ranger Battalion and attached units were occupying a 2d Infantry Division outpost in the vicinity of Thach Tru, Quang Ngai Province, a Viet Cong force, estimated to be a reinforced regular regiment, supported by 75mm recoilless rifles and 81mm mortars, launched a predawn multi-pronged attack against the friendly positions. Although greatly outnumbered, the 37th Ranger Battalion and attached units, in an extraordinary display of gallantry, determination, and esprit de corps, were successful in driving back three communist human wave onslaughts. After suffering staggering casualties and heavy losses of weapons and equipment, the Viet Cong were forced to withdraw from the battlefield and abandon their operation.
The devotion to duty, perseverance, and extraordinary heroism demonstrated by the members of the 37th Ranger Battalion and attached units in defending their homeland are in the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon themselves and the Republic of Vietnam.
