    "Economic growth under President Obama is pitiful. Today's news that our economy grew at only 1.3 % last quarter is a clear signal that our nation needs new leadership. President Obama has failed to live up to his empty promises of spurring the economy and creating jobs. Rather than confronting our problems head on and developing a clear path to recovery, the President is hiding. It is impossible to find his specific plans on any of the most pressing financial issues of the day, including badly needed entitlement reforms. It is time to begin tackling these tough issues and making challenging decisions to restore our economic prosperity, but first we need a new leader with the courage to do so."
