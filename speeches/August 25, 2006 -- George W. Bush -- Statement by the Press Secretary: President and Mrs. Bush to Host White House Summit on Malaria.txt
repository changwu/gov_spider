    The President and Mrs. Bush will host a White House Summit on Malaria in December of 2006. The Office of the First Lady--in cooperation with the Office of the Malaria Coordinator at the U.S. Agency for International Development, other federal agencies, the Millennium Promise Alliance and other private partners--will bring together international experts, NGOs and faith-based and service organizations to discuss and highlight measures for controlling malaria, a completely preventable disease from which one child dies in Africa every 30 seconds.
On June 30, 2005, President Bush announced the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI). The $1.2 billion, five-year initiative aims to cut malaria-related deaths by 50 percent in 15 target countries in Africa.
The Summit will call on the private sector, foundations, voluntary organizations and school groups to complement the PMI by matching the U.S. Government's financial commitment and educating the public about malaria.
