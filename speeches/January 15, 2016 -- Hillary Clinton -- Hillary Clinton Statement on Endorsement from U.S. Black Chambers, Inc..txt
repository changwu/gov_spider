    Hillary Clinton released the following statement after earning the endorsement of the U.S. Black Chambers, Inc. The USBC is an association of more than 100 self-sustaining Black Chambers and small business associations nationwide and serves close to 250,000 small businesses.
"I am honored to have the support of the U.S. Black Chambers, Inc. which does important work supporting African-American entrepreneurs nationwide. They serve close to 250,000 small businesses, helping them with issues relating to professional development resources, business development, capital formation, government contracting and much more. That's important, because black-owned businesses are a vital source of jobs and prosperity for Americans of all races and backgrounds.
"As President, I'll make sure America's small businesses – including black-owned small businesses – get more support. I'll fight to cut red tape, improve access to capital, provide tax relief and increase access to new markets around the world. America works best when all its citizens get the chance to develop their talents and chase their dreams. That's what the U.S. Black Chambers strives every day to achieve. I'm thrilled to join them in their fight for fairness and opportunity for African-American entrepreneurs and families."
