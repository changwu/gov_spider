We don't want this kind of campaigning because it violates the spirit of our campaign. I want to become President because I am the best candidate, not because I attacked the other candidate," said Huckabee from the campaign trail in South Carolina.
National Campaign Manager Chip Saltsman agreed: "Anyone who has the slightest understanding of the race ahead and the mindset of voters would know this sort of activity is extremely counterproductive. It takes the campaign off message at a time when Governor Huckabee is resonating with voters here in South Carolina."
"We have enthusiastic, overflow crowds at each of our events. It loses votes rather than gains them. It's an underhanded way of doing business that is not welcomed by the campaign and it flies in the face of what Governor Huckabee stands for: integrity and clean politics. On behalf of Governor Huckabee and his campaign, I ask once again that these calls be stopped immediately," said Saltsman.
