To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith propose 13 new rescissions totalling $838.6 million in budget authority. In addition, I am reporting 18 new deferrals that total $253.2 million in budget authority and changes to one deferral previously transmitted that decrease the budget authority deferred by $4.1 million.
If we are to avoid excessive Federal spending, the kinds of actions I am proposing today are essential. I believe that both the legislative and executive branches must continually weigh the contribution made by each Federal program against the limited resources available. We must carefully assess new or expanded activities before they are implemented. To make room for necessary new spending, we must eliminate Federal spending for programs that are no longer needed, that duplicate other programs, or that can be financed from other sources.
The details of each rescission proposal and deferral are contained in the attached reports.
