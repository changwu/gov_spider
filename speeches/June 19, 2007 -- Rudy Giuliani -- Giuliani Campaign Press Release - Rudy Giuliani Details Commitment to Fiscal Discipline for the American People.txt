    In a speech in Des Moines today, Mayor Rudy Giuliani will continue to discuss his 12 Commitments to the American People by detailing his commitment to restore fiscal discipline and cut wasteful Washington spending.
The plan approaches budgeting like a business, demanding greater efficiency, transparency and accountability in government to ensure fiscal discipline. Giuliani will call for ending anonymous earmarking, requiring federal agencies to identify annual spending reductions and savings, and reducing the federal civilian workforce through attrition and retirement.
"If we are going to keep our economy moving in the right direction we need to change the way Washington works," Giuliani has said. "We must address the culture of spending and return to our core principles of fiscal discipline and fiscal responsibility. I commit to making the Federal government more efficient and accountable to the American people and cut irresponsible spending."
Restoring fiscal discipline and cutting wasteful Washington spending is one of Rudy's Twelve Commitments to the American People, his bold vision aimed at moving America forward. He will continue to travel the country this summer to detail each of his Twelve Commitments. For more about the Twelve Commitments, please click here.
