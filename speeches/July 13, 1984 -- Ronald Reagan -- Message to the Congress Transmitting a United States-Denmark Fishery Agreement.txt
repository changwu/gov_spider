    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith a governing international fishery agreement between the United States of the one part and Denmark and the Faroe Islands of the other part signed at Washington on June 11, 1984.
This agreement is one of a series to be renegotiated in accordance with that legislation to replace existing bilateral fishery agreements. I hereby commend this agreement to the Congress.
