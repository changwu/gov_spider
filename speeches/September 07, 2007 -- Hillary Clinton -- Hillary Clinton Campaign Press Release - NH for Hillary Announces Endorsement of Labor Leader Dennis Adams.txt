    MANCHESTER, NH - The New Hampshire for Hillary campaign today announced the support of New Hampshire AFL-CIO member, Dennis Adams. A resident of Deerfield, Adams will serve as a member of Labor Leaders for Hillary.
"As an advocate, First Lady, and United States Senator, Hillary Clinton has spent her life fighting for America's families," said Adams. "She has proven her ability to make change happen and will continue to do so when she becomes president."
Adams is the Director of Marketing for the New England Plumbers and Pipefitters union, Chair of the New Hampshire Youth Council and he also served as the president and treasurer of the NH Building Trades Union for 13 years.
"I am honored to have the support of Dennis Adams," said Senator Clinton. "I will look to him to help share my vision of restoring a strong, vibrant American middle class, with his friends and neighbors across New Hampshire."
Last week, Senator Clinton received the endorsement of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace workers (IAM). The IAM will launch a massive education campaign among IAM members and extensive publicity in union publications and websites nationwide. Twenty-five states with over 450,000 active and retired IAM members, including 743 in New Hampshire, will vote in the three weeks starting with the Iowa caucuses and ending with the polls closing in California on February 5th. The United Transportation Union and its 125,000 active and retired members also endorsed Clinton last week.
