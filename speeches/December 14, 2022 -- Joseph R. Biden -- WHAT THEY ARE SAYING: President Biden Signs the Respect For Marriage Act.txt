    Yesterday, President Biden signed the historic, bipartisan Respect for Marriage Act into law at a celebration on the White House South Lawn. He was joined by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, as well as advocates, LGBTQI+ families, faith leaders, and plaintiffs in marriage equality cases across the country.
In May 2012, then-Vice President Biden made history when he said: "This is all about a simple proposition. Who do you love? Who do you love and will you be loyal to the person you love?"
The Respect for Marriage Act helps ensure that proposition is fully realized in the United States. It builds on generations of civil rights advocacy to bring stability and security to millions of LGBTQI+ and interracial couples who will finally be guaranteed the rights and protections to which they and their children are entitled.
See below for what they're saying about the historic event: 
Members of Congress:
Speaker of the House, California Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi: "I joined @POTUS, @VP, and @SenSchumer at the @WhiteHouse for a signing ceremony for the Respect for Marriage Act, a landmark victory in the fight for full equality – enshrining the foundational right to marry the person you love into the law of the land."

I was proud to join House Democrats in passing this bill twice, and I am grateful to the thirty-nine House Republicans and twelve Republican Senators who joined us in supporting this crucial legislation. "It is unacceptable that the Supreme Court put this basic right in jeopardy in the first place with its radical Dobbs v. Jackson decision. Like so many others throughout America, I'm relieved we were able to secure these protections for marriage equality. House Democrats will not rest, however, until Congress establishes similar protections for the other basic freedoms, rights, and liberties cherished by the American people." [Statement, 12/13/22]
