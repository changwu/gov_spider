    Orlando, FL – Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee announced the endorsements of several state and national members of the faith community at a news conference in Orlando, Fla on Saturday morning. This show of support adds to a growing list of those who stand behind Huckabee and his pro-life, pro-family message.
"I'm proud to see such an impressive list of people who are joining together to support my campaign," Huckabee said. "I have known some of these people for many years and they know who I am and what I stand for. I'm anxious for them to share my message with people they know across Florida and across this country."
"A year ago several leaders set out to build a consensus about who is best candidate to stand for conservative pro-life and pro-family values, we are proud to announce that a consensus has been reached , not only around the country, but specifically in Florida," said John Stemberger of Florida Family Action.* "For conservative pro-family voters Huckabee is our man!"
More than 20 state and national faith leaders joined together in their support of Huckabee, all saying they believe he is the right person not only to lead this country, but to lift people up to a better place.
"When the delegation representatives of America's largest voting bloc resoundingly chose Governor Huckabee at the Values Voter Presidential Debate, I knew he was going to be the nominee," said Janet Folger, founder of Faith2Action.* "I support Governor Huckabee because he is the only candidate who supports the Human Life Amendment and the Marriage Protection Amendment."
"I have known Governor Huckabee for 32 years and have found him to consistently represent the biblical values that we can all hold dear," said David Uth, Pastor of First Baptist of Orlando.*
