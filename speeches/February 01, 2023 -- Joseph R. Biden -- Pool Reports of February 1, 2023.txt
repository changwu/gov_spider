"The president and I had a good first meeting."
"The greatest threat to America is our debt."
"We've got a lot of revenue. We just have a spending problem."
"I've just walked out having an hour conversation with this president that I tell you in perspective was a good conversation. No agreements, no promises except we will continue this conversation."
"The Republicans are very united" [in wanting to curb spending]...But we're all Americans. And we all have to work together.
