(Senate)
(Sen. Reid, D-NV, and Sen. McConnell, R-KY)
The Administration strongly supports the enactment of S.1038, which reauthorizes through June 1, 2015, three critical authorities that our Nation's intelligence and law enforcement agencies need to protect our national security. These authorities, which expire after May 26, 2011 absent extension, are: (1) section 206 of the USA PATRIOT Act, which provides authority for roving surveillance of targets who take steps that may thwart Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) surveillance; (2) section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, which provides authority to compel production of business records and other tangible things with the approval of the FISA court; and (3) section 6001 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, which provides authority under FISA to target non-U.S. persons who engage in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor, but are not necessarily associated with an identified terrorist group (the so-called "lone wolf" provision). It is essential to avoid any hiatus in these critical authorities.
