    I commend the Senate for confirming Rob Portman as Director of the Office of Management and Budget. In this key position, Rob will have a leading role on my economic team and will help ensure that the Government spends the taxpayers' money wisely, or not at all. In addition, Rob will be in charge of implementing my goal of cutting the budget deficit in half by 2009 while funding our priorities. The American people deserve results for every hard-earned dollar they send to Washington. Rob is a man of character and will perform his duties with dedication and integrity. I congratulate Rob and his family on today's confirmation and thank him for his continued service to our Nation.
