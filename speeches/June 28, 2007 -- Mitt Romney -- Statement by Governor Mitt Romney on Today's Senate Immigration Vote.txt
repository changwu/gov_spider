Boston, MA - Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement on the United States Senate's vote on the immigration reform bill:
"The immigration bill failed because the politicians in Washington are out of touch with the American people. The voice of the people is loud and clear - secure the border, enforce the law and no special deal for permanent residency or citizenship for illegals. America will always welcome legal immigration, but as a nation we also insist on the rule of law."
