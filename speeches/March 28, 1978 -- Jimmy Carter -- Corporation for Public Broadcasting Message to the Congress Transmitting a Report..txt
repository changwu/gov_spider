    To the Congress of the United States:
Enclosed is the "Annual Report of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for FY 1977," prepared in accordance with the requirement of Section 396(i) of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 (Public Law 90-129) as amended.
The Corporation has again prepared a thoughtful report which highlights its efforts for the past fiscal year. The accomplishments of public broadcasting are well articulated with emphasis on television and radio programming, technological innovation, and human development services.
It should be noted that the projections of long range Federal financial contributions from the Federal Government exceed levels contained in the Administration's legislative proposal to reauthorize the Corporation for the period FY 1981-85.
The Annual Report is being forwarded so that it is available to the Congress for its deliberations.
