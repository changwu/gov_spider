    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
AS SENT TO THE HILL ON 10/21/87
(House)(Rodino (D) New Jersey and six others)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2939. The bill does not comport with constitutional requirements and is otherwise objectionable for the reasons stated by the Department of Justice in its letter of August 31, 1987, to the House Judiciary Committee. If presented to the President in its current form, the Department of Justice and the Office of Management and Budget would recommend a veto of the bill.
