    President Bush met with UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] leader Dr. Jonas Savimbi for approximately 30 minutes in the Oval Office this morning. Dr. Savimbi is in the United States on a private visit. He has met with President Bush several times during the last administration.
President Bush used the occasion of today's visit to stress the United States continued support for UNITA and the goal of national reconciliation in Angola.
The President urged Dr. Savimbi to work with President Mobutu and others in the region to foster the peace process. He noted our longstanding support for a cease-fire and face-to-face negotiations, and ultimately, free and fair elections.
