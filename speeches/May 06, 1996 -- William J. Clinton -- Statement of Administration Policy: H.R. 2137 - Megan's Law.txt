    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICYThis Statement Has Been Coordinated by OMB with the Appropriate Agencies
(House)(Zimmer (R) New Jersey and 26 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 2137 and urges House passage of this legislation.
The Administration has a long standing commitment to ensuring the safety of families and protecting them from child molesters and sexually violent offenders. H.R. 2137 builds on the Administration's already strong record in this area as evidenced by the 1994 Crime Act. H.R. 2137 will require States to make public relevant information about child molesters and sexually violent offenders that are released from prison or placed on parole. This information includes the address where the offender is expected to reside.
