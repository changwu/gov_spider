Senator Kamala Harris's presidential campaign raised $11.6 million in the third quarter of 2019 and has nearly $10 million cash on hand as she enters the final four-month stretch before the Iowa caucuses. Her campaign recently announced a series of major investments to expand its organization in Iowa and South Carolina. It plans to double its number of organizers in Iowa in October and double its number of organizers in South Carolina by the end of November.
"This is a campaign that is growing, expanding, and built to win this primary," said Harris Campaign Manager Juan Rodriguez. "As we have spent the summer months strengthening our infrastructure, we enter this final stretch of 2019 with ample resources to execute a winning game plan. With hundreds of organizers and staff in the early states and Super Tuesday California, we are ready to harness the energy of our thousands of grassroots volunteers to phone bank, knock doors and turn out the vote for Kamala in these 2020 contests."
The campaign's average contribution in the third quarter was $34, and the average online contribution was just $20. Harris has raised $35.5 million overall in this campaign, from more than 850,000 individual contributions. She raised $12 million in the first quarter and $11.8 million in the second quarter.
