Americans are working harder than ever—but while corporate profits are on the rise, paychecks have barely budged in the last two decades. Meanwhile, the average CEO at some of America's biggest companies earns more than 200 times more than the median worker. As president, Hillary Clinton will make it her mission to change that.
She'll go to bat for workers, and go toe-to-toe with corporations on their behalf.
At a major economic speech in Detroit, she put corporate CEOs on notice.


She didn't hesitate to name names.
She made an example of Nabisco, which took tax breaks from the state of Illinois and then announced it would outsource production to Mexico and lay off 600 Chicago workers.

She also took Johnson Controls to task for benefiting from a government bailout and then using a loophole to avoid paying its fair share of U.S. taxes.

These are just two examples of companies that game the system to increase profits—and for too long, American taxpayers and workers have picked up the slack.
Hillary will end the loopholes that reward companies for moving overseas—and she'll make companies that export jobs give back the tax breaks they've received in America.
Instead, she'll reward companies that are doing right by their employees, providing tax incentives for businesses that offer high-quality training and share profits with their workers.

Because more money in the pockets of hardworking Americans is good for businesses—and our economy.
