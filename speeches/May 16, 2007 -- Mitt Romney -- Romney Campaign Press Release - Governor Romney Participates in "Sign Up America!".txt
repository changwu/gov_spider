Boston, MA – After nearly 1,000 Debate Watch House Parties, "Sign Up America!" continues today with a national call day to sign up 24,000 new supporters from across the country in just 24 hours. Well on the way to achieving this goal, Governor Romney addressed "Sign Up America!" call day participants at Romney for President National Headquarters:
Governor Romney: "Wow, this group has been working today. We keep doing unusual things. This is a political rally. This is a 21st century political rally. You see, in the past when they had political rallies they came together on the town green and you got as big a crowd as you could get – 100, 200, 1,000 people. And we decided to take it into the 21st century. Instead of just having it in a town, we have it in the entire country. And we would connect ourselves by Internet and as a result of that we've got folks all over the country holding parts of this rally and calling friends."
