    Earns high rating of government waste watchdog
LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” The Ron Paul 2012 campaign announced today that the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW) has named Congressman Paul a 'Taxpayer Hero' for the second session of the 111thCongress.
"This comes as no surprise as Dr. Paul's strong record of fiscal conservatism has earned him the nickname 'The Taxpayer's Best Friend," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
"Dr. Paul has a strong commitment to representing the interests of taxpayers, a commitment that will only continue as President," said Mr. Benton.
Today's announcement marks the fourth time in as many years that the CCAGW recognized Dr. Paul as a "Taxpayer Hero" in addition to the lifetime "Taxpayer Hero" rating the CCAGW has given him. Dr. Paul received an impressive 98 percent rating in the CCAGW's 2010 Congressional Ratings.
