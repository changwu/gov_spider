    President Bush has called for all states to join a sustained worldwide coalition to defeat global terrorism. APEC Leaders responded with a statement that unequivocally condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in the United States. The statement, a significant show of unity by economies that account for 60 percent of the world's GDP and one quarter of the world's Muslim population:
-- Commits Leaders to "strengthen international cooperation at all levels in combating terrorism" and "to bring the perpetrators to justice";
-- Declares terrorist acts "committed wherever, whenever, and by whosoever are a profound threat to the peace, prosperity and security of all people, of all faiths, of all nations" -- the same language used in the G-8 statement on counterterrorism; and
-- Proclaims terrorism "a direct challenge to APEC's vision of free, open, and prosperous economies".
Commitment to Implement UN Resolutions and Conventions
The Leaders' Statement calls on the APEC economies to implement immediately all relevant UN resolutions and conventions. Specifically, Leaders:
-- Commit to "prevent and suppress all forms of terrorist acts in the future in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and other international law".
-- Pledge to implement "faithfully and immediately" UN Security Council Resolutions 1368 and 1373. Both resolutions reaffirm the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense in the Charter of the United Nations. As UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has noted, the "military action in Afghanistan" is set "in that context". Resolution 1373 aims to stop the flow of financing to terrorists and terrorist groups, such as al- Qaida, by freezing the funds of terrorists and those who assist them.
-- Call for "early signing and ratification of all basic universal anti-terrorist conventions, including the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism."
Specific Actions
Leaders also agreed in the Statement to enhance counterterrorism efforts across the range of areas in which APEC pursues cooperation:
-- Stopping Terrorism Financing: Leaders agreed to take appropriate measures to prevent the flow of funds to terrorists, including accelerating work on combating financial crimes through the APEC Finance Ministers' Working Group on Fighting Financial Crime and increasing involvement in related international standard-setting bodies.
-- Transportation Security: Leaders pledged to adhere to "relevant international requirements for the security of air and maritime transport" and called on Transport Ministers to work together to enhance airport, aircraft, and port security.
-- Energy Security: Leaders agreed to strengthen energy security by examining measures to respond to temporary supply disruptions and longer-term challenges facing the region's energy supply.
-- Critical Infrastructure: Leaders agreed to strengthen activities in the area of critical infrastructure protection, including telecommunications, transportation, health, and energy.
-- Border Controls: Leaders agreed to develop a global integrated electronic customs network and electronic movement records to enhance security while ensuring trade and legitimate travel are not disrupted.
-- Capacity Building: Leaders pledged to strengthen economic and technical cooperation to enable member economies to put in place and enforce effective counterterrorism measures.
-- Economic Cooperation: Leaders also pledged close cooperation to limit the economic fallout from the attacks by taking measures to spur growth and ensure a stable environment for trade, investment, travel, and tourism.
