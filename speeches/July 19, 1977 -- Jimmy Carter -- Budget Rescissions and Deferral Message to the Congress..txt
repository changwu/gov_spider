    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith propose two new rescissions totalling $96.1 million in budget authority and report one new deferral of $12.5 million in budget authority.
The rescission proposals pertain to the foreign military credit sales program and the General Services Administration's Federal Buildings Fund. The new deferral relates to the Department of Defense, Uniform Services University of the Health Sciences.
I urge the Congress to act favorably on the rescission proposals.
