    I welcome the visit of African Union Chairman John Kufuor to Nairobi to help facilitate a dialogue to resolve Kenya's political crisis. I condemn the use of violence as a political tool and appeal to both sides to engage in peaceful dialogue aimed at finding a lasting political solution. The Government of Kenya has acknowledged that voting irregularities have occurred, and the Orange Democratic Movement has pledged to refrain from further protests that could detract from reconciliation efforts. I now urge both sides to enter this dialogue in good faith to earn back the trust of the Kenyan people, who deserve a political process that reflects their dedication to democracy. I remain heartened by the voices of peace that have emerged through Kenya's robust media and civil society. The United States supports their efforts to continue to hold their political leaders to account.
