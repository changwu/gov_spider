    Tomorrow, President Donald J. Trump will welcome President Uhuru Kenyatta of the Republic of Kenya back to the White House. Kenya continues to be a vital partner to the United States in Africa and beyond. Since President Kenyatta's August 2018 visit, when the two leaders established the United States-Kenya Bilateral Strategic Dialogue, we have expanded our partnership across many areas. President Trump looks forward to building on this momentum and discussing new opportunities to advance cooperation and trade.
