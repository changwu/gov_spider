My dear Mr. Lampson:
I am deeply interested to learn of your praiseworthy efforts to erect suitable memorials at Jefferson, Ohio, to Joshua Reed Giddings and B. F. Wade, who played so large a part in the founding of the Republican Party, and to my dear friend, the late Senator Theodore E. Burton, whose life was a noble pattern of the high-minded public servant. I wish you support and success.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. E. C. Lampson, Editor, The Jefferson Gazette, Jefferson, Ohio]
