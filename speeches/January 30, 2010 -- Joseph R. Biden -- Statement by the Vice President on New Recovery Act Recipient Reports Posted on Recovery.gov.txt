    Washington, DC – As mandated by statute, the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board today posted on Recovery.gov quarterly reports required from some recipients of Recovery Act funding. The recipient reports provide more detailed information about a portion of Recovery Act activity during the fourth quarter of 2009. The Vice President issued the following statement:
The recipients reporting on this $54 billion portion of the Recovery Act – which represents less than one-fifth of Recovery spending and tax relief last year – tell us they funded about 600,000 workers last quarter with Recovery dollars. These reports, which provide a snapshot of the impact of a small portion of funds, are yet another indication that the Recovery Act is on-track to create or save 3.5 million jobs by the end of 2010.
Because of this unprecedented transparency effort, the American people are getting a look at some of the ways Recovery dollars are benefiting their neighborhoods and communities directly from the recipients themselves. Since this is a partial survey based on reports filed by recipients, we know it's not perfect or complete – but it is providing a level of detail about a government program that has never before been made available to the public.
