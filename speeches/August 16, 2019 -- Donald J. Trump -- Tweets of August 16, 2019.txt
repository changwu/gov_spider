Israel was very respectful & nice to Rep. Rashida Tlaib allowing her permission to visit her 'grandmother.' As soon as she was granted permission she grandstanded & loudly proclaimed she would not visit Israel. Could this possibly have been a setup? Israel acted appropriately!Retweets: 25515Favorites: 111891

Rep. Tlaib wrote a letter to Israeli officials desperately wanting to visit her grandmother. Permission was quickly granted whereupon Tlaib obnoxiously turned the approval down a complete setup. The only real winner here is Tlaib's grandmother. She doesn't have to see her now!Retweets: 45041Favorites: 201885
