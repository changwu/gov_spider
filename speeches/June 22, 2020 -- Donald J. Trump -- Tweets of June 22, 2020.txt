Our Coronavirus testing is so much greater (25 million tests) and so much more advanced, that it makes us look like we have more cases, especially proportionally, than other countries. My message on that is very clear!Retweets: 25554Favorites: 135851

I gave John Bolton, who was incapable of being Senate confirmed because he was considered a wacko, and was not liked, a chance. I always like hearing differing points of view. He turned out to be grossly incompetent, and a liar. See judge's opinion. CLASSIFIED INFORMATION!!!Retweets: 27585Favorites: 115937

Because of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, 2020 will be the most RIGGED Election in our nations history - unless this stupidity is ended. We voted during World War One & World War Two with no problem, but now they are using Covid in order to cheat by using Mail-Ins!Retweets: 45505Favorites: 167062

Unlike the radical left, I will ALWAYS stand against socialism and with the people of Venezuela. My Admin has always stood on the side of FREEDOM and LIBERTY and against the oppressive Maduro regime! I would only meet with Maduro to discuss one thing: a peaceful exit from power!Retweets: 49925Favorites: 184009

If people can go out and protest, riot, break into stores, and create all sorts of havoc, they can also go out and VOTE — and keep our Election Honest. With millions of mail-in ballots being sent out, who knows where they are going, and to whom?Retweets: 61534Favorites: 245819

Could somebody please explain to reporter Doug Mckelway of @FoxNews that the Border Wall has long been under construction, the battle (war) is won, the Dems have FINALLY given in. In fact, I will be in Arizona tomorrow to celebrate the 212th plus mile of completion. @BretBaierRetweets: 25379Favorites: 98139


June 22, 202022:50:28
Rather hard to believe that @FoxNews didn't know that the Border Wall is well under construction, fully financed, & already over 200 miles long? Will soon be finished! They just reported that "it is something that Dems are unlikely to budge on in this election year". @BretBaierRetweets: 19925Favorites: 73660

WOW! The Trump Rally gives @FoxNews the "LARGEST SATURDAY NIGHT AUDIENCE IN ITS HUSTORY". Isn't it amazing that virtually nobody in the Lamestream Media is reporting this rather major feat!Retweets: 36627Favorites: 159638
