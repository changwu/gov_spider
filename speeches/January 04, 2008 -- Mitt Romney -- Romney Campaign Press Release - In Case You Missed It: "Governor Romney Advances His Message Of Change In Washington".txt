CBS' "Early Show"
January 4, 2008
Governor Romney: "Well, you know, I think the race in Iowa was really a very clear call that people want change in Washington, not in the White House, in Washington. It was a very disappointing night for John McCain, who came in fourth despite the support of the Des Moines Register, a very disappointing night from Hillary Clinton. For those people who are Washington insiders, Iowa said no. And I think you're going to find America saying, 'You know what, we want to change Washington, and that's only going to be possible with somebody who comes from outside Washington.' So, my message will be about changing Washington, getting the major problems we have solved rather than having Washington insiders just change the chairs around."
