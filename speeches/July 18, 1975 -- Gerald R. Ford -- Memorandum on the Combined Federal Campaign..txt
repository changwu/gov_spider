    Memorandum for Federal Employees and Military Personnel
The Combined Federal Campaign presents an excellent opportunity for Federal employees and military personnel to demonstrate their traditional generosity, concern and compassion for their fellow citizens.
Many of our citizens and our friends abroad are in need of help. This year the need is greater than ever before. Through the United Way, the National Health Agencies, and the International Service Agencies, we can serve our youth, the aged, the handicapped, the sick, families in need, and refugees--but only if we provide the resources to enable these agencies to carry out their important work. While individually we cannot help all those in need, working together through the voluntary charitable organizations we can channel our concern into meaningful results.
Voluntary charitable organizations are beacons of hope to families and individuals in distress. They deserve the help we can provide through the Combined Federal Campaign. By our participation in the campaign, we can ensure that help is brought quickly and effectively, wherever it is needed.
While the amount you give is a personal, voluntary decision, I hope that each of you will join me in supporting the Combined Federal Campaign to the fullest extent possible.
