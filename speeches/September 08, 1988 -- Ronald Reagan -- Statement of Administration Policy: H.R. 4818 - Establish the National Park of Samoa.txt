    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Vento (D) Minnesota and 7 others)
The National Park Service has just completed an in-depth field study regarding the feasibility of establishing a park in American Samoa. Until this study is reviewed by the Department of the Interior and an Administration position is established, congressional action on H.R. 4818 would be premature, and, accordingly, the Administration opposes H.R. 4818. Moreover, it is the policy of the Administration to place a higher priority on funding the operation and maintenance of existing park units than on establishing new units, except in the most extraordinary circumstances.
