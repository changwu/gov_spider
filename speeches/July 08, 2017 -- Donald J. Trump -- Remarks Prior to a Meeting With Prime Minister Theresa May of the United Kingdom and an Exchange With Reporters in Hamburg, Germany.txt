    Prime Minister May. Can I say it's great to have an opportunity, Mr. President, to talk to you again and to continue to build on the special relationship we have with the United States?
President Trump. Yes. Thank you.
Prime Minister May. Looking forward to doing that, particularly, obviously, in the area of trade as—and our talks are beginning very positively in that area. But there's a lot of other big international issues for us to talk about——
President Trump. That's right. That's right.
Prime Minister May. ——today: on counterterrorism, on tensions in the Middle East. I think there's a great deal that we can work on together.
President Trump. Yes, that's right. Well, we've had a great, great group of people together and really done a fantastic job together.
I'd like to thank Prime Minister May for being with us. We've had tremendous talks. There is no country that could possibly be closer than our countries. And for a long time. And I just want to say thank you very much. We are working on a trade deal, which will be a very, very big deal, very powerful deal. Great for both countries. And I think we'll have that done very, very quickly. We have all of our trade people. We have Wilbur Ross with us. We have all of the trade people.
Rex and I had a tremendous meeting yesterday with President Putin, and we've had really great meetings with a lot of people. We're having a lot today. But Prime Minister May and I have developed a very special relationship, and I think trade will be a very big factor between our two countries. I want to thank you very much.
Prime Minister May. Well, thank you.
