    I am saddened by the untimely death yesterday of Representative Goodloe E. Byron.
Representative Byron was unusually close to the people of his district; he was never too busy to act as their friend and advocate in their dealings with the Federal Government.
He introduced the legislation which created the Monocacy Battlefield National Park, and he further expressed his love of the outdoors by sponsorship of the legislation I signed in March which protects and preserves for all time the Appalachian Trail.
The delight of many thousands of tourists and hikers will be his best memorial.
Mrs. Carter and I extend our deepest sympathy to Representative Byron's family.
