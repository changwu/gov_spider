    I send my warmest greetings to all who are celebrating Cinco de Mayo.
Today's celebration is usually filled with joyous gatherings of families and friends rejoicing in a unique part of Mexico's rich history. Although this year's celebration may not include the usual festivities and parades, the holiday's underlying story of perseverance and resilience is as relevant as ever. On this day 158 years ago, the Mexican army mounted a monumental defense of freedom, defeating imperialist French forces in the Battle of Puebla. The battle reminds us that great challenges and hardships can be overcome by unwavering resolve and a determined spirit.
Melania joins me in recognizing the Mexican American community for its numerous exceptional contributions to our country, particularly today with so many Americans of Mexican descent serving on the frontlines in our fight against the coronavirus.
Â¡Feliz Cinco de Mayo!
