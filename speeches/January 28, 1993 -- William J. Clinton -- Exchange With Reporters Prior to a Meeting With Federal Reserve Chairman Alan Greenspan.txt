    Q. Mr. President, what's the principle you're fighting for in sticking with your plan not to ban gays in the military? What's the principle that you believe in that makes you want to stick with that?
The President. I came here to talk about the economy today with Mr. Greenspan. If he wants to express his opinion on that subject, I'll be glad to hear it. Most people with whom I talk, except you folks, never discuss that. We have other things we're trying to deal with.
Q. Sir, there was good news about the economyâ€”[inaudible]
The President. I think that there's a lot of response to the efforts we're making now, but there's also a lot of troubling news about lost jobs. And we've got a lot of work to do, a lot of work to do.
