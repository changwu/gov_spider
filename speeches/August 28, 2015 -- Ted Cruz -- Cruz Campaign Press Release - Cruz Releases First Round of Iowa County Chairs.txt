    HOUSTON, Texas — Following the recent publication of the second round of Statewide Leadership Team members, the Cruz for President Campaign today released its first round of Iowa County Chairs.
"Our Iowa team continues to demonstrate the strength and diversity of support we are seeing in Iowa and across the country," said Sen. Cruz. "I'm encouraged by the fact that, as this first round of county chairs indicates, our team is made up of both seasoned veterans and energetic newcomers to the political process."
Today's release gives a first look at the county level organization being built by the Cruz campaign in Iowa. "Ted Cruz is a candidate with broad appeal who has an ability to bring together volunteers and activists from all corners of the Republican and conservative base," said State Director Bryan English. "Within the Cruz campaign, we are witnessing a coalescing of Iowans from Christians to Libertarians, from farmers to educators, and from those who are concerned about national security and the economy."
To date, the Cruz campaign in Iowa has released two rounds of names of those serving on the Statewide Leadership Team. Today's release brings the total number of Iowa Leadership Team members to 113 including the Statewide Leadership Team, County Chairs, and Co-Chairs.
Speaking to the growing list of leaders publicly committing to the campaign, Cruz said, "I am encouraged to see our grassroots team building strength in all of the early states, and our Iowa team continues to lead the way as the Leadership Team and County Chairs are organizing the state right down to the precinct level."
