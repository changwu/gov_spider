    THE PRESIDENT deeply regrets the failure of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to act favorably on the nomination of Ambassador Godley for the position of Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.
It is deplorable that this distinguished Foreign Service officer should be penalized for faithfully carrying out the policies of his Government, which were not set by him. The consequences of this committee action go far beyond the injustice done to an outstanding Foreign Service officer. It is not in the interest of the Foreign Service or the United States that career officers become subject to retribution for diligent execution of their instructions.
