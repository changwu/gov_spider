Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 506(a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2318(a)(1) (the "Act"), I hereby determine that:
(1) an unforeseen emergency exists which requires immediate military assistance to a foreign country or international organization; and
