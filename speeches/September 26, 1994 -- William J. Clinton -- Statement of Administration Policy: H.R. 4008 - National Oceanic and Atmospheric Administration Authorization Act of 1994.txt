    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Ortiz (D) Texas and 7 others)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 4008 with amendments, including amendments to:

Delete the restrictions on contracting for modernization of the NOAA fleet; to delete the cap on the amount that can be spent for repairs and maintenance of ships; and to delete the requirement for funding for non-NOAA vessels (Section 409)  . These limitations would interfere with NOAA's fleet modernization plan.   
Delete Title VI which would statutorily establish a National Undersea Research Program (NURP). The Title is overly prescriptive and would interfere with the Department's ability to administer the program.   
Provide for the National Research Council, instead of the Council's Marine Board, to study the NOAA Corps (Section 410)  . The Council is the appropriate entity to review the broad mission of the Corps. 

Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 4008 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary PAYGO estimate is that H.R. 4008 would increase direct spending by about $1 million per year. Final scoring of this legislation may differ from this estimate.
