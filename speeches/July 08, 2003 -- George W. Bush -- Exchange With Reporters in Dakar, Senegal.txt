    Liberia
Q. Can we ask you about Liberia, sir?
The President. We had a good discussion about Liberia.
Q. Have you made a decision?
The President. The President of Ghana is the leader of ECOWAS. I told him we'd participate with ECOWAS. We're now in the process to determine the extent of our participation. And I really appreciate the President's leadership on this issue. Charles Taylor must leave. The United Nations is going to be involved. The United States will work with ECOWAS. The leaders of ECOWAS were at the table, all of whom are concerned about Liberia, as are we, and are concerned about a peaceful western Africa.
Q. Does that mean you'll send troops?
The President. We're in the process of determining what is necessary to maintain the cease-fire and to allow for a peaceful transfer of power. We're working very closely with ECOWAS. The President of ECOWAS is with us today, the President of Ghana. He and I had a good discussion. I assured him we'll participate in the process. And we're now in the process of determining what that means.
Q. Do you have to wait until Mr. Taylor is gone?
The President. We're in the process of determining what that means.
