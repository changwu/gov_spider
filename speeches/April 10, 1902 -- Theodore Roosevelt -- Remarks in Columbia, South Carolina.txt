    Ladies and gentlemen:
I thank you must heartily for your courtesy in coming forward to greet me this afternoon and it is only one of the expressions of the invariable courtesy with which I have enjoyed every moment of the three days I have been down here. I think I was a pretty good American when I came down, and I am a better American as I leave your borders, and let me in closing ask of you now to support to the best of your ability the Exposition in Charleston, and I ask that not only of you, but of all the people in the Union. It is a great tribute to the energy, the forethought, the business enterprise of the people of Charleston that they should have planned and have built so really beautiful an Exposition, and they deserve all the help they can possibly have for it, and I wish them well, and I wish you well, and I thank you for the way you have treated me.
