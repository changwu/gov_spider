    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on Mother's Day:
"On Mother's Day, I've been giving Ann lilacs every year since our first son was born. She has written so movingly about this tradition and what it means to be a mother in USA Today. As a husband, a father, a grandfather, and a son, I have had many wonderful women influence my life. When all is said and done, there's nothing more important than our families. I've been blessed with a wonderful one."
