    Each year at this time we pause to remember those law enforcement officers who gave their lives in the line of duty.
The job of police officers is perhaps the most difficult and challenging one of all in our free society. They must protect society from those who would violate its laws, while scrupulously observing the rights of everyone.
All too often, these disciplined and courageous men and women give their lives to the cause of justice. As we pause to remember and reflect upon those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for the good of their fellow citizens, let us pray that no more names are added to the list.
All Americans are thankful that there are those willing to risk injury and death so that the rest of us can live in a nation of greater safety and security. It is our responsibility to continue to strive for a society which will lessen the risks of such tasks. For we are committed to a vision of justice that will ensure that those who have been lost will not have died in vain.
