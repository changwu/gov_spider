    Let me say a couple of words. I know you're anxiously awaiting them. First, it's great to be back in Texas. I'm proud to be here with my friend the Governor and Congressman Green.
Before I talk about service, I want to say something about Karachi. We fight an enemy that are radical killers; that's what they are. You know, they claim they're religious people, and they blow up Muslims. They have no regard for individual life.
Our hearts go out to the—our citizens and those affected by the bombings that took place. Our prayers are with their families, are with the families of the people in Pakistan as well.
But these people, if they think they're going to intimidate the United States, they do not understand the United States of America. And we will continue to hunt them down and seek justice.
Secondly, as we make America more secure, we've got to make it a better place. Today is Flag Day. We can talk about patriotism, but a true patriot is one not only who salutes the flag, but a true patriot is one who serves the community in which they live.
So I want to thank AAMA for its great work in Houston and now, I understand, the valley. I want to thank the visionaries who put together this charter school. I want to thank AmeriCorps for being a part of the after-school program. I want to thank the mentors for understanding that out of evil done to America and out of the evil continuing to be done to others around the world can come some incredible good. And the good that can happen is, children can realize the great American Dream—start right here, learn to read, go to college, and can succeed in America; that where there may be hopelessness and despair, love and compassion will overcome it.
And so I want to thank you all for letting me come by. Thank you for reading so well, and see you in college.
