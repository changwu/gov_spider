    AURORA, CO — Colorado State Representative Tom Sullivan today announced his support of Democratic Presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg praising Bloomberg's track record on gun violence prevention. In a statement, Sullivan said:
"This issue of gun safety is not just political, it's deeply personal for me and my family, as we work tirelessly to honor the memory of our son and other communities ravaged by gun violence. Mike Bloomberg is not just talking about the issue, he's created a serious plan to address it. I am supporting Mike as someone who has never been afraid to take on the gun lobby and make this issue a top priority. He is exactly what this country needs right now."
Sullivan and Bloomberg gathered today for an intimate discussion with survivors of gun violence at Heritage Christian Center. The murder of State Representative Sullivan's son in the 2012 Aurora theater shooting propelled Sullivan to enter government, first as a voice in testimonies to shape bills and then as an elected official to make legislation. Sullivan serves alongside other members of the legislature who have been touched by gun violence including those impacted by the 1999 Columbine shooting.
Today, Bloomberg also announced pillars of his policy on gun safety shaped by his experience as a leading advocate for gun violence prevention for more than a decade. As Mayor of New York City, Bloomberg co-founded a national coalition of Mayors Against Illegal Guns in 2006 to push for stronger local, state, and federal gun safety laws, a coalition that grew to 1,000 mayors. He merged Mayors Against Illegal Guns with the grassroots group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America and, in 2014, helped found Everytown for Gun Safety—which has six million supporters today.
