    LITTLE ROCK. AR -- Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee strongly denounced push polling activities in Iowa.
"Our campaign has nothing to do with the push polling and I wish they would stop. We don't want this kind of campaigning because it violates the spirit of our campaign. I don't want to become President because I disabled the other candidates, I want to become President because I am the best candidate," said Huckabee during a press interview in Iowa this morning.
National Campaign Manager Chip Saltsman agreed: "Anyone who has the slightest understanding of the race in Iowa and the mindset of Iowans would know this sort of activity is extremely counterproductive. It takes the campaign off message at a time when Governor Huckabee is resonating with voters as never before. It loses votes rather than gains them. It's an underhanded way of doing business that is not welcomed by the campaign and it flies in the face of what Governor Huckabee stands for: integrity and clean politics. On behalf of Governor Huckabee and his campaign, I ask that these calls be stopped immediately."
