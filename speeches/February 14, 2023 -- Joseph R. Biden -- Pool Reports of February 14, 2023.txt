WH pool report 1 - morning lid to 1215
Bonjour on this pleasant feels-almost-like-spring morning. Your pooler stands ready to bring you up-to-the-minute updates of presidential Valentine's Day activity.
Here is your first: the effective call time has been moved to 1215.
("Effective" because the actual call time for the pool was moved last night to 0700. But early this morning a breakfast lid was announced until 0930 (the original call time), and just a few minutes ago this was extended to 1215.
For those who chronicle this stuff.)

WH pool report 8 – Biden finishes
The president wrapped up his remarks at 1422, reading the main portion of his speech off two teleprompters arranged on either side his lectern.
The bulk of his 28 minutes on stage were spent on the benefits of his legislation for the country, particularly for local governments, including counties. He pointed out that his American Rescue Plan made sure to include counties for relief money, while the CARES Act, passed in 2020, had not required this.
Many of the points he made were those common to his speeches for the past several months, including State of the Union address last week.
He referred to the speech and the reaction he drew from Republicans when he said that some of them wanted to cut Social Security and Medicare.
"It was sort of fascinating. It felt like I was back on the playground."
He began with a joke about his own political origins in Delaware: "I ran for the United States Senate because being a county councilman was too hard."
He then spoke about the latest mass shooting, the previous evening, on the campus of Michigan State University, which was the eve of the fifth anniversary of the massacre at Parkland High School in South Florida.
"It's happening far too often in this country."
"We have to do something to stop gun violence ripping apart our communities."
"There is no rationale for assault rifles and magazines that hold 50 or 70."
That last statement drew sustained applause from the county officials at the tables before him.
Pool is heading back to the vans.
