Donald Trump says it's time to "Make America Great Again"
His big presidential announcement was today at 11 AM ET.
Trump BASHED Obama â€“ a horrible negotiator.
"Our president doesn't have a clue. He's a bad negotiator. He's the one that did Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl. They get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there."
