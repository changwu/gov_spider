    The President today announced that he will nominate Saul Silverman, of Philadelphia, Pa., to be Assayer of the United States Assay Office in New York City. He would replace Allan Ryan, deceased.
Silverman was born March 2, 1921, in Brooklyn, N.Y. He holds B.S. degrees in pharmacy and chemistry from St. John's University in New York. He served in the U.S. Army from 1942 to 1945.
From 1949 to 1954, Silverman was a pharmacist. He worked as an analytical chemist at R. H. Macy Laboratories and as a quality control and technical service chemist at E. F. Houghton between 1954 and 1962. In 1962 and 1963, he was a chemist for Orland Research and Development.
Silverman has been with the Philadelphia Mint since 1963, working as a chemist and supervisory chemist. Last January, after the death of the Assayer of the New York Assay Office, Silverman was temporarily assigned to that office as Supervisor of the Assay Division.
