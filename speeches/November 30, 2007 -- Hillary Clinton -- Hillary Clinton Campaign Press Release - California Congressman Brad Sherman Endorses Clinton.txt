    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of California Congressman Brad Sherman.
"Senator Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to lead America in a new direction and create the change this country needs," Rep. Sherman said. "Her 35-year record of advocacy makes her uniquely equipped to hit the ground running on her first day in the White House."
Now in his sixth term, Rep. Sherman serves as Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade, and is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee. One of the few Certified Public Accountants in Congress, Rep. Sherman has pushed for fiscal responsibility and a fairer tax code.
"Congressman Sherman has been a leader in Congress in his efforts to protect our environment, and a respected voice on foreign and fiscal policy," Clinton said. "I am honored to have his support and delighted he'll help lead our efforts in California."
