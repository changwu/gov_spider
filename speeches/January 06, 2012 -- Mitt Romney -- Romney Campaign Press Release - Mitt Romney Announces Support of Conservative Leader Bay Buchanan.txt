    Mitt Romney today announced the support of conservative leader Bay Buchanan.
"It's an honor to have the support of a stalwart conservative like Bay," said Mitt Romney. "From her time working closely with Ronald Reagan through today, she has been a consistent and clear voice for conservative values like growing the economy, securing our borders, and making sure America is respected in the world. I look forward to working with her to get America back on track."
"If Americans want a real conservative in the White House, they need to look no farther than Mitt Romney," said Bay Buchanan. "These few years of President Obama's failed leadership have weakened our country across the board. We need a president who will immediately reverse Obamacare, stop Washington's out-of-control spending and finally secure our borders. Mitt Romney is the man who will actually get these things done. America simply can't take another four years of Barack Obama."
