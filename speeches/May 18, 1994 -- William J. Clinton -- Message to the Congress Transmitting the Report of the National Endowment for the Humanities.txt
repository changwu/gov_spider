    To the Congress of the United States:
It is my pleasure to present to you the twenty-eighth annual report of National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). In terms of breadth and number of projects funded, this agency is the largest grant-making entity for the humanities in the country. The Endowment supports scholars, teachers, and students in their research and studies, and provides funds for projects such as documentary films and museum exhibitions that reach a large general audience. These humanities activities strengthen the cultural resources of the nation and provide insight into the problems that face our increasingly complex society.
In addition to direct federal support of the humanities, NEH programs have stimulated private contributions, to date almost $1.3 billion in matching gift funds. The Endowment also requires grantees in most programs to commit their own funds for part of the project costs. The NEH support of a project is highly respected and often attracts additional funding from other sources.
The country can be proud of the role the Endowment has played as a catalyst for the support of excellent humanities scholarship and education in the United States over the past The White House, twenty-eight years.
