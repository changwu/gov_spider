    I am withholding my approval from H.R. 6248, the "Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984."
This legislation would generally enhance the penalties under existing law applicable to a felon who has been convicted three times in a United States or State court of robbery or burglary and who receives, possesses, or transports firearms.
Although I certainly support the aims of H.R. 6248, I note that identical provisions were contained in the Administration's "Comprehensive Crime Control Act," which I approved on October 12, 1984, as part of P.L. 98-473. That legislation—marking the culmination of much hard work and effort on the part of members of my Administration and the Congress—is the most comprehensive revision of Federal criminal statutes to be enacted in many years.
Inasmuch as H.R. 6248 merely duplicates existing law, it is unnecessary. Accordingly, I decline to approve it.
