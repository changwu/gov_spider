    President Bush will host Italian President Carlo Ciampi for a meeting and working luncheon on November 14, 2003. Italy is among the United States' closest allies in NATO, and has worked effectively with us in the global war on terrorism and in strengthening peace and democracy in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Presidents will discuss a range of issues, including stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, advancing peace and security in the Middle East region, continuing the fight against terrorism, and strengthening U.S.-European ties.
