Today, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) released its Performance Reporting System, which outlines the goals and objectives for the National Drug Control Strategy, as well as the two- and five-year targets and metrics for tracking progress in achieving them.
"Every day, families and communities are being torn apart by the crisis of addiction in America. Because of President Trump's commitment to this issue and the whole-of-government approach taken by this Administration, we are well-positioned to build on the progress made over the past two years. We have set out to achieve an aggressive set of specific objectives, and accomplish our overarching goal, which is to save more Americans from losing their lives to drug use," ONDCP Director James Carroll said.
To provide an assessment on the annual status of the progress in implementing the Strategy, the Administration established nine goals, with quantifiable and measurable objectives for each, to be achieved by 2022.
