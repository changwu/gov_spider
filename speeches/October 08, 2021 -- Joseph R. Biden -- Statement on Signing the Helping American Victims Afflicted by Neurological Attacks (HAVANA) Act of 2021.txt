    Today I was pleased to sign the HAVANA Act into law to ensure we are doing our utmost to provide for U.S. Government personnel who have experienced anomalous health incidents. I want to thank Congress for passing it with unanimous bipartisan support, sending the clear message that we take care of our own. Civil servants, intelligence officers, diplomats, and military personnel all around the world have been affected by anomalous health incidents. Some are struggling with debilitating brain injuries that have curtailed their careers of service to our Nation. Addressing these incidents has been a top priority for my administration. We are bringing to bear the full resources of the U.S. Government to make available first-class medical care to those affected and to get to the bottom of these incidents, including to determine the cause and who is responsible. Protecting Americans and all those who serve our country is our first duty, and we will do everything we can to care for our personnel and their families.
