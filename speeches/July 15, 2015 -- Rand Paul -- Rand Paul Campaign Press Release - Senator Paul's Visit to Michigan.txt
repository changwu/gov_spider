    HIGHLAND PARK, MI - A small crowd gathered on the front lawn of a home in Highland Park to hear from presidential hopeful and U.S. Senator Rand Paul Friday afternoon.
Appearing with a handful of local elected officials, including Democratic Highland Park Mayor DeAndre Windom, and business leaders, Paul delivered a short outline of his political strategy during his "Unleash the American Dream Event."
The Republican candidate said Friday that one of the problems with Washington, D.C. is that Republicans and Democrats are always fighting.
"We never get the solutions, because we don't have conversation," Paul said. "I came here, really, not to tell the mayor how to do his job, but to learn more about your city...the thing I think we all have to acknowledge is we face a lot of problems in our country...so we need to figure out what works and what doesn't work."Read the entire piece from MLive
