    Alabama Speaker of the House Mike Hubbard made the following statement on Alabama's upcoming primary:
"Mitt Romney continues to demonstrate that he is the only candidate who can unite the Republican Party and lead us to victory in November. On the issues about which Alabamians are most concerned, jobs and our federal spending problem, Mitt Romney has proposed bold solutions to fix our economy and fiscal mess. His first-hand experience in the private economy combined with his proven record of leadership as a governor make Mitt Romney uniquely qualified to tackle tough problems and get our country on the right track. That is why I support him, and that's why his momentum is building in Alabama. I urge all those who want a change of direction in Washington to vote for Mitt Romney on Tuesday."
