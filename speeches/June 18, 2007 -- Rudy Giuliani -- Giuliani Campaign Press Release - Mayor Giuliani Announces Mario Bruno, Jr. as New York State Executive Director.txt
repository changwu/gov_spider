    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee announced today that Mario Bruno, Jr. has joined the team as Executive Director for the state of New York.
Bruno, who served in the former Mayor's administration, will oversee all aspects of the Giuliani campaign in the state, from building upon existing grassroots support to promoting Rudy's message of strong leadership.
"Mario is well-respected in Republican circles," said Giuliani Campaign Manager Michael DuHaime. "His experience as a public servant and his political knowledge are tremendous assets as we work toward victory in the primary. Mayor Giuliani is proud to have Mario on board."
Bruno joins a strong and growing New York leadership team including Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno, Assembly Republican Leader Jim Tedisco and Republican State Committee Chairman Joseph Mondello, who have all endorsed Rudy.
