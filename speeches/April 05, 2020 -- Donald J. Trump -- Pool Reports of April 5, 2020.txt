pool report #6/briefing color
"We have stockpiled 29 million pills of the Hydroxychloroquine ... And they're not expensive," Trump says. "What do you have to lose?"Fauci, seated at side of briefing room, is avoiding eye contact and could practicing a self-calming technique. Dr. Birx likewise appears stoic, as does the scarf draped over her left shoulder.
In the room, pooler can see three people wearing facemasks: two men, a news photographer currently shooting from near the door to the outside and a TV technician at the consoles in the back of the room, and a woman in the back, toward the work area, who I believe is a TV producer. Pooler's spouse is messaging him that he should also be wearing a mask, which he is not.
