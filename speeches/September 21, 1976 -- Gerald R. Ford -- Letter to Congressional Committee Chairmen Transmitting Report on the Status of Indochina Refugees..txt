    IN ACCORDANCE with the provisions of the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975, I am reporting to you on the status of refugees from Cambodia and South Vietnam.
We have made and continue to make remarkable progress in the resettlement and assimilation of the Indochina refugee into American life. This progress has been made possible through the efforts of many private individuals and through the cooperative efforts of public and private institutions. Many refugees have made the transition into American life. Others require financial, medical or educational assistance. As my report to you shows, that assistance is adequately being provided through several federally assisted programs.
Vast strides have been made by these newcomers to our country. I am confident that in the near future, they will achieve full citizenship and contribute greatly to our society.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
