    Huckabee Raised Taxes & Attacked The Free Market
"I don't think he understands the free market business system. He's not good on taxing, he's not good on spending, he's not good on free trade. In other words, all the prosperity factors seem to be Mr. Huckabee's weakness. I don't think he understands it. He's just out of tune with all measures of free market, supply side economics." – CNBC's Larry Kudlow (Hugh Hewitt Radio Show, 12/21/07; www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvfhmE6PKxI)

Gov. Huckabee Actually Stood Before the Legislature And Begged Them To Raise The Income Tax, Sales Tax, And Tobacco Tax. GOV. HUCKABEE: "There is a lot of support for a tax at the wholesale level for tobacco. That's fine with me. I will very happily sign that... Some have suggested the retail level of tobacco. If that ends up being your preference, I will accept that. Others have suggested a surcharge on the income tax. That's acceptable. I'm fine with that. ... Others have suggested perhaps a sales tax. That's fine. Yet others have suggested a hybrid that would collect some money from any one or combination of those various ideas... If that's the plan that the House and Senate agree upon, then you will have nothing but my profound thanks."
