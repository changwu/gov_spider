Fox News' "Fox & Friends"
May 12, 2008
FOX NEWS' STEVE DOOCY: "Great to have you. Later today up in Portland, Oregon, I believe John McCain is going to talk about global warming. What's he going to say?" 
SEN. LIEBERMAN: "This is one of the reasons why I crossed party lines to support John, obviously in addition to his tremendous ability to be our Commander-in-Chief at a time of war. It's also the reason why a lot of Democrats and independents are going to cross party lines to support him. John saw a problem, and he spent some time studying it. He decided global warming was real, and he came to me about six years ago, and said let's get together and do something about this. And we put in the first significant anti-global warming bill -- a bill that uses market mechanisms to move us slowly down in terms of our greenhouse gas emissions. And I think John today is going to talk about that and why he, as President, will make this a priority of his administration. Give him some credit here."
