    Every American has the right to the peace of mind that comes with access to affordable, quality health care. No one should worry about whether they can pay for their doctor or choose between paying rent and filing a prescription. Today we are closer than ever to making that principle a reality. The lowest percentage of Americans are uninsured today—8 percent—in history.
This progress did not happen by accident. More than 35 million Americans are enrolled in Affordable Care Act related coverage, the highest total on record. This includes over 21 million people who are enrolled in the ACA's expansion of Medicaid, coverage that is denied to nearly 4 million Americans who live in States that have refused to expand Medicaid. And, since the beginning of my administration, 5 million more people have gained health insurance coverage, in significant part because of the improvements to the ACA in the American Rescue Plan.
When I ran for office, I said we needed to protect and build on the Affordable Care Act. The Inflation Reduction Act will do just that; it will lock in an average $800 a year savings in health insurance premiums for 13 million Americans and prevent 3 million Americans from becoming uninsured. I urge Congress to pass this legislation swiftly to lower health care costs and make health insurance coverage more accessible for families across the country.
