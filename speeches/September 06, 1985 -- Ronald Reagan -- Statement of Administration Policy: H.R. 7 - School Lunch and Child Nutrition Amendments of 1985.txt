    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Hawkins (D) California)
The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H-R. 7 because it (a) reverses reforms enacted in the 1981 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act that targeted benefits to low-income children; (b) contains none of the Administration's budget proposals; (c) creates new entitlement spending by increasing the school breakfast subsidy for all studentsâ€”including high income students above 185% of poverty; (d) significantly increases expenditures for the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program and the Special Milk Program; and (e) permits higher tuition private schools with high income students to receive school lunch subsidies.
If H.R. 7 were to reach the President's desk, his advisers would recommend its disapproval.
