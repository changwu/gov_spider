    Gov. Perry continues to receive endorsements from elected officials and community leaders across the nation. The latest is New Hampshire Deputy House speaker Pam Tucker:
TUESDAY, SEPT. 6, UPDATE: TUCKER BACKS PERRY. New Hampshire's Deputy Speaker of the House has become the latest leading State House Republican to make a presidential endorsement.
Rep. Pam Tucker, R-Greenland, endorsed Texas Gov. Rick Perry's presidential bid today, saying his "record of creating and nurturing an environment for job growth is surpassed by none in this race. He is undoubtedly the best candidate to get our country working again."
Tucker was among a group of New Hampshire Republicans who traveled to Austin, Texas, about a month ago to discuss Perry's impending candidacy. Perry announced for President several days later.
He has since made three visits to the state, most recently on Saturday, drawing sizeable crowds at receptions in Manchester and Chichester.
Tucker on Wednesday morning will travel to Simi Valley, Cal., to attend the NBC/Politico debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on Wednesday night. She said she will be part of the Perry team giving post-debate media interviews in the "spin room."
Tucker said that she has been watching Perry since April, "before there was talk of him running for President, and I've been impressed.
"He's created the environment for nearly 40 percent of all the jobs created in the country over the past several years," Tucker said. "Imagine if he could take that and transfer that to the national level."
Last week, 2010 Republican gubernatorial nominee John Stephen backed Perry. Previously, Perry was endorsed by former U.S. Sen. Gordon Humphrey and former U.S. Rep. Charles Douglas.
