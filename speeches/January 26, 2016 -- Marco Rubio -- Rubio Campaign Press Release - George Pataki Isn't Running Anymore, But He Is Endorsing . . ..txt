Former presidential candidate and Governor of New York George Pataki has made his choice:
I took a look at all the candidates & @marcorubio is the best person to bring us together — that's why I'm endorsing him @AmericaNewsroom
— George E. Pataki (@GovernorPataki) January 26, 2016
Pataki knows something about winning tough elections — in New York, he beat famed liberal Mario Cuomo to become Governor. 

Here's what he thought was most important about Marco as a candidate:
We need someone who is going to bring Americans together. Senator Rubio has the leadership. He has the vision.
He has the intelligence from Congress to understand what it takes to defend us against radical Islam.
Governor Pataki, welcome to Team Marco!
