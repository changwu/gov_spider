    DENVER — Bennet for America today launched its first television ads in Iowa as part of an integrated strategy, with digital, field, and political efforts, to further focus resources on communicating directly with Iowa caucusgoers and win the nomination. The two ads — "Most" and "Truth" — make clear what sets Bennet apart from the other candidates and why he's the best person to beat Donald Trump and lead the country forward.
"Everywhere Michael goes on the campaign trail, people walk away believing he is the leader we need to make change, but not enough people have had the chance to meet him or learn what drives him," said Bennet for America spokesperson Shannon Beckham. "These ads show who Michael is and how he's different from other candidates. He's pounding truth into a campaign full of empty promises and broken politics — calling for a new generation of leadership and a healthcare solution that doesn't take insurance away from millions of Americans."
The seven-figure TV and digital buy will run over the course of several weeks. A third ad will also debut during that time. The campaign is significantly increasing its current digital outreach plan with a full suite of digital-first creative spots targeting Iowa caucusgoers. The campaign will also be debuting ads in New Hampshire soon.
Bennet has made 13 trips to Iowa this year, including six days so far this month. According to Radio Iowa, "no other candidate has spent as much time in the state in September." Bennet spent this past weekend campaigning with former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack and holding events in Obama-Trump counties — such as Lee County, which flipped more than 30 points — that he believes are critical to win in 2020, and that someone with experience winning two tough races in a purple state can help secure. He will be back in Iowa on Friday for the Polk County Steak Fry and to continue to "pound some truth into the campaign" as the Des Moines Register editorial board wrote.
