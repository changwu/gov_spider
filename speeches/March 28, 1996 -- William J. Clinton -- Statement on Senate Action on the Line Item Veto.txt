    I want to commend the Senate for passing legislation to give the President line item veto authority. While not a perfect bill, the conference report as passed by the Senate will give Presidents the ability to cut wasteful Government spending and special interest tax provisions.
I have advocated the line item veto for a very long time. I had the line item veto when I was Governor of Arkansas; I advocated the line item veto when I ran for President; and I have pursued it since becoming President.
The President, no matter what party, needs the line item veto to ensure that our public resources are put to the best possible uses during these times of tight budgets. While I note that this authority does not become effective until the next Congress, I urge the House to follow the Senate's lead and pass the conference report now.
