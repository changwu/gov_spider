    Michelle and I extend our warmest wishes to families across the country celebrating Kwanzaa this holiday season. Today begins a weeklong celebration of African American heritage and culture through family and community festivities. Kwanzaa's seven principles—unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith—are also shared values that bind us as Americans. And in the spirit of the season, we reflect on the blessings of the past year and commit to building a brighter future for all our children. As families, friends, and neighbors come together today to light the kinara, our family sends our best wishes for a happy and healthy new year.
