    The President met at the White House this morning with Dr. Jonas Savimbi, leader of the opposition National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), who is in the United States on a private visit. Dr. Savimbi enjoys significant support among the Angolan population. He seeks the withdrawal of all foreign forces and a process of internal political reconciliation in Angola. The United States believes that true peace in Angola can only result from national reconciliation and that UNITA has the right to participate in such a process.
The President and Dr. Savimbi discussed a range of issues concerning the situation in southern Africa. The President supports UNITA's struggle against the presence of Soviet and Cuban forces in Angola. Dr. Savimbi supports the ongoing U.S.-brokered negotiations with South Africa, Angola, and Cuba aimed at achieving Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola and independence for neighboring Namibia. During the recent Toronto summit, participating nations expressed strong support for the negotiations and the goal of national reconciliation within Angola.
