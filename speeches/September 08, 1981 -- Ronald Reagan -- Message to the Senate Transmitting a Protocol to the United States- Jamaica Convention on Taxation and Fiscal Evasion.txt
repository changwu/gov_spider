    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, the Protocol amending the Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Jamaica for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, together with a related exchange of notes, signed at Kingston on July 17, 1981. I also transmit the report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol.
The Protocol was negotiated subsequent to Prime Minister Seaga's visit to this country in January, 1981. It strengthens the provisions of the Convention in order to limit potential abuse of the treaty in certain situations and to make more effective the means of denying treaty benefits to residents of third countries who establish a corporation in one Contracting State in order to obtain treaty benefits from the other Contracting State. The Protocol also permits United States citizens to deduct expenses incurred while attending business conventions in Jamaica.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Protocol and Convention and give its advice and consent to ratification.
