    Helena, MT – Clad in a blindfold as dark as the undisclosed money flooding our elections, Montana Governor Steve Bullock joined NowThis for a lighthearted take on one of the most serious issues in this election: the toxic influence of outside dollars.
Governor Bullock has done more than any candidate in the field to fight dark money, taking the first challenge to Citizens United all the way to the Supreme Court as Attorney General, passing the strongest campaign finance laws in the nation as Governor, and suing the Trump administration when they created a new dark money loophole.
Watch: Governor Bullock, blindfolded, joins NowThis to rail against dark money
