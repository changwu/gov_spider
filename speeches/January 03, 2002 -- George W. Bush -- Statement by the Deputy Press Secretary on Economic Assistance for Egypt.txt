    The White House is pleased to announce that the United States is accelerating the disbursement of economic assistance funds to Egypt, in line with the Presidents commitment to help our important ally weather current global economic difficulties and the post-September 11 shock to the Egyptian economy. This accelerated assistance -- valued at $959 million -- to a key partner in the campaign against terrorism and the pursuit of Middle East peace will support Egypts implementation of its economic reform program.
