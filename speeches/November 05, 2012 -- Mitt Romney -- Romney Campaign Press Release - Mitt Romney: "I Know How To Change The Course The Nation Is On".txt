See, accomplishing real change is not just something I talk about. It is something I have done, and it is something I will do as the President of the United States." â€” Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "I think you know that the President promised change but he couldn't deliver change. I not only promise change; I have a record of achieving it. I actually built a business. I helped turn around another business. I helped get the Olympics back on track. And then, with a Democrat legislature, 85 percent Democrat, I helped turn my state from deficit to surplus, from job losses to job growth, and from lower take-home pay to higher take-home pay. That's why I'm running for president. I know how to change the course the nation is on. I know how to get us to a balanced budget and how to build jobs and make rising take-home pay happen again. See, accomplishing real change is not just something I talk about. It is something I have done, and it is something I will do as the President of the United States. If you believe we can do better, if you believe America should be on a better course, if you're tired of being tired then I ask you to vote for real change. Paul Ryan and I will bring real change to America from Day One."
