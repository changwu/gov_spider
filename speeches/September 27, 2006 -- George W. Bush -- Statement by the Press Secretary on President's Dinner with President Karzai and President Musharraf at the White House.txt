    The President was pleased to have both President Karzai and President Musharraf to dinner at the White House. The holy month of Ramadan is a more than appropriate time for the three leaders to come together to share a post-sundown meal.
The leaders were joined at dinner by the Ambassadors to the United States from both Pakistan and Afghanistan, Vice-President Cheney, Secretary Rice, and National Security Advisor Hadley.
During the dinner, the President invited both leaders to share their views on the current situation in the region and the common challenge posed by extremism and terrorism.
President Musharraf discussed initiatives he is pursuing in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas to improve governance, develop the region economically, and enhance security. President Karzai discussed ongoing efforts to enhance security, improve governance, and accelerate development throughout Afghanistan.
The three leaders had a constructive exchange on the common challenges facing our three nations. The leaders agreed on the need for common action to achieve common objectives. They committed to supporting moderation and defeating extremism through greater intelligence sharing, coordinated action against terrorists, and common efforts to enhance the prosperity of the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
