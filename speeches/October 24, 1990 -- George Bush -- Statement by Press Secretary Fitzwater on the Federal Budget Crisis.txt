    We continue to have discussions with House and Senate conferees concerning an agreement on the budget. Although there are several areas of disagreement that remain to be worked out, sufficient progress has been made for the President to sign the continuing resolution expected to be passed by Congress tonight. This 3-day continuing resolution includes budget savings that approximate those envisioned in the first year of the bipartisan budget agreement.
We expect the President to sign this continuing resolution tomorrow morning. All Federal employees should report to work as scheduled. The Government will continue to function without interruption.
Tomorrow's travel to New Mexico and Arizona by the President has been canceled. On Thursday the President will continue to monitor the budget situation through his negotiators, who will be working out details of a budget agreement.
