    NEW YORK, NY-- New Mexico Governor and Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Richardson today released the following statement in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the integration of Central High School by the Little Rock Nine:
"Today we honor the extraordinary courage of nine young Americans. Fifty years ago, the Little Rock Nine stood up for the basic human rights of every American and led our country down the path toward integration, tolerance, and justice.
"As a nation, we have made great strides, but we have not reached the end of that path. Fifty years ago, the Little Rock Nine entered a white-only school and forced every American to reevaluate his or her sense of justice. Recently, the Jena Six have entered into the national spotlight due to racism and intolerance. The current situation in Louisiana once again has forced every American to reexamine what is right and fair.
"We must renew our commitment to respect the civil rights of every American, whether black or white, gay or straight, immigrant or native-born. We must fulfill the promise of the integration of Central High School and guarantee that every American's rights are honored."
