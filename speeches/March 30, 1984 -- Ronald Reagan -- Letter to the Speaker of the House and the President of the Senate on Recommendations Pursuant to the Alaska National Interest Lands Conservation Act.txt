    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Enclosed in accordance with section 1311 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3200) is the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor of Alaska with respect to the creation of a scenic highway along the routes described in that section.
The Secretary and the Governor recommend that no such scenic highway be established and, further, that the Congress move immediately to repeal the public lands withdrawal from mining and mineral leasing imposed by section 1311. I concur in those recommendations.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
