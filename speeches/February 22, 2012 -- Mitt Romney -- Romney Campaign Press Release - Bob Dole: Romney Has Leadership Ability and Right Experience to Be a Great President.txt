    Former Kansas Senator Bob Dole made the following statement on tonight's debate:
"I've watched a lot of debates in my years. I've seldom seen a candidate shine like Mitt Romney shined tonight. Finally, we have a conservative who has the leadership abilities and the right kind of experience to make a great president. Governor Romney's tax-reform plan puts conservative ideas into practice, cutting rates while putting the country on the path to a balanced budget.
"Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, both Washington insiders, are pushing proposals that would add billions if not trillions to the deficit, making it impossible to distinguish from the Democrat proposals. This is not their only flaw as candidates but it would bring the Republican Party to a resounding defeat in November.Â  In recent weeks, they have made Governor Romney a punching bag in their lust for the nomination but nearly every poll indicates that Governor Romney is electable in the Fall and will still be standing when it's all over. Governor Romney's performance tonight should demonstrate that he is the strongest candidate by far. I have no quarrel with Santorum or Gingrich except I don't want to lose the presidency, the House and lose seats in the Senate if either of them were the candidate which I believe would be the result."
