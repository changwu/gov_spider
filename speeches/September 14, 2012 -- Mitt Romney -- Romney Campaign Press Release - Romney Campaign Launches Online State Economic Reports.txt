    Today, the Romney for President campaign released a new candidate comparison tool on MittRomney.com, which enables voters to learn more about the economic situation in their state. Despite the President's empty rhetoric of recovery, the reality is that the Obama Administration has presided over the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression.
"After four years of disappointment, President Obama hasn't delivered on the economic prosperity that he promised," said Mitt Romney. "Now Americans can see exactly how the failures of this President's economic record have impacted their state. I've got a plan to turn this economy around, and this tool will allow voters to see exactly how my Plan for a Stronger Middle Class will benefit their community, creating more jobs and more take-home pay for every American."
After generating their state's economic report, voters will be given the opportunity to share those results with their friends, family and co-workers online.
