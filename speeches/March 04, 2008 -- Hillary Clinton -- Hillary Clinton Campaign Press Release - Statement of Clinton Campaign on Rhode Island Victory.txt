    Providence, RI: Hillary Clinton tonight scored a decisive victory in the Ocean State, winning the popular vote by a margin of 58%-40% with 98% of precincts reporting.
"Voters reaffirmed tonight what we've been saying since the beginning: Rhode Island is squarely behind Senator Clinton," said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, co-chair of the Clinton campaign in RI. "This campaign was unprecedented: we phone banked, we canvassed, and we made Senator Clinton's case all over this state. Tonight it paid off."
Congressman Jim Langevin added: "Rhode Islanders know Senator Clinton is ready to lead, and will deliver real solutions to the challenges faced by so many Rhode Islanders."
"When I visited Rhode Island last Sunday, I said that this little state would have a big voice in this election," said Senator Clinton. "I am so pleased and honored to have such broad and decisive support from the great state of Rhode Island."
Hillary's campaign launched an unprecedented voter outreach effort over the last three weeks, canvassing in every city and town, operating more than a dozen phone banks, and mobilizing volunteers from 22 staging locations around the state. Latinos for Hillary activated Latino voters, while Women for Clinton issued a "10 to 1 challenge," with each member recruiting ten more members in support of Hillary's candidacy.
The victory came as the campaign was outspent by its opponent by more than three to one.
