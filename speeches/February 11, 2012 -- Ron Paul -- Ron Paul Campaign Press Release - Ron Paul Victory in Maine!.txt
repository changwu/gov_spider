FALMOUTH, Maine â€” 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul has scored a strong finish in the Maine presidential caucuses. Paul gained over 36 percent of the vote in the 'Pine Tree' state, being barely nudged out by eventual winner Gov. Mitt Romney who pulled in a little over 38 percent.
Paul performed well throughout the state, although his campaign's stronghold of Washington County did not report today for inexplicable reasons. Congressman Paul was barely bested by Gov. Romney by about 194 votes, a margin the campaign is confident it will make up with the 200 plus votes expected to come out of Washington County's caucus.
"Today's results show once again that Congressman Paul's campaign for liberty and a return to Constitutional principles is strong and growing," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton. "We are confident that we will control the Maine delegation for the convention in August. Our campaign is so thankful to all of our supporters in Maine, and all over the nation, and we want them to know that we plan to take this message all the way to the White House."
