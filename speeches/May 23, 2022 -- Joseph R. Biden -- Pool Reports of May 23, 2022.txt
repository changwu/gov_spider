Travel report 10
There will be a full stream of the remarks below but here are the highlights with an Otter link below courtesy of Noah Bierman from the LAT.
The pool entered a large ornate room with high ceilings. The president and the PM sat alongside an ornate table with a beautiful boquet or red and white flowers on the table. There was an American flag behind POTUS and a Japanese flag behind the PM. The PM had a male translator seated behind him and there was a female translator seated behind Biden.
Biden sat with his legs crossed and his hand one his chin with the PM was speaking. He held some papers in the other hand.
There were four chairs on the left side of the room w/ American delegation and Four chairs on the right side of the room with Members of the Japan delegation. The chairs were facing each other.
On the left side of the room, the Biden delegation was the following order from closest to Biden to furthest away: Antony Blinken, Rahm Emanuel, Gina Raimondo, Katherine Tai.
Your pooler did not know the names of the four members of the Japanese delegation sitting across from them but they were all men.
The PM, speaking in Japanese, welcomed Biden for his first visit as president. He also declared solidarity with the US in confronting Russia's invasion of Ukraine. "Russia's aggression of Ukraine undermines the foundation of global order," Kishida said.
Biden said that the US remains committed to Japan's defense.
At the conclusion of their statements, they ignored shouted questions from reporters. The pool is holding until the press conference this afternoon. We have been given two ribbons—one pink, one red and white—as our credentials.
Otter link via Noah. Excuse him for spamming the list earlier, he was trying to help me by sending a quote.

The presser begins. It will be live-streamed but here is some color:
The Biden delegation is seated stage right. The front row is Raimondo, Blinken, Emanuel.
Katherine Tai is in the next row back with Jake Sullivan and a third seat that was empty at the beginning of the press conference.
The row after that is Kate Bedingfield, Karine Jean-Pierre, and Jen OMalley Dillon.
Your pooler's near-sightedness failed him for the next rows.
Raimondo and Tai were conferring about something before the presser began.
The Japanese delegation is stage left.
There are teleprompters set up for each world leader. The teleprompters are different models.
If you are in the room looking at POTUS and the PM. American reporters are seated on the left side of the room and the Japanese reporters are in the right side of the room. There are many more Japanese reporters than American reporters.
Everyone is masked.
Some info about the room per the Japanese govt. website.

Situated on the west side of the State Guest House, Hagoromo no Ma is so called for the large ceiling painting inspired by a passage from the Noh play Hagoromo ("Robe of Heaven"). A grand space in shades of gold and scarlet, adorned with mirrors, it was formerly referred to as the ballroom. It also hosts ceremonial welcomes in inclement weather, or serves pre-dinner drinks for guests.

IPEF launch event concludes.
Biden ignored several shouted questions about Taiwan. As he walked out of the event space, Gina Raimondo gave POTUS a pat on the back.
Some color from the event in case people couldn't see it in the livestream:Biden regularly looked at a briefing book in front of him and took notes as other leaders spoke.
After New Zealand's leader spoke, she disappeared from her screen which was replaced by a IPEF logo while other leaders began speaking . She had said in Her remarks that she was on her way to the US. The other leaders stayed on after their remarks.
When there was a technical malfunction with the leader of Singapore and a non-English translation rang out in the hall, Biden gave Blinken a look with a shrug.
Once one of Malaysia's ministers began speaking, someone came and told PM something that prompted him to quietly depart. Aides then also brought both Blinken and Biden cups that, from a distance, look like coffee cups. Both also had glasses of water in front of them.
