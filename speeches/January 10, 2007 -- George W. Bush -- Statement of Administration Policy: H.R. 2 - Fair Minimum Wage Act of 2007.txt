    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Miller (D) CA and 214 cosponsors)
The Administration supports increasing the minimum wage by $2.10 over two years, but opposes H.R. 2 in its current form because it fails to provide relief to small businesses, which are creating most of the new jobs in the United States.
The Administration strongly supports adding provisions to H.R. 2 to pair the increase in the minimum wage with tax and regulatory relief to help small businesses stay competitive and to help keep the economy growing, such as provisions of H.R. 324. In addition, the Administration appreciates the Senate's willingness to work on a bipartisan proposal to address the needs of small businesses, which will be the most affected by a minimum wage increase. The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to maintain a flexible labor market and provide a complete package that helps both workers and small businesses.
