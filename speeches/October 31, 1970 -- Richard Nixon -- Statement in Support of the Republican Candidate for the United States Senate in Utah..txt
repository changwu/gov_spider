    AMERICA needs Laurence Burton in the United States Senate in the 1970's. Laurence Burton will speak strongly for Utah and for the Nation on the issues of fiscal responsibility, controlling inflation, combating crime and drugs, and achieving peace with honor.
I know Laurence Burton well, and I have great respect for his wisdom and his judgment. He speaks with integrity and independence. In his work with the important Public Land Law Review Commission, he showed an intelligent understanding of a matter of keen interest to the people of Utah. He has won the trust and confidence of his colleagues in the House of Representatives. In the Senate, he will command the attention of his colleagues and also of the members of the administration. He is a statesman who will do what he sees to be right for the people of Utah and of all the United States.
As America moves into the 1970's, we need men like Laurence Burton to lead us. I need Laurence Burton to help carry out the programs Utah voted for in 1968. Utah needs Laurence Burton to strengthen its voice in the Nation's Capital, and to speak effectively and firmly for what Utah wants.
