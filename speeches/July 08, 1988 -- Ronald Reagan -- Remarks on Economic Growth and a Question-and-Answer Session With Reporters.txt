    The President. Yesterday I met with Vice President Bush and discussed what's right about America. And the answer is a lot. You'll be hearing a lot more from us in the coming months. Today we have another piece of good news: Employment is at an all-time high, and unemployment is the lowest since 1974.
During the past 7 1/2 years, over 17 million new jobs have been created, and the economy remains strong. More Americans are working today than ever before in our history. As they sit around their kitchen tables, more Americans are planning for their future, not desperately searching the want ads for a job.
We continue the longest peacetime expansion in this country's history. The American model of low tax rates, deregulation, and privatization are the policies being emulated around the world. Today's news is more solid evidence that the policies of this administration work, that our philosophy works. I predict that 1988 will be a banner year for Republicans because it's a banner year for peace and prosperity in America.
Now I am called away by a previously scheduled meeting, but Secretary McLaughlin is here with me and is kindly going to take the questions, and probably she'll answer them better with regard to the labor situation than I could.
