    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, the Convention between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Concerning the Conservation of Migratory Birds and Their Environment, signed at Moscow on November 19, 1976.
In the same manner as other Migratory Bird Conventions which the United States has with Canada, Japan and Mexico, this Convention provides for international cooperation in the protection and preservation of migratory birds. A fundamental function of this Convention is the identification of species of birds which migrate between the United States and the Soviet Union and species of birds which, while not actually migratory between the United States and the Soviet Union, have populations in both States and share common flyways or common breeding, wintering or feeding areas. With respect to these species of birds the Parties undertake certain strict management procedures as well as an ongoing interchange of information regarding the protection of these species.
In addition, as I mentioned in my May 23 Message to Congress on the Environment, this Convention and the legislation which will be submitted to implement it will establish new authority to conserve the habitats necessary to the survival of migratory birds. The Convention contains an undertaking by the Parties to list in an Appendix to the Convention. those Migratory Bird Habitats of special importance within the areas under their jurisdiction and, by mutual agreement, those which are outside the areas under their jurisdiction.
There are many species of birds which will benefit from the provisions of this Convention, which fills a major gap in the protection of the species of migratory birds which exists in the United States. I urge the Senate to act favorably on this Convention at an early date by giving its advice and consent to ratification.
