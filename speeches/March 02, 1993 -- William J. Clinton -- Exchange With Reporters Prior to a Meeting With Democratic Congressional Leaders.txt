    Spending Cuts
Q. Mr. President, we hear you're not going to ask for any more spending cuts. Is that right?
The President. Where did you hear that?
Q. Well, there's a little piece in the paper that says somebody on your staff admitted that, well, they didn't really think you'd be able to find any more spending cuts.
The President. Well, I expect there will be a lot more as we go along. I just don't think we should shut the Congress down while we all look for them. Keep in mind that we've got more than they've had in a long time, and we need to go forward with this program. But I think you'll see a continuous stream of them coming out as we go along.
Q. From you?
The President. From me and from others.
Bosnia
Q. Mr. President, are you satisfied with the airdrops in Bosnia, the success of the airdrops? The President. Well, the last report I got this morning was pretty good, based on the last information I had. And I haven't talked directly to General Powell today, but he thinks they've gone pretty well, and I have to rely partly on-largely on his judgment.
Q. How long do you think they need to go on there? The President. I don't have an answer to that now.
