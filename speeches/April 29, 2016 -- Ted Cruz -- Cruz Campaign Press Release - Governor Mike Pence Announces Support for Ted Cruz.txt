    HOUSTON, Texas - Today, Governor Mike Pence of Indiana announced on the Greg Garrison Radio Show on WIBC radio in Indianapolis that he will be voting for Ted Cruz in the upcoming Indiana primary.
Listen to the interview here.


"Ted Cruz is a principled conservative who's dedicated his career to advocating the Reagan agenda," said Governor Pence. "I'm pleased to support him."
"…I really admire the way that Ted Cruz has been willing to stand up for taxpayers in opposing runaway spending, deficits, and debt. Calling for and leading on repealing Obamacare and I also have to tell you, I'm very impressed with Ted Cruz's devotion and knowledge of the Constitution of the United States… of the freedoms that are enshrined there in our Bill of Rights from our liberties to our Second Amendment. And of course, I appreciate his strong and unwavering stand for the sanctity of life. It's for those reasons, and just as much as in support of the principles that have always animated my public service, that I'm voting for Ted Cruz in the upcoming Republican primary.
"…The man has shown the courage of his convictions, it's not a popular thing in Washington D.C. to take on the leadership of your own party," Governor Pence concluded. "I know that first hand, I did it when I was there."
Governor Pence was elected the 50th Governor of the State of Indiana in 2012 and inaugurated January 14, 2013.
"I am honored to have Mike's endorsement," said Cruz. "Mike has been an important voice for conservatives during his time as Governor. The success of Indiana shows that conservative ideas work. I look forward to working together to continue to coalesce Republicans around this campaign."
