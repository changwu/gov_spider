After the President made a bad deal with Iran, Governor Walker made his position very clear and outlined what he would do if elected president.

      #IranDeal threatens US safety and exemplifies Obama-Clinton foreign policy: reward our enemies and undermine our true friends like Israel-SW

      By endorsing the #IranDeal, @HillaryClinton has betrayed Israel and its supporters: http://t.co/O6C5vuejyy - SW

      I'll terminate this bad #IranDeal, reimpose crippling sanctions, and work w/ allies to roll back Iran's destructive regional influence-SW

Due to a severe thunderstorm and flight delays, Scott Walker was up for 40 hours straight and held not one, not two, not three, but four events in South Carolina and Georgia. His son Matt, chronicled the missed connections, 2AM Burger King runs and rent-a-cars in this Medium post.

      My head hasn't been on a pillow in 30 hours. This really is around the clock campaigning. Crowds still pump us up. -SW
