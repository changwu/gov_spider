    To the Senate o/the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Protocols for the Third Extension of the Wheat Trade Convention and the Food Aid Convention constituting the International Wheat Agreement, 1971, open for signature in Washington from March 17 through April 7, 1976. The Protocols were formulated by a Conference which met in London on February 20, 1976.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocols.
The Protocol for the Third Extension of the Wheat Trade Convention, 1971, extends the Convention until June 30, 1978, and maintains the framework for international cooperation in wheat trade matters. It also continues the existence of the International Wheat Council.
The Protocol for the Third Extension of the Food Aid Convention, 1971, also extends until June 30, 1978, commitments of parties to provide minimum annual quantities of food aid to developing countries. The United States intends not to deposit ratification of this Protocol unless the other major donors become a party to the Protocol and formally record this intention by a written declaration to that effect made at the time of signing.
Both Protocols provide that instruments of ratification shall be deposited no later than June 18, 1976. The Wheat Council and Food Aid Committee may, however, grant an extension of time to any signatory government that has not deposited an instrument of ratification by that date.
It is my hope that the Senate will give early and favorable consideration to the two Protocols so that ratification by the United States can be effected and instruments of ratification can be deposited without undue delay.
