    Dr. Hornig, distinguished Medal of Science award winners, Members of the Cabinet, Members of the Congress, distinguished ladies and gentlemen:
The discoverer Isaac Newton once wrote that he felt like "a boy playing on the seashore," while "the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me."
Today, we have come here to the East Room to honor 11 men whose lifelong purpose has been to explore the great ocean of truth. Their achievements--and the work of other scientists--have lengthened man's life, have eased his days, and have enriched our treasury of wisdom.
For nearly two centuries, America has been a lighthouse of democratic government in the world.
But we have also stood for other things. First, we have been an example of the power of science and technology to transform man's life.
The steamship, the telephone, the Salk vaccine, the splitting of the atom, our steady climb to the moon and the stars--all of these developments in our land have excited the entire world, and have changed it forever.
Today, our enormous investment in science and research is our evidence of our faith that science can not only make man richer--but science can make man better.
Second, and more important, America stands for the unfettered pursuit of knowledge.
Scientific research in our Nation is heavily financed by our Government.
I believe that government must guard freedom of inquiry--and extend it. The voyage of our scientists should be to make new discoveries--not just to confirm old dogmas.
In the famous poem, Ulysses pledges "To follow knowledge, like a sinking star, Beyond the utmost bounds of human thought."
That goal is the goal of these scientists_ that goal is the goal of American science.
So gentlemen, I am greatly honored to make this year's awards of the National Medal of Science.
