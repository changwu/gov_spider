    Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump made additional disaster assistance available to the territory of the U.S. Virgin Islands by authorizing an increase in the level of Federal funding for debris removal and emergency protective measures undertaken in the U.S. Virgin Islands as a result of Hurricane Irma beginning on September 6, 2017, and continuing.
Under the President's major disaster declaration issued for the U.S. Virgin Islands on September 7, 2017, Federal funding was made available for Public Assistance, Hazard Mitigation, and Other Needs Assistance at 75 percent Federal funding of total eligible costs.
President Trump increased cost sharing to 90 percent Federal funding for debris removal, including direct Federal assistance, and 100 percent Federal funding for emergency protective measures, including direct Federal assistance, for 30 days from the start of the incident period, and then a 90 percent Federal cost share thereafter.
