    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the U.S. Virgin Islands and ordered Federal aid to supplement territory recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides on November 10-16, 2003.
Federal funding is available to territorial governments on a cost-sharing basis for the repair or replacement of public facilities damaged by the severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides. Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures.
Representing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Michael D. Brown, Under Secretary for Emergency Preparedness and Response, Department of Homeland Security, named Brad Gair as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The agency said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the Territory and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
