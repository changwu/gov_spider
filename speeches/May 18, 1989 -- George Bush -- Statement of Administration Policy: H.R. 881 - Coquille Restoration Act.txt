    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(DeFazio (D) Oregon and four others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 881, which would circumvent the existing Indian tribal acknowledgment process by legislating Federal recognition of the Coquille Tribe. The Interior Department's acknowlegment process is designed to ensure that the same criteria are applied systematically to any group seeking Federal recognition as an Indian tribe.
The Western Oregon Termination Act of 1954 currently bars the Coquille from petitioning for recognition under the Federal acknowledgment process. The Administration would support legislation to remove this bar so that the tribe could seek acknowledgment in accordance with criteria applicable to other tribes.
