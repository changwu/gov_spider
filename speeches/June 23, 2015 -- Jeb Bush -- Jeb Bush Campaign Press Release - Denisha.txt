    Denisha Merriweather had failed twice by the time she was in the third grade. Her public school was not meeting her needs, but her godmother, Johnell Jones, couldn't afford a private school.
A friend told Johnell about Florida's new tax credit scholarship program. In addition to instituting the first statewide voucher program in the country, Governor Bush also created a tax credit scholarship program for low income students that has grown to be the largest school choice program in the country.
Nine weeks after starting at her new school, Denisha was on the honor roll â€” quickly rising from a failing student to an "A" student.
Denisha says the scholarship program Governor Bush championed made it possible for her to be the first person from her immediate family to graduate high school and she also graduated college.
Every family, every child, should have the opportunity to find the school that best fits their needs and receive a great education.
