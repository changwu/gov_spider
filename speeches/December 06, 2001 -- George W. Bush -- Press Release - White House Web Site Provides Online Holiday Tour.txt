    The White House today announced the first-ever online tour of the White House on its web site (www.whitehouse.gov). The 360 degree views of the White House State Rooms allow visitors to see the holiday decorations first-hand.
The virtual holiday tour (www.whitehouse.gov/holiday) will provide millions of people an opportunity for an in-depth and detailed look at the unique holiday decorations and historic grandeur of the rooms.
Online visitors can tour the East room, which is accentuated by clusters of snow-covered trees dripping with icicles, snowflakes, and tinsel, and the Blue Room, where the official White House Christmas tree stands. The ornaments are miniature replicas of historic houses from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The tree is also adorned with crystal snowflakes, glass icicles, silver and gold glass balls, and white glass pine cones.
Visitors can also view the dramatic Center and Cross Halls for a dazzling display that includes clusters of spruce trees decorated with miniature white lights, icicles, tinsel and mounds of snow. Online visitors may also view the Red Room, Green Room and the State Dining Room, all decorated for the holidays.
As a special holiday feature, the web site includes a photo essay of the Christmas decorations, a historic look at the White House and National Christmas trees and a collection of Presidential holiday cards dating back from the Hoover Administration.
