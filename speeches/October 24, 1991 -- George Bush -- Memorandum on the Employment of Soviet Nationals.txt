    Presidential Determination No. 92-4
Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Subject: Employment of Soviet Nationals at U.S. Diplomatic and Consular Missions in the Soviet Union
By the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code and section 136 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1986 and 1987 (Public Law 99 - 93) ("the Act"), I hereby determine that implementation of section 136(a) of the Act poses undue practical and administrative difficulties. Consistent with this determination, you are authorized to employ Soviet nationals in nonsensitive areas of the New Embassy Compound in Moscow under strict monitoring by cleared Americans. Further, I delegate to you the responsibility vested in me by section 136(b) of the Act to report to the Congress on circumstances relevant to this determination. Such responsibility may be redelegated within the Department of State.
You are authorized and directed to report this determination to the Congress and to publish it in the Federal Register.
George Bush
