    The President joined Secretary of Education Richard Riley today in naming 141 high school seniors as 1993 Presidential scholars. The scholars, who are recognized for their achievements in academics or the arts, will visit Washington June 19-24 and will be honored at a White House ceremony where each will receive a Presidential scholar medallion.
"These young people represent the best in our country," said the President. "Through hard work and community service they have earned this prestigious award. I look forward to meeting them next month at the White House."
Final selections of the scholars were made by a 32-member Commission on Presidential Scholars chaired by New Jersey Governor Jim Florio. The Commission was appointed by President Clinton earlier this month.
The 141 winners include one young man and one young woman from each State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and from American families living abroad; 15 at-large scholars and 20 scholars in the arts. Academic scholars were selected on the basis of SAT and ACT scores, essays, school recommendations, and transcripts. Arts scholars were identified through an Arts Recognition and Talent Search program conducted by the National Foundation for Advancement in the Arts.
