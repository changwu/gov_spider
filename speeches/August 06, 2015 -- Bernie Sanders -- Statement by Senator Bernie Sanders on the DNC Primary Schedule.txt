    WASHINGTON – Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement today on the Democratic National Committee's announcement of the 2016 primary debate schedule:
"I am disappointed, but not surprised, by the debate schedule announced by the Democratic National Committee. At a time when many Americans are demoralized about politics and have given up on the political process, I think it's imperative that we have as many debates as possible — certainly more than six. I look forward to working with the DNC to see if we can significantly expand the proposed debate schedule."
