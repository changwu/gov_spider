    Chicago, IL - Myrlie Evers-Williams, widow of civil rights leader Medgar Evers, endorsed Senator Barack Obama today citing his unique ability to bring people together and achieve real change we can all believe in.
"I am deeply honored to announce my support for Senator Barack Obama. Over the course of this campaign, I have watched with pride as Barack Obama has inspired a new movement for change. Countless Americans of every race, economic and political background are engaged in our democracy with a passion and commitment not seen for generations.
"Like my husband Medgar Evers and other great leaders of the Civil Rights Movement, Barack Obama embodies a deep well of courage, integrity, compassion, strength and sound judgment. He offers the kind of leadership that we need in the White House as our nation grapples with chronic issues like rising gas and food prices, skyrocketing healthcare costs, a flagging housing market, job insecurity and a misguided Iraq war.
"America is again at a crossroads, and at this moment Medgar's words speak to me with a fierce urgency, 'ËœIs there anything that you believe in strongly enough to stand up and fight for?' Barack Obama is a living testament to Medgar's work. He is the strongest candidate to unite our country around the common challenges we face. That is why I support Barack Obama for president."
Senator Obama: "I am honored to have the support of Mrylie Evers-Williams. Along with her husband Medgar, she laid the groundwork for the Civil Rights Movement in Mississippi, and did so much to advance the cause of equality and justice in this country. Mrylie's tireless efforts to keep her husband's legacy alive and to open up opportunity for all Americans has been a light upon my path as a community organizer, civil rights attorney, and state and U.S. Senator - and their example is one I'll continue looking to in the months ahead and beyond."
