    Harold Washington had a distinguished career in public service. In the Illinois Legislature, the Congress, and as mayor, he dedicated his life to the service of his fellow Chicagoans. He was a dedicated and outspoken leader who guided one of our nation's largest cities through the 1980's.
Harold Washington will truly be missed not only by the people of Chicago but also by many across the country for whom he provided leadership on urban issues. Nancy and I extend our condolences to his family and to the city he served for so long.
