    To the Congress of the United States:
It is my great pleasure to transmit to the Congress the Annual Report of the National Council on the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts for fiscal year 1973.
The cultural heritage of this Nation-enormously rich and diverse---is a strength to millions of Americans who turn to the arts for inspiration, communication, and creative self-expression.
This annual report reflects the vital role which the Government performs in making the arts more available to all our people, by encouraging original fresh expression and sustaining the great traditions of our past artistic accomplishments.
The National Endowment for the Arts has an exceptional record of achievement in advancing the broad artistic development of this Nation, reaching into every State and special jurisdiction. Its funding at $38,200,000 in fiscal year 1973 was nearly a third more than the previous year, and with these additional monies the Endowment was able to continue and expand critically important support for our orchestras, operas, theatres, dance companies, and museums as well as encourage our artists, and open new opportunities for talented young actors and performers.
With the Bicentennial near at hand, the creative gifts of our artists and the production and presentation skills of our great institutions will be indispensable components of the national celebration. Through the arts we will be able to express most fully the ideals of this Nation.
I hope that every Member of the Congress will share my enthusiasm about the many meaningful achievements of the National Council on the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts and will continue to support the Endowment with the resources needed to sustain the cultural heritage of the Nation, and give it abundant opportunity for growth.
