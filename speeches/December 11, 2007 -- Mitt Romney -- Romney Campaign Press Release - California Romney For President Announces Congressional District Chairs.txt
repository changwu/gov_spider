Boston, MA – Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced California Romney for President Congressional District Chairs in all 53 districts across the state. This team will help mobilize Governor Romney's support across the Golden State. They join California Romney for President Co-Chairs Senate Republican Leader Dick Ackerman and Tony Strickland and California Congressional Co-Chairs Congressman McKeon and Congressman Campbell.
"This team of dedicated individuals will play a crucial role in organizing our growing grassroots support in California," said Governor Romney. "Through their efforts, we will talk to California voters about the new generation of challenges facing our nation, and my optimistic vision to overcome them. Together, we will build a stronger America with a strong economy, strong families and a strong military."
