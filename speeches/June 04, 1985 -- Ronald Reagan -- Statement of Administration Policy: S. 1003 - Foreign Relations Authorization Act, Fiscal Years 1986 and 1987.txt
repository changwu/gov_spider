    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
The Administration supports Senate passage of S.1003 but will seek to have certain objectionable provisions deleted or modified during conference. Most importantly, the Administration is concerned with:
— the numerous earmarkings which preclude appropriate flexibility in Executive branch management of foreign affairs;
— section 105, which authorizes funding for the World Commission on Environment and Development, an organization to which the United States is not a party and through which no United States agency conducts or plans to conduct its activities;
— sections 110 and 115 which could enable independent contractors to obtain Federal Employees Compensation Act benefits, thus changing the most basic element of that program — that it provide workers' compensation benefits only for persons who have an employment relationship with the Federal Government; and
— section 121, which mandates issuance of a travel advisory on Mexico, because it reduces flexibility in the management of foreign affairs and would prove counter productive given recent positive steps taken by the Mexican Government.
