There is reserved to the United States the right to occupy such areas of Desecheo Island as may be needed for the establishment of aids to navigation, together with rights for landing and ingress and egress to the areas so occupied by the United States.
In the event that Desecheo Island shall cease to be used for forest reserve and native bird preserve purposes, or be devoted to any other than forest reserve and native bird preserve purposes, the same shall revert to the United States.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
