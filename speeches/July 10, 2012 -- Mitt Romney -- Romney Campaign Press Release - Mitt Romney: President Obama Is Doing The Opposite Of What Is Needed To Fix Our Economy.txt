    "I think that actually New Democrats as well as Republicans have recognized that raising taxes—particularly at a time when the economy is in trouble and jobs are not being created at the rate that's necessary—that raising taxes is the exact opposite course for the nation to take if you want to get America back on track. I mean, the challenge with this president is, in a lot of respects, he's an old style Democrat. The old liberals were always in favor of more government programs, more spending, more borrowing when things were difficult. And we have found that that has not worked." — Mitt Romney

SEAN HANNITY: "Governor, he now has gone back to, again and again, this class warfare argument. Now, tell us what you think this would do to the economy."
MITT ROMNEY: "Well, Sean, I think that actually New Democrats as well as Republicans have recognized that raising taxes—particularly at a time when the economy is in trouble and jobs are not being created at the rate that's necessary—that raising taxes is the exact opposite course for the nation to take if you want to get America back on track. I mean, the challenge with this president is, in a lot of respects, he's an old style Democrat. The old liberals were always in favor of more government programs, more spending, more borrowing when things were difficult. And we have found that that has not worked. The right course for America is not to raise taxes on people, not to go out and borrow excessively, but instead, to live within our means and to have tax policies that encourage job creators and small businesses to grow their business and to add employees. It's unfortunate that we have a president who's really never had any experience in the private sector, has never worked in a small business or a large business to understand what it takes to create jobs."
