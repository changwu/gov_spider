    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell. Hillary joined Rendell to make the announcement during a press conference today at Philadelphia City Hall.
"Hillary Clinton has a proven track record of making change happen, and getting results," said Rendell. "She had a goal of expanding health care to low income children, and as a result, over six million kids nationwide have health insurance today. When she saw that National Guardsmen and Reservists were not receiving adequate health care, she teamed up with Republicans and Democrats and passed legislation guaranteeing them health care, regardless of their deployment status. We need Hillary's results-oriented leadership and commitment to change in the White House to move our country forward."
"I am honored to have the support of Governor Rendell," said Clinton. "I have always admired Governor Rendell's energy, vision, and ability to get the job done, and I'm grateful that he is helping to spread my message of change to the people of Pennsylvania."
Rendell was elected Governor of Pennsylvania in January of 2007. As Governor, he has continued his pursuit to cut wasteful spending and revitalize distressed communities. Rendell served as Mayor of Philadelphia from 1992 to 1999, and was Chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2000.
