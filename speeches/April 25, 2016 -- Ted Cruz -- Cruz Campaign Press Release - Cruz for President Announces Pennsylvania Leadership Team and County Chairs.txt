    HOUSTON, Texas â€” Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today announced his Pennsylvania Leadership Team consisting of statewide leaders, county chairs, and delegate candidates from across the state.
The team is led by State Chairman Lowman Henry, Chairman and CEO of the Lincoln Institute of Public Opinion Research, Inc., a nonprofit public policy foundation based in Harrisburg, PA. Also providing invaluable insight to the team is Vonne Andring, who has worked on campaigns of every level throughout the state.
"We have an exceptional team of grassroots leaders in Pennsylvania that is helping to coalesce conservatives and unite the Republican Party around our campaign," said Cruz. "They have been tireless advocates for freedom and restoring the Constitution, and I deeply appreciate their dedication to helping our campaign throughout the Keystone State."
"Since Pennsylvania's delegates are unbound and elected on the same ballot as the presidential candidates, having a strong, devoted grassroots team is very important here," said State Chairman Lowman Henry. "We have been working tirelessly to ensure that the voters know which delegates will be supporting Ted Cruz at the convention, and are devoting time and effort to make sure they are elected."
