Boston, MA – Today, Romney for President launched its newest television ad, "Change Begins With Us." The ad features Governor Romney talking directly about his belief that change in Washington begins with his fellow Republicans putting their house in order. The Republican Party needs to return to its core conservative principles on issues like fiscal responsibility, ending illegal immigration and upholding ethical standards. By returning to these principles and bringing conservative change to Washington, Republicans and Governor Romney can build a stronger America.
The ad will begin airing as part of the campaign's rotation today in New Hampshire and Iowa later in the week. Script and viewing link are below.
Script For "Change Begins With Us" (TV:30):
GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: "If we're going to change Washington, Republicans have to put our own house in order.
"We can't be like Democrats – a party of big spending.
"We can't pretend our borders are secure from illegal immigration.
"We can't have ethical standards that are a punch line for Jay Leno.
"When Republicans act like Democrats, America loses.
"It's time for Republicans to start acting like Republicans.
"It's time for a change and change begins with us.
"I'm Mitt Romney and I approve this message."
