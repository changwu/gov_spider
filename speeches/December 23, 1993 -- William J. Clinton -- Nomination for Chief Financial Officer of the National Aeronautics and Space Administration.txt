    The President today announced his intention to nominate Arnold G. Holz, assistant comptroller and director of general accounting for the State of Maryland, to be Chief Financial Officer at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
"The depth of experience that Arnold Holz has acquired in 34 years of complex accounting, auditing, and financial reporting activities is a welcomed addition to the Nation's space exploration program as it enters a new era of international cooperation to build a space station and prepares for sustained human exploration of the solar system," the President said.
