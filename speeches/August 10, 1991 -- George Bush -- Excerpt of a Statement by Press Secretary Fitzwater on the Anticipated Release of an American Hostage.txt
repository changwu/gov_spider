    We have seen news reports about the release of American hostages, and we remain hopeful that one or more hostages will be released soon. We are, of course, trying to obtain more information.
The Revolutionary Justice Organization has apparently told the press that it will release a hostage within 72 hours. Past communications and photographs issued in the name of that group have stated that it holds Joseph Cicippio and Edward Tracy. We have no direct information concerning this statement. We continue to receive reports from diplomatic sources that a captive release will occur.
We reiterate that now is the time for all hostages and others held outside of the legal system in the region to be released immediately, unconditionally, and safely for humanitarian reasons. We call on all governments with influence to make this happen.
Our reception team remains in Wiesbaden [Germany] on standby status, and we continue to maintain contacts with the families of all hostages.
We understand that China has announced it intends to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This is something that we have been seeking for a long time. We welcome this development, and we look forward to early ratification by China of the treaty.
