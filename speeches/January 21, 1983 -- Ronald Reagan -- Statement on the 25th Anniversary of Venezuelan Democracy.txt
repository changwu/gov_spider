    On behalf of the people of the United States of America, I extend warm congratulations to the people of Venezuela as they celebrate 25 years of uninterrupted democratic government. The vitality and durability of Venezuela's free institutions are an inspiration to the hemisphere and a reminder to all people that only through periodic and unfettered elections can freedom flourish. It is particularly appropriate that this occasion coincides with another important event honored by all Americansâ€”the 200th anniversary of the birth of Simon Bolivar, whose democratic ideals live in the hearts of all our citizens.
