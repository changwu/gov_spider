    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Florida Congresswoman Corrine Brown.
"Hillary Clinton has the best combination of strength, experience and intellect to be President and lead from her first day in the White House," Brown said. "As she's repeatedly done as Senator, she will bring people together to get results."
First elected to Congress in 1992, Brown has been an outspoken advocate for expanding the Veterans Affairs budget to provide better healthcare and benefits for soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. As Chair of the Transportation Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials, Brown has worked to pass comprehensive rail safety legislation and strengthen America's Homeland Security.
Before her election to Congress, Brown served 10 years in the Florida House of Representatives.
"I admire Corrine's tireless work on behalf of our veterans to ensure they get the health care and benefits they need and deserve" Clinton said. "I am honored to have her support, and I look forward to working together as we bring our message of change across Florida."
