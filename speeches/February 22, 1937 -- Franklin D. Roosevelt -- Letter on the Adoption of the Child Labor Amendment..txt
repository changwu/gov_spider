    Hon. Herbert H. Lehman,
Governor of New York,
Albany, N. Y.
I am informed that the Child Labor Amendment will come up for discussion today at a public hearing before the Judiciary Committee of the Assembly. The bill having passed the Senate I sincerely trust that the Assembly will take similar favorable action as quickly as possible. I hope very much that my own home state will be very prompt in ratification.
