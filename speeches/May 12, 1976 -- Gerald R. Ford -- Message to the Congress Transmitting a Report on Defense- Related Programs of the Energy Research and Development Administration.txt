    To the Congress of the United States:
In response to the requirements of Section 307(b) of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, I am pleased to transmit a comprehensive report concerning the desirability and feasibility of transferring ERDA's defense-related programs to the Department of Defense or other federal agencies. The recommendations of the Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration are also included with the report.
I agree with the judgments of the Administrator and the Secretary and support their recommendations that ERDA retain its current responsibilities for funding and management of the defense-related programs. I have noted the recommendations with respect to the establishment of separate budget planning ceilings for ERDA energy and defense-related activities. I will consider these recommendations in developing my future budgets.
I agree with the recommendations of the Administrator and the Secretary that the Department of Defense should revise its nuclear weapons budget and cost reporting submissions to Congress to specify separately the ERDA costs associated with each new nuclear weapon or nuclear weapons system.
This segregation of costs will make clear to the Congress and to the public the total requirements for national defense purposes. I also agree that it is desirable to review the funding and management arrangements for the ERDA defense-related programs after two or three years of experience to see whether additional changes should be considered.
