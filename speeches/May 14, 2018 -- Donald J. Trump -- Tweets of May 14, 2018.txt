So sad to see the Terror Attack in Paris. At some point countries will have to open their eyes & see what is really going on. This kind of sickness & hatred is not compatible with a loving peaceful & successful country! Changes to our thought process on terror must be made.Retweets: 31816Favorites: 135139

The so-called leaks coming out of the White House are a massive over exaggeration put out by the Fake News Media in order to make us look as bad as possible. With that being said leakers are traitors and cowards and we will find out who they are!Retweets: 26539Favorites: 118557
