    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Today, Senator John Edwards released the following statement expressing his disappointment in Senator Clinton's support for the Peru trade deal:
"I am terribly disappointed by Senator Clinton's support for the Peru trade deal. At a time when millions of Americans are concerned about losing their jobs and the economy, it is dismaying that Senator Clinton would side with corporations, their lobbyists and the Bush Administration in support of a flawed trade deal that expands the NAFTA model.
"As I have said before, there are real and serious differences in this presidential race, and our stands on this trade deal are another example. Whereas voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and all across America have learned that I will fight for safe and smart trade, now they see that Senator Clinton, by supporting this trade deal, has chosen to follow a very different path.
"It's time for Senator Clinton to stand up for working Americans and stop defending corporate lobbyists and a broken system in Washington."
