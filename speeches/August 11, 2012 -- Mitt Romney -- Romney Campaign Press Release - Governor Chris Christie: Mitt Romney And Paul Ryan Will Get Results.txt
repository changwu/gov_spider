    Governor Chris Christie today made the following statement on the selection of Congressman Paul Ryan as Mitt Romney's Vice Presidential running mate:
"With Paul Ryan on the ticket this is a team that understands the economic stagnation our country has been facing the last four years and the urgency with which we need to change course. The Romney-Ryan team is uniquely positioned to make the tough choices necessary to confront our fiscal challenges and get results."
