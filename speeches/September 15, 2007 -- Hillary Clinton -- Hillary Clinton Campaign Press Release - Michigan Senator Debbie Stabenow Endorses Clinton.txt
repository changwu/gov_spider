    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Michigan Senator Debbie Stabenow.
"Hillary Clinton has the experience required to walk into the Oval Office on day one and start delivering the type of change our country needs. She understands the challenges facing our working families, and she has fought her entire life to make sure they have the tools they need to achieve the American Dream. She understands that our manufacturers are the heart and soul of the American middle class and that they deserve our support. I am endorsing Hillary Clinton for President because she is ready to lead, she understands the change that America needs and she has never backed down from a fight."
First elected to the Senate in 2000, Stabenow has been an outspoken advocate for fair trade and a national leader in the fight to make health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans. She led the fight to pass a $2 billion tax credit for U.S. companies who keep jobs at home instead of shipping them overseas, and passed the first-ever ban on oil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes.
Prior to her service in the Senate, Stabenow represented Michigan's Eighth Congressional District from 1996 to 2000, and before that served in the Michigan State Senate, the State House of Representatives and on the Ingham County Board of Commissioners.
As a state legislator, Stabenow was instrumental in passing Michigan's historic property tax cut and small business reforms, as well as nationally acclaimed legislation to protect children and families.
"We need more leaders like Debbie in the Senate, urging the President to change course in Iraq and pushing for health care coverage for all Americans," Clinton said. "I'm honored to have her support."
