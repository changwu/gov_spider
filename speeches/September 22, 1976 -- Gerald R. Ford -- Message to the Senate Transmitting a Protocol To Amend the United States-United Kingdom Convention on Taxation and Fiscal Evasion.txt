    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Protocol signed at London on August 26, 1976, amending the Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital Gains, signed at London on December 31, 1975, as amended by Notes exchanged at London on April 13, 1976. For the information of the Senate, I also transmit a covering report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol.
The Convention, along with the amending Notes and this Protocol, would promote closer cooperation and more active trade between the United States and the United Kingdom.
I urge the Senate to give its advice and consent to ratification to the Convention, the exchange of Notes, and to this Protocol, at any early date.
