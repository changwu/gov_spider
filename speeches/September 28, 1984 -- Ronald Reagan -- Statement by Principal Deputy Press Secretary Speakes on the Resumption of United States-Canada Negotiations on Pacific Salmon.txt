    The President is pleased to announce that negotiations with Canada on Pacific salmon interception will resume in early December.
We have been urged to take this action by regional officials, including Governor Spellman of Washington and the U.S. congressional delegations of the States of Washington, Oregon, and Alaska.
It is our hope that an acceptable agreement would be reached quickly in view of the continuing conservation problems for Chinook salmon stocks.
