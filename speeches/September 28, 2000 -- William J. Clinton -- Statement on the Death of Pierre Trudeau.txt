    I was deeply saddened to learn today of the death of Pierre Trudeau. As Prime Minister for nearly a generation, Pierre Trudeau opened a dynamic new era in Canadian politics and helped establish Canada's unique imprint on the global stage. I know his passing will be felt by all Canadians. Hillary joins me in offering the condolences of the American people to his two sons and to the people of Canada.
