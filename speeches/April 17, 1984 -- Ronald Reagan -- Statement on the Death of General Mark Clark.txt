    I join all Americans in mourning the death of a true American hero, General Mark Clark. As a young officer of infantry on the battlefield in World War I, as one of America's top-ranking commanders in World War II, and as commander in chief of United Nations forces during the Korean conflict, General Clark proudly wore the uniform of an American soldierâ€”with courage, dignity, integrity, and, above all, honor.
General Clark's memory will live forever in the hearts of his countrymen. We are free because of men like him. His professionalism and dedication will be the standard of every soldier who takes the oath to defend our nation.
Nancy and I extend to General Clark's family our deepest sympathies.
