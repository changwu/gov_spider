    Today, Biden for President released a new ad featuring a veteran who was severely injured in a blast while serving overseas and lambasts Trump for his reported comments about American soldiers. The ad will be on television and digital platforms in key battleground states targeting media markets and areas with a high number of military households and veterans, including Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Wisconsin.
The new ad "Sergeant King" features Cedric King, a U.S. Army Master Sergeant (Ret.) who grew up in a small farming town in North Carolina and now lives in Georgia. In the ad, he retells the story about being injured while serving, missing his family, and wondering if he would make it home.
"I gave two legs for this country. I got friends that never came back home. The guys who had their caskets draped with our nation's colors â€” those are the real heroes. And you mean to tell me you call them 'suckers,' 'losers?' With all due respect, I think you missed it on this one." He lauds Joe Biden as someone who understands what it means to serve, and the need to have that understanding in the White House.
Following Donald Trump's reported comments in The Atlantic disparaging American troops and veterans earlier this month, Biden for President launched a digital ad campaign geared towards military families on digital platforms near military bases like Fort McCoy in Wisconsin or Fort Bragg in North Carolina. It also released "Knock On The Door," an ad that highlights a veteran from Florida who was a casualty notification officer.
The campaign remains on television airwaves and digital platforms in a total of 13 states, including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Nebraska, and Minnesota.
