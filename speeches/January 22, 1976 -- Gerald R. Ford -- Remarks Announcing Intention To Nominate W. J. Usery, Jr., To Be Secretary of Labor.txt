    I would like to say, however, that I am very delighted that Bill Usery is going to be the nominee for Secretary of Labor. His long experience as head of the Mediation Service and the tremendous record that he built up over a period of time of working very successfully with both labor and management in the settlement of some of the most difficult disputes in this very controversial area qualifies him superbly to be Secretary of Labor.
I want to thank Bill for assuming this responsibility, and express to you, Bill, the gratitude of not only myself but, I think, the American people. We are very fortunate to have you available and willing to assume this very tough job here, in which we have a number of prospective disputes, legitimate labor-management problems, in the rubber industry, in the automotive industry, in the trucking industry, as well as others. The department will be in very good hands.
Thank you very much.
