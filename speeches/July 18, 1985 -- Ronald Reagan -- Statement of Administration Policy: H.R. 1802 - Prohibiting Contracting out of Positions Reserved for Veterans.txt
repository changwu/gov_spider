    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Gilman (R) New York and 5 others)
The Administration is strongly opposed to enactment of H.R. 1802, which would prevent contracting out for guard, elevator operator, messenger, and custodian positions currently held by veterans, unless qualified veterans are unavailable for such positions.
This would unnecessarily eliminate potentially 40,000 positions from the productivity improvement program of OMB Circular A-76, with savings foregone of upward of $409 million annually. Most veterans in these positions affected by the A-76 program historically have been offered other Government positions and not lost Federal employment.
