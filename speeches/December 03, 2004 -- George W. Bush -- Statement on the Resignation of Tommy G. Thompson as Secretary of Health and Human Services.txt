    I have known Tommy Thompson for many yearsâ€”first when we served as Governors and then as my Secretary of Health and Human Services. He is a friend and a true public servant who worked every day to make Americans healthier and to help more Americans in need achieve the dream of independence and personal responsibility.
He worked to modernize and add prescription drug coverage to Medicare for the first time in the program's history. He focused on expanding services to seniors, people with disabilities, and low-income Americans. He led the effort to broaden the network of community health centers across our country and to advance the development and use of health information technology. Throughout his career as Governor and as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy has led efforts to reform welfare laws and help more people transition from welfare to work.
Tommy has been a stalwart member of my homeland security team, especially through his contributions to our Nation's response to the threat of bioterrorism. And he has done a superb job in our compassionate mission of helping those here and abroad fight the scourge of the HIV/AIDS virus.
Tommy served as Governor of Wisconsin for 14 years and has served as Secretary of Health and Human Services for 4 years, and I appreciate his desire to tackle new challenges. I wish Tommy and Sue Ann all the best.
