    Mitt Romney today announced his Agriculture Advisory Committee.
"Our country's farmers and ranchers provide the most abundant, safest, and affordable food supply of any country in the world," said Mitt Romney. "Not only do they feed our country, they also are responsible for feeding billions of people across the world. They provide jobs for millions of Americans and are an integral part of our economy. Along with these leaders in agriculture, I will work to ensure that our food supply will remain steady, safe, and affordable for our citizens."
Announcing the formation of the Romney Agriculture Advisory Committee, Nebraska Senator Mike Johanns said, "As a former Secretary of Agriculture, I know the important role of our farmers and ranchers in maintaining both a healthy economy and an affordable food supply. Governor Romney understands that agriculture is a key source of strength and stability for our economy, and he is committed to maintaining our country's strong farming heritage. The advisory committee looks forward to providing counsel in this area in the coming months and to welcoming a new era of agricultural policy under a new president."
