    Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness, Mr. Chief Justice, Senator Russell, Senator Fulbright, ladies and gentlemen:
What we are and how we feel today is linked to what happened in a little Greek city 2400 years ago. What was born then in art and ideas and politics has never been surpassed and has seldom been equaled. Everything in the realm of creative thought bears its stamp and its mark. The Western World is the child of Greece and we are its inheritors.
The Greek people are proud people with more reason to be than any other nation on earth. They understand freedom, because their ancestors invented it. They appreciate liberty, because their soil has been watered with the centuries old blood of those who died for it.
When Mrs. Johnson and I visited Greece last year, we saw this modern Greece and we liked what we saw. There in that ancient land was the mingling of the old and the hopeful, the new and the great. Here in the United States thousands upon thousands of Greeks, who are now Americans, have made this land of ours stronger and wiser. Part of Greek culture is now part of the American tradition and America is better for it.
And it is quite appropriate that the courageous King and his beautiful Queen are today's living symbols of the questing Greek conscience; the unquenchable Greek spirit. Yes, the Greeks have a word for it and the word is Frederika, as lovely today as she was that happy afternoon that Mrs. Johnson and I first met her.
So, on this delightful occasion in the presence of so many of her friends and our friends and upon the occasion of Her Majesty's visit with us, and Princess Irene, I should like to ask all of you to rise and lift your glass in a toast to His Majesty the King of Greece.
