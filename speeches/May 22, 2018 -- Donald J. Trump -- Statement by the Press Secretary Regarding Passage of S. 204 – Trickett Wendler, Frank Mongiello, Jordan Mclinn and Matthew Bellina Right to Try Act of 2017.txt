    The President applauds the House of Representatives for passing S. 204 the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 today. This legislation increases access to investigational treatments by amending the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to create a new, alternative pathway for patients with life-threatening illnesses. The President expressed his support for the need for "right to try" legislation in his uplifting State of the Union Address earlier this year, and is happy to deliver on that promise. This Administration believes that treatment decisions for those facing life-threatening illnesses are best made by the patients with the support and guidance of their treating physicians. This legislation advances these principles. Almost forty states have passed their own versions of this important legislation, and we look forward to addressing this at the Federal level. Implementing patient-centered healthcare policies is a priority of this Administration, and we will continue our work to ensure Americans have access to the healthcare options they deserve.
