    Yesterday, the President established an inter-agency group led by the Domestic Policy Council and the National Security Council to increase and better coordinate U.S. Government efforts to counter antisemitism, Islamophobia, and related forms of bias and discrimination within the United States. The President has tasked the inter-agency group, as its first order of business, to develop a national strategy to counter antisemitism.
As President Biden has made clear: antisemitism has no place in America. All Americans should forcefully reject antisemitism – including Holocaust denial – wherever it exists.

I am pleased to see President Biden heeded our call to convene an interagency group and develop a national strategy to combat antisemitism. The steps announced today will go a long way toward improving the United States' ability to combat antisemitism, helping to keep communities safe and eradicate hate…" [Statement, 12/12/22]
California Senator Dianne Feinstein: "I strongly support President Biden's decision to establish an interagency group to coordinate against the rise in hate, bias and discrimination in the United States.

The FBI today released its annual report on hate crimes in the United States. The report shows that hate crimes based on race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation and other characteristics occur far too frequently. Hate and intolerance have no place in our country, and I'm pleased the Biden administration is taking additional steps to combat it." [Statement, 12/12/22]
