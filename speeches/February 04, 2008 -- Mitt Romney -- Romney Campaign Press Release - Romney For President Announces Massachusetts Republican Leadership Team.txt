Boston, MA â€“ Today, Republican leaders from across Massachusetts announced their continued support of Governor Mitt Romney. Governor Romney has the overwhelming support from Massachusetts elected and grassroots leaders across the state. These men and women have been instrumental in expanding Governor Romney's grassroots organization in the state ahead of the February 5th primary.
"I am proud to have the overwhelming support of Massachusetts Republicans from across the state. Together, we fought to lower taxes, cut government spending, improve education, reform health care and strengthen families in Massachusetts," said Governor Romney. "With their help, I'll be able to bring those same proven conservative principles to our nation's capitol and bring real conservative change to Washington."
Former Lt. Governor Kerry Healey added, "Governor Romney continues to have the backing of Massachusetts Republicans because we saw first hand the leadership he brought to our state after inheriting a nearly $3 billion dollar deficit and state spending that was out of control. We are all proud to support his campaign for the White House because we know he'll bring that same executive experience and determination to Washington to overcome the real challenges facing our nation."
