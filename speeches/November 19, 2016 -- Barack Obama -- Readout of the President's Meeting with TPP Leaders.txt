    President Obama met with the Leaders of the 11 other Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) countries today and discussed the United States' continued strong support for trade, our commitment to strengthening ties to the Asia-Pacific, and the need to remain engaged in an increasingly interconnected world. President Obama discussed his support of high-standard trade agreements like TPP, which level the playing field for American workers and advance our interests and values in the economically dynamic and strategically-significant Asia-Pacific region. The President commended those TPP leaders who have already successfully worked with their legislatures to move forward with TPP approval. President Obama conveyed that as we continue to engage globally, we must also continue to find ways to ensure that trade agreements contribute to our shared objective of reducing inequality. President Obama urged his fellow Leaders to continue to work together to advance TPP and other policies that achieve these shared goals.
