    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Kennedy (D) MA and Simpson (R) WY)
The Administration supports reauthorization of the refugee resettlement assistance programs, and favors enactment of S. 1248, with two amendments:

— deletion of the provision in the bill that would advance the date for the President to report to Congress his recommendations on refugee admissions to "not later than June 1" from "before the start of each fiscal year." The Administration supports ongoing consultation with the Congress on refugee admissions. However, a requirement to provide an accurate and comprehensive estimate of the regional and worldwide ceilings four months before the start of the fiscal year would detract from the objectives and intent of the Refugee Act. The Act calls for review of worldwide refugee conditions, policies, and programs to ensure that the admission levels and programs are appropriate to the circumstances. Advancing the date for reporting the recommended levels to June 1 would make it considerably more difficult to fulfill that purpose.
— deletion of the provision extending the authorization for assistance to States and counties for incarceration of certain Cuban nationals. This should not be a Federal responsibility.
