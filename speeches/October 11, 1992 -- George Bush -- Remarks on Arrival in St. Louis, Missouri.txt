    The President. Hey, listen, thank you for this great welcome, a marvelous sendoff for the big debate, and the countdown to the election. I'm absolutely convinced we're going to win this election. I believe we're going to win the election because we are right on the issues. Our record is good, and we're not going to let this guy distort it anymore.
You know, the only way they can win is if they try to convince the American people that America is in decline. That's what they're telling us. We are number one; we're going to make life better for everybody. But don't let them tell you things are bad. It is so sick.
Thank you all very much. Keep your TV's on. Thanks a lot.
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
