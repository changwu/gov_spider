    Las Vegas, NV - The Obama campaign announced that it has begun running two new ads in Nevada. The 30-second campaign ad entitled "President" features Barack Obama detailing his vision for change: affordable health care for all Americans, tax breaks for workers, not companies, and an end to the war in Iraq.
"Would," also 30 seconds, serves as a both a testament to Obama's past record and a declaration of what he will achieve as President. It details his opposition to the Iraq War from the start and his success in passing ethics reform to reduce the power of lobbyists, concluding with a promise to unite the nation and bring change we can believe in.

Paid for by Obama for America. Message approved by Barack Obama.


V/O: Five years ago, he said what the others would not, opposing the rash and reckless war in Iraq; warning that it would not make us safer.
In Washington, he did what the others could not, taking dead aim at the power of lobbyists; passing the farthest-reaching ethics reforms in a generation.
And as President, he'll do what the others cannot, unite a divided nation, repair our standing in the world and bring change we can believe in.
Barack: I'm Barack Obama and I approved this message.
