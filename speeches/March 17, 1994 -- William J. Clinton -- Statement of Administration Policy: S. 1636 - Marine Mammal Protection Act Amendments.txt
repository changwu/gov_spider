    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Kerry (D) Massachusetts and 2 others)
The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 1636. The Administration looks forward to working with the Senate and House to promptly resolve any outstanding issues in the final version of the legislation.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
S. 1636 affects receipts and direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary estimate is that S. 1636 would reduce the deficit by less than $500,000 per year over fiscal years 1994-1998.
