    Presidential Determination No. 95-17
Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense
Subject: Drawdown of Commodities and Services from the Inventory and Resources of the Department of Defense to Support Activities of the Palestinian Police Force
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 552(c)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2348a(c)(2) (the "Act"), I hereby determine that:
(1) as a result of an unforeseen emergency, the provision of assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act in amounts in excess of funds otherwise available for such assistance is important to the national interests of the United States; and
(2) such unforeseen emergency requires the immediate provision of assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act.
I therefore direct the drawdown of commodities and services from the inventory and resources of the Department of Defense of an aggregate value not to exceed $5 million to provide and transport 200 vehicles and concurrent spare parts to Israel for use by the Palestinian police force.
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to report this determination to the Congress and to arrange for its publication in the Federal Register.
William J. Clinton
