    Allows grace period for regulatory complianceLAKE JACKSON, Texas - This week, 2012 Republican Presidential candidate, Congressman Ron Paul introduced a bill on the House Floor that would alleviate the onerous regulations the federal government imposes on small businesses, which are the backbone of the U.S. economy.H.R. 3267, the Protect Small Business Jobs Act of 2011, would grant small businesses a six-month grace period to comply with federal regulations.
Speaking about the bill on the House floor, Congressman Paul said:
"At a time of continuing high unemployment and stagnant growth, doesn't it make sense to give small businesses a reasonable time to comply with federal regulations rather than just hitting them with job-destroying fines and legal bills?
"I hope all my colleagues will stand up for small businesses and their current and potential employees by cosponsoring the Protect Small Business Jobs Act."
