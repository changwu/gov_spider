Boston, MA - Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement on the vote in the U.S. Senate setting an Iraq withdrawal timeline:
"Today, the Democrats in the Senate have joined House Democrats in sending to the President a bill setting a date for surrender. In their attempt to micromanage the men and women in our military from Washington, Democrats in Congress have settled on a policy that demoralizes our troops, emboldens our enemies and jeopardizes the prospects for success in Iraq. I urge the President to veto this bill and send a strong message to our troops that we stand with them.
"The policy that the Democrats in Congress have embraced is both reckless and dangerous. We must also thank those Senators who recorded their support for our troops and voted against this timeline for withdrawal."
