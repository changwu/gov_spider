    HOUSTON, Texas – Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today announced the endorsement of Congressman Raúl Labrador of Idaho. He was elected to the Idaho House of Representatives in 2006 and elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010. Congressman Labrador is a leader in the House Freedom Caucus. During his time in Congress Labrador has fought for tax reform, fiscal responsibility, transparency in government and the protection of civil and religious liberties.
"Senator Ted Cruz has always been a stalwart defender of the constitution and a tireless advocate for conservative principles," said Rep. Labrador. "Americans know Washington is broken. Ted Cruz is the only candidate that will truly change the way Washington works, restore the balance of power between the presidency and the American people, and advance the principles of freedom and liberty for all Americans, not just the privileged few. It's time for all conservatives to unite behind the one candidate that can win in November and defeat the Washington establishment."
"Raúl is a passionate advocate for liberty who has spent his time in Congress fighting for the freedoms of Idahoans and for all Americans," said Cruz. "He has continuously stood up and fought for conservative principles like limited government, reigning in Obama's lawlessness, defunding Obamacare and protecting life and marriage. We need more leaders in Washington like him, working to restore the power back to the American people from the Washington establishment. I am thrilled to have his support for our campaign and look forward to working together to restore this country to the principles it was founded upon."
