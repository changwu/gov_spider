    Yesterday, the Biden Administration announced a set of historic actions across six agencies to phase down super-polluting hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), bolster the competitiveness of American industries, and maintain and create hundreds of thousands of good-paying, union jobs across the country. And, the Environmental Protection Agency released a final rule to implement the bipartisan American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act and phase down the production and consumption of HFCs by 85% below baseline levels within the next 15 years.
This landmark climate protection program is expected to provide cumulative benefits of $272 billion and reduce emissions by 4.5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent by 2050—equal to nearly three years of U.S. power sector emissions at 2019 levels.
Leaders from across the country, environmental organizations and advocates, and business and manufacturing leaders applauded President Biden's leadership on reducing climate pollution from HFCs and supporting U.S. industries and workers.
See below for what they are saying:
Business and Manufacturing Leaders: 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy, American Chemistry Council, and National Association of Manufacturers: "We applaud the EPA for finalizing a balanced HFC Allocation Rule on time, a critical step in phasing down hydrofluorocarbons over the next fifteen years and a win-win for both the climate and the economy. The plan allows U.S. manufacturers to maintain a technological advantage over foreign competitors in the global marketplace in supporting an appropriate transition, while creating thousands of new and good paying jobs in the U.S. When aligned with international efforts, this phasedown will help avoid up to 0.5 degrees Celsius rise in temperature, important to meeting global climate ambitions." [Press Release, 9/23/21]
Karen Meyers, Chairman of the Board, Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy & Vice President, Rheem Manufacturing: "This rule is the critical first milestone in the implementation of the AIM Act, which became law in December 2020. We applaud the EPA and the entire Biden Administration for its effort to meet the first statutory deadline for its promulgation." [Press Release, 9/23/21]
Kevin Fay, Executive Director, Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy: "We look forward to reviewing the final allocation rule in full detail and working with EPA to achieve a smooth phasedown as it also initiates efforts on user sector rules and refrigerant management." [Press Release, 9/23/21]
Stephen Yurek, President & CEO, Air-Conditioning, Heating & Refrigeration Institute: "AHRI and its member manufacturers that produce and use hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants are pleased that the EPA finalized the allocation rule on time, as required by the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act. Predictability is a very important aspect of the manufacturing process, and this timely rule ensures that our member companies are aware of this regulatory terrain for the coming years. This rule is a critical step in the 15-year industry-supported process of phasing down HFCs and represents a win for both the climate and the American economy. We are hopeful that the administration will soon submit the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol – the treaty that underpins the AIM Act – to the United States Senate and continue the process of putting the United States on record with the majority of the world's nations in support of this global phase down." [Press Release, 9/23/21]
Household & Commercial Products Association: "HCPA recognizes the importance of the AIM Act, and is committed to working with member companies to phasedown the use of HFCs, while still providing consumers and workers with the trusted and familiar products that they rely on to live clean and healthy lives." [Press Release, 9/23/21]

This will make a huge difference in fighting the climate crisis." [Tweet, 9/23/21]
Florida Congressman Darren Soto: "Proud to work in @EnergyCommerce on a new law targeting reducing hydrofluorocarbons. Now @POTUS and @EPA are using new authority to reduce this dangerous greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change at a rate thousands of times more than CO2." [Tweet, 9/23/21]
California Congressman Mike Levin: "I'm glad to see this. It's one of many steps we must take to drastically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. #ClimateAction" [Tweet, 9/23/21]
California Congressman Scott Peters: "I co-introduced the AIM Act in 2020 to phase down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)—powerful heat-trapping chemicals. Today, @WhiteHouse & @EPA revealed plans to implement the bill. These actions are some of the most consequential steps we can take to combat the climate crisis. Over the years, I've made it a priority to tackle these harmful substances and eliminate them from our atmosphere. I'm thrilled to see how this legislation will make a difference for generations to come. Let's keep the momentum going." [Tweet, 9/23/21]
Environmental Organizations and Advocates:
Avipsa Mahapatra, Climate Campaign Lead, Environmental Investigation Agency: "We have repeatedly seen how environmental crime can fundamentally undermine the best efforts to protect our climate. This is a groundbreaking effort to fight crime in climate pollutants by combining the latest technology with the broad cooperation necessary to deliver on U.S. climate goals." [Press Release, 9/23/21]
David Doniger, Senior Strategic Director, Climate & Clean Energy Program, Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC): "The EPA is moving fast to phase down production and import of super-polluting HFCs. This meets the central requirement of the bipartisan AIM Act, which passed last year with broad support from industry, states, and environmental advocates. Moving from HFCs to climate-friendlier alternatives is an important part of President Biden's plan to meet the climate crisis by cutting America's heat-trapping emissions at least in half by 2030—with big benefits for jobs, our health and a safer future." [Press Release, 9/23/21]
Debbie Weyl, Deputy Director, World Resources Institute United States: "The Biden Administration's new rules to phase down hydrofluorocarbons could not come soon enough. Hydroflourocarbons are thousands of times more potent as a warming agent than carbon dioxide, so replacing these with more climate-friendly alternatives is essential for the United States to achieving its climate goals. These new rules bring U.S. policy in line with the requirements of the Kigali Amendment, an international agreement joined by more than 120 countries to reduce the consumption and use of these powerful pollutants. The phasedown is supported by leading American businesses and could result in thousands of good-paying jobs and enhance the competitiveness of American industry on the global stage. If all countries do their part to successfully phase-down hydroflourocarbons, these efforts alone could avoid up to half a degree Celsius of global warming by the end of this century." [Press Release, 9/23/21]
Jason Schwartz, Legal Director, Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University School of Law: "This rule is hugely beneficial for both the climate and American businesses. Phasing out these superpollutants is expected to help avoid nearly $300 billion dollars' worth of climate damages, and U.S. companies are projected to profit from the phasedown program as demand for domestically produced substitutes increases. The rule is a major milestone in U.S. policy since any meaningful strategy to tackle climate change must address for HFCs as well as other sources of climate pollution." [Press Release, 9/23/21]
John Podesta, Founder, Center for American Progress: "President Joe Biden and his administration took a major step forward today to address climate change. Left unchecked, the super-pollutants targeted by today's actions would have continued to aid in the destabilization of our climate with an intensity that is 1,000 times greater than carbon dioxide. We are facing a worldwide crisis, and that requires the kind of whole-of-government response that prioritizes public health, American competitiveness, and well-paying union jobs that we've seen from this administration. We cannot delay action on climate change any longer—the United States must lead the way in building a clean future." [Press Release, 9/23/21]
Matthew Davis, Senior Director of Government Affairs, League of Conservation Voters: "Today brings another example of how the Biden-Harris administration is using their all of government approach to tackle climate change by slashing emissions of super-pollutant HFCs and driving innovation and clean tech jobs here in the U.S. This critical action, which implements the bipartisan American Innovation and Manufacturing Act enacted by Congress last year, will help protect those communities, often low wealth communities and communities of color, who are most vulnerable to the damaging impacts of climate change. From the 'code red for humanity' IPCC report to devastating extreme weather and long-standing environmental and racial injustice and economic inequality, it's never been more urgent or more important to act on climate. Congress needs to keep up the momentum by moving forward with the Build Back Better Act, which would put us on the path to reducing our emissions 50 percent by 2030, as science and justice require." [Press Release, 9/23/21]
Mindy Lubber, CEO & President, Ceres: "Kudos to @POTUS @Gina_McCarthy @EPAMichaelRegan for moving to address problem of HFCs. Crucial step forward." [Tweet, 9/23/21]
Taryn Finnessey, Policy Director, U.S. Climate Alliance: "The U.S. Climate Alliance welcomes the EPA's finalization of this rule to phase down highly-potent HFCs across the country. National standards will ensure all communities have access to higher quality products, and that we are giving U.S. industry the best opportunity to innovate and lead the global transition to HFC alternatives. Alliance states have been leading the charge in reducing HFC emissions in recent years and now have a strong federal partner in this push. It's a win for jobs, a win for our economy and it will help us achieve our bold state and federal climate goals." [Press Release, 9/23/21]
