    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Seiberling (D) Ohio and 121 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 1373, because naming units of the National Park System after former Members of Congress is contrary to the policy Congress has followed since the first National Park was established in 1872 and Congress has already dedicated the Golden Gate National Recreation Area to Phillip Burton.
