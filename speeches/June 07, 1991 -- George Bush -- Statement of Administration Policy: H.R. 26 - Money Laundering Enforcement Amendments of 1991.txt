    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 6/10/91)(House)(Annunzio (D) Illinois and 10 others)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 26, but will seek Senate amendments to:

Modify section 35 to overcome Administration objections, including: (1) failure to resolve the status of section 4702 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988; (2) failure to clarify that the term "adequate records" does not apply solely to currency transaction records; and (3) placing too much emphasis on the importance of bilateral agreements as a measure of progress on money laundering.
Change the Bank Secrecy Act as necessary to implement recommendations of the G-7 Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering that have been agreed to by the United States.
Modify section 30, which provides for the civil forfeiture of fungible property, to eliminate potential serious repercussions for the banking system.
