    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107-243) and as part of my effort to keep the Congress fully informed, I am providing a report prepared by my Administration on matters relevant to that resolution including on matters relating to planning for post-liberation Iraq under section 7 of the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-338). The report also discusses recent developments in the areas previously reported pursuant to section 3 of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1) on our efforts to obtain compliance by Iraq with the resolutions adopted by the United Nations Security Council.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
