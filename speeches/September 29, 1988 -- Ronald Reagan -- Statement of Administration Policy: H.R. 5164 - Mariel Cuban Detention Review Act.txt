    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Mazzoli (D) Kentucky and 6 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 5164 because it would require an unnecessary and costly administrative review of decisions to detain Mariel Cubans. Existing law and administrative procedures already provide sufficient safeguards against improper detainment. In particular, detainment decisions are reviewed pursuant to the Attorney General's Status Review Plan, the Cuban Review Plan and the Departmental Release Review Program.
