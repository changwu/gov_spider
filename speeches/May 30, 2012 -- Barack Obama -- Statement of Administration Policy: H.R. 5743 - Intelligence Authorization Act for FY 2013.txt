(House Rules)
(Rep. Rogers, R-MI)
The Administration appreciates the continued support of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence for intelligence activities, and notwithstanding the concerns outlined below, does not oppose House passage of H.R. 5743, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2013.
The Administration has serious concerns with the amounts authorized in the classified annex, particularly if these funding levels were included in an appropriations bill, because they exceed the President's Budget. Further, the Administration objects to unrequested authorizations for some classified programs that were reduced in the President's Budget because they are lower in priority and would support deficit reduction efforts. The Administration asks the congressional committees to ensure that the final amounts appropriated for the Intelligence Community for FY 2013 are authorized.
The Administration appreciates that the bill repeals some dated and obsolete statutory reporting requirements. Further reducing unnecessary reporting requirements will help to alleviate the burden associated with these requirements in a resource-constrained environment.
The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address its concerns.
