    The President was saddened to learn yesterday of the death of Norwegian Foreign Minister Johan Jurgen Holst. Throughout his long and distinguished career, Minister Holst was one of the world's leading experts and wisest thinkers on international security issues. As his nation's defense minister, head of a leading research institute, and foreign minister, he was in the forefront of those designing and implementing international security policies during the cold war and adapting those policies to the post-cold-war period.
Americans remember him best for his leading role in the Israeli-PLO negotiations that led to the breakthrough in the Middle East peace process last September. The President was proud to have the opportunity to honor Minister Holst at the White House signing ceremony on September 13.
The White House expresses its deepest sympathies to the family and friends of this great statesman.
