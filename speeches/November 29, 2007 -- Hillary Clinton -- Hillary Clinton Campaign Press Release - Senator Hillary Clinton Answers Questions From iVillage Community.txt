    Shares Wisdom & Photos From Her Life As A Mother, Wife, Daughter, First Lady And Senator
WHAT: Earlier this year, iVillage.com, the first and largest community of women online, gave its members a chance to submit questions they'd like to ask Senator Clinton. The response was overwhelming, with questions that ranged in focus, from her life at home to how to overcome child poverty in the US.
WHEN & WHERE: The most compelling questions, along with 10 special photos that span Senator Clinton's life and career, are part of a special feature, "Hillary Clinton: You Asked, She Answered," launching today on the site at www.ivillage.com/ivillagecares and http://slideshow.ivillage.com.
The feature is part of the iVillage Cares initiative: www.ivillage.com/ivillagecares, which connects women around the world to each other to effect change. Recently, as part of iVillage Cares, iVillage published a journal from Laura Bush describing her trip to Africa, and Condoleezza Rice also answered questions from the iVillage community.
