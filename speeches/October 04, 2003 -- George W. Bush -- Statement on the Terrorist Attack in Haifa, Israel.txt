    I condemn unequivocally the vicious act of terrorism committed today in Haifa, Israel.
This murderous action, aimed at families gathered to enjoy a Sabbath lunch, killed and injured dozens of men, women, and children.
This despicable attack underscores once again the responsibility of Palestinian authorities to fight terror, which remains the foremost obstacle to achieving the vision of two states living side by side in peace and security. The new Palestinian Cabinet must dedicate itself to dismantling the infrastructure of terror and preventing the kind of murderous actions that we witnessed today.
The American people join me in expressing condolences to Prime Minister Sharon and all the people of Israel and in reiterating our common dedication to the cause of fighting terrorism.
