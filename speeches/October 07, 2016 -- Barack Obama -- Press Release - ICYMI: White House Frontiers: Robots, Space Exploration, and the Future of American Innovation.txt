    WASHINGTON, DC – The Office of Science and Technology Policy posted the following White House blog on the White House Frontiers Conference, a national convening that the White House is co-hosting with the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University to explore the future of innovation here and around the world. You can view the blog HERE.
President Obama will travel to Pittsburgh, PA, on October 13 to host the White House Frontiers Conference, bringing together the Nation's top innovators to discuss how new frontiers in science and technology will help improve lives and shape the future. Today, we're excited to announce more details about the event, which will include voices from five frontiers of innovation—personal, local, national, global, and interplanetary. From developing personalized treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's or cancer, to harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to improve lives, to sending humans to Mars, the conference will explore innovations that hold the potential to address some of the world's most pressing challenges and keep America on the cutting edge. 
The White House is co-hosting the Frontiers Conference with the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). The event will include topics inspired by the November issue of WIRED, where guest-editor President Obama will explore the theme of "Frontiers" that will shape the coming decades.
