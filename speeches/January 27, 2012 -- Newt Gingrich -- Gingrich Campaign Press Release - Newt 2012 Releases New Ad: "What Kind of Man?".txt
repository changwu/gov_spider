    Fact Sheet: Mitt's Five Falsehoods (and counting) from CNN Debate
Ad Transcript:
Governor Huckabee: "If a man's dishonest to get a job, he'll be dishonest on the job." (SOURCE)
Narrator: What kind of man would mislead, distort, and deceive just to win an election?
This man would. Mitt Romney. Romney said he has always voted Republican when he had the opportunity.
But in the 1992 Massachusetts Primary, Romney had the chance to vote for George H.W. Bush or Pat Buchanan, but he voted for a liberal Democrat instead. (SOURCE)
Romney said his investments in Fannie and Freddie were in a blind trust.
But as reported in the National Journal, Romney earned tens of thousands of dollars from investments NOT in a blind trust. (SOURCE)
Romney denied seeing a false ad his campaign used to attack Newt Gingrich. But Romney's own campaign paid for the ad...and Romney's own voice is on the ad approving the content. (SOURCE)
If we can't trust what Mitt Romney says about his own record, how can we trust him on anything?
Closing Slide: ...and that's why he'll lose to Obama.
