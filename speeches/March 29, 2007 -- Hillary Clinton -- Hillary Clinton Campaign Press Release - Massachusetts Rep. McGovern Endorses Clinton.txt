    Calls Hillary Best Candidate to End War in Iraq
The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Massachusetts Congressman Jim McGovern.
"This is a bold, groundbreaking, history-making candidacy," McGovern said. "I believe Hillary will be a great president."
An outspoken opponent of the war in Iraq, McGovern has been a leading voice in Congress urging President Bush to stop the escalation of troops and bring an end to the war.
"All of us hope this war will be over before January 2009, but if it isn't, President Hillary Clinton will end this war," McGovern said.
In Congress, McGovern has pushed to expand tuition assistance for college students, increase access to affordable health care for working families and protect and strengthen Social Security. He was the first member of the Massachusetts delegation to endorse Deval Patrick in his successful bid for governor.
McGovern pledged to mobilize his supporters on behalf of Clinton, and campaign in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and across New England.
McGovern is vice chairman of the House Rules Committee and a regional whip for the Democratic leadership. Before being elected to Congress in 1997, McGovern served 14 years as a senior aide to Rep. Joseph Moakley of Massachusetts.
"Congressman McGovern has shown the courage to stand up to President Bush and demand that he change course in Iraq," Clinton said. "I'm proud to have his support as we work together to end the war in Iraq and bring our troops home safely."
