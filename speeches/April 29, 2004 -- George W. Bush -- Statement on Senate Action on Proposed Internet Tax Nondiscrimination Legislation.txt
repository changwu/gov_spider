    I commend the Senate for moving forward to expand access to broadband technology. The ''Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act'' is an important step toward permanently banning access taxes on broadband that will help make high-speed Internet services more affordable, increase the number of broadband users, and enhance our Nation's economic competitiveness.
