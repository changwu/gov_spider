    Washington, DC -- Hillary Clinton issued the following statement honoring the 105th anniversary of Cuban Independence:
"May 20th marks the anniversary of Cuban Independence, a day in which Cubans in the United States and all around the world commemorate the sacrifices of the patriots that fought to free their homeland. But this cannot be a celebration because today the Cuban people continue to struggle for freedom from the brutal dictatorship under which their island lives.
"It is a tragedy that to stay in power, the Cuban dictatorship still seeks to dominate and control its own very talented people. My hope is for the Cuban people to soon enjoy the same freedoms and rights that we do. I send my heartfelt wishes and solidarity in their struggle for freedom and democracy."
