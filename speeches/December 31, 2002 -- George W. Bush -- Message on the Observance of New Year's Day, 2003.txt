    The past year has been a time of achievement, progress, and renewed hope for the American people. As our citizens continue to demonstrate a spirit of resolve and unity, we are building a culture of service, citizenship, and responsibility that strengthens our country and offers hope to those in need. To counter new threats, we are enhancing security at home, and we are part of the global coalition against terrorism that has made significant progress in opposing the forces of tyranny and oppression.
We will continue our efforts to secure America, win the war on terrorism, focus on education, promote compassion, create new jobs, and ensure the economic security of all our citizens. As we move forward into the New Year, I encourage all Americans to give thanks to the Almighty for His many blessings, and to join with me in reaffirming our commitment to helping people around the world achieve peace and freedom.
At the dawn of this New Year, America is a land of justice, liberty, and tolerance. We will work together to build on our successes and embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a Happy New Year. May God bless you, and may God continue to bless the United States.
GEORGE W. BUSH
