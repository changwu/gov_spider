    To the Congress of the United States:
Forwarded herewith in accordance with the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1124 are. reports of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation on awards made during Fiscal Year 1975 to members of the Armed Forces for suggestions, inventions and scientific achievements.
Participation by military personnel in the cash awards program was authorized by the Congress in 1965. More than 1.76 million suggestion submissions since that time attest to the success which the program has had as a means of motivating military personnel to seek ways of reducing costs and improving efficiency. Of those suggestions submitted, more than 275,000 have been adopted with resultant tangible first-year benefits in excess of $873,000,000.
Of the 125,777 suggestions which were submitted by military personnel (including Coast Guard military personnel) during Fiscal Year 1975, 20,760 were adopted. Cash awards totaling $1,442,536 were paid for these adopted suggestions, based not only on the tangible first-year benefits of $74,347,607.94 which were realized therefrom, but also on many additional benefits and improvements of an intangible nature. Enlisted personnel received $1,175,908.50 in awards, which represents 81 percent of the total cash awards paid. The remaining 19 percent was received by officer personnel and amounted to $266,627.50.
Attached are reports of the Secretary of the Defense and the Secretary of Transportation containing statistical information on the military awards program and brief descriptions of some of the more noteworthy contributions made by military personnel during Fiscal Year 1975.
