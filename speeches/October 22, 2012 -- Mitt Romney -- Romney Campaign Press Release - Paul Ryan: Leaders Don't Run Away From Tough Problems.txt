PAUL RYAN: "We can do this. We can turn things around. We can get the economy growing. We can fix this mess in Washington. It takes leadership. Mitt Romney and I are not going to run away from these problems. We are going to run to these problems, to solve these problems, before they get out of our control. That's what leaders do. We're not going to kick the can down the road. We're going to lead. And I'll tell you what, we're not going to spend the next four years blaming other people for our problems. We're going to take responsibility. No more excuses; no more blaming."
