    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(McCain (R) Arizona and 18 cosponsors)
The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 1618.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
S. 1618 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary PAYGO estimate is that the net effect of S. 1618 on the deficit would be negligible.
