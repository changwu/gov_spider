    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Michigan Congresswoman Candice Miller.
"I'm honored to have the endorsement of Congresswoman Miller," said Mitt Romney. "A tireless advocate for her district and the state of Michigan, Candice Miller agrees with me that our nation's top priorities must be to get our economy moving again and keeping America strong and secure. In her leadership on the Homeland Security Committee she is at the forefront of protecting our borders while also promoting trade that will help our economy grow. Congresswoman Miller has worked diligently to advance Michigan's and our nation's economic recovery and I am glad to have her strong support."
"Mitt Romney is the person we need to lead our country," said Congresswoman Miller. "Throughout this primary process the voters have vetted each candidate and after a spirited contest they have made clear who they believe is right person to lead our ticket and that is Governor Mitt Romney. I believe they have come to this conclusion because they know that Governor Romney will begin working on day one to turn around our economy. I know the challenges our country faces and I know Mitt Romney can change our nation's course. I'm proud to stand with Governor Romney and offer him my strong support. I look forward to working with him to enact his agenda as he leads our nation as the next President of the United States."
