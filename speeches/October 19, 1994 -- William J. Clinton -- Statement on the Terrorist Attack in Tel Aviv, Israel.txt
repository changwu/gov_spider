    The terrorist bombing this morning in Tel Aviv is an outrage against the conscience of the world. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Government and people of Israel at this terrible moment, especially the families of those killed and wounded in this criminal act.
This attack comes at a moment when we are rejoicing in the progress which has been made toward a real and lasting peace in the Middle East. The terrorists who committed this act are enemies of that peace and enemies of all those who are working to create a better future for the people of the region. Their violence is aimed at destroying the hopes of the Palestinian people as surely as it is directed at the people of Israel. They must not be allowed to succeed. I call upon leaders in the Middle East and throughout the world to condemn this act and to ensure that there is no haven or support for those responsible. Together, we will ensure that the promise of peace for which we have worked so long is realized.
