    I am sorry to learn that Dr. Janet Yellen intends to resign as Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. Her extraordinary intellect and keen grasp of domestic and international economics have contributed enormously to the formation of my administration's policies in critical areas ranging from Social Security, health care, and the budget to trade and international financial architecture. Janet has been a consistent advocate for sound economic policy, and she has been an important contributor to the extraordinary economic progress we have made in recent years. I wish her and George the very best as they return to private life.
