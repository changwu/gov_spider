    Congresswoman Barbara Lee from California is endorsing Senator Kamala Harris's presidential campaign. Lee is a progressive leader, member of Democratic House leadership, and former Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. She has represented California in Congress for more than 20 years.
"When I was a young single mother attending Mills College, I invited Shirley Chisholm to come to speak on campus and was inspired to later work on her presidential campaign. I threw all my energy and support behind a visionary Black woman committed to making America work for all its people. Shirley set us on a path toward progress, and now Senator Kamala Harris picks up the baton," said Congresswoman Lee. "As just the third African American woman from a major party to run for President, I am so proud to endorse her candidacy as she continues this fight for equality, fairness, and dignity for all Americans. Watching Kamala's career in the East Bay and San Francisco for 20 years, I've witnessed her deep passion for justice and opportunity, and I know she will be a president truly of the people, by the people, and for the people. She will increase working Americans' incomes, expand health insurance to more Americans, and restore dignity and responsibility to the Oval Office. She is a leader uniquely qualified to bring us together and mobilize a movement of Americans to return power to the people."
Lee will be California Co-Chair of Harris's campaign. She joins California Members of Congress Nanette Barragan, Katie Hill and Ted Lieu, as well as 21 members of the California State Senate Democratic Caucus including Senate Pro Tem Toni Atkins, in endorsing Harris's campaign.
