    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Schroeder (D) CO and 22 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4033 because it would cause massive disruption of current Federal employee whistleblower procedures, clog the calendar of the Merit Systems Protection Board, and seriously overburden the courts with Federal employee personnel matters without any previous administrative review.
