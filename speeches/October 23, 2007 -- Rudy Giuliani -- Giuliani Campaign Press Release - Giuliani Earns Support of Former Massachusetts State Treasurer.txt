    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that Joe Malone, the former Massachusetts State Treasurer, has endorsed Mayor Giuliani for President. Malone has long been active in Bay State Republican politics, having served two terms as State Treasurer during the 1990s.
"Rudy has a record of results he can point to when it comes to cutting taxes and controlling spending. He is without question the fiscal conservative in the race," said Malone. "I am endorsing Rudy because he will keep his eye on the bottom line when he becomes President â€“ just as he did when he was Mayor."
"Joe Malone's endorsement of the Mayor reflects continued strong momentum for Rudy's campaign, in New England and across the country. Seeing another former statewide Massachusetts elected official back Mayor Giuliani speaks volumes about the strength of his candidacy. It is an honor to have Joe's support," said Michael DuHaime, Giuliani's National Campaign Manager.
Malone joins former Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci and three of Massachusetts' five Republican State Senators in supporting Mayor Giuliani.
