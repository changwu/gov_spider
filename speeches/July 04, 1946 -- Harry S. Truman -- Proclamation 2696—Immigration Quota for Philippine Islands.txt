  A Proclamation

Whereas the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Attorney General have reported to the President that pursuant to the duty imposed and the authority conferred upon them in and by sections 11 and 12 of the Immigration Act of 1924 approved May 26, 1924 (43 Stat. 159, 161) and Reorganization Plan No. V (3 CFR Cum. Supp., Ch. IV), they jointly have made the revision provided for in section 12 of the said act and have fixed the quota for the Philippine Islands in accordance therewith to be as hereinafter set forth.
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the power in me vested by the aforesaid act of Congress, do hereby proclaim and make known that the annual quota for the Philippine Islands effective July 4, 1946, for the remainder of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1947, and for each fiscal year thereafter, has been determined in accordance with the law to be, and shall be, 100.
The immigration quota of 50 authorized by section 8(a)(1) of the Act approved March 24, 1934, entitled "An Act to provide for the complete independence of the Philippine Islands, to provide for the adoption of a constitution and a form of government for the Philippine Islands, and for other purposes" (48 Stat. 462; 53 Stat. 1230; 48 U.S.C. 1238), which Act was accepted by concurrent resolution of the Philippine Legislature on May 1, 1934, and which became effective on that date, will become inoperative on July 4, 1946, the date the Government of the United States recognizes the independence of the Philippine Islands as a separate and self-governing nation.
The immigration quota assigned to the Philippine Islands is designed solely for purposes of compliance with the pertinent provisions of the Immigration Act of 1924 and is not to be regarded as having any significance extraneous to this subject.
This proclamation shall have the effect of amending Proclamation 2283 of April 28, 1938, and is the third amendment to that proclamation.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done at the City of Washington this 4th day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-six and of the Independence, of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-first.

HARRY S. TRUMAN

DEAN ACHESON,
Acting Secretary of State.
