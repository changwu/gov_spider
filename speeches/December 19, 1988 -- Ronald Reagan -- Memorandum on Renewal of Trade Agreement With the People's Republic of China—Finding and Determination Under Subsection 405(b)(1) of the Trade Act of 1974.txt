    Memorandum for the United States Trade Representative
Pursuant to Section 405 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2435), I find that a satisfactory balance of concessions in trade and services has been maintained during the life of the Agreement on Trade Relations between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China. I further determine that actual or forseeable reductions in United States tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade resulting from multilateral negotiations have been satisfactorily reciprocated by the People's Republic of China.
This finding and determination shall be published in the Federal Register.
