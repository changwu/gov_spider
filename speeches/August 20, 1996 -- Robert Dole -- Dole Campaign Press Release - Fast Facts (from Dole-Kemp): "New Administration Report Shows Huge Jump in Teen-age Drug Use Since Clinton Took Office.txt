SO WORRIED ABOUT REELECTION, APPARENTLY
"The Clintonites in fact are worried, so much so, Newsweek has learned, that top officials in the Justice Department last week issued a 'crisis heads-up' about new statistics showing yet another increase in teen drug use nationwide. ... 'They're going to kill us with this.' one senior Justice official said." -- Newsweek, 8/26/96
EVEN HIS OWN FBI CHIEF CONCERNED ABOUT CLINTON'S LACK OF
LEADERSHIP
"Still, Clinton's record on the drug problem is very soft. Newsweek has learned that FBI Director Louis Freeh wrote a scathing memo 18 months ago to complain about the lack of 'any true leadership' in stemming the influx of heroin and cocaine, which Freeh compared to an 'all-conquering army.' Freeh then hand-delivered the memo to Clinton himself -- a bold move." -- Newsweek, 8/26/96
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT WHEN CLINTON'S ANTI-DRUG MOTTO IS
"JUST SAY SURE"?
"Question: If you had it to do over again, would you inhale' (Laughter, applause)
Clinton: Sure, if I could. I tried before." (Laughter)
