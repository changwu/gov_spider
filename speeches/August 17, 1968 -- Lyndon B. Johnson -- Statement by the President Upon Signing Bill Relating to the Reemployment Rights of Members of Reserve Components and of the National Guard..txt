    IN EVERY town and city in America--in every walk of life--there are dedicated members of the reserve components of our Armed Forces and National Guard, who are indispensable sinews in the military strength of our Nation.
These Americans may be clerks or farmers, factory or office workers, doctors and lawyers, and engineers.
They have maintained their readiness in the midst of their daily careers and responsibilities and, by so doing, have earned the gratitude of our people. Sometimes their needs have been neglected.
This is one of the reasons for this measure that I am signing into law today.
It spells out, so there can be no doubt, that the members of Reserve and National Guard will have the same reemployment rights and attendant conditions of employment as their fellow workers who do not have such military obligations.
And, of equal importance, is that portion of this bill which provides for the continuation of reemployment rights of those enlistees who extend their tours of duty and members of reserve components who are recalled to active duty or who extend tours of active duty at the request of their Government beyond the current 4-year service limitation.
This measure makes it clear that reservists and guardsmen will not be treated unfairly in their employment, and that those recalled to active duty or who extend their active duty will not lose their reemployment rights because of this additional service in our Armed Forces.
It is a significant recognition of their commitment to their Nation and a small payment on our debt to these men and women who continue to serve America.
