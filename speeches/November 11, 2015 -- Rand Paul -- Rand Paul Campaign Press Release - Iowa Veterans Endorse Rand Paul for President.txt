    DES MOINES- Earlier this evening, 40 Iowa Veterans from across 22 counties announced their endorsement of Rand Paul for President. This coalition of veterans will campaign throughout Iowa on behalf of Rand Paul, actively spreading his conservative realist principles such as peace through strength, limited government, and expanded personal freedom."I am honored to receive support from veterans who have valiantly served our country. Our military is second to none and much of that excellence stems from having professionals who serve voluntarily. For our country's sake, certainly for our soldiers' sake- for the sake of every veteran who ever donned the uniform and fought for this country- America's mission should always be to keep the peace, not police the world," Sen. Rand Paul said. "The American soldier is a volunteer in defense of liberty. For you we are grateful: for your strength, your service and your sacrifice."
