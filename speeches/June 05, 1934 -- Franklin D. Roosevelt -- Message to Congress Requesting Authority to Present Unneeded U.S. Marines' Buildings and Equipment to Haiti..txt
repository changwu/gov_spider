    To the Congress:
Next October our Marine and Naval forces will be withdrawn from the Republic of Haiti. During a period of almost twenty years in which they have been stationed in Haiti they have rendered valuable assistance to the Haitian Government and people in training the Haitian Constabulary. This Constabulary known as the Garde, has been using certain equipment and material loaned to them by our Marine and Naval forces, and the Haitian Government would welcome the opportunity of retaining this equipment and material. Also, there are various buildings, barracks, garages and workshops which our Marine and Naval forces have constructed and which would be of practical use to the Haitian Government. It would seem to me a fitting climax to the close of the period of special relationship which has existed between Haiti and the United States if our Government were to make a gift of these buildings and of a portion of this material and equipment to the Haitian Government. In the joint statement which the President of Haiti and I issued on April 17th, following our conversations during President Vincent's visit to Washington, I expressed my intention of seeking the necessary authorization from the Congress of the United States in order to make such a gift.
With the foregoing in mind, therefore, I recommend the enactment of legislation authorizing me in my discretion to convey to the Government of Haiti, without cost to that Government, such buildings, material, and equipment now in Haiti owned by our Government as may appear to me to be appropriate.
