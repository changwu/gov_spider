    WASHINGTON, D.C.- Rand Paul will host the 'Revolution Continues Rally' at the University of Iowa on Sunday, January 31, 2016. Rand Paul will be joined by special guest Ron Paul, and together they will focus on energizing the youthful base by discussing the importance of protecting the entire Bill of Rights and being boldly for conservative ideals that limit the powers of the Washington Machine.
Rand's unique message of liberty can unite Constitutional conservatives, young voters, and independent voters, which will lead to a successful showing on caucus night.
Aside from his father, Rand will also be joined by over a dozen family members who will host their own events throughout the state and speak at caucuses on the evening of Monday, February 1st.
