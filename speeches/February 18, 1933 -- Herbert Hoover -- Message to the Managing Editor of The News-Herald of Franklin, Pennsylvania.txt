My dear Mr. Borland:
I congratulate you heartily upon the founding out of your fifty-fifth year of continuous newspaper experience with the journal which you rounded, and I send you every good wish for many more years of equally useful accomplishment in the high-minded service of your community and the nation. Your record is indeed a just source of pride to yourself and of gratification to your neighbors.Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
