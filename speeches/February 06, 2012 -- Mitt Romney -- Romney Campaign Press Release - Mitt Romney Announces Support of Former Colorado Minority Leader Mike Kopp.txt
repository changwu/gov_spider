    Mitt Romney today announced the support of former Colorado Senate Minority Leader Mike Kopp.
"Coloradans deserve better than the failed policies and promises of the last three years," said Mitt Romney. "While President Obama might have come to Colorado four years ago and promised to fix our economy and fix Washington, he has clearly failed. I am campaigning to restore our great entrepreneurial spirit and I look forward to working with Mike in this endeavor."
Announcing his support, former Minority Leader Mike Kopp said, "I am endorsing Mitt Romney for President because I want to see America rise to greatness again. American greatness is not a sloganâ€”it is what we demand of our country. And it takes steady leadership, aligned with the values of the American people, in the White House to achieve it. While I admire each of the Republican candidates in the race for various reasons, I'm personally committed to working for the one with the strongest record of successful leadership in complex environments: Governor Mitt Romney."
