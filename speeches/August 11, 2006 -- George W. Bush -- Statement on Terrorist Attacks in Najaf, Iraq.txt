    The terrorists in Iraq have again proven that they are enemies of all humanity. Yesterday they targeted innocent civilians in Najaf near a holy Muslim shrine and a symbol of peace throughout the world.
According to Iraqi officials, the terrorist who committed this atrocity was stopped by Iraqi police before he could enter the holy shrine. These police officers were killed in the attack. They died for their country and for the cause of freedom, and we honor their dedication and bravery. We also mourn the loss of every innocent life in this atrocity and other atrocities perpetrated in Iraq in recent months.
On behalf of the American people, I join Iraqi leaders of all communities who have condemned this barbarous action in the strongest possible terms. To the Iraqi people, I pledge the commitment of the United States to helping your new Government bring peace and security to all areas of your country.
