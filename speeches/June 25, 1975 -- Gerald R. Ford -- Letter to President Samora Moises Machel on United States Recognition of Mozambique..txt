    Dear Mr. President:
I am pleased to inform you that the United States Government extends recognition to Mozambique. It is our hope, with your agreement, that diplomatic relations can soon be established between our two countries.
We congratulate your leaders and their Portuguese colleagues on the wise statesmanship that has led to Mozambique's independence.
The American people share with the people of Mozambique the knowledge that hard-won individual liberty and national independence can be preserved only by unremitting labor and sacrifice.
As we strengthen and multiply our bonds of mutual friendship, I am confident of a future in which our two peoples will work together in the freedom, peace and security of all mankind.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
[His Excellency Samora Moises Machel, President of the People's Republic of Mozambique]
