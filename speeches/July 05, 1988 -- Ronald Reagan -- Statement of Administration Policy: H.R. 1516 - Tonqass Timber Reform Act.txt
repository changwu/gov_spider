    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Mrazek (D) New York and 153 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1516 as unnecessary and premature. Congress should not mandate significant changes to the management of the Tongass National Forest at this time. Such legislative changes should be guided by the next revision of the Tongass Land Management Plan, due in 1990.
