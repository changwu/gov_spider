    The President. Dr. Harvey, as part of our ongoing effort to support historically black colleges and universities, I'm pleased to recognize Hampton Institute with a grant to further your service to the local small business community.
Hampton has a well-earned reputation for opening doors of opportunity, not only to its students but to the residents of your community. And this grant will help you and your efforts to increase local investment and create new jobs on the peninsula.
Paul Trible has told me of the seminars and the programs the Institute provides, training for local residents in management and efficiency. You're doing a fine job, and I join Senator Warner and Congressman Trible in commending you and the Institute for your community service.
And now, should be a check, but we don't do it that way. But to make sure that it is for real, I'm presenting you with the signed warrant that this is a $125,000 grant, technical assistance grant, to Hampton Institute.
Dr. William Harvey. Thank you very much, Mr. President. We appreciate your support for Hampton Institute as well as for all of black higher education.
Last year when you signed your Executive order, you instructed the Federal agencies to put more money into black higher education. And this has become a reality. Although spending was down for all of higher education, actually the black community-the black higher educational community received more money; as a matter of fact, about $3 million more than in the previous fiscal year. We thank you, Mr. President, for this support.
Congressman Trible has been a supporter of Hampton Institute for a long time. As a matter of fact, you might be interested to know that for several years he was against the pay raise in Congress. And he didn't get it, and he gave the pay raise to Hampton Institute. So, he's been a supporter for a long time. We appreciate Congressman Trible, and, Mr. President, we appreciate you. Thank you, sir.
The President. Thank you.
