    This has been a tough fight. I am gratified by the result, but I can take little personal pleasure from a fight among friends, whatever the outcome.
We took a long step in the battle against inflation this afternoon. The Nation owes a debt to the Congress for its wise and responsible action.
As I said earlier this week, there has never been a question of the need to develop our energy and water resources. I will work with the Congress to develop legislation that provides the energy and water projects we needâ€”and can afford.
The hard work and dedication that went into the original legislation will not be wasted. Working together, I hope the Congress and the administration will be able to agree on legislation that protects our citizens from the devastation of drought and floods, that channels water from resource-rich to resource-poor areas, that develops our necessary energy resources.
