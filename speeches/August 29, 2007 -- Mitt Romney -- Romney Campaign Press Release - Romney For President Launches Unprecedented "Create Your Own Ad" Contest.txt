Boston, MA â€“ Today, Romney for President announced the "Team Mitt: Create Your Own Ad!" contest, an unprecedented initiative to create the campaign's new television advertisement by empowering grassroots supporters of Governor Mitt Romney. The winner of the contest will become the first amateur ever to have his or her work used as an official television advertisement for a presidential campaign.
By partnering with Yahoo! and Jumpcut.com, supporters from across the country will be able to utilize an innovative video editing platform to create their own ad by remixing or "mashing up" a large variety of the campaign's photos, videos and audio clips, as well as their own multimedia content.
After the contest's submission period ends on September 17, the campaign will conduct online voting at MittRomney.com to help select the winner of the contest. The ad will air in conjunction with the campaign's massive grassroots event, "Rally for Romney," during the week of September 20.
Alex Castellanos, Senior Adviser and media strategist to Governor Romney, said, "It is truly groundbreaking for amateur, grassroots supporters to so directly assist in introducing their candidate to the American people. This contest demonstrates Romney for President's commitment to using unique and democratizing online tools to engage voters and harness the extraordinary enthusiasm of its growing team of supporters."
