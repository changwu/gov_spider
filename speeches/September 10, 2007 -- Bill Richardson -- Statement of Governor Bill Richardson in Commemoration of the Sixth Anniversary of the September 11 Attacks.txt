    SANTA FE, NM-- New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson issued the following statement in commemoration of tomorrow's sixth anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States:
"Six years after the September 11 attacks, the world again will pause to remember the victims of that horrible morning. Time has helped heal some wounds, but we will never forget one of the darkest days in this country's history.
"To honor the lives of those we lost, the leaders of this country must pledge to do everything in their power to prevent another attack on our homeland. National security cannot and should not be about partisan turf wars. Congress and the White House must move forward in a bipartisan effort to strengthen our nation's security, improve our intelligence capabilities, and promote a foreign policy that unites the world against the scourge of international terrorism.
"The anniversary of September 11 is a solemn occasion for the nation and the world to remember the loved ones we lost. But it is also a reminder that we must make real progress in the face of a continuing threat."
