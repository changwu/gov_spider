    From Fed Up:
"And there stands a crumbling monument to the failure of the New Deal, in stark contrast to the mythical notion of salvation to which it has wrongly been attached for too long, all at the expense of respect for the Constitution and limited government." â€” Page 50
Governor Perry never said that Social Security was unconstitutional.
As the son of tenant farmers in rural West Texas, Rick Perry has seen first hand how important social security has been for so many of our senior citizens, and he believes there is no question we must keep our promise to our senior citizens.
Governor Perry has stated the issue is not with the intent behind social security or the benefits those checks have provided, but that the system is broken. There is no money set aside for a single American, and that our leaders owe it to the American people to acknowledge this.
The point in the book is simply that this is what happens when you empower a far-away central government.
