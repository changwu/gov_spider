    I am seriously concerned about events surrounding the election in the Dominican Republic and have been in touch with the Presidents of several neighboring countries in Latin America and with the Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS) concerning the election procedures. We share a common concern for the integrity of the democratic process. I retain my hope that the legally constituted electoral authorities in the Dominican Republic will be able to carry out their responsibilities without interference and that the outcome of the elections will be respected by all. We will be examining the report of the three prominent observers invited to witness the election process. The degree of our country's support for the Dominican Government will depend upon the integrity of the election process.
