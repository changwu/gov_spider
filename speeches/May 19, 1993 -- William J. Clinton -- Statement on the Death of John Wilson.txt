    As residents of the District of Columbia, Hillary, and I mourn the sudden and tragic loss of DC City Council Chairman John Wilson. John was a tremendous individual who devoted his life's work to the empowerment and benefit of the District's citizens.
We know the love that John had for the District of Columbia will be remembered and cherished by all the city's residents as his service and achievements are profoundly appreciated.
Hillary and I will keep his wife, Bonnie, in our prayers.
