    Yzaguirre Will Co-Chair Clinton's Campaign, Lead Hispanic Outreach
Civil Rights leader Raul Yzaguirre, former president of the National Council of La Raza, announced his endorsement of Hillary Clinton today. Yzaguirre will serve as a national co-chair of Hillary's campaign, and a chair of her Hispanic outreach effort.
"Hillary Clinton has spent more than three decades advocating on behalf of those who are invisible in America," Yzaguirre said. "Not only is she the most experienced and qualified candidate to be president, Senator Clinton has the ability to bring people together to get results and move this country forward."
Over his 30 years as president, Yzaguirre helped build NCLR into the largest Latino civil rights and advocacy organization in the country. With affiliates in 41 states, NCLR serves millions of Hispanics across the country and works to expand opportunities for all Americans through education, advocacy and lobbying.
Yzaguirre is currently the presidential professor of practice in community development and civil rights at Arizona State University. In 1993, he received the Order of the Aztec Eagle, the highest honor awarded to non-citizens by the Mexican government. Yzaguirre has also been awarded both the Hubert H. Humphrey Civil Rights Award by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, and the Charles Evan Hughes Gold Medal Award for courageous leadership in civic and humanitarian affairs by the National Conference for Community and Justice.
"Throughout his life, Raul Yzaguirre has worked tirelessly to expand civil rights and create opportunity for working Americans," Clinton said. "I'm delighted that Raul will play a leadership role in this campaign as we reach out to all Americans and ask them to join our effort."
