    Mayor Marshall, I want to thank you, of course, for this warm welcome. I want to thank that wonderful Boca Raton Band and those pretty girls. It's a great band and thank you very much. I also wish to thank all of the wonderful people who are here who have made this stop one of the finest, biggest, most enthusiastic. It makes a long day seem very short and very, very worthwhile.
We have had a little rain, and I should apologize for my appearance, but there's an old saying, you know, that aristocracy is of the soul, not of the cloth. So, I don't look very good but I think I am a darned good President. And I want you to know that the things we have done in the last 19 months have all been plus, and the next 48 months are going to be more pluses.
I could quickly review, and I will. We have had bad inflation--12 or 14 percent--and it is cut in half. We have gone through a recession, the worst since the end of World War II. We are on the way out. Employment is going up; unemployment is going down. Prices are going down, and we have a good start on a healthy economy. And I ask you to give me a chance to make sure that it is continued.
I ask for your help March 9, and once we win that, we are on our way to win November 2.
Thank you very, very much.
