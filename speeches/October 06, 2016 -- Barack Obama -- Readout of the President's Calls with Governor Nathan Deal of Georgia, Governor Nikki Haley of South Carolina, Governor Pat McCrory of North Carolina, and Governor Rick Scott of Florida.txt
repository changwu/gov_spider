    The President spoke by phone today separately with Governor Nathan Deal of Georgia, Governor Nikki Haley of South Carolina, Governor Pat McCrory of North Carolina, and Governor Rick Scott of Florida about preparations ahead of Hurricane Matthew. The President committed to providing necessary federal resources to help the states respond. Already today, the President declared an emergency in the State of Florida and ordered federal aid to supplement state, tribal, and local response efforts. As the President made clear yesterday, residents of the impacted areas should follow the guidance of emergency response officials and should be taking this storm seriously. The President urged everyone in the potential path of the storm to monitor local radio or TV stations for updated emergency information. The President continues to receive regular updates on Hurricane Matthew and the coordinated efforts on response preparations with states and has directed his team to be as proactive as possible in preparing to respond to this storm.
