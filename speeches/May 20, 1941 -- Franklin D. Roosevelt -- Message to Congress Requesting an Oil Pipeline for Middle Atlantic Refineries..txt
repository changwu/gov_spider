    The Speaker of the House of Representatives
Sir:
As a result of recent study by the special subcommittee on petroleum investigation of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, Chairman Cole has transmitted to me for consideration a proposed measure "to facilitate the construction, extension or completion of interstate petroleum pipelines related to national defense." This measure is concerned with one of the vital phases of our national defense program.
The vast concentration of industry, population, and military bases on the Atlantic coast is now dependent for petroleum upon tankers plying between the Gulf coast and the Middle Atlantic ports. Not only is this water route long and potentially perilous, but even present demands upon these transportation facilities make restriction of oil consumption to essential uses a distinct possibility within a few months. The immediate construction of pipelines to augment the supply to the Atlantic coast is the one means available to us to relieve the situation.
The bill which is proposed by Mr. Cole seems to me adequate to accomplish its objectives, and, in my opinion, it is a measure of first rank in importance. The situation which the bill is designed to correct must be remedied. I therefore take this means to call the measure directly to your attention and to urge that it be given early and earnest consideration by the Congress.
Respectfully,
