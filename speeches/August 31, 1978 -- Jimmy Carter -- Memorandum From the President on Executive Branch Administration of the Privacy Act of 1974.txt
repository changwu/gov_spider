    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Enclosed for your information is a copy of the Third Annual Report on executive branch administration of the Privacy Act of 1974, which I recently transmitted to the Congress.
The protection of personal privacy is of great concern to the American people, and an important priority of my Administration. I urge you to personally review this report and take steps to further improve your agency's administration of the Privacy Act.
The report indicates that many agencies have made substantial improvements in their implementation of the Act. I urge each of you, however, to initiate additional efforts during the coming year to reduce the amount of personal information collected and maintained by the Federal government, to avoid unwarranted disclosure of this information, and to improve the internal management of personal data systems.
I have asked the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to monitor these efforts and to keep me informed of your progress.
JIMMY CARTER
