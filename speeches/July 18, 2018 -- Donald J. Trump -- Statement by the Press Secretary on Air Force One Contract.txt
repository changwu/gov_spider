    Yesterday, the United States Air Force awarded a firm fixed price contract to The Boeing Company to design, modify, test, certify, and deliver two Presidential, mission-ready aircraft by 2024. Formal replacement efforts began in 2011 and the new aircraft will replace the current Air Force One planes that are now 31 years old. The contract sets the total price for the two completed "Air Force One" replacement aircraft at $3.9 billion, saving the taxpayers over $1.4 billion from the initially proposed $5.3 billion cost-plus contract.
President Donald J. Trump has emphasized the need to minimize the cost of replacing the two existing Air Force One aircraft. Yesterday's action meets that objective and reflects the President's commitment to our military and to protecting taxpayer dollars.
