    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Saxton (R) New Jersey)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 4408, which reauthorizes the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act. The Administration believes that there is a need for continued, coordinated Federal-State conservation and management of the Atlantic coastal migratory stock of striped bass to ensure continued recovery of this population.
