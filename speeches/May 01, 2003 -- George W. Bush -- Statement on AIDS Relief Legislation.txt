    The fight against AIDS is a moral imperative our great Nation must confront decisively and boldly.
I applaud the House of Representatives for acting quickly to pass historic legislation that is consistent with the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief that I announced earlier this year. Today's action is an important step toward providing critically needed treatment and care for millions of people suffering from AIDS and proven prevention programs for millions more who are at risk.
Time is of the essence, and I urge the Senate to act quickly so that we can turn the tide against this disease and give the hope of life to millions of people in the world's most afflicted countries.
