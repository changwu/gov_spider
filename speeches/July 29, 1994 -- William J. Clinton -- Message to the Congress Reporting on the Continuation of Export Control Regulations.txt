    To the Congress of the United States:
1. On September 30, 1990, in Executive Order No. 12730, President Bush declared a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ("IEEPA") (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) to deal with the threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States resulting from the lapse of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.), and the system of controls maintained under that Act. In that order, the President continued in effect, to the extent permitted by law, the provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, the Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R. 768 et seq.), and the delegations of authority set forth in Executive Order No. 12002 of July 7, 1977, Executive Order No. 12214 of May 2, 1980, and Executive Order No. 12131 of May 4, 1979, as amended by Executive Order No. 12551 of February 21, 1986.
2. President Bush issued Executive Order No. 12730 pursuant to the authority vested in him as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including IEEPA, the National Emergencies Act ("NEA") (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code. At that time, the President also submitted a report to the Congress pursuant to section 204(b) of the IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(b)). On March 27, 1993, the Export Administration Act was extended through June 30, 1994. Subsequently, on September 30, 1993, I issued Executive Order No. 12867, terminating Executive Order No. 12730.
3. Section 401(c) of the NEA additionally requires the submission of a final report on all expenditures incurred during the period of emergency. This report, covering the period from September 30, 1990, to September 30, 1993, is submitted in compliance with this requirement.
4. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 3-year period from September 30, 1990, to September 30, 1993, that are directly attributable to the exercise of authorities conferred by the declaration of a national emergency with respect to export controls were largely centered in the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration. Expenditures by the Department of Commerce are estimated to have been $117,720,000, most of which represented program operating costs, wage and salary costs for Federal personnel, and overhead expenses.
