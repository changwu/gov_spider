    I thank you all for coming. It's my honor to welcome Chairman Reyes and members of the Hispanic Caucus here. I thank them for coming. It's going to give us a very good chance to get to know each other on a personal basis, as well as to talk about some issues that are of deep concern to the Members of the Congress. And Mr. Chairman, I'm honored to have you here.
One of the things that I know the chairman knows is that I respect the Hispanic culture a lot. When I was a Governor for the State of Texas, I used to remind my fellow Texans that our State was richer as a result of the Hispanic culture. And I look forward to working with the members here on a variety of issues, not the least of which is to make sure the world is more peaceful, more educated, and more prosperous.
So, thank you all for coming. Thank you for being here.
