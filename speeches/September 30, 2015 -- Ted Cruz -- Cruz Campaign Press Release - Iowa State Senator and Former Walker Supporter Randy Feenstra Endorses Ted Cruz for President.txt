    HOUSTON, Texas – Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today announced the endorsement of former Scott Walker supporter, Iowa State Senator Randy Feenstra. The endorsement follows Cruz's earlier announcement that all three of Walker's former grassroots co-chairs in Georgia are also now organizing for the Cruz campaign.
"It is an honor to earn Randy's support and I look forward to working with him as we compete to win Iowa and the entire GOP primary," Sen. Cruz said. "I am very proud of the network of courageous conservatives we've built across Iowa. Their hard work will be crucial to restore jobs, growth and security and reignite the promise of America."
"Sen. Cruz is an inspirational leader that has the ability to bring people together around a bold vision," Sen. Feenstra said. "I believe he is the leader this country needs as we work together to address the pressing social, economic, and foreign policy issues facing our nation. Today, I am committing to do everything I can to help Ted Cruz become the next President of the United States."
Sen. Feenstra is a life-long Iowan, who was recently re-elected to a second term in the Iowa Senate. He currently serves as the chairman of the Sioux County Foundation and serves on several other boards including Sioux Center Executive Hospital board and the Lewis & Clark Regional Water executive board. He spent 14 years as an EMT for the City of Hull, seven years as the Hull City Administrator, and was elected Sioux County Treasurer in 2006 where he served until his election to the Iowa Senate in 2009. He received a Bachelor's degree from Dordt College and Master's degree in Public Administration from Iowa State University. Feenstra and his wife, Lynette, have four children and reside in Hull.
