    It gives me great pleasure on behalf of the National Aeronautical Association to present to you, as the representative of the Packard Motor Car Company, the Collier Trophy for the development of the Packard Diesel aircraft engine. As you know, I am naturally greatly interested in every important mechanical development. The adaptation of the Diesel principle to aircraft engines is a contribution not only to economy but to safety in aviation. It is a notable mechanical achievement and one which is worthy of the fine air work to which the Packard Company has contributed so much in the past. This trophy is the highest award in American aeronautics, and I congratulate you upon it.
