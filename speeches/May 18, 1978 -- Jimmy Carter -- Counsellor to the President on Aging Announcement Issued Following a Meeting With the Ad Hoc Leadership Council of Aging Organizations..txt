    In his meeting with the Ad Hoc Leadership Council of Aging Organizations today, the President outlined the following points about his objectives in establishing the position of Counsellor to the President on Aging:
—To ensure that he will have placed before him proposed initiatives in the field of aging designed not only to meet the needs of older persons but also to make it possible for the Nation to benefit from the unique contributions that older persons can make to the strengthening of our Nation by opening up opportunities for their continued involvement in the life of our day.
—To ensure that whenever policy issues are presented to him in such areas as social security, employment, housing, health, transportation, and welfare, he will be reminded of the impact that proposed solutions will have on the lives of older persons.
—To have placed before him proposals designed to make it possible for him to make the maximum possible contribution to coordinating programs in the executive branch that have an impact on the lives of older persons.
—To have a personal representative who can present his views on issues in the field of aging to the departments and agencies of the executive branch, to the Members of Congress, and to representatives of organizations in both the public and private sectors.
The President also noted that he has designated the Counsellor as Chairman of the Federal Council on the Aging. Putting these two functions in the hands of one person will make it possible for the Counsellor to present to the President a broad consensus of views in the field of aging that are represented by the membership of the Federal Council on the Aging.
