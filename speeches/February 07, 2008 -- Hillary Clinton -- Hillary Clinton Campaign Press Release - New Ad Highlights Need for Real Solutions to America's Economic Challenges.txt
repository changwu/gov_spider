    Hillary makes clear that her campaign is about providing solutions for working Americans in a new ad airing in Maine today.
The 30-second spot, entitled "Falling Through" comes three days before Maine voters head to the polls on February 10th.
Hilary is the only candidate with a plan to end the housing crisis and help people keep their homes. Hillary's plan takes bold action to stem tide of foreclosures with a 90-day moratorium on foreclosures and at least a five year freeze on interest rates for subprime mortgages. Her plan invests billions in extending and broadening unemployment insurance for those who are struggling to find work. Hillary hears the voices of Americans concerned about economic instability and is focused on providing solutions to the problems they face.
Following is the script for the ad.
"FALLING THROUGH"
TV :30
Hillary Clinton: The Bush economy is like a trapdoor.
Too many families are one pink slip, one missed mortgage payment, one medical diagnosis away from falling through and losing everything.
The oil companies, the predatory student loan companies, the insurance companies and the drug companies, have had seven years of a president who stands up for them.
I intend to be a president who stands up for all of you.
I'm Hillary Clinton and I approved this message.
