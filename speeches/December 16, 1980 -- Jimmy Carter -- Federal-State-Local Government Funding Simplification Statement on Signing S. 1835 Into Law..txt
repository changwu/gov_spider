    I have today signed into law S. 1835, which extends for 5 more years the authority of the Joint Funding Simplification Act of 1974.
I am pleased that the Congress has continued this authority to assist State and local governments obtain and use Federal assistance from a number of Federal programs in a more coordinated and simplified process.
In the past 5 years, for example, the joint funding process has assisted the States of Arizona, Kentucky, and Rhode Island, along with a number of cities, regional organizations, counties, and Indian tribal governments to develop or improve service delivery and economic and community development programs.
Joint funding is a proven management tool that has enabled the Federal agencies and State and local governments to work together to reduce administrative paper. work and achieve a more timely delivery of funds to meet the needs of our people.
I urge both the Federal agencies and State and local governments to take full advantage of the joint funding authority.
