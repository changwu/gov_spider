    To Mr. Leet, Mr. Love, and Earl Graves and Bill Sessions, Director Simpson of the Secret Service and Admiral Truly, members of the White House staff and the Vice President's staff, all interested in Scouting, let me say it's a pleasure to be here.
This has become, appropriately so, an annual event. And I am proud to be now this card-carrying member of the Boy Scouts -- [laughter] -- and pleased to receive this year's report to the Nation.
I'm also just delighted to have this Desert Storm patch because in my view there's no doubt about the outcome of Desert Storm and no doubt about the reasons why. We're fighting in the Gulf so that this generation of Scouts never has to. And we want to pass on to them the kind of world they deserve -- a world of stability and security, peace and justice.
This report that the Scouts have given me is, I am told, full of the good deeds done by our nation's future leaders, from helping the hungry to helping kids stay drug-free. And that's the kind of work that makes the Scouts Points of Light and the leading lights of a new generation.
So, I really wanted to come here to thank you, as representatives of all the Scouts across the Nation, for all the wonderful good deeds you do every single day because in that way you're keeping our country strong.
So, thank you for coming, and thank you for these marvelous souvenirs that I take with me. And God bless you all, and keep up the great work.
Thank you so much.
