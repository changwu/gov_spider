    The President announced today that he intends to nominate Ashton Carter, the director of Harvard's Center for Science and International Affairs, to be Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear Security and Counter-Proliferation.
"One of the key national security challenges of the post-cold-war era is containing the spread of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction," said the President. "In Ashton Carter we will have an experienced and expert Assistant Secretary focusing on the problems and seeking solutions."
