I would argue this is the result of failed leadership in Washington, bad fiscal policy coming from the administration and that is why we have this very tepid report. For every net one job created, four people -- nearly four people left the workforce." â€“ Paul Ryan

PAUL RYAN: "Carl, this is not even close to what a recovery looks like. Look, we would need to actually have 150,000 jobs created just to keep at pace with population growth. This is not what President Obama promised. I would argue this is the result of failed leadership in Washington, bad fiscal policy coming from the administration and that is why we have this very tepid report. For every net one job created, four people -- nearly four people left the workforce. So this is not what a recovery looks like. We need growth. We need economic growth and we can get that if we get the right policies in place. That's what Mitt Romney and I are proposing, specific solutions, pro-growth economic policies to get the kind of growth we ought to be having in this economy to get people back to work."
