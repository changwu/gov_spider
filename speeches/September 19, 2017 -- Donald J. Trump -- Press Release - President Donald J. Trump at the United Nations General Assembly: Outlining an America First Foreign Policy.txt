    "Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust, and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe." â€“ President Donald J. Trump
AMERICA FIRST FOREIGN POLICY: Before the United Nations General Assembly, President Donald J. Trump outlined the Administration's foreign policy of "Principled Realism," a strategy of acting in America's national interest and in accordance with our values.

America First means America will, put its citizens, its values, and its concerns, first, like all nations should.

Strong sovereign nations are key to international peace.


President Trump reiterated that he will make foreign policy decisions based on outcomes, not on ideology.
America will remain an international leader but will also encourage the nations of the world to do their share.

America First does not mean America alone.
All countries must contribute in the fight against global terrorism and other shared threats.
Nations that care for their citizens likewise have a rational interest in shared cooperation.


President Trump said he wants to see a world that is more stable and prosperous, with countries that better maintain their own sovereignty.
North Korea and Iran remain key threats to international stability and require international cooperation.
