    FIRST, I want to thank the wonderful band over here. I want to thank all of you who I have had the opportunity to meet and the ones I didn't. I will also thank you because it's my judgment that we have a first-class organization, and we have some wonderful volunteers. And with the kind of leadership, with John Tower and everybody else, and some good programs, some good policies at home and abroad, I think we can surprise them and win.
My wife Betty came back from a wonderful trip down to Texas. She was enthusiastic. My son Jack--he came back from his second trip down here. Of course, everyplace I go they say Jack is great, Betty's great--I'm getting a little self-conscious.
But we have the right programs at home and abroad. We have got outstanding leadership with John Tower. We have got tremendous support from people like yourselves. And I can't thank you enough for what you have done, what you are doing and, boy, that news could be very, very good Saturday night.Thank you very much.
