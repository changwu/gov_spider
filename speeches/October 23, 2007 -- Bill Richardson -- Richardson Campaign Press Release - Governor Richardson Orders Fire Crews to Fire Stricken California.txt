    (Santa Fe, NM) - Today Governor Bill Richardson ordered two strike teams consisting of 5 Type 1 fire engines per unit and 21 crew members per team to California to assist in structure protection. The teams are made up of fire departments from throughout New Mexico and are expected to depart Albuquerque by nightfall.
"We've been in touch with Governor Schwarzeneggar's office since the beginning of the fire to offer the assistance of our experienced and capable fire crews,” said Governor Bill Richardson. “New Mexico is fortunate to have no major fires and have the resources available. Neighbors should help neighbors in their time of need. So, I'm ordering two strike teams to answer's California's request and help fight this unprecedented fire.”
“California Office of Emergency Services asked neighboring states to analyze availability of fire teams yesterday and DHSEM and Forestry began surveying local fire departments for availability immediately,” said Tim Manning, Director, New Mexico Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.
The strike teams will be deployed for fourteen days and report to Chino, CA. The team members are represented by the following departments: San Juan County, City of Farmington, City of Albuquerque, City of Angel Fire, City of Raton, City of Rio Rancho, City of Las Vegas, Bernalillo County; and Los Ranchos de Albuquerque.
The New Mexico Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management has been jointly working with New Mexico State Forestry and the Southwest Coordination Center to fill the resource request. New Mexico State Forestry has assembled the strike teams and will be mobilizing through the national wildfire coordination system. New Mexico and California are both members of the mutual aid coordination for all states, which enables states to request and receive specific and appropriate aid from fellow states in their time of a natural disaster or emergency.
