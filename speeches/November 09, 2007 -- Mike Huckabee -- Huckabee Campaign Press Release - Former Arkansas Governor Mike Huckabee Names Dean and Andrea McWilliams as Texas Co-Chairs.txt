    Little Rock, AR – Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee named Dean and Andrea McWilliams, the co-owners of a Texas-based governmental affairs firm, as co-chairs of his presidential campaign organization in the Lone Star state.
"I'm thrilled to have Dean and Andrea on our team. They have a great reputation in Texas and across the nation," Gov. Huckabee said.
The McWilliams are nationally recognized, governmental affairs specialists with impressive backgrounds who have received accolades in the public affairs, lobbying and political industries.
"I believe Governor Huckabee can succeed in a race where the break-away front runner for the Republican nomination has yet to be identified," Dean McWilliams said. "His poll numbers continue to climb and so does our confidence that Mike Huckabee could be the unifying conservative standard bearer the GOP base has been craving."
"Mike Huckabee is the candidate that will keep the Republicans in the White House for another eight years," Andrea McWilliams said. "He is the affable, compassionate, good guy that doesn't just talk about leadership – he exhibits it and has a track record to prove it."
"This is a terrific development for the campaign. I look forward to working with the McWilliams and benefiting from their counsel as we plan our strategy to win votes in Texas ," said Huckabee.
