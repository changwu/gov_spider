    ATLANTA â€” Texas Gov. Rick Perry today received the endorsement of 45 Republican Georgia lawmakers in his campaign for president. This represents more than one-third of the state's Republican lawmakers, including well over half of state Senate Republicans.
"Rick Perry is the candidate who will get America working again," said Economic Development Chairman and Governor Deal's Floor Leader, State Senator Ronnie Chance. "Under his leadership, Texas gained more than one million net new jobs. Gov. Perry's record proves that he is the right choice for our nation."
"Rick Perry doesn't just talk about conservative reform, he backs it up with actions," said State Representative Allen Peake, Majority Caucus Secretary/Treasurer. "Gov. Perry is a principled conservative who has cut taxes, reduced spending and stood up to the job-killing regulations from Washington bureaucrats."
"I am humbled to have the support of so many Republican lawmakers in Georgia," said Gov. Rick Perry. "They share my vision for a stronger America with more jobs, more freedom and less government intrusion in the lives of our citizens. With their help, we will run a spirited campaign in Georgia, and in 2012 we'll get America working again."
