    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Nunn (D) GA)
If S. 3144 were presented to the President in its current form, the President's senior advisers would recommend a veto.
S. 3144 would substantially change Federal policy with respect to abortion. The bill would allow abortions on demand to be performed at overseas U.S. military facilities in cases other than when the life of the mother is endangered.
Abortion is a deeply emotional issue. It is made even more difficult when the underlying issue is whether the Government — and ultimately the American taxpayer — should pay for abortions and under what circumstances. Since 1981, the Federal Government has determined that taxpayer funds should be used for abortion in only the most narrow of circumstances: when the life of the mother is endangered.
The President has repeatedly voiced his strong view that such a policy should continue and that any attempt to weaken current abortion policy would warrant a veto.
