    Last night’s approval of the DREAM Act in the House of Representatives was a historic and important step. We agree with the Senate leadership’s decision to table the version under consideration in that chamber in favor of taking up the version approved in the House. Eight Republicans voted together with Democrats to approve this important bill in the House last night. It should get bipartisan support in the Senate as well, and in light of the vote in the House, this is the right way to move forward to get that. The DREAM Act is the right thing to do for our nation, our economy, and our security - and even reduces the deficit by $2.2 billion over the next decade. The President looks forward to seeing the Senate approve it so that he can sign it into law.
