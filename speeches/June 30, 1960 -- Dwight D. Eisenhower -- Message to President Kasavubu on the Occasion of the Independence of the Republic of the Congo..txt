    Dear Mr. President:
On the occasion of the independence of the Republic of the Congo I extend in my own name and on behalf of the people of the United States most cordial greetings and felicitations to you and the Congolese people.
The independence of the Republic of the Congo is a source of deep satisfaction to the United States, especially since this freedom was achieved in friendly cooperation with Belgium. The attainment of independence by 13.5 million Congolese is one of the most significant events in Africa during this unprecedented year of 1960.
On this historic occasion the Government and people of the United States look forward to close and friendly relations with the Government and people of the Republic of the Congo.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
