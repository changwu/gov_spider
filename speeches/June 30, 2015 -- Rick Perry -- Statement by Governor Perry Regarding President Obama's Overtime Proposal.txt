    AUSTIN — Gov. Rick Perry today released the following statement regarding President Obama's mandate that employers expand overtime pay:
"President Obama's overtime-pay mandate is filled with job-killing incentives that will drastically increase the cost of hiring new workers. Government shouldn't be in the business of mandating how much employers pay, or the level of benefits they provide. Unlike the federal government, employers don't have the luxury of living beyond their means. As businesses are forced to spend more on payroll, those costs will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for everyday goods and services.
Millions of Americans are out of work or have given up looking for work. We need a president who is concerned about the rising cost of living across the country, and who will implement economic policies to make life more affordable—and jobs more accessible—for all Americans."
