    Today I met with Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross to discuss the current state of our automobile industry. I instructed Secretary Ross to consider initiating a section 232 investigation into imports of automobiles, including trucks, and automotive parts to determine their effects on America's national security. Core industries such as automobiles and automotive parts are critical to our strength as a Nation.
