    DES MOINES, IA â€“ Following Montana Governor Steve Bullock's strong performance on the debate stage in Detroit, Iowa Democratic endorsers Attorney General Tom Miller and DNC Member Jan Bauer released the following statements:
Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller: "Tonight, Governor Steve Bullock showed a personal understanding of the struggles that Iowans face, and the achievable solutions to get the job done as President. At a moment where we need new leadership for our country, we need more than 'wishlist economics.' Governor Bullock displayed the clear-headed leadership we need to beat Donald Trump, bring our nation together, and ensure that our government works for everyone."
Jan Bauer, Iowa DNC Member and former 22-year Story County Democratic Chair: "This election will decide the course of our nation, and tonight, Governor Bullock demonstrated why he's the leader who will get us back on track. As SuperPACs and Big Money have taken control of our politics, Iowa has been besieged by an agenda that attacks working families, farmers, and people of color. Governor Bullock is the candidate with a vision and record to change the direction of our country. He brings an outside, proven perspective, and the experience we need to make government work for every American."
