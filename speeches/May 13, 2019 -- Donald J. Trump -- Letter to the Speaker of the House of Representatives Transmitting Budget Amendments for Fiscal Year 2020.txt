    Dear Madam Speaker: 
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Budget amendments for the Departments of Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Labor, State and Other International Programs, and Transportation, as well as the Army Corps of Engineers. These amendments are necessary to correctly reflect policies assumed in my FY 2020 Budget.
Also included are amendments providing increased amounts for the Department of Education regarding funding for the Special Olympics, the Army Corps of Engineers regarding funding for the Florida Everglades, the Environmental Protection Agency regarding funding for the Great Lakes, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration regarding returning United States astronauts to the surface of the Moon by 2024. These amendments are fully offset and do not change the overall discretionary budget authority requested in my FY 2020 Budget.
In addition, in recent weeks, my Administration announced that it would restore funding for the Refueling and Complex Overhaul of the USS Truman aircraft carrier. However, no new amendments would be needed to effectuate this change.
The details of these amendments are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
