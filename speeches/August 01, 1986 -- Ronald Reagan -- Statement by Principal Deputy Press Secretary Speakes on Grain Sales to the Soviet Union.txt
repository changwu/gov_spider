    The President has made a decision today to allow grain to be sold to the Soviet Union at current world market prices in sufficient quantities to fulfill the terms of the U.S.-Soviet long-term grain agreement. The unfulfilled portion of the contract calls for the Soviets to purchase 4 million metric tons of
U.S. wheat by September 30, 1986.
