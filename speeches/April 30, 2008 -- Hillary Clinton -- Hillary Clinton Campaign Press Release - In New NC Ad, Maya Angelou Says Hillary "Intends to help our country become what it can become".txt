Maya Angelou: Hillary Clinton is a prayer of every American who really longs for fair play.
Working men and women have had their jobs snatched from underneath them, their homes snatched away from them. And what we need, I think, is a person, a President who can make a difference in our country.
She intends to help our country become what it can become. She dares to say human beings are more alike than we are unalike.
I watched her become interested in public health and in education for all the children. And I watched her stand.
I have found the person I think would be the best president for the United States of America.
Hillary Clinton: I'm Hillary Clinton and I approved this message.
