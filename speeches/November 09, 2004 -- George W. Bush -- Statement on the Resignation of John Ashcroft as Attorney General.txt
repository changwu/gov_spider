    John Ashcroft has worked tirelessly to help make our country safer. During his 4 years at the Department of Justice, John has transformed the Department to make combating terrorism the top priority, including making sure our law enforcement officials have the tools they need to disrupt and prevent attacks. In doing so, he has made sure that the rights of Americans are respected and protected.
I applaud his efforts to prevent crime, vigorously enforce our civil rights laws, crack down on corporate wrongdoing, protect the rights of victims and those with disabilities, reduce crimes committed with guns, and stop human trafficking. I appreciate his work to fight Internet pornography. I am grateful for his advice on judicial nominations and his efforts to ensure that my judicial nominees receive fair hearings and timely votes.
John has served our Nation with honor, distinction, and integrity. I appreciate his service and wish him and Janet all the best.
