    I join the American people in sending my best wishes to all those who are celebrating Russia Day. Since the first Congress of the Russian Federation declared a new sovereign nation on June 12, 1992, the United States and Russia have worked to build a relationship that makes both our nations more secure and more prosperous. Together, we have reduced our nuclear arsenals, expanded trade and commerce, and deepened the ties between our people. Here in the United States, we are grateful for the many Russian Americans who have helped to strengthen our country and who play a vital role in bringing the Russian and American people even closer.
