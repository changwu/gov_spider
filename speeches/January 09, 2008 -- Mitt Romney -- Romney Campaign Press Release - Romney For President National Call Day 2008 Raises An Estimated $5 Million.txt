Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced that National Call Day 2008 has raised an estimated $5 million. About 500 Romney volunteer fundraisers from across the country joined Governor Romney in Boston today to call donors nationwide to raise both primary and general election dollars. Today marks the first Romney for President finance event in which general election dollars were raised. The success of today's event will help Governor Romney continue to compete nationwide and help communicate his message of bringing conservative change in Washington.
Governor Mitt Romney said, "National Call Day 2008 has been an extraordinary success. I am grateful to all of the fundraisers and donors who have helped us raise the resources we need to continue to be competitive in all 50 states. Washington is broken, and we all know that it will take someone from outside of Washington to bring conservative change to our nation's capital. Today's success shows the continued belief that I have the vision, values and experience to bring that change.
"This is going to be a long race, but we have some great momentum, and will carry that momentum into Michigan. The success of today's events shows a continued belief that I am the only Republican candidate who can match up against the Democrats in the fall. My campaign is about the future of our country, and I will be ready to go toe-to-toe with the Democrats in the general election."
