    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that Don Davidson, the former Mayor of Nashua, has endorsed Rudy Giuliani for President. Davidson is recognized as a longtime local government leader in the state's second largest city.
"Although we have a number of candidates to choose from in this year's primary, only one has the record of a proven leader on issues that matter most to New Hampshire Republicans, and that is Rudy Giuliani," said Davidson. "As Mayor of New York City, with the third largest government in the country, he cut taxes, reduced spending and helped create new jobs â€“ despite having to work with an overwhelmingly Democrat city council."
Davidson continued: "In addition, his steadfast support for being on the offense in the Terrorists' War On Us is an essential commitment that our next President must possess if we are to continue to be the greatest country in the world. Rudy is the rare leader who will bring real change to Washington, DC."
"Mayor Davidson's decision to back Rudy reflects strong local support for the campaign in Nashua and southern New Hampshire," said Wayne Semprini, Giuliani's New Hampshire Chairman. "With the election nearly upon us, we are pleased to see that Rudy's Granite State Team is continuing to grow."
