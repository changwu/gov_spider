    Today, the White House released state fact sheets that highlight how the Inflation Reduction Act lowers health care costs for Americans nationwide. The fact sheets highlight how millions of Americans across all 50 states and the District of Columbia will benefit from Medicare finally having the power to negotiate prescription drug prices, will gain peace of mind from knowing that their out-of-pocket prescription drug costs are capped at $2,000 annually in Medicare, and will save hundreds of dollars per year on health insurance premiums because of the law.
After three decades of attempts, the Inflation Reduction Act takes on one of the most powerful special interests in history – the pharmaceutical lobby – to deliver cost savings directly to American families. And, it protects the progress made under the Biden-Harris Administration to give more Americans access to affordable health insurance coverage, bringing the uninsured rate to an all-time low. By signing the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden is delivering on his promise to lower prescription drug costs, make health insurance more affordable, and make the economy work for working families.
