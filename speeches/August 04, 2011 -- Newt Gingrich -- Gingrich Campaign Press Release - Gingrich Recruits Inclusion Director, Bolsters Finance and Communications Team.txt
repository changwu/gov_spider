    Atlanta, GA â€“ Newt Gingrich has made several staff hires and recruited Latino activist Sylvia Garcia to lead his campaign's efforts to include Hispanic voters as part of the broad coalition of conservatives the campaign is building.
"Our country has a choice of two futures," said Gingrich. "On one hand you can have bigger government, smaller citizens, fewer choices and less of your own money. On the other we have the Republican Party that puts freedom and family first, empowers entrepreneurs, rewards those who work hard and will defend our country. This is the future I believe we can have and I think Americans of all backgrounds should be part of it."
"The Newt 2012 model is inclusion not outreach," added Garcia. "We want to engage Hispanic Americans in creating solutions to our country's most pressing challenges. We are not asking people to be for a candidate, we are asking to be with a movement. That will be Newt 2012's commitment."
Sylvia Garcia has worked in journalism, marketing, public relations, and business development for the American Hispanic market for over twelve years. She graduated from the University of Miami in Broadcast Journalism and Spanish Language. She has worked in Latin America, Spain, and the U.S. In 2005, she joined Gingrich Communications as Hispanic Inclusion Director. Together with the Speaker, she is a founder of The Americano, the first bilingual Conservative site for Hispanics.

As an undergraduate she was involved with the College Republicans and served several consecutive internships both in Miami and Washington D.C. with Gingrich Communications.
