    Online donations up 2000% following Delaney's debate performance
DETROIT, MI â€“ The Delaney campaign had its best online fundraising day to date Wednesday, as Delaney made the case for real solutions, not impossible promises before a national audience. Following a surge of donations last night and this morning, Delaney has seen a 20-fold increase in donor rate during the 24-hour period surrounding the debate with more coming in every minute. Delaney has also seen a 10% increase in his number of Twitter followers.
"John put the pedal to the metal last night in the Motor City and the engine was revving online. The Washington Post, CNN, and Vox all listed Delaney as one of the winners of Tuesday night's debate and we won online as well," said Campaign Manager John Davis. "We had our best online fundraising day of the campaign and saw a 20-fold increase in donations compared to our daily average. John will campaign in Nevada on Saturday and Iowa on Sunday and we're going to keep making the case to voters. As John said, this primary is about a choice between extreme policies that aren't popular and real solutions that can also get done."
