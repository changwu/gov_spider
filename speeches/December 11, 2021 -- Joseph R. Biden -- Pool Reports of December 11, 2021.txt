Some Wilmingtonians, if that is the correct term, came out of their homes to watch the motorcade pass by, but your pooler did not see any noteworthy exhibitions of support or opposition.

Out of town pool report 11: POTUS remarks (incl Ukraine at the end)
The President spoke somberly, dressed in a dark suit, light blue shirt and patterned dark tie.
There was a glass of water placed beside him from which he did not drink.
He took a question about a possible link to climate change:
"The Intensity of the weather across the board" is linked to climate change, he said. But "the specific impact" on "these specific storms, I can't say."
Another Q about plans to visit the affected areas?
"Yes I do." He said he has already offered to go to Kentucky but "I don't want to be in the way." Reiterated he intends to go, however.
The room hushed even more when POTUS pondered the plight of those wondering "Is my loved one going to be ok?"
"My heart aches for those people right now."
As he was beginning to leave, he was asked why he had taken the idea of US troops being deployed to Ukraine off the table
"They never were on the table," he said.
He also said that the economic consequences for Russia if Putin moves forward will be "devastating."
Remarks ended at 4:25pm.
Pool is out and motorcade is moving at 4:29pm.
As always check remarks against transcript and apologies for any typos committed in haste.
