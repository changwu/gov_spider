WH pool report 1 
Good morning, on a typically warm and humid D.C. summer day.
There are no public events on the president's schedule today.
However, as is typical, the president is sharing his views of a variety of topics this morning on social media.
A few minutes ago, the president posted on Twitter a statement about his golf hobby compared to that of his predecessor. Your pooler notes that the statement includes one or more inaccuracies that reporters on call today may want to fact check before publishing.

WH pool report 2 — motorcade rolling 
Pool gathered at 0845, and were moved into vans on the South Lawn driveway.
At 0858 the motorcade is underway. The WH has not indicated where we are going, but your pooler is on the case and will let you know as soon as possible.
One possible clue: Pool was not administered COVID tests this morning, strongly suggesting we are not scheduled to be anywhere near the president today.

WH pool report 3 — golf 
The president's SUV turned into his private, for-profit golf course in Sterling, Virgina at 0939. Pool vans continued on to an Italian restaurant in a nearby strip mall.
The 28-mile trip was unremarkable. The motorcade used the normal protocol for golf trips, led by a police car and using lights and sirens as necessary to stay together through red lights and to discourage other traffic from cutting into the line of black SUVs and vans.
Some pedestrians at the end held out cell phones to take video. Others flipped us off.
At the entrance were a small group of protesters, including one dressed as the grim reaper, carrying a scythe sign reading “137K.”
Today marks the president's 86th day trip to Sterling.
He has now spent 259 days on a golf course that he owns in his 1,270 days in office.

STED
At the entrance were a small group of protesters, including one dressed as the grim reaper, carrying a scythe sign reading “137K.”
Your pool regrets the error, caused entirely by the bumpy ride in the pool van.

WH pool report 4 — “Moscow on the Potomac” 
Pool was rousted from our tables at Lucia's and brought via vans back to the entrance to Trump's golf course.
There, the grim reaper is gone, replaced by other protesters, including one who has posted a large yellow and orange sign: “Moscow on the Potomac.”
At 1318 awaiting the emergence of the motorcade.

WH pool report 5 — headed back to the WH 
At 1420 the president's motorcade is heading back toward the White House.
During the 62 minutes pool waited on the street outside his golf club, the anti-Trump protest grew from a handful to perhaps two dozen, most with signs commenting on the president's competence and offering advice on steps he should next take.
Across the street, a handful of Trump supporters with “TRUMP 2020” signs waved at passing cars but mainly sat in the shade. A young man in a brown Jeep flying large U.S. and TRUMP 2020 flags drove back and forth at least a dozen times, slowing down each time he passed the anti-Trump group.
Pool has not physically seen the president yet today.
We should be back at the White House in about half an hour.

WH pool report 6 — return 
The president's motorcade pulled into the South Lawn driveway at 1458.
His SUV was long empty by the time we walked past it into the press work space in the West Wing.
Your pooler has asked the White House the names of his partners today. Your pooler is not at all confident we will receive a response.

WH pool report 7 -- lid 
The White House press office announced a travel photo lid at 1504.
Have a pleasant what's left of Sunday.
