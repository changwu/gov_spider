    So we're going to watch the rocket launch. There's a 50/50 chance. We don't know. Because of weather and other things, it's very delicate, but very amazing. So we're going over, and we'll be back in a little while. But we want to watch the rocket launch. NASA has come a long way. It was dead as doornails, and now it's the most vibrant place in the world for that. And so I look forward to it.
I guess you're traveling with me, so maybe we'll see you on the plane. We have a lot of great things happening.
I think that, before I leave, I want to thank Secret Service. They were incredible last night at the White House. They handled that group of Antifa or whoever they wereâ€”radical left. They handled it very well. They handled it very, very well. They handled it incredibly. And we owe a lot to Secret Service. They're incredible men and women.
I'll see you on the plane. Thank you.
