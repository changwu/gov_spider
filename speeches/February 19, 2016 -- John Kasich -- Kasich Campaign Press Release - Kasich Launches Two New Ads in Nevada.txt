    With new polls showing Ohio Governor John Kasich as the Republican in the best position to defeat Hillary Clinton in the general election, Kasich for America today released two new statewide radio advertisements in Nevada that showcase Kasich's plan to get Washington out of the way and return money, power and influence to the American people.
The first ad is called "This Land is Your Land," and highlights Kasich's pledge to give state and local leaders a stronger voice in managing public lands, especially in Nevada where the federal government owns 85 percent of all land.

The second ad highlights Kasich's success cutting taxes and balancing budgets in Ohio and Washington to foster the climate for new job creation.
