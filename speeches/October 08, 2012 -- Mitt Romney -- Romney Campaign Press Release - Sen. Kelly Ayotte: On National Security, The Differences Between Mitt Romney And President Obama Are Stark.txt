    â€” New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's foreign policy speech:
"When it comes to national security and protecting the homeland, the differences between Mitt Romney and President Obama are stark. Like Ronald Reagan, Governor Romney knows America is safer and the world is more stable when America leads and maintains military power beyond challenge. Unfortunately, President Obama is more interested in managing military decline than maintaining the credibility of the U.S. military deterrent. A President Romney will ensure our country has the military that our national security requires. He will provide the American leadership, strength, and clarity that assures our allies, deters our enemies, and keeps the American people safe."
