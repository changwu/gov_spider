    IT IS a pleasure to greet you this morning. You are making records for yourselves that will be useful when it comes time for you to run the Government. It won't be long now, from my way of calculation time, when you will all be responsible for the welfare of the Nation.
You are trying to learn how to assume that responsibility, and that is absolutely essential if we are going to continue with our form of government.
I think our form of government--and I have make some study of the question--is the greatest in the history of the world, and I want to see it continue for another thousand years.
And young men such as you, trying to find out all about it and how it ought to operate, even coming down to tell me what I ought to do, is a good sign that the country is going in the right direction.
You know, there isn't a man in the United States who can't tell the President how to do his job better than the President knows how to do it; and I am sure that you feel the same way about it.
I hope you have had a pleasant time, and I hope you didn't have any contest in this election which I understand took place last night. I hope that the man who had the forward-looking platform won the election, as we did last fall.
Thank you very much.
