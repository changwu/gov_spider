    The Israeli Knesset spoke with a voice heard around the world todayâ€”a voice for peace. We welcome this historic decision. The overwhelming vote in favor of the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt affirms the deep and long-felt desire of the people of Israel for peace with their neighbors. In taking this action, Israel's democracy has lived up to its promise, providing a free and open discussion of all the issues, and then deciding in favor of peace.
The bonds of shared values and common purpose between the United States and Israel are strong and enduring. The achievement of peace between Israel and Egypt will strengthen even more our relations with these two partners in peace and help move toward a stable, cooperative, and peaceful future for all the peoples of the Middle East.
