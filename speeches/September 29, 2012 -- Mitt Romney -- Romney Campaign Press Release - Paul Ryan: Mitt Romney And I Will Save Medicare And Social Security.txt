PAUL RYAN: "Just down in Florida yesterday, Vice President Biden was making up all new falsehoods about Social Security and taxes. They're trying to scare people for political gain. That's unfortunately the kind of campaign that we're seeing, as I said, from a President without a record to run on. Let me be very clear: There is only one person in this race threatening the health and retirement security programs of our seniors, and that is President Obama. There is only one person in this race insisting on raising taxes and that is President Obama. In fact, Joe Biden himself voted to raise taxes on Social Security benefits. And as a Senator, President Obama voted to keep those tax increases in place three times. I want to be very clear about this. Mitt Romney and I will never waver in our commitment to our seniors. Our plans actually save these programs. They make no changes for people in or near retirement. And they strengthen Medicare and Social Security for a generation. You know why we do this? Because it is a promise that was made. It's because people organized their retirements around these promises. They paid their taxes when they worked. And now these benefits are due to them. And shame on the politician who wants to use this issue to try and scare seniors, when those of us are trying to fix this problem for my generation and my kids' generation, and your kids. We will win this election. We will save Medicare and Social Security. And we will make sure that these promises are kept for future generations."
