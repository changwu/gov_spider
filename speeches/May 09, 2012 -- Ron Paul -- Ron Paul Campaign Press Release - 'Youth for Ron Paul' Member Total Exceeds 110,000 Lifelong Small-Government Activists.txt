LAKE JACKSON, Texas – The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign announced today that its 'Youth for Ron Paul' (YFP) program membership has surpassed the 110,000 mark.
Since the program launched in September 2011, and as of yesterday, the number of YFP members was 110,880. Members have established 627 sanctioned chapters in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia.
Young supporters including college-age activists and new workforce entrants established these chapters nationwide to remain politically involved expressly to challenge the status quo, bring about lasting prosperity, and work toward the full, permanent restoration of their economic and civil liberties. Ron Paul, the champion of these aims, often declares that the free-market and constitutional ideas he espouses are young ones, and that an idea whose time has come stands no chance of being stopped. The intellectual revolution youth are bringing about, then, is a manifestation of all that Dr. Paul hopes to achieve through his lifelong advocacy and pursuit of our nation's highest office.
"Young Americans are often viewed as a solid constituency for the left and establishment Washington, who make promise after promise about a federal government that will 'take care of them' from cradle to the grave. Now it's clear that more than 110,000 young Americans reject this empty rhetoric and have committed themselves to the principles of constitutionally-limited government and the restoration of their economic and civil liberties as real solutions to our nation's challenges," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Manager John Tate.
