    I was profoundly saddened to learn of the untimely demise of President-elect Neves. It is a tragic event for his family and for Brazil. In my meeting with him last February, I was deeply impressed by both his human warmth and his intellectual insight. He was indeed a man for the time and his country, and will be sorely missed.
Brazil will be well-served by the heirs of Tancredo's legacy. I am confident that you and the members of his cabinet, inspired by his memory, will provide the leadership Brazil needs at this critical hour.
I would like to express my most profound condolences to you and the people of Brazil, at your great loss. My prayers, and those of Brazil's many friends in the United States, are with you as you take up your new responsibilities.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
