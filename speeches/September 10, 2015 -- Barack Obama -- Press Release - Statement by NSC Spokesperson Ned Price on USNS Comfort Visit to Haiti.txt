    The USNS Comfort, a U.S. Navy hospital ship, will be docking in Haiti on Friday, September 11th. The United States has invited the Cuban Ambassador in Port-au-Prince and five Cuban medical workers to tour the ship and witness its capabilities. The United States and Cuba share certain common interests, among them the health and welfare of the people of Haiti. This engagement provides a unique opportunity to engage with Cuban medical professionals and to discuss opportunities for future cooperation. This cooperation demonstrates how our continued normalization of relations with Cuba can help us advance our interests in the Americas.
