    The President and First Lady to Host a Juneteenth Concert onTuesday, June 13, 2023.
The White House announced today a Juneteenth Concert on Tuesday, June 13. The South Lawn concert will be a celebration of community, culture and music.
In 2021, President Biden signed bipartisan legislation establishing Juneteenth as the nation's newest Federal holiday, so that all Americans can feel the power of this day, learn from our history, celebrate our progress, and recognize and engage in the work that continues.
President Biden has worked to advance racial equity and ensure the promise of America for Black Americans. See fact sheet on the Biden-Harris Administration's ongoing efforts to advance equity and opportunity for Black Americans and communities across the country here.
This concert celebration will also take place during Black Music Month, where the Biden-Harris Administration will uplift American art forms that sing to the soul of the American experience.
