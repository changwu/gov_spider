    Des Moines, IA - Following his break out debate performance last week, Cory Booker secured critical new endorsements from elected officials and activists in the Hawkeye State. The latest Iowa leaders to join one of the largest coalitions of grassroots power in the state include State Representative Beth Wessel-Kroeschell and former Story County Supervisor Wayne Clinton.
"We have worked since day one to build an operation that wins in the room on caucus night, and we are confident that our organization is on the right path to be successful and continue our momentum into the caucuses. The active and influential supporters who Representative Wessel-Kroeschell, former Supervisor Clinton, and so many more join today are an advantage that money cannot buy, and we can't wait to win with them on February 3rd," said Cory 2020 State Director Mike Frosolone.
"I'm proud to endorse Cory Booker for president because he understands this moment in our nation. He knows that we must unite Americans to rise above the dysfunction and hate that is ripping us apart, but, more than that, he knows that we have to actually deliver results for our friends and neighbors who have been left behind for far too long. Cory is a proven leader and coalition builder, and I wholeheartedly believe that our future will be brightest if he is elected President in 2020," said Iowa State Representative Beth Wessel-Kroeschell.
"At a time when it feels like we're being pulled further and further apart by our differences, we need to elect a leader who sees the dignity and worth in every person he meets. Cory Booker is a uniter who leads with his values. His ability to bring people together to get things done sets him apart from the field, and it's why I'll be proud to support him on caucus night," said former Story County Supervisor Wayne Clinton.
