    Marco Draws Young, Fired-Up Crowd in West Palm Beach
 
The day before Florida goes to vote, Marco stopped by a college in West Palm Beach to rally supporters — and students flocked to see him.

Walked through the crowds here for Marco & 75% is under 35. NOTE: This is a college campus, but still impressive to see at GOP event

The big crowd was of a piece with the reception he's been getting recently:

Marco laid out some criticisms of the current state of the election, and the perverse idea the front runner has about what leadership means:

A bit more of what he had to say, via the Miami Herald:
Rubio denounced the rhetoric on the campaign trail. Without naming Trump he said that we have a candidate that says at rallies "if someone heckles me and you punch them in face I will pay your legal fees. .... We have a candidate that uses profanity. We have never had a presidential candidate that has to be bleeped out. We have a candidate now leading the Republican primary that we have to explain to our children."
In a hit on Trump, Rubio said "The presidency is not a reality TV show. It's not the political version of Survivor."
A local TV station reported that Marco got a great reception from the crowd — and one attendee noted that no one risked injury at the rally.

Younger voters get it just as well as anyone: We need a real leader to solve the problems America faces, not a vulgar con artist.
