    As President of the United States, I extend my best wishes to the U.S. delegation which departs tonight for Copenhagen to represent our Government at the World Conference for the United Nations Decade for Women. This delegation of distinguished women and men reflects the wide diversity of our society and is ably led by Ambassador Donald McHenry and Presidential Assistant Sarah Weddington.
The Conference will provide a constructive opportunity to review the progress of women throughout the world during the past 5 years and to establish a meaningful plan of specific actions to benefit women for the coming 5 years. The work of this Conference to improve the conditions of women's lives everywhere in the world can make a major contribution to the enhancement of human rights, a goal which has been a vital element of my administration's policy. The United States is deeply committed to eliminating all forms of discrimination and will continue to work for equal rights at home and abroad.
I am proud to authorize Sarah Weddington to sign, on behalf of the United States, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Following the signing ceremony in Copenhagen on July 17, the Convention will be subjected to the normal constitutional processes of the United States.
I am confident that this delegation will contribute to international understanding and cooperation on these vital issues and will reflect great credit on our country.
