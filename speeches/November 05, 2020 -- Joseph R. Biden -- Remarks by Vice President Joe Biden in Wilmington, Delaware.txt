Good afternoon.
Senator Harris and I just completed full briefings on both the COVID and economic crises facing the nation.
We're reminded again of the severity of this pandemic: Cases are on the rise nationwide, and we are nearing 240,000 deaths due to COVID.
My heart goes out to each and every family that has lost a loved one to this terrible disease.
In America, the vote is sacred.
It's how the people of this nation express their will.
And it is the will of the voters, no one — and not anything else — that chooses the President of the United States.
So, each ballot must be counted and that's what is going on now.
And that's how it should be.
Democracy is sometimes messy, so sometimes it requires a little patience.
But that patience has been rewarded now for more than 240 years with a system of governance that has been the envy of the world.
We continue to feel very good about where things stand.
And we have no doubt that when the count is finished, Senator Harris and I will be the winners.
So, I ask people to stay calm.
The process is working.
The count is being completed.
And we will know soon.
Thank you.
My God Bless You, and may God protect our troops.
