    President George W. Bush today announced that he has named Scott H. Evertz to be Director of the Office of National AIDS Policy. He is currently the Vice President of the Luther Manor Foundation, Inc., and the Director of Resource Development for the United Lutheran Program for the Aging in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
As the Director of the Office of National AIDS Policy, Mr. Evertz will work with federal agencies and coordinate the development of HIV/AIDS policy for the White House. He will also be the White House point of contact for organizations focused on community-based, national and international aspects of HIV/AIDS.
The Office of National AIDS Policy will have an increased focus on the international components of the disease. The President has directed the office to work closely with both the Department of State and the Department of Health and Human Services on policy recommendations on the international front due to the growing global health crisis of HIV/AIDS. The office will have two full-time detailees -- one from the Department of State and one from the Department of Health and Human Services. The Office will also provide support to a new high-level AIDS task force co-chaired by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The task force will also include the White House Domestic Policy Advisor and the National Security Advisor and will work to better coordinate the Administration's proactive activities and responses to all aspects of the domestic and international AIDS epidemic.
Mr. Evertz has extensive experience working with victims of AIDS and has volunteered his time generously within the community. He voluntarily serves as the Development Counsel for Common Ground & Elena's House, a faith-based organization which provides care and services to people living with HIV and AIDS and was a founding member of the Wisconsin HIV/AIDS Care Coalition.
