    National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice met today at the White House with Libyan Foreign Minister Mohamed al-Dayri. Ambassador Rice expressed the United States' condolences for the horrific attacks and resulting deaths today in eastern Libya and all those who have been killed by terrorist groups in Libya. She reiterated strong U.S. support for the mediation efforts led by U.N. Special Representative of the Secretary-General Bernardino Leon and for a political resolution to the ongoing conflict in Libya. She urged the swift formation of a national unity government that can partner with the international community to fight terrorist groups and conclude Libya's transition process, including the completion of a new constitution and holding elections for a new government under that constitution.
