    Menendez Will Serve as National Campaign Co-Chair
The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez and named him a national Co-Chair of Clinton's campaign.
"Senator Hillary Clinton is uniquely prepared and unquestionably ready to lead this country and inspire each of us to be our best," Menendez said. "Senator Clinton stands out for the richness of her experience, the depth of her intelligence and the strength of her ideals. She is clearly the right leader, ready to chart a new course for America."
Elected to the Senate last November, Menendez previously served in the House of Representatives for 14 years, rising to become Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus and the highest-ranking Hispanic in Congressional history.
After September 11, 2001, Menendez earned national recognition for his leadership in reforming the country's intelligence and public health systems and for fighting to establish an independent commission to investigate the terrorist attacks on our country. He has also led the fight in Congress to stop Social Security privatization and expand access to affordable healthcare.
"Bob and I have worked side-by-side to help those affected by 9/11 and ensure that we take steps to make America more secure," Clinton said. "I'm honored to have his support, and I look forward to continuing our work on expanding healthcare access and ensuring retirement security for all Americans."
