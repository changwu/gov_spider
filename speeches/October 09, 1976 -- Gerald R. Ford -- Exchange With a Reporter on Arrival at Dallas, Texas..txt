    REPORTER. Mr. Carter said yesterday that he wants you to give the American public some more facts about that IRS report concerning your campaign funds in 1972. He says we need to know more about that.
THE PRESIDENT. Well, all of those were thoroughly investigated by the FBI, by the IRS, and by two committees of the Congress, and they gave me an absolute clean bill of health.
I suggest that people who throw stones shouldn't live in glass houses.
Thank you very much.
