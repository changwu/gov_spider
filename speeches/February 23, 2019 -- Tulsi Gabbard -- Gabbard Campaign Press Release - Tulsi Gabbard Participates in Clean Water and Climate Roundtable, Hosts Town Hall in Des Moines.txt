    DES MOINES, IOWA—Tulsi Gabbard, Hawaii congresswoman and presidential candidate, met with Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement today to discuss The Clean Water Act, water rights, climate change policy, and other important environmental issues affecting everyday life for the people of Iowa. She also met with Iowa District 3 Democrats to discuss bringing the Party together and what needs to be done to best serve the people and their families.
This evening, Tulsi hosted a town hall in Des Moines, where she connected the dots on how foreign wars of intervention deplete critical resources necessary to address domestic needs in the United States—including healthcare, education, infrastructure, and more.
