    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement today calling on President Bush to support the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act that the U.S. Senate is debating and likely to approve.
"It's time for President Bush to be honest with the American people and admit he was wrong on the issue of stem cell research. Stem cell research is not just another political issue. It's a moral issue, and where you stand is a test of moral leadership. A growing number of Americans from across the country and members of Congress from both sides of the aisle have joined together to support expanding stem cell research.
"Saying three simple words, I was wrong, would direct the full force of American scientific ingenuity towards developing cures for diseases that afflict millions of our fellow citizens. The President should fully support the Senate's bill to fund robust stem cell research. Everyday the President lacks the courage to admit he was wrong, he pushes medical breakthroughs that could help millions of Americans further away.
"President Bush has the power to fix his mistake. With the stroke of his pen, he can expand research and restore hope to millions of Americans."
