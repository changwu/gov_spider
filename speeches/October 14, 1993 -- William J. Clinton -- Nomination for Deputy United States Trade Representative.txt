    The President announced today that he intends to nominate former Washington Governor, Booth Gardner to be Deputy United States Trade Representative, with the rank of Ambassador. He will serve in USTR's Geneva, Switzerland office, representing the U.S. before the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world body on trade policies and practices among nations.
"Booth Gardner was one of the very best Governors with whom I served. He has a solid background in business and trade" said the President, "and knows firsthand the importance of free and fair trade to keeping our economy strong and creating jobs for American workers. I think he will do an outstanding job in Geneva."
