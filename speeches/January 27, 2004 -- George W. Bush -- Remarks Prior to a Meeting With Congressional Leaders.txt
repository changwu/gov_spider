    Legislative Agenda
I want to thank the Members from the Senate and the House who are here, both Republicans and Democrat leaders who are here to discuss the upcoming session. We've got a lot of common interests this year, interests of continuing to fight and win the war against terror. We need to protect our homeland. We need to put policies in place that help people find work. We'll work together on the health needs of our fellow citizens. We've got to be wise with the people's money. I look forward to constructive conversation today and working together constructively throughout the year. This is an election year. It's a year where people say, "Nothing can get done." We need to prove them wrong. We need to continue to do the people's business in a sound way.
I want to thank the Members for coming. I appreciate the chance to visit with you, and I look forward to a good relationship here in 2004.
