    Today, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield released the following statement on Vice President Pence's visit to Minnesota:
"Nothing Vice President Pence says today will distract voters from the truth: four years of the Trump-Pence Administration's chaos and division has made Minnesotans' lives worse. In Donald Trump and Mike Pence's America, 2,000 Minnesotans have died from COVID-19 and tens of thousands more have lost their jobs due to the administration's failed response to the coronavirus. The Trump-Pence Administration is in court attempting to strip health insurance from tens of millions of Americans and eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions during a deadly pandemic. Americans are more divided than ever and crying out for real, unifying leadership.
"In this time of crisis, Minnesotans deserve a leader who will bring the country together, keep families safe, protect health care, and build the economy back better than before. That's Joe Biden's vision for America, and Minnesotans know that he will provide the leadership working families so desperately need and deserve."
