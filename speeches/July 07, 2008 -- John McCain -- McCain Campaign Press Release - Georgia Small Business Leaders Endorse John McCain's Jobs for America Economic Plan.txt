    TALLAHASSEE, FL -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced its Georgia Small Business Leaders for McCain coalition chairmen and steering committee. Today small business owners throughout Georgia endorsed John McCain's economic plan, joining business leaders across the country who have praised John McCain's jobs-first plan to grow the economy as president.
"As a business owner and legislator, I support John McCain because he understands that small business owners thrive in a pro-growth environment," said State Senator Chip Rogers. "John McCain will keep taxes low so that small business owners have the resources they need to make their businesses grow and so that their customers will have money in their pockets to spend."
Rick Culbreth, owner of Savannah's Yates-Astro Pest Control added, "John McCain is the best candidate for small business and that is why I support him. As president he will get our economy back on track with policies that help the engine of our economy-- small businesses."
Today in Colorado John McCain announced his Jobs for America economic plan, kicking off five days of economic themed activity in critical battleground states.
