    Today on Holocaust Remembrance Day, we honor the memories of those who died in the Holocaust and pay tribute to those who survived.
Yom HaShoah reminds us of our never-ending obligation to teach our children about the Holocaust so that the memory of these terrible events can never be extinguished. This winter, I took my granddaughter to Dachau, just as I had taken each of my own children as they came of age. Young people need to understand what happened. They need to feel a sense of personal duty to carry forward the mission of making sure it never happens again.
Too often "never again" has been used in lamentâ€”as a statement of regret over responses that were insufficient or came too late. These words must inspire reflection and, more importantly, action. We must continue to derive strength and courage from them and recommit ourselves to the work of making sure these atrocities can never be repeated. We must actively fight the scourge of bigotry and anti-Semitism wherever it occurs.
Finally, the survivors we honor today have made extraordinary contributions to the fabric of life in the United States and around the world--and many are still in need. They deserve our admiration and our care.
