    Today, former Mayor of Phoenix and Arizona Congressman Greg Stanton (AZ-9), released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for the President of the United States:
"This election is the most important in modern history, and Joe Biden is the best choice to defeat Donald Trump and unite and heal our country. Joe will deliver real, meaningful results for Arizona families by improving and expanding access to health care, creating good jobs, and re-establish America's role as leader on the global stage â€“ especially when it comes to combating climate change. I know that Joe is not only the best candidate to take back the White House, but the best choice to make sure that we have majorities who will fight for working families in both the House and Senate."
Stanton has represented Arizona's 9th District since 2019. Prior to that he was elected as Mayor of Phoenix in 2011 and served on the Phoenix City Council from 2000 to 2009.
Stanton joins Former United States Senator Dennis DeConcini, Arizona Corporation Commission Member Sandra Kennedy, Former Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, and numerous other Arizona leaders in endorsing Joe Biden.
Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,400 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
