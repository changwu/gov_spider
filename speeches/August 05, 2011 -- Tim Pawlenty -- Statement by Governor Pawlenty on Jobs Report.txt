    "Today's dismal jobs report is a far cry from the hope and change that President Obama promised on the campaign trail. Since the President took office, unemployment has risen 17%, the federal debt has increased 37% and gas prices have doubled. In the last week, the stock market suffered its worst day in years, economic growth was revised down and consumer confidence dropped. Despite these clear and abundant signs that our economy is floundering, President Obama has still failed to deliver a concrete plan to create jobs and promote growth. This lack of leadership is inexcusable and driving our economy toward decline. It's time for a new president to point us back in the right direction, and I am the only candidate who has proposed a specific economic plan that will create jobs and grow our economy."
