    Michelle and I extend our warmest thoughts and wishes to all those who are celebrating Kwanzaa this holiday season. Today is the first of a joyful 7-day celebration of African American culture and heritage. The seven principles of Kwanzaa--unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith--are some of the very values that make us Americans.
As families across America and around the world light the kinara today in the spirit of umoja, or unity, our family sends our well wishes and blessings for a happy and healthy new year.
