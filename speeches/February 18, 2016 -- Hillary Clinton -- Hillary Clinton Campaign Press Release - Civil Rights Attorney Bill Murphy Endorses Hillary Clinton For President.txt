    Longtime civil rights advocate Bill Murphy, the lawyer who is representing Flint residents in a class action lawsuit against Michigan officials and the family of Freddie Gray has announced his support for Hillary Clinton. Murphy, a Baltimore native, released the following statement Thursday:
"Today I endorse Hillary Clinton for president of the United States: Because she has been truly loyal to President Obama and is the best person to protect and build on his legacy. Because she has a better relationship with communities of color than Bernie or any other candidate. Because she knows more about the power of the presidency and how to use it than Bernie or any other candidate. Because she has more foreign policy knowledge, experience and success then Bernie or any other candidate. Because Hillary's background as a lawyer puts her in a better position than Bernie or any other candidate to understand who should be nominated to the Supreme Court. Because we trust Hillary more than Bernie or anyone else to keep America safe. And most important, because never again do we want our hearts broken and our hopes dashed by nominating a wonderful candidate who can't beat the Republicans in the general election.
I'm all in for Hillary Clinton for President of the United States."
