    I commend the members of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy for their hard work and welcome their Final Report.
Our oceans sustain an abundance of natural wonders, enable the transportation of vital goods, and provide food and recreation for millions of Americans. My administration is working with every level of government, the private sector, and other nongovernmental organizations to advance the next generation of ocean policy. In order to foster more effective management and conservation of our ocean and coastal resources, my administration has launched and supported numerous innovative science, management, and policy initiatives. We have created a new integrated ocean observing system with international partners, embarked on deep oceans research with a state-of-the-art research ship, and advanced legislation to strengthen the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. We are also building an improved, market-based system to help restore our fisheries and keep our commercial and recreational fishing industries strong. Working with Congress and State Governors, my administration looks forward to building on these initiatives assisted by the work of the Commission.
