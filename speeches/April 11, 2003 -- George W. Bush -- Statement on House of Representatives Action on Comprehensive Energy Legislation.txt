    I commend the House for passing comprehensive and balanced energy legislation. The House legislation will increase America's energy independence by diversifying our sources of renewable energy, expanding new technology, and increasing environmentally responsible exploration. This bill is a major step forward in the effort to secure our Nation's energy future, in keeping with my National Energy Policy. I look forward to prompt Senate action and to working to ensure that fiscally responsible legislation to reduce our reliance on foreign sources of energy can be brought to my desk.
