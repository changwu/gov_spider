    On Wednesday, June 2nd, the President and First Lady will host a concert in the East Room honoring Paul McCartney, who will be awarded the 3rd Gershwin Prize for Popular Song from the Library of Congress. President Obama will present the award as he did last year when the Library of Congress honored Stevie Wonder. The concert will be broadcast on PBS stations nationwide on Wednesday, July 28, 2010 at 8:00 PM EDT (check local listings) as “In Performance at the White House Celebrating the Music of Paul McCartney: The Library of Congress Gershwin Prize.”
The prize commemorates George and Ira Gershwin, the legendary American songwriting team whose extensive manuscript collections reside in the Library of Congress. The prize is awarded to musicians whose lifetime contributions in the field of popular song exemplify the standard of excellence associated with the Gershwins.
The President’s remarks at the ceremony will be pooled press.
