    (LOS ANGELES, December 19, 2019) â€” Yesterday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the federal health insurance mandate provision of the Affordable Care Act, calling it unconstitutional. This decision, from a predominantly conservative bench, further imperils health care for millions of Americans, who already face significant financial barriers to medical and pharmaceutical access. As part of his 5 Rights Agenda, Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer will fight to make health care a constitutional right for all Americans. He will also make appointing judges who will defend workers and families a priority of his administration.
Steyer released the following statement:
"Yesterday's court decision will hurt millions of hard-working Americans throughout this country. The United States Supreme Court already upheld the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate in 2012. It is constitutionally compliant and it provides essential care to millions. The Trump administration's relentless attack on health care will disproportionately hurt lower income families and communities of color.
"Thankfully California's elected leaders have enacted a state individual mandate, and I applaud Attorney General Becerra's decision to appeal this to the highest court in the land. My health care plan will protect the ACA's key provisions, expand its benefits for millions of Americans, and create a new public option to give Americans the choice of a quality, affordable plan. This court decision is yet another example of the importance of electing a progressive Democrat in 2020 to reverse the rightwing polarization of the federal judiciary."
