    President Bush will welcome President Toomas Ilves of Estonia to the White House on June 25, 2007. As the President witnessed during his visit last November, Estonia is a thriving example of how freedom has transformed the nations of central and eastern Europe, and brought security and prosperity to the people of the region. Estonia shares the lessons of its success with others pursuing liberty in their countries. A valued NATO ally, Estonia is making important contributions to the security and development of Afghanistan, and to securing freedom in Iraq. President Bush looks forward to discussing these and other regional and international issues with President Ilves.
