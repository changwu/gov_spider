    To the Congress of the United States:
I herewith transmit the Seventh Annual Report of the National Advisory Council on Extension and Continuing Education. The Council is authorized by Public Law 89-329.
The Council's study covers the impact of Federal continuing education, extension and community service programs. I especially commend its analysis of the problems and shortcomings which have resulted from too many fragmented programs operating under various narrow legislative authorities. This study lends further support to a better approach to higher education which would permit academic communities to pursue excellence and reform in the fields they choose and by the means they choose.
The new Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education provides a way to support development of effective programs in continuing education, extension, and community service. Because of the wide range of support possible under the Fund's broad mandate, I shall continue to recommend the termination of other less flexible programs.
