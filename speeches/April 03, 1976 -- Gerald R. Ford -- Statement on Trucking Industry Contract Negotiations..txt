    LABOR SECRETARY W. J. Usery has informed me that representatives of the Teamsters Union and the trucking companies have reached tentative agreement on a new contract. I am pleased that they have taken this constructive step.
I want to compliment the negotiators and Secretary Usery for their efforts to work out a settlement through the collective bargaining process.
