In-town pool report #8 — full Q/A
Otter: https://otter.ai/u/EHzmFffY4CVxiMana1o959wmN5s
On the border, why is the border more overwhelmed under your watch, Mr. President?
BIDEN: Because there are three countries that never — there are fewer and fewer immigrants coming from Central America and from Mexico. It's a totally different circumstance. What's on my watch now is Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, and the ability to send them back to those states is not rational. You could send them back and have them — we're working with Mexico and other countries to see if we can stop the flow. That's the difference.
Question: Ron DeSantis says he's sending migrants to Delaware. Do you have any comment or response to that, sir?
BIDEN: He should come visit. We have a beautiful shoreline

Out of town pool report #1: Motorcade rolling
Hello, I'll be your print pooler this afternoon/evening for President Biden's trip to New York City for the United Nations General Assembly. We are motorcading to JBA, as a large tent is being constructed on the South Lawn for the Elton John performance happening there Friday.
POTUS emerged from the north White House entrance at 4:10 p.m. The motorcade pulled out of the north White House driveway at 4:11.
The president is slated to attend a DNC reception this evening in New York. I'll send more details on that as I get them. Feel free to reach out with any questions.

Motorcade pulled onto the JBA tarmac at 4:33 p.m. after an uneventful drive.
The president did not come over to answer questions or talk to the pool. He waved at the top of the steps, then boarded Air Force One at 4:38 p.m.
We will be wheels up for New York City momentarily.

Out of town pool report #4: NYC landing
Air Force One was wheels down at JFK Airport at 5:25 p.m. Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre popped back to the press cabin to say hello during the flight.
POTUS deplaned at 5:33 and then made his way on foot to Marine One, which was parked nearby. Pool is loading into an osprey and will follow along for the quick flight to the landing zone.



September 20, 202218:02

Out of town pool report #5: Landing zone
Marine One set down at the Wall Street landing zone at 5:55 p.m., lightly misting reporters in the process as it kicked up water from the East River.
Press was moved to vans before seeing Biden step off and get into the motorcade. We are now headed to tonight's DNC reception at 6:01.



September 20, 202218:25

Out of town pool report #6: Fundraiser arrival
Motorcade arrived at the fundraiser location at 6:20 p.m. near the corner of E 59th Street and Madison Avenue after an uneventful drive. Plenty of onlookers lined the blocked off streets, many with phones out taking photos and video. We are now holding outside.
Your pooler has reached out to the DNC for details on tonight's reception, and I will pass along anything I get in response.



September 20, 202219:14

Out of town pool report #7: DNC reception begins
Pool was brought into the home of Henry Munoz III for a fundraiser. Biden walked out to applause at 7:10 p.m., looked at the pool and noted we were situated behind a rope line. He then went to the main room filled with guests and got down on one knee to greet a child who said she just turned 6.
Biden was accompanied by New York City mayor Eric Adams and former Rep. Charlie Rangel as he walked out.
Pool also spotted actor Robert De Niro in attendance. De Niro was seen leaving (with a mask on) before POTUS came out to speak.
A DNC official said tonight's fundraiser is being attended by roughly 100 guests and will raise nearly $2 million for the DNC and Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund.



September 20, 202219:45

Out of town pool report #8: Biden remarks
Henry Munoz spoke first. POTUS was then introduced by Mayor Adams, who praised Biden as an "everyday guy" and a "plain talking Democrat. Adams said he wanted to deliver the message that "We not only want him to be re-elected, we need him to be re-elected."
Biden began speaking at 7:20. Hit on many of the same themes from his other speeches, talking about the stakes of the coming midterms, how he told G7 leaders "America is back" and was asked "for how long?" and how the country was founded based on an idea.
He touted investments in infrastructure, the Inflation Reduction Act', declining gas prices, the bipartisan gun safety bill. He got loud applause for saying he's going to fight to ban assault weapons.
Some quotes below. Check against official transcript. Video/photo was not allowed in the room.
"There’s so darn much at stake," he said, calling it an inflection point.
"I know I got criticized for the speech I made in Philadelphia," he said later, but argued one can't say they're for democratic values if they "celebrate violence against the government."
On abortion and Roe v. Wade:
He cited Justice Alito's comments in a leaked draft of the Dobbs opinion when the justice said it would allow women the chance to vote to affect the legislative process.
"They ain't seen nothing yet," Biden said.
"But it's about freedom. It's not just about choice... Now mark my words, they're going after gay rights. I guarantee you. Promise you," he said, adding contraception access was also at risk.
"This isn't about 2024, this is about 2022," Biden said in closing, warning that he'd spend all his time using the veto pen.
Biden wrapped at 7:41, pool ushered out quickly and is headed back down to the motorcade.



September 20, 202220:12

Out of town pool report #9: Motorcade rolling
The motorcade is rolling from the fundraiser site at 8:10 p.m. Pool was in vans and did not see POTUS leave the building.
One other note from the remarks- Biden made mention of his comments to "60 Minutes" that the pandemic is "over," noting he got criticized for saying it.
"But it basically is not where it was," Biden added, while urging those in attendance to get their booster shots if they haven't already.
Thanks to Emily Goodin and Jennifer Jacobs for their help transcribing some of the remarks.



September 20, 202220:22

Out of town pool report #10: RON arrival and lid
Motorcade arrived at the Intercontinental at 8:15 p.m. A lid was called at 8:20. Have a good rest of the night!
