    Instead of closing the deadly gun show loophole, the House of Representatives voted in the dark of night to let criminals keep buying guns at gun shows. This vote will not stand the light of day. I will keep working until the Congress stands up to the gun lobby and makes the commonsense measures passed by the Senate the law of the land. We owe it to the families of the children who died in Littleton to give all Americans the safety they deserve.
