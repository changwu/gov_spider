    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rostenkowski (D) Illinois and 62 others)
In his veto message on H.R. 3, the President expressed his desire for a second trade bill that would improve U.S. competitiveness.
Therefore, the Administration supports House action to move the process forward by enacting a second bill as soon as possible.
The President's veto message listed a number of objectionable features in the first bill, and the Administration is encouraged by the House's deletion of two of the most onerous anticompetitive provisions.
