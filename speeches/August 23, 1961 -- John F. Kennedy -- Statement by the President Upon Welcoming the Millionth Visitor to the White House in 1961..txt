    IT IS a great pleasure that we welcome Mrs. Jack Sprayberry of Rome, Georgia who is the one-millionth visitor to the White House in the year 1961. This is, the first year in the history of the White House that we have welcomed this many visitors. The previous high was 977,142 in 1960.
I believe this indicates a renewed interest in the White House as a great American landmark and virtually the only home of a head of state in the world where the people of the country are welcome as visitors. The White House is alive with history back to the earliest days of our country and I would like to take this opportunity to urge every American when the opportunity presents itself to come to Washington to visit this historic home.
Our young people can be inspired by the history; our older people can have their faith renewed by it. The White House is the home belonging to the United States and it is only fitting that as many visit it as possible.
