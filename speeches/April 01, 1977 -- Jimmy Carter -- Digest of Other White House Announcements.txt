At his regular news conference today, Press Secretary Jody Powell read a correction for the record concerning a White House press release of March 2, 1977 (page 274 of this volume). Mr. Powell stated, "We indicated on March 2 with regard to the development of a national energy policy that the mail would go to the general public seeking their views on the energy situation; that the mailing would be drawn from the census lists. That was incorrect. It is, in fact, illegal to draw names from the census lists. So, we didn't do it. In fact, we did in fact use mailing lists obtained from the Reuben H. Donnelley Company. They were random samplings based on Bureau of Census data. The mailing went forward, but just from a different list process."
