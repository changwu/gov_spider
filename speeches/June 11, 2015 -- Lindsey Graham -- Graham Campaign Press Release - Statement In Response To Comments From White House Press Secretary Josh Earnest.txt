    Alexandria, VA â€” In response to comments made by White House press secretary Josh Earnest today about a Graham White House, communications director Brittany Bramell, released the following statement:
"Let's imagine a White House without Barack Obama. A White House without a president who leads from behind, who doesn't stand up for our allies, who doesn't listen to his military commanders. Now let's imagine a White House with a Commander-in-Chief ready on day one, a Commander-in-Chief like Lindsey Graham. A Graham White House would be respected by our allies and feared by our enemies. It's not that hard to imagine a Graham White House, particularly with the nightmare Americans have been living through these last 6 years."
