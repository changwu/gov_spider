    President Leone, Mrs. Leone, Mr. Prime Minister, Excellencies, and friends:
Mr. President, Mrs. Ford and I express our grateful appreciation for the very warm and generous welcome. We are delighted to be here.
The United States and Italy are close friends and very close allies. This fact was apparent during President Leone's visit to Washington in 1974. That visit was memorable to me as the first visit by a European head of state to the United States during my Presidency. The very positive results of our discussions were reflected in the U.S.-Italian joint statement issued last September.
Now, during my first visit to Europe as a President, I come to Rome to continue our consultations on the many, many issues of great importance to both of our countries.
Our discussions today will be inspired and strengthened by the results of the ` summit meeting in which both our countries participated last week and by our reaffirmation, together with other NATO member nations, of our dedication to Alliance goals.
Extraordinary ties of friendship and kinship link our people. It is my pleasure to bring to you, Mr. President, the greetings and the very high regard of the people of the United States for Italy. In a world of rapid and dramatic change, Italian-American friendship stands out as a symbol of stability and resolve.
I know that our meetings, Mr. President, will reinforce the traditional bonds of affection and cooperation between our two countries, thus contributing to our goals of peace and prosperity for Italy, for the United States, and for all nations.
