South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy called out Ted Cruz's campaign today after another round of dirty tricks ahead of Saturday's vote.Watch:

Cruz himself has reportedly acted "irritated" and "rattled" as his campaign's deceptions have been raised.
Conservative outlets have criticized him for resorting to misleading attacks rather than debating the issues, too.
It's time for Ted Cruz to stop the underhanded attacks and focus on the real issues South Carolinians care about.
