    National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with the Secretary General of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, MOTEGI Toshimitsu, to discuss the regional security environment and U.S.-Japan relations. Both officials underscored their commitment to strengthening bilateral economic and security cooperation, affirmed their resolve to continue supporting Ukraine as it defends itself from Russia's brutal and unlawful invasion, and discussed the importance of increasing multilateral cooperation across the region, including with the Republic of Korea. Mr. Sullivan noted that President Biden looks forward to meeting Prime Minister Kishida at the G7 Leaders' Summit in Hiroshima this month. The two officials committed to continue deepening the bilateral partnership to advance their shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific.
