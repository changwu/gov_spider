    Dear Phil:
It is with deep regret that I accept your resignation as Deputy Attorney General, effective upon the availability of a successor.
You brought a most impressive history of service to the Department of Justice and distinguished yourself at every turn. During your time as Deputy Attorney General, you consistently demonstrated intelligence, integrity, sound judgment, and an unyielding commitment to the cause of justice.
I am very grateful for all of your many contributions to my Administration and our nation. I wish you the very best as you return to your academic career at Harvard Law School.
Sincerely,
BILL CLINTON
