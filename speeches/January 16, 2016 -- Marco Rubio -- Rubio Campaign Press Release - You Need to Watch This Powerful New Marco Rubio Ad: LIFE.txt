To Marco Rubio, the issue of life goes beyond the political debate. Watch this amazing new ad about the issue, which starts airing in Iowa today:


For me the issue of abortion and life is not a political issue, it's a human rights issue. I will look for ways to limit the number of abortions in this country, particularly those late-term abortions where children who are viable outside the womb are still being killed.
If I have to make a choice, I am going to choose life. It's not because I want to tell anybody what to do with their bodies or their lives, but because I believe that one of the fundamental rights given to us by our Creator is the right to live. 
Awesome ad. No one a better persuader for pro-life than Marco. https://t.co/Wh6NCgAWDL

Marco has always sided with life. He will continue to fight to provide a voice for the voiceless as President.
