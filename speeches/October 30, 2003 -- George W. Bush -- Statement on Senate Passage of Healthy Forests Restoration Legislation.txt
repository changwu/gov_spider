    I commend the Senate for passing the "Healthy Forests Restoration Act." The bipartisan support for this commonsense legislation demonstrates that we are united in our goal of returning our Nation's forests to health by eliminating unnatural overgrowth and promoting early community involvement in forest management planning.
Restoring forest health is important to the safety of our communities and to the protection of wildlife, endangered species, water supplies, and forest resources. I urge the House and Senate to quickly resolve the differences in their bills so that I can sign this important legislation and we can fully implement my Healthy Forests Initiative.
