    I have signed into law S. 3036, the Susan B. Anthony Dollar Coin Act of 1978. This act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to replace the current dollar coin with the "Anthony dollar," a smaller, more easily handled coin. I am confident this act—and the new dollar—will substantially improve our coinage system as well as cutting Government coin production costs.
I am particularly pleased that the new dollar coin will—for the first time in history—bear the image of a great American woman. The life of Susan B. Anthony exemplifies the ideals for which our country stands. The "Anthony dollar" will symbolize for all American women the achievement of their unalienable right to vote. It will be a constant reminder of the continuing struggle for the equality of all Americans.
