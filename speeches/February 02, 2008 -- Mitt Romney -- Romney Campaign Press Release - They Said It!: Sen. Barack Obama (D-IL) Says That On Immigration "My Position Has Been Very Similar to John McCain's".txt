    Sen. Barack Obama: "I think they [Republicans] will pounce on any issue that has to do with immigration. But as I said, my position has been very similar to John McCain's, who's maybe the likely Republican nominee. And if he wants to try to parse out this one issue of driver's licenses, an issue of public safety, my response is that we have to solve the overall problem." (ABC's "World News Tonight," 2/2/08)
