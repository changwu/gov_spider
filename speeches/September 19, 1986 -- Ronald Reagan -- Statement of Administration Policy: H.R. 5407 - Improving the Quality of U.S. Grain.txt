    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Smith (D) Iowa and 17 others)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 5407, but will seek amendments in the Senate to:
— clarify that the prohibition on recombining or adding dockage or foreign material to grain applies only to those who do so knowingly;
— exempt grain to be used for animal feed from the prohibition, since most dockage and foreign material has feed value;
— delete the requirement for publication of final rules regarding insect infestation of grain within 6 months because, while the development of such males is underway, it cannot be completed that soon; and
— delete some of the unnecessaory study requirements, such as the ones regarding compensation for losses due to changes in grain standards and paying premiums for premium quality grain.
