    Governor Richardson stands out with strong plan to get US troops out of Iraq, his clear direction for US foreign policy, and his vision for improving education
CHARLESTON, SC -- Governor Bill Richardson continues to score well in the reviews from last night's CNN/YouTube debate in South Carolina. The Governor scored with voters and commentators with his plan to get US troops out of Iraq with no residual forces.
Governor Richardson also drew favorable reaction to his strong responses to questions involving improving education and rebuilding America's reputation and relationships around the world. Debate watchers noted the Governor's unequaled record of experience, his understanding of the issues, and his direct responses to the questions posed through users of the YouTube Internet site.
Governor Richardson tied for first place in the debate in a CNN focus group of undecided Nevada voters.
Chris Cillizza of the Washington Post's The Fix called Governor Richardson one of the winners of last night's debate.

Governor Richardson is prepared on day one to be President and to handle the challenges facing this country, and his unparalleled experience resonated last night. The Nation notes that "The most meaningful [response], at least in terms of the preparation of the various contenders to deal with the demands of the global stage, came from New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, a former congressman, cabinet secretary and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations."

David Yepsen of the Des Moines Register writes that "Chris Dodd and Bill Richardson gained the most...Richardson's affability and diplomatic background came through."

South Carolina newspaper The State said that:
"Richardson was direct with most of his answers, refraining from pandering to the crowd and showing depth in his answers. An example was his layered response to a question about the federal No Child Left Behind law, which he favors repealing. His answer showed the only governor on the stage understood the issue from the states' perspective."
