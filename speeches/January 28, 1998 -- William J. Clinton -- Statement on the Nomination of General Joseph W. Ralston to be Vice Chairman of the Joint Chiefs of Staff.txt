    I am pleased to announce that I have nominated General Joseph W. Ralston for a second 2-year tour as Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
General Ralston has served with distinction as Vice Chairman over the past 2 years, providing excellent advice and support for two Secretaries of Defense and two Chairmen. His experience with the quadrennial defense review and major defense policy issues, along with his demonstrated leadership skills, ensure that the position of Vice Chairman will continue to be filled by the high caliber of individual needed for this challenging and vital post.
