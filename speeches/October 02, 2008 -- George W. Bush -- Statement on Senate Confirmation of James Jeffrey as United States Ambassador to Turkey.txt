    I am pleased that the Senate confirmed Jim Jeffrey to be the United States Ambassador to Turkey. Jim is a man of intellect, integrity, and commitment. His work as my Deputy National Security Adviser, as United States Ambassador to Albania, and in three previous assignments to Turkey make him superbly qualified to represent the United States to our friend and NATO ally.
I thank Jim for his continued service to our Nation and congratulate him and his family on today's confirmation.
