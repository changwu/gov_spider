    Chicago, IL - The Obama campaign announced today the launch of Women for Obama Torchbearers. The Torchbearer program is the Obama campaign's newest initiative to mobilize and engage young women leaders, age 35 and younger, in their community to get out the vote for Senator Obama in November.
Michelle Obama lauded the new program, "Just as they are to their families and their communities, women have been invaluable to Barack's efforts to bring change to this country. Tens of thousands of women have organized for us, traveled to battleground states, and carried our message to all corners of this country. I'm looking forward to working with our Torchbearers to continue this effort and mobilize for the election."
"Women make up the majority of the electorate and it's our votes that will decide this historic election", said Dana Singiser, Senior Advisor for Women for Obama. "Women have always been at the forefront of creating change in our country - from teachers to sorority presidents, mothers shaping the next generation or volunteers, small business women or public servants, young women impact our neighborhoods and our lives every day all across the country. Women recognize that the stakes in this election are too high and as a Woman for Obama Torchbearer, they will harness their energy through grassroots mobilization to ensure that Barack Obama is elected president in November."
Senator Obama understands the critical role that women will play during this election process. As a Woman for Obama Torchbearer, women will have the unique opportunity to participate in the election process at a grassroots level. Women leaders will be equipped with the skills, knowledge and resources to empower their communities and elect Senator Obama as president.
