But According To ABA Review Panel Chairman Stephen Tober, Kavanaugh Is "Indeed Qualified To Serve On The Federal Bench." TOBER: "This nominee enjoys a solid reputation for integrity, intellectual capacity, and writing and analytical ability. ... A substantial majority of the Standing Committee believes that Mr. Kavanaugh is indeed qualified to serve on the federal bench." (Stephen L. Tober, Committee On The Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Testimony, 5/8/06)
Tober Himself Notes That "There Is No Bright-Line Litmus Test As To Whether A Nominee Is 'Well Qualified' Or 'Qualified.'" TOBER: "It is, at its most basic, the difference between the 'highest standard' and a 'very high standard.'" (Stephen L. Tober, Committee On The Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Testimony, 5/8/06)
According To The ABA's "Backgrounder," A "Qualified" Rating Means The Committee Believes A Nominee Will Be Able To Perform "All Duties And Responsibilities" Of A Federal Judge. TOBER: "The Backgrounder also makes clear that '(t)he rating of 'Qualified' means that the nominee meets the Committee's very high standards with respect to integrity, professional competence and judicial temperament and that the Committee believes that the nominee will be able to perform satisfactorily all of the duties and responsibilities required by the high office of a federal judge.'" (Stephen L. Tober, Committee On The Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Testimony, 5/8/06)
