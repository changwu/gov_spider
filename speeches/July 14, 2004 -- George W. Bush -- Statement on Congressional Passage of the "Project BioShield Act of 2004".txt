    During this time of threat to the homeland, I commend Congress for passing the "Project BioShield Act of 2004." This legislation will strengthen our ability to protect Americans against biological, chemical, nuclear, and radiological threats. It will speed the Government's ability to turn promising scientific discoveries into necessary countermeasures, provide for rapid stockpiling of critical new drugs and vaccines, and allow the Food and Drug Administration to make treatments available quickly to Americans in emergency situations. By bringing researchers, medical experts, and the biomedical industry together in new and innovative ways, we will not only help protect the homeland but also gain insights into other diseases. This will break new ground in the search for treatments and cures, while strengthening our overall biotechnology infrastructure. I look forward to signing this vital piece of legislation.
