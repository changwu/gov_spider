    President Bush will travel to London on November 18-21, 2003, for a State Visit to the United Kingdom. This State Visit is the first time an American President has visited the United Kingdom as a guest of the Queen since President Reagan's visit in 1982.
The United Kingdom is working together with us on a wide range of issues, including strengthening freedom, peace, and security in the greater Middle East region; building stable democratic societies in Afghanistan and Iraq; fighting terrorism; preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction; and promoting global health and economic development. On behalf of the American people, the President is deeply grateful to the people of the United Kingdom for their courage and sacrifices in support of freedom and democracy throughout the world.
