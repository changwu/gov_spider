    SANTA FE â€“ Governor Bill Richardson today issued the following statement in response to the tragedy at Virginia Tech:
"On behalf of all New Mexicans, Barbara and I extend our condolences to the families of the victims whose lives were cut short by this horrific tragedy," Governor Bill Richardson said. "This is a sad day and our hearts go out to the Virginia Tech community as it grieves this loss."
As a result of the tragedy, Governor Richardson instructed New Mexico Higher Education Secretary Beverlee McClure to immediately begin working with institutions in state to ensure adequate safety measures are in place. These measures may include having a safety plan in place and a disaster response plan. The state will also be looking into the security personnel on each campus and the level of training those personnel have in an effort to determine how to better prepare campus police and security officials to respond to such incidents.
A Safety Task Force will be formed to make recommendations to the Governor for improving the safety of our students, faculty, and staff on our campuses in the state. The Governor is committed to creating a safe learning and working environment for all New Mexicans.
