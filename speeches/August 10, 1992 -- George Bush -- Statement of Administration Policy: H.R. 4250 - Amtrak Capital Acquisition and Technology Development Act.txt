    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 8/11/92)(House)(Swift (D) Washington and 3 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4250 because it would:

— Not provide for reforms necessary to move Amtrak toward self-sufficiency and, instead, would increase the Federal subsidy for Amtrak.
— Conceal Amtrak's dependence on Federal subsidies by authorizing separate accounts for mandatory payments to the Railroad Retirement Board and for new State- subsidized rail service. Moreover, the authorization levels specified in the bill include costs specifically excluded by the bill's authorizing language. They cover not only Amtrak's "excess" rail pension liability, but also amounts attributable to the independent liability of Amtrak employees.
