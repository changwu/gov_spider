    President Bush will welcome President of Uzbekistan Islom Karimov to the Oval Office on March 12, 2002. The Presidents discussion will reflect the new relationship that is evolving between the United States and Uzbekistan. The countries unprecedented level of cooperation first became evident in the fight against terrorists in Afghanistan. The United States looks forward to deepening cooperation not only on security matters, but also on human rights and political and economic reform, all of which are essential elements of the robust and lasting relationship we hope to build with Uzbekistan and its people.
