    DENVER — Bennet for America today announced that it brought in $2.1 million in the third quarter of the year, with $1.8 million cash on hand. 86 percent of the campaign's contributions are $25 or less, and 98 percent of the contributions are $100 or less — demonstrating a strong base of grassroots support.
"Our strategy to run a lean, strong campaign in early states is working, and we have the resources to compete and win. We're continuing to run TV, rural radio, and digital ads and build out our infrastructure and staff," said Bennet for America spokesperson Shannon Beckham. "Instead of allowing the DNC's flawed debate criteria to dictate this race, we're communicating directly with voters and caucusgoers. They believe in Michael's agenda — one that will not only unite Democrats, but also win back the nine million Obama-Trump voters we need to defeat Trump and take back the Senate. Michael spent more time in Iowa in September than any other candidate, and we believe it will pay off in the long run."
During the last quarter, Bennet for America pursued a strategy focused on the early states. Bennet spent more time in Iowa in September than any other candidate. He launched a seven-figure TV, rural radio, and digital ad buy in the state, and campaigned alongside former Iowa Governor and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack. The Des Moines Register Editorial Board wrote that "Bennet Pounds Some Truth Into the Campaign...caucusgoers...would be well-served to give Bennet more attention."
In New Hampshire, Gary Hart endorsed Bennet at the Democratic Party State Convention, where he said, "A number of years ago, the voters of New Hampshire provided an opportunity for a young Colorado senator to build a strong national candidacy. They have the chance now to do it again. Michael Bennet has the intelligence, experience, and judgment to put our nation back on track at home and abroad."
