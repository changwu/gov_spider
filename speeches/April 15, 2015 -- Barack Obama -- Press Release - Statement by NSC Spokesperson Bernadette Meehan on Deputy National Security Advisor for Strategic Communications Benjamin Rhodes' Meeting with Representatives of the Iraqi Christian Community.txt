    Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications Ben Rhodes met today at the White House with representatives of the Iraqi Christian community. Mr. Rhodes updated the delegation on the President's discussion yesterday with Iraqi Prime Minister Al-Abadi and on the progress in the global campaign to counter ISIL, and heard from the delegation about the extraordinary challenges facing the Iraqi Christian community. Mr. Rhodes reiterated the President's commitment to help all of Iraq's diverse communities — including Christians, Sabean-Mandaeans, Shabak, Yezidis, and other ethnic and religious minorities — and underscored our deep concern at the threat ISIL poses to these communities and to all the Iraqi people.
