Julia Rothman, a New York City?based artist, tackled the second Democratic debate of the 2016 election.
I am constantly drawing what's around me, things that happen to me, things I see, things I am thinking about. I wanted to draw the debate because it was just that—something important happening that I definitely needed to pay attention to. Hillary is a remarkable woman, and I am incredibly inspired by her tenacity. When I draw someone, I am completely focused on that person. This was a chance to really study her courage and determination—and understand her by observing her intensely.

I often find it very challenging to get a likeness. Last night I was very focused on her expressions, trying to capture her in a few different moments—talking about serious issues, and also laughing at the funny banter. And I ended up taking a lot of pictures of the television with my phone. That way I was able to draw from a few still shots while also watching at the same time. I drew in pencil first, which is unusual for me. I hardly ever sketch before, but I wanted to make sure my lines were right. Then I inked and painted in sections quickly.

I was very impressed by her confidence, her clear wording, and strong spirit. And overall, the sketches, to me, served as a documentation of her impassioned performance.
