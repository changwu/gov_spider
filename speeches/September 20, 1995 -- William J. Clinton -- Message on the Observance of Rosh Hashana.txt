    Warm greetings to all who are celebrating Rosh Hashana, marking a new year of both promise and renewal.
On this solemn occasion each year, the powerful call of the shofar is sounded, summoning Jews around the world to a spiritual reawakening. The message of Rosh Hashana—remembrance and redemption for the new year—serves as a timeless lesson for all of us as we seek a closer relationship with God and work to find deeper meaning in our lives.
This sacred holiday is also a time for selfexamination and an opportunity to celebrate God's ongoing creation. Let all who are rejoicing in this season of hope also strengthen their resolve to work for a better, brighter future.
Best wishes for a joyous Rosh Hashana and for a new year of peace.
