    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)
(Young (R) AK and Pombo (R) CA)
The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 512, which would prohibit the use of funding from the Land and Water Conservation Fund to establish new refuges unless Congress passes a specific law authorizing the creation of the refuge. If H.R. 512 were to be presented to the President in its current form, the Secretary of the Interior would recommend that the President veto the bill.
Congress currently approves, through annual appropriations, all acquisitions financed by the Fund. H.R. 512 would add an additional layer of congressional approval, thereby making it more difficult to acquire much needed refuge lands in a timely manner.
