    Michelle and I were saddened to learn of the passing of former Arizona Governor Rose Mofford. Rose was once fired from a government position because her boss "felt it was better to have a man in that particular job." But she was undeterred, eventually rising to become secretary of state and then Governor, the first woman in Arizona to hold that office. In all, her career in public service spanned more than a half-century. It's a story of tireless service, steady leadership, and a trailblazing spirit that inspired not only a State where three more women would eventually follow her in office, but an entire country. Rose showed us all what to do when somebody says we're not good enough because of who we are: Don't believe it. Our thoughts and prayers are with Rose's family and friends as they remember and celebrate her example.
