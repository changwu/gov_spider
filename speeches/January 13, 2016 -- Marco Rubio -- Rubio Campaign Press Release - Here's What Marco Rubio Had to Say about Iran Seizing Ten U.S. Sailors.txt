Marco said tonight this is a clear provocation:


Iran is testing the boundaries of this administration's resolve. And they know the boundaries are pretty wide.
This administration is willing to let them get away with many things. You are only seeing this accelerate since the deal was signed with Iran.

This isn't even the only provocation this month: Iran recently fired rockets near the U.S.S. Harry S. Truman, an American aircraft carrier.
As soon as he takes office, Marco would begin undoing the dangerous nuclear deal and ratchet up the pressure on this dangerous regime.
