    Today, North Carolina State Representative Zack Hawkins released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for the President of the United States:
"At a time when our country is devastatingly divided, the only option for president is a proven leader and unifier — Joe Biden. North Carolinians can trust Joe to restore the soul of our nation, starting on day one. With a track record of working across the aisle to pass critical legislation including the Violence Against Women Act, the Affordable Care Act, and the only Assault Weapons Ban in history, Joe knows that when we work together, there is nothing we cannot accomplish."
Joe Biden has the support of all three Democratic U.S. House members in North Carolina — Congressman G. K. Butterfield, Congresswoman Alma Adams, and Congressman David Price. Biden has more endorsements in the Tar Heel State than any other Democratic candidate, which includes the support of 25 current and former elected officials in North Carolina, including mayors, state lawmakers, city, and county officials, candidates for office, and local activists. Earlier this month, Biden received the endorsement of Anthony Foxx, former Secretary of Transportation and mayor of Charlotte, and Paul Lowe, Chair of the North Carolina Legislative Black Caucus.
Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
