Marco Rubio is undoubtedly the Republican that the Clinton camp fears the most.
Top aides to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have outright admitted that they don't want to face Marco in November.At a town hall event in Iowa today, Marco explained why:

Over the next few weeks you're going to hear Hillary Clinton attacking me and lying a lot about my foreign policy record and I know exactly why. She does not want to run against me. She knows that if I am the nominee we are going to beat her. She doesn't want to run against me, but I can't wait to run against her.
She is a failed Secretary of State. She was a disastrous Secretary of State. All of the foreign policy issues we've faced around the world happened under her watch. And by the way, she is disqualified from being Commander in Chief because she recklessly and irresponsibly used her email server, she recklessly and irresponsibly lied about Benghazi.
She told the families of those four brave Â Americans. "Oh this was just a spontaneous uprising because of a youtube video." And then she was telling her family members and foreign leaders and others that this was a planned terrorist attack. Someone who does that can never be Commander in Chief or President of the United States.

There's a reason why the New York Times said that a Marco vs. Hillary match-up is a "scary thought" for Democratic elites.No one is better prepared to highlight Hillary Clinton's failures and outline a stronger, more forward-thinking vision for America than Marco.
