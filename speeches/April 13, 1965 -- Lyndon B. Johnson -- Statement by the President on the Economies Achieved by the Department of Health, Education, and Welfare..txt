    I WELCOME Secretary Celebrezze's report as further evidence that this administration is setting new standards of economy and efficiency without impairing the effectiveness of programs which are so vital to our well-being as individuals and as a nation.
Legislation now before the Congress will substantially broaden the mission of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. It is gratifying to know that a department whose programs touch the lives of every American can double and redouble its expenditures in so many areas and still take pride in the great care with which it spends our tax dollarsâ€¢
