    From his time in the Army to his service as New Mexico's attorney general and senior Senator, Jeff Bingaman has served this country and the people of New Mexico for more than three decades. He has been a tireless advocate for preserving America's natural resources and promoting a clean energy future. Jeff has gained the respect of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle in New Mexico and in Washington, and his voice on the floor of the Senate will be missed. Michelle and I offer Jeff our best wishes and deepest appreciation for his lifetime of service.
