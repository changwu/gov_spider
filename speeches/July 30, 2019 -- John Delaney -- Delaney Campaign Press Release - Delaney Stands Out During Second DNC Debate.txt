    DETROIT, MI – During Tuesday night's debate, John Delaney drew a clear contrast between his fight for workable solutions, and extreme proposals that would put President Trump on a glide path to reelection. Journalists and political commentators applauded his performance.
What people are saying:
"@JohnDelaney is a contender tonight. He's making himself the main counter to Sanders' Medicare for All plan." - @chrisjollyhale
"Delaney having a bit of a moment, more exposure for his centrism than he's ever seen. He's getting time to speak out as a vocal moderate, as Klobuchar and Bullock and others look on." - @costareports
"I like that @JohnDelaney is saying he's the only one who upholds Obama's trade agenda by supporting the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And the thing is... he's right!" - @matthewstoller
"Progressive idealism on #MedicareForAll sounds promising but @JohnDelaney is probably right about political and economic viability (or lack thereof) for the vast, expensive healthcare proposal that would eliminate all private coverage" - @benpiven
"Delaney: the math is wrong. If they pay the #medicare rate many hospitals would close... The question is why do we have to be so extreme?" - @berthacoombs
"Delaney beating Bernie like a drum on M4A. Just saying" - @jrubinreports
"@JohnDelaney is the first to discuss a family friendly #tax code at the #DemDebate – check that off on #MomBingo! #WeCareDebate" - @momsrising
