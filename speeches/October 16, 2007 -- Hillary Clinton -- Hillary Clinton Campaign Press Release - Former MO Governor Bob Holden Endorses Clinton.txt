    Holden Named Missouri Co-Chair, Joins Education Policy Task Force
The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of former Missouri Governor Bob Holden, and named him a Missouri Co-Chair and a member of the Campaign's Education Policy Taskforce.
"This country needs change, and Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to deliver it," Holden said. "She is uniquely qualified to hit the ground running on her first day in the White House."
Holden served as Governor of Missouri from 2001 to 2005, boosting school funding and creating a prescription drug program for the state's seniors. Under Holden's leadership, Missouri maintained a AAA bond rating and created thousands of new jobs despite a national recession.
Prior to his election as Governor, Holden served two terms as Missouri State Treasurer, earning more than $1 billion in investment income for the state. From 1983 to 1989, he served in the State House of Representatives.
Holden is currently Chairman of The Holden Group, LLC, where he advises public and private sector clients on business development and international trade strategies.
"I am honored to have Bob's support and counsel," Clinton said. "With his help, we'll continue to grow our grassroots support across Missouri."
Holden joins other prominent Missourians in supporting Hillary, including former House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt, St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay, Congressman Emanuel Cleaver II, Jackson County Executive Michael Sanders and former Missouri Secretary of State Rebecca "Bekki" Cook.
