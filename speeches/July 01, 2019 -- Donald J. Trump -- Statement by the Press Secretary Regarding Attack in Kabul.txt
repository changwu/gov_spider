    The United States condemns in the strongest terms today's heinous terrorist attack, claimed by the Taliban, in which Afghan civilians and security personnel were killed and severely wounded. The attack involved a vehicle bombing and gun assault on an Afghan defense facility, also damaging nearby civic and cultural centers and a primary school, injuring dozens of young children. This brazen attack demonstrates the Taliban's callous disregard for their fellow Afghans, who have repeatedly voiced the urgency of finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
