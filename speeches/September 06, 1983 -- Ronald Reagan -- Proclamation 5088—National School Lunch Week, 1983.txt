  A Proclamation

The National School Lunch Program-now in its 37th yearâ€”operates to provide nutritious and well-balanced meals to many young people of our country. The school lunch program is an outstanding example of the partnership between the Federal government and State and local governments to make available the food, funds, and technical support that insures continued nutritional assistance for school students.
The youth of America are our greatest resource. The school lunch program demonstrates the awareness, concern, and willingness to work together that we all share in promoting the health and well-being of our students.
Over 23 million lunches are served daily in some 90,000 schools throughout the country. This effort is being conducted by resourceful and creative food service managers and staff in cooperation with government, parents, teachers, and civic groups.
By joint resolution approved October 9, 1962, the Congress designated the week beginning on the second Sunday of October in each year as National School Lunch Week and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for the observance of that week.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States to observe the week of October 9, 1983, as National School Lunch Week and to give special and deserved recognition to those people at the State and local level who, through their innovative efforts, have made it possible to have a successful school lunch program.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 6th day of Sept., in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightythree, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.

RONALD REAGAN
