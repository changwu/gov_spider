    President Bush will welcome Prime Minister Thaksin to Washington on November 30. The United States and the Kingdom of Thailand are treaty allies and old friends. Thailand is a steadfast partner with the United States and provides excellent cooperation and coordination on counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, money laundering, alien smuggling, and other transnational threats which affect both countries. The U.S.-Thai partnership plays a key role in the international coalition against terrorism and in promoting peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. President Bush looks forward to discussing the anti-terrorism campaign, regional security matters, economic cooperation, and ways to further strengthen the strong bilateral relationship between the United States and Thailand.
