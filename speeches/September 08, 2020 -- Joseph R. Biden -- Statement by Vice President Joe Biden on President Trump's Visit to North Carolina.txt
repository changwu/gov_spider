    In the past week, nearly 10,000 positive COVID-19 cases have been reported in North Carolina and close to 200 North Carolinians have died due to the virus. Since the middle of March, more than 1.2 million North Carolinians have filed for unemployment benefits, and the state's unemployment rate shot up in July to nearly double what it was last year. Yet today, North Carolinians will not hear President Trump discuss how he plans to get this virus under control, nor will they hear plans to safely restart our economy or provide much-needed relief to struggling workers, parents, and small business owners.
President Trump's mismanagement has cost too many North Carolinians their lives and livelihoods, with communities of color bearing the brunt of the devastation. He has looked away from North Carolinians in need of a lifeline, even as his wealthy corporate donors get ahead.
As President, I will fight for your family like it's my own. I will bring our country together to defeat this pandemic and build our economy back better so that it works for all North Carolinians and leaves no one behind.
