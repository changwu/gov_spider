My dear Mr. Delano:
It was my privilege nearly ten years ago to attend the initial meeting in the interest of the Regional Plan of New York and its Environs. I am now particularly interested to know that the final volume embodying the research and study of a decade has been completed for presentation to the citizens of the New York region. This marks an important stage in your enterprise. From the vision of a new conception of city building you proceeded to painstaking fact-finding and to the formulation of a plan. You now approach the stage of realizing the plan in practice. Its realization will be facilitated by the sound foundation which has been laid. The work of the organization, so generously made possible by the Russell Sage Foundation, is a contribution to sound, farsighted municipal planning of preeminent importance in this country, if not in the world.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Frederic A. Delano, Chairman, Regional Plan of New York and its Environs, 407 Hibbs Building, Washington, D.C.]
