    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(DeConcini (D) AZ)
The Administration supports S. 1301. The Administration will seek to manage prudently reductions of the intelligence authorization contained in the bill, but notes that S. 1301 already makes cuts beyond those in the House bill. The administration will oppose any amendment that would further reduce intelligence spending beyond what the Select Committee on Intelligence has recommended. Furthermore, the Administration opposes any change to S. 1301 that would disclose, or require the disclosure of, the aggregate amount of funds authorized for Intelligence activities. The current procedure that provides for the authorization of appropriations in a classified annex continues to be appropriate.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
S. 1301 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is zero. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
