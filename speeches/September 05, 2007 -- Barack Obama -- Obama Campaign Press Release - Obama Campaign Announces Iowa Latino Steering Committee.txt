    Des Moines, IA -- The Obama Campaign today announced a 26-member Latino Steering Committee that will engage Latinos across Iowa, talk with them about Obama's commitment to changing Washington, and provide input on the direction of the Iowa campaign.
"Senator Obama will bring our country together and make progress on the many issues that have stalled under the current Administration," Dr. Hector Avalos said. "I trust his judgment on tough issues such as the war in Iraq and providing accessible health care coverage for our families, and I know he is the best candidate to work across the aisle to reform our broken immigration system. His courageous decision on the Iraq war proved to me that wisdom is more important than the experience of Washington elites."
Barack Obama has continued to fight for the Latino community by expanding opportunities for Latinos in education, health care, and economic development. Obama has been a leader in the fight for comprehensive immigration reform and is committed to putting politics aside and offering a complete solution that strengthens our security while reaffirming our heritage as a nation of immigrants.
"Real change comes from the bottom up and the Latino community is a vital part of our grassroots movement for change in Iowa," Senator Obama said. "Our campaign is committed to empowering and engaging Latinos across Iowa and I'm proud to have the support of these leaders in the Latino community.
During Latino Heritage Month -- which spans several weeks in September and October -- the Obama Campaign will visit more than 50 Latino festivals, conferences, lunches and dinners across Iowa. The Latino outreach team also will work to register Latinos across the state and organize caucus and citizen education programs.
