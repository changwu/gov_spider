    The question before the United States Senate tomorrow is crucial to our efforts to secure a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. I have been impressed by the sincere desire of Senators I have talked with this weekend to rise above partisanship and political concerns. I believe the Senate will approve the transaction and thus allow the United States to maintain our historic commitment to the security of Israel, while enhancing our ties with moderate Arabs who also seek peace and stability in that region.
