Don't get it? CNN has your explanation:
The unusual spelling of Rubio is a reference to 2015 buzzword 'bae,' a trendy term of affection."

It's supposedly short for "before anyone else" or "before all else." 
Basically, Marco hopes he comes before anyone else when it comes to Republicans picking a candidate.  But really, it's just a fun shirt. So go here and get one.
Love him or Hate him, @marcorubio 's swag game is on par: "Marco Polos", "Ru(bae)O shirts" https://t.co/dC6cbAIvp0
