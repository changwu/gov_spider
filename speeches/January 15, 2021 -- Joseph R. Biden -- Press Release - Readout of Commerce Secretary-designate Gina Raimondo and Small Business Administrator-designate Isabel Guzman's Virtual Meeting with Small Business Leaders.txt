    On Friday, Commerce Secretary-designate Governor Gina Raimondo and Small Business Administrator-designate Isabel Guzman met with leaders in the small business community for a virtual discussion hosted by Business Forward and Small Business for America's Future (SBAF). The discussion focused on how the incoming Biden Administration will support small businesses hurt by the COVID-19 health and economic crises and build the economy back better and more equitably.
Yesterday, President-elect Biden announced the American Rescue Plan, his COVID-19 vaccination and economic rescue package that will invest in America, create millions of additional good-paying jobs, and support struggling communities.
During the event, Secretary-designate Raimondo spoke about her work creating jobs and economic opportunity as Governor of Rhode Island and her commitment to helping American workers and small businesses get back on their feet and emerge from the pandemic stronger than before. Administrator-designate Guzman shared her experience working in her father's small business when she was growing up and then becoming an entrepreneur herself, which has given her a firsthand appreciation of the challenges facing America's small businesses.
Raimondo and Guzman answered participant questions and spoke about their shared commitment to help America's small business owners build better futures for their families and communities. They emphasized the need for strong leadership from the federal government to support small businesses during the pandemic and to address the systemic barriers facing entrepreneurs of color, women, and rural businesses. They also talked about the importance of expanding clean energy jobs and access to broadband and health care, and they pledged that equity would be at the core of their work at the Commerce Department and SBA.
