    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question. The previous report covered progress through May 31, 1995. The current report covers the period June 1, 1995, through July 31, 1995.
Throughout the period, my representatives continued efforts to urge meaningful negotiations among the parties and to encourage them to take steps to create a healthy environment for talks and progress on overall settlement issues.
In July, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Richard Holbrooke met with U.S. Presidential Emissary for Cyprus Richard I. Beattie and U.S. ambassadors to the region, as well as private individuals and members of Congress, to consider the current Cyprus situation.
There is general agreement that the recent decision by the European Union (EU) to begin discussion of Cyprus' accession to the EU could provide added motivation to the parties to achieve a settlement. Special Cyprus Coordinator James A. Williams visited a number of EU member countries during this period to consult on ways to take advantage of this opportunity to move the peace process forward.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
