Subject: Implementation of the Inspector General Act
One of the highest priorities of my Administration is the detection and prevention of fraud, waste, and inefficiency in the operation of Federal programs. As you know, I take very seriously our obligation to conduct the public's business with the utmost integrity.
On October 12 I signed a bill establishing Offices of Inspectors General in each of your departments and agencies. It places under these officials virtually all of your audit and investigative resources. I would like to select these Inspectors General personally and send their names to the Senate for confirmation as soon as possible. Therefore, please suggest at least three candidates of exceptional integrity and ability to me without delay. I will also seek the names of potential appointees from other sources.
I also want to ensure an early, well coordinated effort to establish the new offices. I am therefore asking Jim McIntyre to see which present resources and functions should be assigned to the new offices and to set the process up quickly and efficiently.
JIMMY CARTER
