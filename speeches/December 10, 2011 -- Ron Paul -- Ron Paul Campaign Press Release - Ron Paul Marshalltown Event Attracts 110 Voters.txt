    Crowd size, makeup show growth since prior visits
ANKENY, Iowa â€” In a sign of growing momentum and voter interest in 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul, 110 voters attended Dr. Paul's Marshalltown town hall meeting held at the Fisher Community Center.
The turnout is noteworthy as crowds were larger than in two prior visits to Marshalltown, the city that is also county seat to Marshall County, and because of the crowd's diversity. In particular a larger share of the voters present today were undecided voters in addition to regular supporters, thus showing both in polls and photographs growth in Paul's base.
