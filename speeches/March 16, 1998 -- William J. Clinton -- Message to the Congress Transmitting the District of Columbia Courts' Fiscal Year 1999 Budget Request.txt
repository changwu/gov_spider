    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the District of Columbia Code, as amended, I am transmitting the District of Columbia Court's FY 1999 budget request.
The District of Columbia Courts has submitted a FY 1999 budget request for $133 million for its operating expenditures and authorization for multiyear capital funding totalling $58 million for courthouse renovation and improvements. My FY 1999 Budget includes recommended funding levels of $121 million for operations and $21 million for capital improvements for the District Courts. My transmittal of the District Court's budget request does not represent an endorsement of its contents.
I look forward to working with the Congress throughout the FY 1999 appropriation process.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, March 16, 1998.
