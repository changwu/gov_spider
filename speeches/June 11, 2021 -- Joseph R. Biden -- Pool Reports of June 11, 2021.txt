Travel pool report #1 
St. Ives
I’ll be your POTUS pooler for the first full day of the G7 summit here in Cornwall
The pool has arrived in St. Ives, where we are waiting for POTUS to leave his hotel at Tregenna Castle for the G7 venue in nearby Carbis Bay. He’s scheduled to leave at 1:55 pm local time and the pool is expected to fold into his motorcade.
The pool went through security and we presented officials with cell phone photos of the results of the self-administered Covid-19 tests that we are required to take every morning.
A couple notes: service here is spotty, but I’ll do my best to get the reports out in a timely manner. Pool access will also be very limited today, but as always, we’ll push for as much access as we can get.
Upon arrival in St. Ives, the pool spotted a couple dozen activists holding signs that called on the G7 leaders to take action on climate change.
It’s 60 degrees and cloudy here. But the views of the sea are nonetheless spectacular.

Uneventful motorcade ride. Onlookers snapped photos and police lined the streets along the way as we navigated the winding streets of Cornwall

Travel pool report #4 
Carbis Bay
After getting out of the vans, the pool hustled down a steep hill where we were stopped by security twice. With the help of our Downing Street minder, we made it to a beach where a stage was set up at around 2:20 pm. The British prime minister and his wife greeted world leaders as photographers and journalists looked on.
We watched world leaders greet the prime minister and his wife one by one.
"Why don't we just do a group photo," Mr. Johnson said as the world leaders left the podium one at a time.
At 2:23 pm, POTUS and FLOTUS arrived and greeted Johnson and his wife and posed for photos
"I feel like I'm at a wedding," FLOTUS said as she walked across the beach in a red dress.
"Everybody in the water," POTUS said, presumably joking, as he faced the press.
Pool asked: what's your message to Putin. Biden responded, "I'll tell you after I deliver it."

Carbis Bay
At 2:30, the world leaders returned to the stage on the beach—this time without their spouses.
"Okay, here we are folks — right. Everybody here? Alright, we've got it," Johnson said as photogs snapped pictures.
Biden stood to Johnson's right in the front row.
As the leaders walked away, Macron put his arm on Biden's back and the two leaders engaged in a conservation that the pool couldn't hear.
At 2:32 pm, the leaders entered a nearby building.

Travel pool reports #6 
Carbis Bay
Following the family photo, the pool held in a media room. Only one photographer from the pool was allowed into the first session of the G7 on the recovery from the coronavirus. Print, wire and video journalists from the pool were barred from the event, as were other photographers.
I’m told part of the event was carried live on a video feed, but Biden did not make any remarks.
I should also note that only six members of the pool were allowed to be present for the family photo. The other members of the pool were left in a van. Despite the restrictions, there were several dozen journalists from other countries at the family photo.
The pool is now making the long walk back up a steep hill to the press vans. We don’t expect to see the president again for the rest of the day. I’ll send updates if that changes.

Carbis Bay to St. Ives
The motorcade started rolling from the G7 venue at 4:29 pm. Another uneventful ride. Lots of onlookers snapping photos and waving. Police again lined the streets.
We arrived at the Treganna Castle property at 4:34 pm. We’re now holding here in the vans. We did not see the president get into the motorcade.

Bodelva
The motorcade arrived at the Eden Project at 6:37 pm. We're holding in a parking lot and cannot see POTUS or any of the other dignitaries here.
The Eden Project is an eco-park with several giant domes housing what the project's website calls "the largest rainforest in captivity."
We're told we won't have any access to tonight's events.

Travel pool report #12 
Bodelva
Pool is still holding in a parking lot at the Eden Project. No update on POTUS’s activities.
The pool is nowhere near tonight’s events, but we saw the queen’s motorcade drive by.
The following is from the White House. Your pooler has asked that this statement be put on the record.
From a White House Spokesperson:
President Biden had a pull-aside with President Macron today in advance of their bilateral meeting planned for tomorrow. The Leaders discussed a range of regional and bilateral issues, including COVID-19 and counterterrorism efforts in the Sahel, and affirmed the importance of the U.S.-France partnership and the Transatlantic alliance. President Biden enjoyed a positive and productive first day of discussions at the G7, focused on ways we can collaborate to build a more inclusive and fair global economy.
