    The Clinton Campaign in Pennsylvania kicked off the Women for Hillary effort in the Keystone State today. The kickoff took place at a Women for Hillary organizing event in Blue Bell attended by Senator Clinton and over 1,000 women who will spearhead the campaign's outreach and organizing efforts in Pennsylvania.
"I am honored to have the support of remarkable, dedicated and talented women across Pennsylvania," Senator Clinton said. "This group of volunteers will provide energy, enthusiasm and organization and will help lead the conversation over the next four weeks about the real solutions I have put forward to address the challenges facing Pennsylvania families after eight years of neglect by the Bush Administration."
The Pennsylvanians who have signed on as Women for Hillary supporters are committing to at least five hours of volunteering per week until the primary. The women will actively engage their friends and neighbors in an ongoing conversation about Hillary's plans to get America back on track as well as recruit others for the program, host house parties, give friends lawn signs and buttons, and serve as Ambassadors for the Hillary for President campaign.
"There has been no greater champion for women and families than Hillary Clinton, and Pennsylvania Women for Hillary will do everything we can to inform voters in Pennsylvania about her record," said Congresswoman Allyson Schwartz. "For 35 years Hillary has worked tirelessly on issues ranging from early childhood education to women's health to covering kids, and she is the candidate best prepared to make a difference for children and families starting on day one in the White House."
