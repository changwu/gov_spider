    Congressman Paul Gillmor's life was an extraordinary example to service and leadership. From working as an Air Force judge advocate during the Vietnam war to championing legislation in the Halls of Congress, Paul devoted his career to strengthening his State and his nation. He was a good man and dedicated public servant who represented the people of Ohio with distinction for four decades. In Ohio, he served as president of the State senate for three general assemblies. In Washington, Paul was well respected for his leadership of a wide range of issues before the House Financial Services and Energy and Commerce Committees. We will always remain grateful for his service.
Laura and I are deeply saddened by his death. We pray for his wife Karen and their family.
