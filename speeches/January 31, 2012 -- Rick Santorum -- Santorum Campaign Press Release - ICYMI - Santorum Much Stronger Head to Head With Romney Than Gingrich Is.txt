Verona, PA - In polling released by the national polling company Public Policy Polling, it is clear who the one conservative is who is best positioned to beat Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination - and that candidate is Rick Santorum.
According to PPP: http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/01/trouble-ahead-for-romney.html
"Trouble ahead for Romney?"
What might be most interesting in both states is what happens in a head to head between Romney and either Gingrich or Santorum:
-In Missouri Santorum leads Romney 50-37 and in Ohio Santorum leads 45-38.
-In Missouri Gingrich leads Romney 43-42 and in Ohio Gingrich leads 42-39.
Two takeaways from those numbers: if this ever came down to Romney, Paul, and just one out of Gingrich and Santorum, Romney would be in a lot of trouble. And he'd be in more trouble if the single conservative alternative ended up being Santorum.
Santorum is a stronger long term threat to Romney than Gingrich because he has less baggage and is simply much better liked.
Santorum is easily the most popular of the Republican candidates in both Missouri (+42 favorability at 63/21, compared to +20 forGingrich and +10 for Romney) and Ohio (+35 at 59/24 compared to +10 for both Gingrich and Romney). It's just proving hard for Santorum to get much traction while Gingrich is still in the race.
