    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 9/25/92)(House)(Sen. Johnston (D) Louisiana)
If S. 3095 is presented to the President, the Secretary of the Interior would recommend that he veto the bill.
Based upon the erroneous presumption that the United States once recognized the Jena Band of Choctaw Indians, S. 3095 would purportedly restore the Band as a federally recognized tribe. The United States, however, has neither recognized the Band nor committed any act that the Band may construe as official recognition. Inasmuch as restoration of a native American group as a federally-recognized Indian tribe is predicated upon past recognition by the United States, the Band cannot be restored.
Thus, the bill would inappropriately provide statutory acknowledgment of the Band, thereby circumventing the established Federal acknowledgment process. To do so would erroneously acknowledge the Band and entitle it to numerous Federal programs and benefits. Statutory recognition is unfair to all other groups seeking Federal acknowledgment and undermines the administrative process designed to eliminate the need for &a hoc legislative determinations.
