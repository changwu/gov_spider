    Middle East Peace Summit
Mr. Kramer. How's it going?
The President. I'm more optimistic than I was when they got here. This is really important. We might make it. I don't know. God it's hard. It's like nothing I've ever dealt withâ€”all the negotiations with the Irish, all the stuff I've done with the Palestinians before this and with the Israelis, the Balkans at Dayton. What's really troubling is that they know if they make a peace agreement half of their constituencies will have to be angry at them for a while. But I would be totally misleading if I said I had an inkling that a deal is at hand. That's just not true. But we're slogging.
Group of Eight Summit
Mr. Kramer. Will you leave for Japan on Wednesday?
The President. I hope so. I'm going to do my best to finish here. There's been some progress, but I can't say I know we'll succeed. They're trying. It's so hard. My heart goes out to them. It's really hard. It's the hardest thing I've ever seen.
