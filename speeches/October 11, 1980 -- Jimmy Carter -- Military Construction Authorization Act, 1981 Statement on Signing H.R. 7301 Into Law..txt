    I am signing into law H.R. 7301, the Military Construction Authorization Act for 1981.
This act is important to increasing our Nation's security at home and abroad. It provides $5.5 billion for highly necessary facilities in 49 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and in 16 foreign countries, which support not only the military services and their reserve components but the defense agencies and the Military Family Housing program as well. These facilities will help us continue to achieve higher degrees of military readiness and mobilization capability. They will also improve the quality of life for many of our military personnel and their families.
The bill also provides support for three other essential elements of our national defense. One is our contribution to the NATO Infrastructure Program for continued upgrading of overall readiness in Europe. Another is the enhancement of our military position in Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf areas where critical United States interests may be threatened. The third is consideration for high priority national programs such as energy conservation and pollution abatement.
While the bill's primary purpose is to meet urgent military requirements, a side benefit to the economy of our country and to the American construction industry will be the creating of an estimated 100,000 to 150,000 direct jobs and, perhaps, an equal number of indirect jobs.
I also want to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to Chairmen Price and Stennis and Subcommittee Chairmen Hart and Nedzi for their dedicated work in securing the passage of this bill. And I want to particularly pay tribute to Mr. Nedzi, whose long and faithful service will be dearly missed when he retires from Congress following the completion of his current term.
