    As Wisconsin hits this grim milestone, I am thinking of the families that will never again be whole, the empty chairs around dinner tables, and the mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters who have had to say goodbye to their loved ones far too soon. I'm also thinking of those who are out of work, who are struggling to keep their small businesses afloat and who are struggling to balance working with full time virtual learning because it isn't safe for their kids to go back to school.
Wisconsinites are suffering the consequences of President Trump's historic failure of leadership. After deliberately downplaying the virus' severity — Trump still has no plan to get it under control and has proven himself utterly incapable of guiding us through this moment. It didn't have to be this bad. If I'm elected president, we won't play political games with public health — we'll trust the experts and the science, speak honestly with the American people, and implement my plan to beat the virus and build our country back better than before.
