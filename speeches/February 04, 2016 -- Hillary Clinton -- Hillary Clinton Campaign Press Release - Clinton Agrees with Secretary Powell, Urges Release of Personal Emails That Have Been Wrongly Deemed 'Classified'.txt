    According to a new report Thursday, the State Department Inspector General has determined that work-related emails sent on personal accounts belonging to former Secretary of State Colin Powell and to senior aides to former Secretary Condoleezza Rice contain classified national security information. This conclusion – which was reached despite the lack of any classification markings within the emails – has been strenuously opposed by Secretary Powell, who has called for these emails to be released.
In response to this announcement, Hillary for America Chairman John Podesta released the following statement:
"This announcement about Secretary Powell's emails shows just how routine it is for government bureaucrats to go overboard when it comes to judging whether information is too sensitive for the public to see. Hillary Clinton agrees with her predecessor that his emails, like hers, are being inappropriately subjected to over-classification. She joins his call for these emails to be released so that the public can view the contents for itself."
