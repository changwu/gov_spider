    HOUSTON, Texas - Last night on The O'Reilly Factor, Bill O'Reilly agreed to moderate a debate between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. Trump has repeatedly ducked out of debates and refuses to debate Cruz one on one. In a previous statement, Cruz for President Spokesman Ron Nehring said, "Perhaps Mr. Trump is unable to speak for more than one minute about any given topic because of his shallow understanding of basic policies, or perhaps he is scared of voters learning the truth - that he has spent his entire adult life promoting liberal positions completely opposite of the conservative platform that he has campaigned on."

CRUZ: Donald's approach on foreign policy is one of weakness and isolationism. That's his position consistently across the globe.
O'REILLY: But see you put me in a difficult position because I'm not going to defend Trump but I will say that we're trying to get him on tomorrow.
CRUZ: I've got an idea.
O'REILLY: What?
CRUZ: Why don't you ask Donald Trump to come here and defend himself? Donald is afraid to debate.
O'REILLY: Debate you one on one?
CRUZ: I would love to do a one on one debate. Bill you can moderate. He wouldn't argue that you're an unfair moderator.
O'REILLY: Yes he would.
CRUZ: So I'm happy to have you moderate.
O'REILLY: Alright we're going to work that.
CRUZ: And NATO is a perfect example, where he throws out a foreign policy position that is weaker and more liberal than Obama's and Hillary Clinton's and then he doesn't get challenged on it because he's afraid to have a debate.
O'REILLY: Okay, let's talk about you. But I will follow up on that debate offer. And I appreciate you making it.
CRUZ: I think it'd be terrific.
