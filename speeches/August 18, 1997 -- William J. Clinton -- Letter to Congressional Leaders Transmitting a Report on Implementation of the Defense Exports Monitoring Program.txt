    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
As required by section 40A of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2785), I transmit herewith the first annual report on the implementation of a comprehensive program to monitor the end-use of defense articles and services, and to prevent the diversion of technology incorporated in defense articles, sold, leased, or exported under the Arms Export Control Act and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.).
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
