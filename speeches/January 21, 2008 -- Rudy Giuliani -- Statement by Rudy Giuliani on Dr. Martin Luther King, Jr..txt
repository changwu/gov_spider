    Mayor Rudy Giuliani released the following statement today on Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.:
"Today, all Americans honor the life and leadership of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. King confronted racism with his movement of non-violence and with his own courage and determination. He brought America to a much greater tolerance and much fuller understanding of equality. His vision helped balance the scales of justice in the United States. He inspired us to find the best in ourselves â€“ lifting people out of poverty by promoting equal opportunity and individual responsibility. His courage helped change our country forever. And his strength of character continues to inspire our nation to form a more perfect union."
