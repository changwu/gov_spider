    Mitt Romney today announced the support of former North Carolina Senator Elizabeth Dole.
"I am humbled to have Senator Elizabeth Dole's support," said Mitt Romney. "Throughout her life, she has demonstrated the loyalty and service to her country that should be an example for all public servants. Senator Dole's support will be integral as I take my pro-growth message to voters across the country."
In a letter supporting Mitt Romney, Senator Elizabeth Dole wrote:
"America is facing some of the greatest challenges in our nation's history, in particular with regard to our economic future. It is vitally important that we nominate an individual with both a steady hand for these difficult times and the experience and capabilities to get our country back on track."
"In a phone call Monday afternoon, I advised Governor Romney that I'm supporting him and will do whatever I can to be of assistance between now and the November election. I've been in all of Iowa's 99 counties twice and have met hundreds and hundreds of dedicated voters. Endorsements may not matter, but hopefully my friends in Iowa will also offer their support to the Governor, a man of experience, leadership and unassailable character."
-Elizabeth Dole
