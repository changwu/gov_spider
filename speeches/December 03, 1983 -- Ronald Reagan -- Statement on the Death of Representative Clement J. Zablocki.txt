    Nancy and I were deeply saddened today to learn of the death of Congressman Clement Zablocki. Clement Zablocki served his constituency and his country with dedication and integrity. He was a strong and effective advocate for the causes in which he so deeply believed. But above all else, he was an American of great patriotism who could always be counted upon to put country ahead of politics. I will miss his wise counsel. We send our deepest sympathy to his family.
