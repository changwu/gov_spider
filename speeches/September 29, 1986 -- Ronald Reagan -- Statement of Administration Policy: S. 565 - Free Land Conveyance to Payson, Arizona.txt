    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Senator DeConcini (D) Arizona)
The Administration opposes enactment of S. 565, which would require the Secretary of Agriculture to give nearly 31 acres of land to the town of Payson, Arizona, without compensation. We oppose such a Federal grant because there is no compelling reason for such assistance, and it is contrary to existing law which requires a fair market value payment to the Federal Government for such transactions. Such special treatment would be costly to the taxpayer, and it is unfair to other communities which have purchased Federal lands in the past in compliance with current law.
