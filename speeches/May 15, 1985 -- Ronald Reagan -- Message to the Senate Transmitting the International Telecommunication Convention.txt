    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the International Telecommunication Convention, with annexes, and a Final Protocol, signed at Nairobi on November 6, 1982.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
The International Telecommunication Convention (Nairobi, 1982) abrogates and replaces, in relations between Contracting Governments, the International Telecommunication Convention (Malaga-Torremolinos, 1973) to which the United States is a party.
The International Telecommunication Convention is the basic instrument of the International Telecommunication Union, which provides the framework for the orderly conduct of international telecommunications. It is in the public and commercial interest of the United States to continue to play an active role within this framework.
The International Telecommunication Convention entered into force on January 1, 1984, for governments that have deposited their instrument of ratification or accession, by diplomatic channel through the intermediary of the Government of Switzerland, with the Secretary General of the International Telecommunication Union.
I believe that the United States should become a party to the International Telecommunication Convention (Nairobi, 1982), and it is my hope that the Senate will take timely action on this matter and give its advice and consent to ratification.
