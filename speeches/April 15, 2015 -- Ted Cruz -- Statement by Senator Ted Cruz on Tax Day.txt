HOUSTON, Texas â€” U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement marking Tax Day:
"Tax day is upon us again. But this year it's different. This year, on top of the frustrating reminder that Americans are giving too much of their income to fund too many wasteful government programs, families are now being forced to pay the Obamacare tax for the first time.
"Instead of government-run healthcare that increases taxes, limits options, and puts the government between patients and their doctors, imagine a free-market system that enables healthcare to be personal, portable and affordable. Instead of a tax code that crushes innovation and inflicts burdens on families struggling to make ends met, imagine a simple, flat tax that lets Americans fill out their taxes on a postcard. Imagine a tax code that is simple enough to abolish the IRS.
"More of Americans' hard-earned wages should be able to stay in their wallets so they can be free to invest more in their families and businesses, not in growing big government.
"Tax reform is crucial to reversing our current economic stagnation, sparking economic growth, and expanding opportunity. I'm running for President because I believe that together, we can make D.C. listen, we can repeal Obamacare, we can implement fundamental tax reform, and we can restore our nation as a place that champions prosperity and opportunity for all."
