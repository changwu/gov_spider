    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Sponsors: Natcher (D), Kentucky; Hoyer (D), Maryland)
This Statement of Administration Policy expresses the Administration's views on H.R. 2403, the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Bill, FY 1994, as reported by the House Committee. The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2403, but will work with Congress to address the concerns described below and in correspondence with the Committee.
President's Investment Program
The Administration supports the Committee action funding Tax Systems Modernization (TSM) projects with immediate productivity savings. The Administration objects, however, to the significant reduction in funding for long-term TSM projects. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are aggressively responding to Congressional reviews of TSM. Full funding for TSM is important to achieve the objectives of modernization, including improved service to taxpayers, more efficient IRS operations, and increased tax compliance and collection.
Federal Employee Health Benefits Program
The Administration commends the Committee's decision to remove the prohibition on Federal Employee Health Benefit Program funding of abortions. Deleting this language is consistent with the Administration's overall policy to eliminate prohibitions on Federal funding for abortions. The Administration is committed to working with the Congress on this issue and urges the House to support the Committee's decision. In scoring the President's request and the Committee bill, no costs were associated with the elimination of the prohibition.
Additional Administration concerns were provided in writing to the Committee on June 14, 1993.
