    Former Vice Presidential Candidate and women's rights pioneer Geraldine A. Ferraro announced her endorsement of Hillary Clinton today.
"By electing Hillary Clinton, we can smash the ultimate glass ceiling once and for all," Ferraro said. "And in doing so, we will be electing the most qualified and experienced candidate for President."
The first woman to be named to a major party's presidential ticket, Ferraro inspired women across the country with her performance on the campaign trail. In her speech to the 1984 Democratic National Convention, Ferraro addressed her history-making candidacy: "By choosing a woman to run for our nation's second highest office, you sent a powerful signal to all Americans. There are no doors we cannot unlock. We will place no limits on achievement. If we can do this, we can do anything."
Americans saw a strong, capable woman running for national office, forever changing the role of gender in politics.
"Those of us who have worked for women's equality all our lives will watch with great satisfaction when Hillary Clinton stands tall on a chilly January afternoon and is sworn in as the first woman president," Ferraro said.
Ferraro was an assistant district attorney before being elected to Congress in 1978 for three terms. In 1993, President Clinton appointed Ferraro to lead the U.S. delegation to the United Nations Human Rights Commission. She currently serves as a board member of the National Democratic Institute of International Affairs and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
"No one has done more to pave the way for women running for office than Geraldine Ferraro," Clinton said. "She has been an inspiring leader, and I'm honored to have her support."
