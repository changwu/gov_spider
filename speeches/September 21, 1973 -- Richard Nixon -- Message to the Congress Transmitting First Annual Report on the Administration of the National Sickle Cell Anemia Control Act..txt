    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to send to the Congress the First Annual Report on the Administration of the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act in accordance with the requirements of Section 1106 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended. The Annual Report describes the ongoing research and service activities established to carry out the provisions of the act.
Research efforts to investigate the mechanism and subsequent complications of the abnormal sickling process in sickle cell anemia have been significantly increased over the past year under the National Institutes of Health. Clinical trials utilizing antisickling agents are underway to alter the sickling process and thus aid individuals who suffer from sickle cell anemia. Demonstration service activities designed to improve public awareness, education, detection and counseling concerning sickle cell disease have been initiated by the Health Services Administration.
These efforts are directed towards one genetic blood disorder--sickle cell disease, but the research and service results will also be relevant to a broader spectrum of genetic blood disorders. The fight against sickle cell anemia continues to be a high priority for our Government and I am pleased to commend this report to the attention of the Congress.
