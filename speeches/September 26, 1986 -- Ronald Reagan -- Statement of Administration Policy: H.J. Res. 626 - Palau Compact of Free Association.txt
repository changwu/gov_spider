    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Seiberling (D) Ohio and 5 others)
The Administration supports prompt House passage of the Palau Compact of Free Association, H.J.Res. 626, for a variety of national security and foreign policy reasons. The Administration will, however, seek amendments in the Senate to delete certain objectionable provisions that were added to the resolution as proposed by the President. These provisions would:
— pledge full faith and credit of the United States for funding of some programs in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), and the Republic of Palau, which these governments agreed to conduct within the base Compact funding amounts;
— authorize "transitional" payments for the continuation of Federal programs in FSM, RMI, and Palau after termination of United States trusteeship responsibilities there; and
— require the National Park Service to inventory significant natural, cultural, and historical resources of FSM, RMI, and Palau.
These payments and programs go well beyond the negotiated agreements between the United States and the respective Micronesian governments. They would entail considerable expenditures above those offered and agreed to by the governments concerned in accepting the Compacts and termination of U. S. trusteeship responsibilities.
