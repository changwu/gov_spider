    I haven't been listening over the radio to the convention at Houston. I was out this morning up and down the river and forgot that the convention started today. I recall now that it does, and I think Mrs. Coolidge has had the radio on. But the radio there is over in the Lodge and I have scarcely been there this morning since I got up. Our dining room is across the bridge in another building, so when I came back from being out on the water I went into the dining room and haven't had a chance to listen to the radio.
