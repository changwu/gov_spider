    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by subsection 103(c)(2) of the International Development and Finance Act of 1989 ("the Act"), and as President of the United States, I hereby report that it is in the national interest of the United States to terminate the suspensions under subsection 103(a) of the Act of programs of the Export-Import Bank of the United States for the People's Republic of China. I am thereby waiving the prohibitions on the Export-Import Bank's financing any trade with, and on extending any loan, credit, credit guarantee, insurance or reinsurance to the People's Republic of China as provided in subsection 103(a).
Sincerely,
George Bush
