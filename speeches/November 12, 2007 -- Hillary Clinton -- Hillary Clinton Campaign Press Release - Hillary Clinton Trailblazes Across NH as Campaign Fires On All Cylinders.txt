On Monday, Hillary received the endorsement of State Representative Tom Buco. Buco, serving his second term in the state house, was the first Democrat in nearly 30 years to be elected from Carroll County. In his endorsement, Buco said, "At a time when our country is facing serious issues both at home and abroad, we need a leader who can rise above negative politics and focus on talking to New Hampshire voters about her detailed, specific plans to confront these challenges head on. Hillary Clinton is an experienced leader with strong plans to end the war in Iraq, provide universal health care for every American, and help boost the economies of communities like Conway. She is the one candidate with a positive message who can deliver the real change this country so desperately needs."
While introducing Senator Hillary Clinton at the Granite State Independent Living (GSIL) Forum in Manchester on November 2nd, State Senator Lou D'Allesandro became the eighth State Senator announced his endorsement of Hillary for president. He has this to say about his endorsement: "After the Democratic Presidential Primary Debate this week, my decision to support Senator Clinton became clear. At this critical time in our country's history, we must move beyond negative politics. At the debate, Hillary demonstrated that she is the only candidate with a strong, positive message. I believe she can deliver the real change our country needs."
