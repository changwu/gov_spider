    I have authorized a $30 million food grant to the people of Poland. The food, consisting of flour, grain products, milk, and oil, will be donated by the United States through Public Law 480 (Title II), the "Food for Peace Program," to food programs managed by CARE and the Catholic Relief Services over the next 6 months. The groups within Poland to be primarily assisted by this food aid are those that have been affected by the severe shortage of staple goods. These groups include preschool children, pregnant women, the elderly, the hospitalized, and orphans.
This food grant reflects the humanitarian concern of this Nation for the well-being of the people of Poland. It demonstrates U.S. recognition of longstanding ties and friendship between the American and Polish people and the administration's commitment to the peaceful resolution of the current Polish situation.
