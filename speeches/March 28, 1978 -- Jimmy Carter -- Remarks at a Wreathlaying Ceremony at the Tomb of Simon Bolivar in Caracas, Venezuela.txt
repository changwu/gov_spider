    I want to speak to all the Venezuelans and to the rest of our friends gathered here.
I am very moved. I have just offered in the name of lily people the affection and respect due to the liberator Simon Bolivar. I have also just set foot on Venezuelan soil and felt the generous friendship of this great democracy.
Bolivar has not plowed in the sea. His inspiring presence and the goals that our two countries share are forces that inspire me and give me confidence in the success of our struggle for the dignity of man and the well-being of peoples in the Americas and throughout the world.
His dream and the dream of George Washington, of San Martin, of all those who struggle today for human liberty, will triumph.
I am happy to be with you.
Viva Venezuela!
Thank you very much.
