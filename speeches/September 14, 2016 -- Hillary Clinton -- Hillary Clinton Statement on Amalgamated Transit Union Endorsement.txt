    Today, after receiving the endorsement of the Amalgamated Transit Union, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement:"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of the Amalgamated Transit Union.
"For more than a hundred years, ATU members have kept our cities running, powering our urban economies and helping countless people get to and from work every day. Along the way, they helped build the American middle class by fighting for fair wages, good benefits, and safe working conditions.
"As President, I will proudly stand with ATU as we work to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, and make the minimum wage a living wage. We'll invest in building 21st century infrastructure, including transit infrastructure, and make sure that our transit systems are designed to actually connect working people to jobs and economic opportunity. And we will protect the rights and dignity of all Americans–because we know that we are stronger together.
"The stakes in this election could not be higher for working people. Donald Trump stood on a debate stage and said that wages are "too high" in this country. He opposes policies that would make it easier for people to balance work and family, including paid family leave and ensuring pay for women. He personally hired a union-busting firm to keep workers at his hotel in Las Vegas from organizing. Donald Trump is wrong for workers and he's wrong for America."
