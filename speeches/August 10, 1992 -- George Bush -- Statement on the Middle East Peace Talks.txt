    We are pleased to announce that we have received positive responses from all the parties to the bilateral negotiations in the Arab-Israeli peace process to attend the sixth round of talks which will commence in Washington on August 24.
The United States and Russia, as cosponsors, welcome this opportunity for the parties to engage in substantive negotiations and to make real progress during this round.
The United States is prepared to continue to play its role as a driving force, catalyst, and honest broker to promote progress in these negotiations.
