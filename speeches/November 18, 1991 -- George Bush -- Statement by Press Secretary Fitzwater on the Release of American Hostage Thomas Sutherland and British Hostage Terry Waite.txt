    We are pleased with the release of Thomas Sutherland and Terry Waite. The release of these hostages after years of captivity in Lebanon is a time of joy for them and their families.
For their assistance in the release, we wish to thank the United Nations and the Governments of Iran, Syria, and Lebanon.
Our joy is mixed, however, with deep concern over those who remain in captivity. We call again for the release of all those in the region who are held hostage outside the process of law. All of them must be free. We support the initiative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to secure their safe, immediate, and unconditional release. The three remaining American hostages and the other hostages being held in Lebanon must be reunited with their loved ones, and there must be a full accounting of all those who have died in captivity and the return of their remains.
