    LAS VEGAS â€“ The New York Times reported yesterday that in a meeting held in a large Wall Street investor's office, big-money donors instructed Secretary Hillary Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook to go after Sen. Bernie Sanders for offering so-called "unrealistic proposals" and by claiming that all his solutions are related back to "millionaires and billionaires."
Not surprisingly those are exactly the attacks that the Clinton campaign is now dutifully lobbing.
"One of the biggest differences between our campaigns is that Bernie's campaign does not take its marching orders from Wall Street and big-money donors," Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, said. "It's shameful that the Clinton campaign is parroting attacks at Sen. Sanders that The New York Times has documented come right from her big-money backers. Now we are beginning to get a glimpse into what goes on in all those closed door meetings with Wall Street interests."
The mega-donors also asked Mook to highlight the Clinton campaign's support from small donors. But just 17 percent of her individual contributions last year came from small-dollar donors, compared to 74 percent for Sanders. Nearly 60 percent of her campaign committee's money came from donors who gave the legal limit to her campaign.
