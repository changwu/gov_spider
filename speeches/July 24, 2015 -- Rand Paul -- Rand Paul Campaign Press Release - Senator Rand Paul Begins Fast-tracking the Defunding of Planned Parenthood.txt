    WASHINGTON, D.C. - Last week, Sen. Rand Paul vowed to defeat and defund Planned Parenthood by any means necessary. Today, Sen. Paul fast-tracked his defund Planned Parenthood legislation by initiating Rule 14. This could allow for a Senate vote as early as next week.
"Since the inhumane acts of Planned Parenthood have surfaced, I have vowed to defeat and defund this taxpayer-funded organization. I am more appalled than ever by Planned Parenthood's complete disregard for the sanctity of human life. Today, I implemented Rule 14 and fast-tracked legislation to strip every dollar of Planned Parenthood funding. I will continue to lead this charge in defense of the unborn," Sen. Paul said.
