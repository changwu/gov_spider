When a vacancy opens up on the Supreme Court, the president has a responsibility to nominate a new justice—and the Senate has a responsibility to vote. But hours after Justice Antonin Scalia died, Republicans in the Senate and on the campaign trail pledged to block any replacement justice President Obama nominates.
With so many issues in front of the court right now, their actions would have a direct and immediate impact on millions of lives. Hillary Clinton knows the American people can't wait, and she's taking Republicans to task.

8 I have news for Republicans who would put politics over the Constitution: Refusing to do your duty isn't righteous, it's disgraceful. -H— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016


9 There are 339 days until the next president takes office. The Senate has never taken more than 125 days to vote on a SCOTUS nominee. -H— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016


10 As for complaints that this is an election year: 1988 was an election year, too—and Justice Kennedy was confirmed 97-0. -H— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016


11 So, a message for Senate Republicans: Fill this vacancy. @POTUS will do his job. Do yours. -H— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016
