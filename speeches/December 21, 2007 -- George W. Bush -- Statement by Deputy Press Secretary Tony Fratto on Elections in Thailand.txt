    The United States looks forward to elections to be held in Thailand on December 23, 2007. The people of Thailand deserve free and fair elections that will return a democratic government to office as soon as possible. The United States eagerly awaits the return of democracy to Thailand so that we may resume our close and abiding relationship with this important ally.
