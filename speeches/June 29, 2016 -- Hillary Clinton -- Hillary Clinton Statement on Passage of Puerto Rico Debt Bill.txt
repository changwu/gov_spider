    Hillary Clinton released the following statement on the passage of PROMESA, which authorizes the Government of Puerto Rico to restructure their debt and creates a federal oversight board:
"Puerto Rico's continuing economic crisis has caused real suffering for the people of the island. The bill the Senate passed today is the best chance we have of averting a fiscal crisis on July 1. The bill is by no means perfect, and I continue to have serious concerns about some of the provisions it contains. That's why, as this bill is implemented, I will continue to stand with the people of Puerto Rico to ensure that the oversight board created by this legislation is made up of members who will act in the best interest of Puerto Ricans, and protect their health care, pensions, wages, and well-being. And it is past time that we put the interests of American citizens ahead of hedge fund profitsâ€”which is why I will fight with the people of Puerto Rico to put the island's economy back on a stable and prosperous path, including by ensuring Puerto Rico is treated equitably under federal law."
