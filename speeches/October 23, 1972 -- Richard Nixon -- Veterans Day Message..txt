    AS AMERICAN troops return home with honor from another distant conflict, the hope is strong for a full generation of peace. No group has sacrificed more to achieve this goal than the men and women who have proudly worn the American uniform.
In serving God and country, they have sought not glory for themselves, but peace and freedom for us all. They have expressed in their service much of what is finest in our Nation. Courage, selflessness, discipline, and devotion--these are qualities we will need as much to build a future of peace as we have needed them in the past in time of war.
Each year we set aside a special day to salute our veterans--to pay our tribute to the millions of quiet, undemanding heroes who have served so that other generations might be spared war's anguish and destruction. At a time when a small minority has tried to make heroes of the few who have refused to serve, it is more important than ever that we honor the example of the millions of men and women who have loyally stood by their country.
Speaking for the American people, I say today that the vast majority of us have never been prouder of our country's nearly 29 million veterans, whether they are the survivors of World War I or the outstanding young men who have served in Vietnam. To all of them I say that our respect has never been stronger, nor our gratitude greater, than on this Veterans Day, 1972.
