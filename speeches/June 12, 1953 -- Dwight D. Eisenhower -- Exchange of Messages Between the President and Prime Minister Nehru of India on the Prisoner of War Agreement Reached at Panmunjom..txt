- My dear Mr. Prime Minister:
I thank you for your message received June 9 regarding the prisoner of war agreement reached at Panmunjom. I greatly appreciate your words regarding the part which the United States has played in this matter. It is my earnest hope that this agreement will speedily lead to an armistice and just peace in Korea, and to a relaxing of world tensions. India's participation in the work of the Repatriation Commission will mark a further significant contribution toward these ends.
Sincerely yours,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
