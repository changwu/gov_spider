With great confidence and smooth delivery during last night's debate, Mitt Romney denied changing the text of his book, No Apology, saying, "One reason to elect me is that I know what I stand for. I've written it down. Words have meaning." [1]
Hours after the debate, Romney retreated from his written words, admitting the paperback edition of No Apology was scrubbed to remove the Romneycare reference: "We can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country." [2]
This morning on Fox News, Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul attributed Romney's fluctuating positions to "changes in the climate." "Updates of course are going to be made to reflect changes in the climate," Saul said. "Those changes were reflected in the book." [3]
"Mr. Romney talks a good game, but just can't shoot straight about Romneycare being the father of Obamacare," said Perry spokesman Ray Sullivan. "Time and again he changes positions and policies to suit his political needs. Mr. Romney promised no retreat from his book. Now his campaign admits he changes his positions to match changes in the political climate, such as denying Romneycare should be a national model now that Obamacare is a job-killing disaster."
Mr. Romney said during last night's debate: "Please don't try and make me retreat from the words that I wrote in my book. I stand by what I wrote. I believe in what I did. And I believe that the people of this country can read my book and see exactly what it is." [4]
