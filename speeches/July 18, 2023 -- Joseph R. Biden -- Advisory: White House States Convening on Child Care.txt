    Tomorrow at 9:00am ET, the White House will host an in-person convening of state leaders, including New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, Minnesota Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan, and more than 90 state legislators from 41 states across the country to support state actions to make child care more affordable for working families, increase child care provider supply, and improve job quality for child care workers. First Lady Jill Biden will join the convening and provide closing remarks around 11:45am ET.
This convening follows historic actions the Biden-Harris Administration has taken to lower costs and expand access to child care, including most recently announcing an HHS notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that would strengthen the Child Care & Development Block Grant program (CCDBG), which supports 1.5 million children and their families each month with child care assistance.
The event will be anchored by Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President and Director of the Gender Policy Council; Neera Tanden, Assistant to the President and Director of the Domestic Policy Council; and Tom Perez, Assistant & Senior Advisor to the President and Director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs.
Watch the opening and close of the convening here.
