    President Obama will host Afghan President Ghani, Chief Executive Officer Abdullah, and key members of their unity government for meetings and a working lunch at the White House on Tuesday, March 24, 2015. The two presidents will discuss a range of issues including security, economic development, and U.S. support to the Afghan-led reconciliation process. This marks the first meeting between the two presidents at the White House following the 2014 presidential election, which produced the first democratic transfer of power in Afghanistan's history. While in Washington from March 22-25, President Ghani and his delegation will also engage in a high-level strategic dialogue hosted by Secretary Kerry at Camp David. President Ghani's visit highlights the importance of continuing bilateral cooperation and the American commitment to our U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership to reinforce regional security and sustain the achievements of the last 13 years.
