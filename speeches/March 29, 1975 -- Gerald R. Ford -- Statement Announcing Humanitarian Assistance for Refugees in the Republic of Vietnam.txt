    A SEVERE emergency exists in the coastal communities of South Vietnam which are swollen with helpless civilian refugees who have fled the North Vietnam offensive. They are desperately in need of any assistance we and other nations can provide.
To help the refugees reach safe haven further south, I have ordered American naval transports and contract vessels to assist in the evacuation of refugees from the coastal seaports.
I also call upon all nations and corporations that have ships in the vicinity of the South Vietnamese coast to help evacuate refugees to safety in the south.
I have directed that U.S. Government resources be made .available to meet immediate humanitarian needs and I have appointed Mr. Daniel Parker, Administrator of the Agency for International Development, as my Special Coordinator for Disaster Relief.
