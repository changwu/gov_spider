    With the passing of Bryce N. Harlow the Nation has lost one of its finest public servants. Recognizing the need for improved communication between the executive and legislative branches in the era of the modern Presidency, Mr. Harlow founded the Congressional Liaison Office of the White House and served as its Director under Presidents Eisenhower and Nixon.
He was trusted by Presidents and Members of the House and Senate on both sides of the aisle. He was a brilliant writer and eloquent speaker whose knowledge of the intricacies of government served the Nation admirably for nearly four decades. He was an insightful architect of public policy whose contributions have strengthened our democracy's political process.
Nancy and I, my administration, and the Republican Party have lost a great friend and a wise counselor. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family. He will be sorely missed.
