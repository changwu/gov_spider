    To the Congress of the United States:
Section 213(c) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) requires that all beneficiary countries exporting beef or sugar to the United States under the duty-free provisions of the Act submit a stable food production plan. Food plans consist of measures and proposals to ensure that food production in and the nutritional level of the population of a beneficiary country are not adversely affected by changes in land and other resources use that could result from increased sugar and beef production undertaken in response to the duty-free treatment for these exports into the United States.
In accordance with section 213(c)(4) (19 U.S.C. 2703(e)(4)) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA), I am submitting to you my biennial report on the extent to which each CBERA beneficiary has implemented its stable food production plan and the results of such implementation. My report concludes that each beneficiary country has demonstrated a good faith effort to implement and monitor its stable food production plan, although there have been varying degrees of success in country efforts to improve nutritional levels and to increase agricultural productivity.
