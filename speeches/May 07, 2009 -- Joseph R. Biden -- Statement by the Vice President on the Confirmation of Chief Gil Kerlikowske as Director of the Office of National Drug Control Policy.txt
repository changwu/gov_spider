    Vice President Biden issued this statement today after the United States Senate voted to confirm Chief Gil Kerlikowske as Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy:
I am very pleased by the Senate's overwhelming support for Gil Kelikowske today. Chief Kerlikowske is the right man for the job. With over 36 years of law enforcement experience at all levels, he has long been on the front-lines in the battle against drugs. And, while the challenge before him is great, the President and I believe that he will lead our nation's efforts against illegal drugs with unshakable resolve.
