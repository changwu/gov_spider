    To the Congress of the United States:
I inclose a report received from the Secretary of State requesting the submission to the present Congress of the claim presented by the Government of Norway against the United States for reimbursement on account of losses sustained by reason of the detention of the Norwegian steamer Tampen by the United States Coast Guard during June, 1925.
I concur in the recommendation made by the Secretary of State and recommend that, as an act of grace and without reference to the question of the legal liability of the United States in the matter, the Congress authorize an appropriation in the sum of $8,765, in order to effect the settlement of all claims arising as a result of detention of the vessel.
