    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 Budget amendments for the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, the Interior, and State, as well as the National Science Foundation and the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia. These amendments do not affect the proposed FY 2015 Budget totals.
These amendments are necessary to reflect correctly policies assumed in the FY 2015 Budget. The details of these amendments are set forth in the enclosure from the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
BARACK OBAMA
