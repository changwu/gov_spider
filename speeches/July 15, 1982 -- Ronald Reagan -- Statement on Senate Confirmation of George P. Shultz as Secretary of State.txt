    On behalf of the American people, I want to compliment the Senate for its wisdom in approving, so decisively, the nomination of George Shultz as our next Secretary of State. The Senate's swift action augurs well for continued cooperation between the Congress and executive branch and for strong leadership at the State Department.
I also want to compliment Mr. Shultz on his impressive performance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His articulate and convincing presentation sent a strong signal to friend and foe alike-America is blessed with a man of exceptional character and qualifications for this vital position. I very much look forward to having George with us as a member of the team.
