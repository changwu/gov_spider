    AUSTIN — Today Governor Rick Perry released the following statement calling on Planned Parenthood's nonprofit status to be revoked by the federal government:
"With the release of a fourth video showing a Planned Parenthood doctor discussing the sale of body parts from aborted babies, the organization's carefully constructed façade continues to crumble. We can no longer allow the atrocities committed by an organization that receives state and federal tax dollars, and that receives special tax treatment from the federal government. That is why today, I am calling for the revocation of the federal nonprofit charters of the Planned Parenthood Federation Of America and its political wing, Planned Parenthood Action.
"The Obama Administration targets groups with the word 'patriot' in their name but does nothing to an organization that cuts apart and sells the body parts of dead babies. This cannot stand. It is long past time for the mirage around Planned Parenthood's true activities to fade."
