Said Douglas, "Among the candidates left standing, only John Kasich demonstrates the leadership ability needed in the Oval Office. From balancing the budget in Washington to turning Ohio's economy around, he knows how to solve problems and he knows how to bring people together. He's the only Republican who can defeat Hillary Clinton in the fall and I'm proud to join him on the road to the Convention."

Douglas was elected the 80th Governor of Vermont in 2002 and reelected three times before retiring from office in 2011. He previously served as Majority Leader of the Vermont House of Representatives, Secretary of State, State Treasurer and Chairman of the National Governors Association.
Said Kasich, "I'm grateful to receive Governor Douglas' endorsement today. Jim knows what it takes to lead a state and manage economic growth, so his vote of confidence carries tremendous weight. He will no doubt be a major asset to our team as we carry our message to voters."
