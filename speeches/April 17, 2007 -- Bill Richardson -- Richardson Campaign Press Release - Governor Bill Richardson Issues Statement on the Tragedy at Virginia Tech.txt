    Governor Bill Richardson today ordered flags at half staff in response to the tragedy at Virginia Tech.
In honor of lives lost at Virginia Tech, all flags will fly at half-staff through sundown, Sunday, April 22, 2007. President Bush signed a federal proclamation directing that the U.S. flag be displayed at half-staff. The federal proclamation also applies to the New Mexico flag, which under federal law must fly lower than the U.S. flag.
"Yesterday the worst mass shooting in America's history took place at Virginia Tech," said Governor Bill Richardson. "Thirty-two lives were tragically cut short. The hearts of every New Mexican, and every American, go out to the victims and their families. On all of our school campuses, we must be vigilant and protect the young lives who are so dear to us all."
