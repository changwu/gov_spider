    Arne Duncan has been one of the best Secretaries of Education in our nation's history. Over the past 7 years, he has been a dynamic leader who brings unparalleled energy to his work. During his time as Secretary, Arne has made almost unprecedented strides in changing the direction of education in this country through his work to improve graduation rates, expand access to community colleges and raise academic standards for students all across the country. He has also done tremendous work through Title IX to make campuses safer for women and girls. He's a man of great character and principle and he has become a close friend to Jill and me. We wish him all the best and we will miss him dearly.
