    I am delighted that the House of Representatives today joined the Senate in accepting the conference report on the mental health systems act. This bill, which had its origins in the hard work of the President's Commission on Mental Health and which owes its success to the talent and dedication of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Congressman Henry A. Waxman and Tim Lee Carter, and their staffs, is a landmark piece of legislation.
The mental health systems act will encourage the provision of services for the chronically mentally ill, severely disturbed children, the elderly, minorities, and other priority population groups. It will also, for the first time, make grants available for the prevention of mental illness and the promotion of mental health. In addition, it will refine and enhance the partnership between Federal, State, and local levels of government.
It is a fine bill, and I look forward to signing it into law.
