    I welcome the agreement of the parties for a 4-month cessation of hostilities in Bosnia.
We hope it will be respected fully and pave the way for a negotiated settlement that brings peace to all the long-suffering people of Bosnia.
We applaud the flexibility that the parties have shown and commend the United Nations and former President Carter for their efforts.
We will be working with our Contact Group partners, the United Nations, and the parties in a renewed effort to seize this opportunity for peace.
