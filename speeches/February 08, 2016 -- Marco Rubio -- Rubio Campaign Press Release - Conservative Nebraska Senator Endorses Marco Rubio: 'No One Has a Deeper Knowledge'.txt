Nebraska conservative senator Deb Fischer, who picked up a critical Senate seat for the Republican Party in 2012, is backing Marco.

Fischer sits on the Armed Services Committee and backs Marco because of his national security vision and plan to rebuild the U.S. military. 
Here's what she told the Lincoln Journal Star:
No one has a deeper knowledge of the global challenges than Marco.
â€¦ We're going to be electing a commander-in-chief and our focus needs to be on national security.
She's also been a strong pro-life advocate in the Senate and has been a voice for farming and agriculture issues.Senator Fischer, welcome to Team Marco!
