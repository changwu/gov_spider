    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, I have found and proclaimed (copy of the Proclamation is enclosed) that a severe energy supply interruption currently exists with respect to the supply of imported crude oil and petroleum products and have implemented the authority vested in me to impose emergency building temperature restrictions as set forth in Standby Energy Conservation Contingency Plan No. 2.
The Plan will become effective as of July 16, 1979. A copy of the final Department of Energy regulations which more fully explain the manner for the exercise of the Plan is enclosed.
