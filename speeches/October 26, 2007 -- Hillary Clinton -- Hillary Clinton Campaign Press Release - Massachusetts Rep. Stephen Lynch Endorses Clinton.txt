    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Massachusetts Congressman Stephen Lynch.
"These challenging times call for a leader with Hillary's strength and experience," said Congressman Lynch. "She is deeply committed to rebuilding our middle class and putting the American Dream back within reach of all Americans."
Rep. Lynch was elected to Congress in 2001, where he's been an outspoken advocate for enforcing our trade laws and keeping American jobs in the U.S.
Prior to serving in Congress, Rep. Lynch served in the Massachusetts State Senate from 1995 to 2001. Rep. Lynch also spent 18 years as an ironworker, rising to become President of the Massachusetts Ironworkers Union in 2000.
Rep. Lynch serves on the Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Lynch is a member of both the Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs and the Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, Postal Service and the District of Columbia.
Rep. Lynch is a co-founder of the Congressional Labor and Working Families Caucus, which was formed to protect workers rights and educate Members of Congress on issues that impact American families.
"Stephen's been a champion for America's workers, fighting every day to make sure they get a chance to compete on a level playing field," Clinton said. "I'm honored to have his support and delighted that he'll help lead our efforts in Massachusetts."
