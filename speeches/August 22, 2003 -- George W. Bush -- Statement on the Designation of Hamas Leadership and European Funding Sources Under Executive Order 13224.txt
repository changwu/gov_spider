    At my direction, the Treasury Department has moved today to block and freeze the assets of six top Hamas leaders and five nongovernmental organizations that I am advised provide financial support to Hamas. By claiming responsibility for the despicable act of terror on August 19, Hamas has reaffirmed that it is a terrorist organization committed to violence against Israelis and to undermining progress toward peace between Israel and the Palestinian people.
I call upon all nations supportive of peace in the Middle East to recognize Hamas as a terrorist organization and to take all appropriate actions to deny it support.
