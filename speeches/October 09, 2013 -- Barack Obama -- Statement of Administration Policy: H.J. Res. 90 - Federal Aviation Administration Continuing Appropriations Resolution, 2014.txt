(House)
(Rep. Rogers, R-KY)
The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.J. Res. 90, which is another attempt at funding the Federal Government in piecemeal fashion by restoring only very limited activities. Consideration of appropriations legislation in this manner is not a serious or responsible way to run the United States Government. Instead of opening up a few Government functions, the House of Representatives should re-open all of the Government. The harmful impacts of a shutdown extend across Government, affecting services that are critical to small businesses, women, children, seniors, and others across the Nation. The Senate acted in a responsible manner on a short-term funding measure to maintain Government functions and avoid a damaging Government shutdown. The House of Representatives should allow a straight up or down vote on Senate-passed H.J. Res. 59.
If the President were presented with H.J. Res. 90, he would veto the bill.
