LAKE JACKSON, Texas— 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul attracted more than 1,150 supporters to the Denver Renaissance Hotel Grand Ballroom in Denver today, demonstrating his overall popularity.
The crowd gathered expressly for the 12-term Congressman from Texas at 12:00 p.m. This was his second event of the day and yet clearly there was no loss of enthusiasm.
