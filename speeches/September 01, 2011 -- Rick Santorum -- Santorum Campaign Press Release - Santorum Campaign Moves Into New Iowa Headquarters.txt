Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) announced today the opening of a new Santorum for President Iowa headquarters in Urbandale, IA.
As a result of growing interest and enthusiasm in the wake of Senator Santorum's Ames Straw Poll performance, Senator Santorum has moved his Iowa campaign headquarters to a new location to better accommodate growing staff and volunteer needs:
Rick Santorum for President
11197 Aurora Avenue
Urbandale, IA 50322
Senator Santorum said, "The outpouring of support we have received since the Ames Straw Poll has been incredible. We're excited that our campaign is growing in enthusiasm and size. The additions of staff, volunteers, and new office space were needed and necessary to run our Iowa campaign operations. I believe our new space will allow our campaign to be the most volunteer friendly headquarters for our grassroots base. I'm so proud of our team, and I look forward to working with them as we advance toward victory in the Caucuses."
