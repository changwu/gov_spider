The President told the NYPD that he is particularly grateful for the exceptional teamwork that has been abundantly evident over the past several weeks with other police departments and with Federal departments and agencies and said they have the respect and gratitude of all New Yorkers and all Americans. In addition, the President is grateful for the extraordinary work being done by the employees of the Department of Justice and previously called FBI Director Mueller to express his gratitude for the strong work of the Bureau and underscored the need to maintain vigilance and to continue the strong investigative and intelligence work that is critical to protecting the homeland from terrorist attacks.
