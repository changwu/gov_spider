    Crosses 130,000 Individual Donor Threshold
Booker Has Already Met Polling Requirement for Third and Fourth Democratic Primary Debates
Newark, NJ — Today, Cory 2020 announced that Cory Booker has met the requirements set by the DNC to participate in the third and fourth Democratic primary debates.
Booker was the sixth Democratic presidential candidate to reach the required polling threshold for the fall DNC debates. Now, in surpassing the second requirement of 130,000 individual campaign donors, he has secured a spot on the fall debate stages.
"We're building this campaign the right way, brick by brick from the grassroots up, and we're seeing the results of that strategy as we continue to build momentum," said Cory 2020 Campaign Manager Addisu Demissie. "We're grateful to the tens of thousands of Americans who have chipped in to ensure Cory's voice will be heard in the Democratic debates this fall, and who believe in Cory's uplifting vision of building a more fair and just country for everyone."
The data behind Booker's push to 130,000 donors indicates growing momentum behind his candidacy:

More than ¼ of Cory 2020's unique donors have become donors since the June debate, just one month ago.
Cory 2020 added its second 65,000 unique donors in less than half the time as the first.
