    Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen:
It has been my privilege to visit over 60 countries in the world, and of all the countries I have visited, there has been none that has been more memorable than the visit to Romania. This is true not only because of the very substantive talks you, Mr. President, and I have had on issues--talks which I am convinced history will record will serve the cause of peace but it is true also because of the wonderfully heartwarming welcome we have received from the people of Romania every place we have gone.
Mr. President, I am convinced, after this visit, as I am sure you are, that regardless of the differences in policies, the peoples of the world are determined to be one and, Mr. President, from the bottom of my heart, as I leave your country, I want to say, in your own language as well as I can: Traiasca prietenia noastra. La revedere [Long live our friendship. Until we meet again].
