    COLUMBIA â€“ Activist Jacqueline Jackson, wife of Jesse Jackson Sr., a South Carolina native, took to the South Carolina airwaves today calling Hillary "what's best for our families," in the campaign's sixth statewide radio advertisement in South Carolina.
The 60-second spot, entitled "Mrs. Jackson," features Jacqueline Jackson discussing Hillary's 35-year fight for children and families, including her struggle for universal health care and her work to pass the State Children's Health Insurance Program.
"Women are used to making difficult choices, but this is easy because it's about what's best for our families. Join me in supporting Hillary Clinton," Jackson says in the ad.
A complete transcript is included below. The radio ad will be available online at: www.hillaryclinton.com/southcarolina.
JACKSON: This is Jacqueline Jackson. My husband, Rev. Jesse Jackson, is a native of South Carolina. Let me tell you why I decided to support Hillary Clinton for President.As a mother and a grandmother, I know that raising children begins and ends at home. It begins with a loving family that builds esteem. It ends with a woman's touch that inspires children to make their dreams a reality. That's why this election is so important. It is also why I believe Hillary Clinton is by far the most qualified candidate to be President in these tough times. Hillary believes that the way we treat our children reflects our nation's values. For 35 years, Hillary has fought for families. As first lady, she fought for universal health care and fought just as hard to pass the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Women are used to making difficult choices, but this is easy because it's about what's best for our families. Join me in supporting Hillary Clinton.
HILLARY: I'm Hillary Clinton, candidate for President, and I approve this message.
ANNCER: Paid for by Hillary Clinton for President
