    Former Pennsylvania Governor and Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge today came out in support of Gov. John Kasich for president and joined his campaign as a national co-chair.
Said Ridge, "I want to see proven conservative leadership in our nominee, not just the promise of conservative leadership, and that's why John Kasich is my candidate. I've known him for more than 30 years, since we came to Congress together, and I've always respected the way he successfully unites people of different views to enact conservative policies. He did it in Ohio and helped turn around his state and he did it as chief architect of the balanced budget in Washingtonâ€”something we haven't seen since he left. John Kasich also has both the strong command of national security and foreign policy issues that a president needs as well as the executive experience it takes to actually be Commander-in-Chief. He is ready to be president on Day One."

A native of Munhall, Pennsylvania, Ridge represented Pennsylvania's 21st Congressional District from 1983-1995 before becoming the state's 43rd governor. In 2003, he was appointed by President George W. Bush to serve as the country's first Secretary of Homeland Security. Ridge campaigned for John McCain in 2008 and most recently supported former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.
Said Kasich, "Tom Ridge and I entered office together in 1982. In Congress I knew a principled, resolute leader who understood how to work across the aisle to get things done for the people he served. In the years since he has distinguished himself through noble service to our country at a critical point in our nation's history. To receive his stamp of approval is a tremendous honor for me, and I'm grateful for his offer of support and advice moving forward."
