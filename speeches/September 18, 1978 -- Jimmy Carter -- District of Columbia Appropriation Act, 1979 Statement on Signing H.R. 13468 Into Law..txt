    Today I have signed H.R. 13468, which makes appropriations for the government of the District of Columbia. This bill appropriates both funds generated locally by the District and Federal funds for loans and direct payments to the District.
Congress recently took a historic step toward granting the citizens of the District equal standing with other American citizens by approving a proposed constitutional amendment to grant the District full voting representation in the Congress. If we are to make equal rights and home rule a reality for the District, we must also bring stability and predictability to the Federal payment process.
The Federal payment is intended to offset the effects of the Federal presence on the District's revenues. As such, it should be determined on a fair, objective basis and not arbitrarily changed from year to year. I favor the establishment of a formula which would consider the various factors involved in the Federal presence to determine the appropriate amount of the payment each year. My administration is working with the Congress and the District government to develop such a formula.
In signing this appropriations bill, I wish to reaffirm my commitment to the basic principles of fairness and self-determination, which must be the cornerstone of Federal-District relations. While not forgetting the close connections between the Federal Government and the District of Columbia, we must continue to move toward a greater role for the District in determining its own governmental actions.
