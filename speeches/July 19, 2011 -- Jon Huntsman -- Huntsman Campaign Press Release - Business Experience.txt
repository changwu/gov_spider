    Jon's economic record as governor speaks for itself. Under his leadership, Utah was the fastest-growing state in the nation, number one in job creation, named the best state for business by Forbes and the best-managed state by Pew.
Yet America deserves a president who has proven his economic chops in the private sector as well. And no other candidate has hands-on business experience like Jon. 

As an executive in the family business, Jon helped build real products and create thousands of jobs. He knows how to sign the front of a check, not just the back. He knows what it means to meet a payroll. He understands markets, and most importantly, he understands the damage that burdensome regulations, mandates and high taxes cause to job-creators.
That's why as governor, he streamlined regulations and signed the largest tax cut in state history. He aggressively promoted free and fair trade. He championed free-market health care reform that, unlike Massachusetts, does not include mandates and fines on individuals and businesses. Jon's pro-growth, jobs-friendly policies delivered remarkable results for Utah, and they'll deliver for America as well.
