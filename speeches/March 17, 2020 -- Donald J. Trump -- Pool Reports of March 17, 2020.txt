WH Pool Report #7 - Inside Tourism meeting, continued
President Trump, whose family runs hotels around the world, interjected to ask questions of the execs as they went around the table and explained their financial circumstances.
One exec explained the chain effect of events and flights being cancelled. "The collective impact is quite significant…now we are seeing occupancy below 10%.
"When this ends do you see a quick build up?" Trump asked. "It depends on how confident people are to get back on planes and travel."
As the execs were speaking, VP Pence was making notes all over the points in front of him.
Bates from Disney said employee retention is the most important, and second is liquidity.
Bates said he likes an "Employee-employer payroll tax holiday."
"Is that what you like of the scenarios?" Trump said.
Bates said he likes all of them, and a lot.
"Most direct, not as quick, but most direct," Trump replied.
Beyond Sec. Ross and the VP, I spotted only two other admin officials in the room, but could not recognize them.
Q: How much money for checks?"That's all being figured out now, and we're also helping industries like Boeing, we have to help Boeing, the airline industry. It wasn't their fault. We will do that, we will be doing it. We're adding it up. It will be fine, it will come back very quickly once we're finished with our war with the virus."
Q: Payroll tax holiday…can we afford something that bil?"Well we can definitely afford but the question is do we want to go through payroll, or do we want to – there are other ways to do it and we're determining it with the Senate the Senate and House."
Q: What's your message to furloughed employees?"Well the message is that this was something that happened it is nobody's fault...It happened and we're going to take care of it, we'll be bigger, stronger and better than ever before."
Pool was ushered out.
