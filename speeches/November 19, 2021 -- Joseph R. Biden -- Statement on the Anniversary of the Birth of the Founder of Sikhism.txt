    Jill and I extend our warmest wishes to the Sikh community on the 552d anniversary of the birth of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the founder of the Sikh faith. Guru Nanak's visionary message of equality, peace, and service is as important today as it was five centuries ago. His teachings emphasize the dignity and equal rights of all people, empowerment of women and girls, interfaith cooperation, and acts of service to support those in need. By living these and other core values of their faith, Sikhs continue to strengthen communities throughout the United States and the world.
