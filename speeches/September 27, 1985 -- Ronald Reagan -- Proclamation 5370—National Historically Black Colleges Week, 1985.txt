  A Proclamation

The one hundred and two historically black colleges and universities in the United States have contributed substantially to the growth and enrichment of the Nation. These institutions have a rich heritage and tradition of providing high quality academic and professional training, and their graduates have made countless contributions to the progress of our complex technological society.
Historically black colleges and universities bestow forty percent of all degrees earned by black students in the United States. They have awarded degrees to sixty percent of the black physicians, sixty percent of the pharmacists, forty percent of the attorneys, fifty percent of the engineers, seventy-five percent of the military officers, and eighty percent of the members of the judiciary. Throughout the years, these institutions have helped many underprivileged students to develop their full talents through higher education.
Recognizing that the achievements and aspirations of historically black colleges and universities deserve national attention, the Congress of the United States, by Senate Joint Resolution 186, has designated the week of September 23 through September 29, 1985, as "National Historically Black Colleges Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of September 23 through September 29, 1985, as National Historically Black Colleges Week. I ask all Americans to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities to express our respect and appreciation for the outstanding academic and social accomplishments of the Nation's black institutions of higher learning.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth.

RONALD REAGAN
