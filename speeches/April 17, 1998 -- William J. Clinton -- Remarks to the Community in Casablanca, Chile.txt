    Thank you. Mr. President, Mrs. Frei, Mr. Mayor, Senora, thank you all for making Hillary and me feel so welcome in this beautiful town of yours. I want to say a special word of appreciation to all the young people who came out, especially those who made the nice signs in English. Thank you very much.
And I think we should give another round of applause to Los del Mauco for the cueca. The music was wonderful. Thank you very much. Also the wonderful band, Colegio Saleciano, from Valparaiso, let's give a hand to the band over here. [Applause]
You know, one reason we wanted to come here is that the house in the United States where the President lives is called Casa Blanca. And so when I came here today, the mayor said to me, "Here you're in my Casa Blanca and I am the boss. But when I come to visit you, you can be the boss in your Casa Blanca."
Let me say to all of you, you should be very proud of your country and your President, for beginning tomorrow Chile will host and President Frei will preside over the Summit of the Americas, a gathering of the 34 freely elected leaders of our hemisphere. And the real reason we are here is because we want you to know that we will do our best to discuss things and work together on things that will make your lives better.
We believe that the people of Chile, the people of the United States, the people of all the Americas will share a common future. And we want it to be a future with better education for all of our children, better health care for all of our people, a cleaner environment in every nation in the Americas, and a stronger, better, freer future in which we are all working together.
The United States is proud to be a partner and a friend of Chile, and I have enjoyed very much coming here today and seeing all of you. In the faces of the children, I see the future of the Americas, and I like what I see very much.
Thank you very much. Muchas gracias.
