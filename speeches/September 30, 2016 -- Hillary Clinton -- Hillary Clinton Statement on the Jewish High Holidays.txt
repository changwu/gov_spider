    Today, before the start of Rosh Hashanah Sunday, Hillary Clinton released the following statement:
"As the High Holiday celebrations begin, I send my best wishes for a Shana Tova – a happy and healthy new year – to Jewish families and communities in the United States, Israel, and around the world.
"Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are a time for prayer and contemplation. They are a time to recall our past year, take a hard look at what we've done and what we've said, and ask how we can do better in the year ahead. They challenge us to do the difficult work of self-reflection—key to becoming a better family member, friend, and neighbor.
"Our country must do this work as a national community, too. All Americans should question whether we're doing all that we can to work on "Tikkun Olam"—repairing the world. That means asking ourselves if we could be doing more to help those who are hungry or in need of shelter. If we could be doing more to make sure everyone has access to health care. And if we could be doing more to build a brighter future where no one is left out or left behind.
"It's critical to ask these tough questions. And then, at the conclusion of the High Holidays, it's even more important to get to work and answer them.
"Many of the complex challenges we face as a nation are daunting—but luckily, we don't have to face them alone. We are stronger together, and if we commit to work in good faith with one another, surely we can build a better world for future generations.
"This year's High Holidays are saddened by the passing of President Shimon Peres, a man whose life's work exemplifies the notion of Tikkun Olam. Let us honor his legacy by continuing to strengthen the bonds between the American and Israeli people, and by never wavering in our quest for peace.
"May the coming year be filled with sweetness and joy."
