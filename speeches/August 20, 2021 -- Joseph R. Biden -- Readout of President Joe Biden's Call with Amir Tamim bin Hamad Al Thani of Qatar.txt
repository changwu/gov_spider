    President Joe Biden and Amir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar spoke to reaffirm the longstanding friendship between the United States and Qatar. The President expressed appreciation for Qatar's generous support for the ongoing evacuation from Afghanistan of U.S. citizens, diplomatic staff from the U.S. and several partner nations, and vulnerable Afghan nationals. The President noted that this is the largest airlift of people in history and that it would not have been possible without the early support from Qatar to facilitate the transfer of thousands of people daily. The President also thanked the Amir for the important role Qatar has long played to facilitate intra-Afghanistan talks. The two leaders underscored the importance of continued close coordination on developments in Afghanistan and the broader Middle East, and they welcomed the upcoming summit of regional states to be held in Baghdad towards the end of the month.
