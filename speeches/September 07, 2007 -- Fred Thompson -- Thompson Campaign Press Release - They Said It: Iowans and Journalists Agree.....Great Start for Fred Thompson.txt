He was also featured as the lead story on the Drudge Report for the entirety of the debate. Kudos too go out to new Thompson communications director Todd Harris who moved a memo moments after the debate ended that read: 'Thompson Already Dominating Campaign Narrative.' Well played."

"The outburst [from the Leno audience] seemed genuinely spontaneous, inspired by words that resonate with the pride that Americans feel about their role as the model and inspiration for a free world....Thompson's declaration of freedom had to stir millions of viewers across the nation."
