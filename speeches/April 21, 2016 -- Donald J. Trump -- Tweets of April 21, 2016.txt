Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!Retweets: 9770Favorites: 26505

Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!Retweets: 8661Favorites: 24979

Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.Retweets: 8421Favorites: 22605
