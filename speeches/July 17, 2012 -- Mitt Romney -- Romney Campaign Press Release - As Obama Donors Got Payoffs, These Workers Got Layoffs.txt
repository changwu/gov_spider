"I Want To Know Why I'm Behind On My Bills Now? ... I Told Them I Was Put Out Of A Job. I Want To Know Why." BOBBY STRICKLAND: I didn't see it coming. If they saw it coming no one said anything about it. I was there for only a short time. I was gung-ho, I was a contract employee and due to go permanent a couple weeks after everything had happened. So I didn't see it coming at all. ... I want to know why I'm behind on my bills now? Sallie Mae wants to know why they are not going to get their loan for this month and maybe next month. I have to tell them something. I told them I was put out of a job. I want to know why." (Fox News' "On The Record," 9/23/11)

"Why Is It That You Can Plead The Fifth When Millions Of Dollars Are Involved?" BOBBY STRICKLAND: I think people who were let go, everybody else wants to know what happened to the money? Why is it that you can plead the fifth when millions of dollars are involved? People want to know why? I would like to know why I was put out of a job. I'm pretty sure Lindsey would like to know why he was put out of a job. I'm sure everybody else would like to know why they were put out of a job. Where is the money?"
