    Gil Kerlikowske, National Drug Control Policy Director (ONDCP) issued the following statement regarding the passage of the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010.
"Prescription drug abuse is America's fastest-growing drug problem, and one largely fed by an unlikely source - Americans' medicine cabinets. The passage of the Secure and Responsible Drug disposal Act of 2010 will save lives by providing patients with safe, environmentally sound ways to dispose of unused or expired prescription drugs. I commend Congress on the enactment of this important measure - it represents a significant step forward to reduce drug use and its consequences in America."
