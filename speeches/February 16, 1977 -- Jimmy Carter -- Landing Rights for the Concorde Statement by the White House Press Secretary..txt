    During the last few days, Prime Minister Callaghan of the United Kingdom and President Giscard d'Estaing of France sent personal messages to the President on the subject of landing rights for the Concorde aircraft at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York, on a 16-month trial basis, as provided for in the decision of former Secretary of Transportation Coleman on February 4, 1976.
Yesterday, the President replied to these messages, indicating that he shared the desire of the two European leaders to approach this matter in a way that reflects the close friendship between our countries.
The President stated that he cannot direct the Port of New York Authority or the Governor of New York to reach a particular decision that is theirs alone to decide.
He further stated, however, that this administration will reaffirm the 16-month trial period for Concorde landings as proposed in the decision of former Secretary of Transportation Coleman. This position, of course, does not prejudice the outcome of the administration's later decision on whether Concorde should be given permanent permission to and at United States airports.
The President further expressed his hope that this action will be a basis for reaffirming the close ties between the United States and Britain and France as we work together to meet problems that we face in common.
