    Record quarter powered by grassroots surge; half of Q4 total came from first-time donors
Newark, NJ â€” Cory 2020 had its best fundraising quarter during the last three months of 2019, raising $6.6 million thanks to a groundswell of new grassroots support.
Over half of Cory 2020's Q4 total came from donors who were giving to the campaign for the first time, and 96 percent of people who gave for the first time in Q4 donated via Cory 2020's online fundraising program. Cory 2020's average online donation in the fourth quarter was $22.98.
"We're thrilled to have closed out 2019 with our best fundraising quarter yet, despite not being able to join the December debate stage due to the artificial thresholds that prevented viable candidates from participating," said Cory 2020 campaign manager Addisu Demissie.
"But to put it bluntly, we're still behind the fundraising of a field of predominantly white candidates who have been able to haul in significantly greater sums of money or tap into their personal fortunes to fund their campaigns. In the wake of Julian Castro's departure, we find ourselves at a juncture where what started out as the most diverse field of candidates running for president in our nation's history is increasingly becoming one that does not reflect the rich diversity of our party and of our country.
"Despite the barriers, we are running hard at this challenge, getting stronger, and asking everyone who wants to keep Cory competitive in this race to go to corybooker.com and help support our campaign."
These contributions have made it possible for the campaign to go up on the airwaves with television ads for the first time and remain competitive as the campaign enters the home stretch in Iowa, where momentum for Cory has continued to build.
