    AMERICANS everywhere lament the death of Joseph W. Martin, Jr. But we are joined also in enduring admiration and gratitude for the inspiring example of a friend, patriot, and human being.
For half a century, Joe Martin demonstrated the finest qualities of legislator and statesman. He placed the Nation's trust first.
Among those of us who knew him well and worked long hours at his side, he will be missed but affectionately remembered.
