    REPORTER. How do you feel about your San Diego reception?
THE PRESIDENT. I think that the reception here tonight is one of the finest, if not the best. And I want to thank everybody tonight that is here--35,000 to 40,000 people on a Sunday night, and the warmth and the friendliness and the enthusiasm--well, I will sleep better. It convinces me we are going to carry California.
Q. How do you feel about the race now?
THE PRESIDENT. I think we will surprise some people. I am confident. I think we will come out on top on November 2.
Q. What do you intend to emphasize in this final week of blitz?
THE PRESIDENT. Trust, peace, and prosperity. Thank you all very, very much.
