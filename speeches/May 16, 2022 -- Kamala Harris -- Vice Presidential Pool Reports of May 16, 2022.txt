VPOTUS pool report #3: Travelers/ wheels down Germany
Good morning from Germany. Air Force Two was wheels down at Ramstein at 4:45 am local time for a refueling stop. Takeoff from JBA was 2:58 pm.
We are expected to be here for about 90 mins before continuing on to Abu Dhabi International Airport.
Vice President Harris did not come back during the flight. See below for her complete statement under the wing before JBA departure where she addressed the shooting in Buffalo and spoke briefly about the trip to UAE. Before speaking to reporters under the wing, Harris chatted for a few minutes with CIA director William Burns and Climate Envoy John Kerry. Harris was greeted warmly and gave a broad smile while shaking Burns's hand. Kerry smiled as Harris appeared to say something while pointing at Burns.
I noted a number of the officials traveling with Harris on AF2 in my last note but here is the complete list provided on background from a White House Official:
Greeting VP upon arrival at JBA:Dir. William Burns U.S. Central Intelligence AgencySec. John Kerry Presidential Special Envoy for Climate
Traveling staff:Lorraine Voles, Chief of Staff to the Vice PresidentPhil Gordon, National Security Advisor to the Vice PresidentRebecca Lissner, Deputy National Security Advisor to the Vice PresidentDean Lieberman, Special Advisor to the Vice PresidentAbram Paley, Special Advisor to the Vice President for the Middle East and North AfricaAsel Roberts, Senior Advisor to the Chief of Protocol
Please also note a correction to my last report which should have noted the death of Sheikh Khalifa. Sheikh Mohamed is of course the new president.
Here is Harris's full statement under the wing before departure:
"I'm leading a delegation on behalf of the president and our administration to express our condolences. The United States takes quite seriously the strength of our relationship and partnership with the UAE and we are going there then to express our condolences but also as an expression of our commitment to the strength of that relationship and continuing to strengthen that relationship.
"I'll speak also about what happened in Buffalo. It's horrendous, it's horrendous.
"In our country we have to recognize that we may very well be experiencing an epidemic of hate towards so many Americans. That is wrong. It is taking on a level of violence in the case of what happened in Buffalo and we've seen it in other places in our country. And we all must speak out against it.
"Hate against anyone of us we should interpret as being hate against all of us, as a nation. We are a nation that prides ourselves on our diversity as an element of our strength. And to see what has happened. Yesterday, an 86 year old grandmother who had just been taking care of her husband in a nursing home was just going to get some groceries. A security guard who had dedicated his life as a law enforcement officer and was known in the community to be one of the kindest, most gentle people, who showed extraordinary heroism.
"I think we all have to know that this is something that we have to not only speak about, but we've got to do everything in our power as a nation to stop it, to stop it. There's too much at stake. We should be working at it and thinking about it, not hating one another."

VPOTUS pool report #4: background on UAE leader meeting
On background as a senior administration official:
The Vice President believes it is important to travel to Abu Dhabi and offer condolences in person to demonstrate the support of President Biden, the Biden-Harris Administration, and the American people during this time. Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan was a longtime friend of the United States, and this delegation both honors his legacy and points confidently to the future of relations between the US and UAE.
As part of her condolence visit with United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed she will congratulate Sheikh Mohammed on his election as President of the UAE and underscore the importance the Biden-Harris administration places on the U.S.-UAE partnership. The composition of the delegation—including multiple members of the Cabinet—also demonstrates this.
The Vice President looks forward to further strengthening the U.S.-UAE partnership under Sheikh Mohammed's leadership, and will emphasize the Biden-Harris administration's intent to deepen bilateral ties across the fields of security, climate, space, technology, education, energy, and commerce.
The Vice President also recognizes the importance of U.S.-UAE cooperation to a secure, prosperous, and stable Middle East region, where the Biden-Harris administration aims to enhance the security of our friends and encourage further integration across borders and amongst countries of the region with shared security and economic interests.
Additional Background:

Economic: The UAE is a top regional trading partner for the United States, with over $23 billion in total bilateral trade in 2021. The UAE is the United States' single largest export market in the Middle East and North Africa region, and more than 1,000 U.S. firms operate in the country. The UAE is the top Arab investor in the United States, with close to $44.7 billion invested, supporting over 17,700 jobs, including in the renewables and semi-conductor sectors.


Security: The United States and the UAE are working collectively towards the common goal of a stable, secure, and prosperous Middle East. We are committed to continuing decades of U.S. partnership on security cooperation, and defense trade, joint exercises, training, and exchanges. We are taking a range of actions to support the UAE's strong defenses. This includes continuing to provide early warning intelligence and collaborating on air defense. The United States works with the UAE and other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council to increase cooperation on border security, maritime security, military preparedness, cybersecurity, and counterterrorism. The UAE has fought alongside the U.S. in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as being an active participant in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, and in operations against al-Qa'ida and their regional and global affiliates. The U.S. has $29.3 billion in active government-to-government sales cases with the UAE under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) system.


Energy: The U.S.-UAE Strategic Energy Dialogue (Dialogue) advances this important bilateral cooperation through structured and consistent engagement on energy issues and technologies. Recently the Dialogue has focused cooperation in on fossil fuels - including carbon capture utilization and storage, civil nuclear, energy efficiency, and renewable energy.


Climate: We congratulate the UAE as the first OPEC member and Arabic-speaking country to announce a net zero emission by 2050 objective and as host of COP28 and look forward to carrying forward the progress made at Glasgow and drive further climate action.


Space: The UAE Space Agency was among the first eight signatories of the Artemis Accords, reflecting a shared commitment to the safe and peaceful exploration and use of outer space, which Vice President Kamala Harris has championed as Chair of the National Space Council. We are proud to work with the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre on these scientific efforts and training the next round of Artemis generation astronauts.


Regional Integration: We welcome the warming relations between Israel and the UAE, including the opening of respective embassies, appointment of ambassadors, new direct flights, dozens of cultural exchanges, and burgeoning economic and business ties that have benefited the people of both countries and the region. Expanding the circle of peace between Israel and other countries -- in the Middle East and beyond -- brings prosperity and security to all. In a recent trilateral meeting with his Israeli and Emirati counterparts, Secretary Blinken launched two trilateral working groups: one on religious coexistence and the other on water and energy.


Afghanistan: The United States is grateful for the assistance of the UAE in hosting and ensuring the safe transit of thousands of people from Afghanistan, including more than 6,400 evacuees that have arrived in the United States via the UAE.

That's a wrap. It's been a pleasure serving as your pooler over the last 37 hours.
Some notes from the meeting with MBZ in Abu Dhabi Monday:
Pool entered the room where the delegation was meeting with MBZ after holding for about 20 mins in a circular marbled atrium just outside the doors.
A crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling in the hall where pool was staged. Pool could see floor length windows in the distance. Light bounced around the room.
Milling back and forth were at least a dozen men in traditional white robes. One woman dressed in a black abaya sat by the gold door outside the meeting room.
Inside, members of the U.S. presidential delegation were seated to Harris's right. UAE flags flanked Sheikh Mohamed on either side.
Seated to MBZ's left was King Philip of Belgium and a woman in a black abaya that pool did not recognize. A third seat to MBZ's left was empty. These attendees and the U.S. delegation did not wear masks.
Dressed in a light grey robe, MBZ perched on the right side of his chair leaning slightly towards Harris as he spoke and gesturing. Harris faced the Sheikh, hands clasped gently on her knees. Her expression was neutral while pool was in the room.
Two additional people dressed in white robes were staggered slightly behind MBZ, one of whom looked to be taking notes.
Secretary of State Blinken was seated to Harris's immediate right, followed by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Climate Envoy Kerry, VP NSA Philip Gordon, CIA Director Burns, and White House Coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa Brett McGurk.
Gordon and the rest of the delegation were separated by about an armchair's-worth of space. A small table separated Burns and McGurk. Your pooler's view was obstructed and she did not catch a clear view of the other officials seated further to Harris's right.
Kerry, Austin, Gordon and Burns looked towards the U.S. pool as we entered, before returning attention to MBZ and Harris.
A waiting New Zealand delegation was seated in a block of seats further to MBZ's left. All wore masks.
