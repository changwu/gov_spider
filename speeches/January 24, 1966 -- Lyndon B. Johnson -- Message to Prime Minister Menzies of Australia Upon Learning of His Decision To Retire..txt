IT IS with mixed feelings of regret and understanding that I have learned of your decision to retire from active public life. I say regret because I have deeply valued your friendship, your understanding, and your support on a range of world issues and, in particular, in connection with the struggle to defend the Republic of Vietnam against Communist aggression and subversion. I say understanding because after 19 years of distinguished service as Prime Minister of Australia and a lifetime spent in vigorously supporting and defending democratic ideals in your own country, in the British Commonwealth, and in the world, you have fully established your right to a period of rest and contemplation. I will miss your wisdom and sturdy good sense. With cordial best wishes,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
