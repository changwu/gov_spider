    The President today appointed Patricia S. Fleming to serve as interim National AIDS Policy Coordinator.
Ms. Fleming, currently special assistant to Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala, will serve until a permanent coordinator takes office.
"This administration has made significant strides in the fight against this terrible epidemic. We've increased our budgets for AIDS research, treatment, and prevention and have fought hard to provide health insurance for all Americans, regardless of preexisting conditions. Patsy Fleming will make sure we don't lose our momentum," said the President.
