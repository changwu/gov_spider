    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that Monroe County Sheriff Richard Roth is backing Mayor Giuliani for President. Today's announcement comes as Mayor Giuliani continues to campaign across Florida in advance of the state's Tuesday Republican primary.
"Rudy Giuliani's commitment to public safety is unmatched. During eight years as Mayor of New York City, he cut crime by more than half and made New York one of the safest large cities in America. There is no question that he will work to keep all Americans safe as President," said Sheriff Roth.
"With the support of leaders like Sheriff Roth, and the support of everyone who has joined the Giuliani campaign throughout the year, including over 6,000 volunteers, Rudy Giuliani is the candidate who will win Tuesday's primary," said Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum, Giuliani's Florida Chairman.
Reflecting the campaign's strong grassroots effort, Giuliani has the support of dozens of current and former local, county and state officials. Today's announcement follows the recent endorsement of former U.S. Representative Clay Shaw.
