    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I am notifying the Congress of my intent to reallocate funds previously transferred from the Emergency Response Fund (ERF).
To promote democracy and freedom, $7.7 million of ERF funds will be reallocated within the Broadcasting Board of Governors to support the operational costs of Arabic radio and television broadcasting to the Middle East.
The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
