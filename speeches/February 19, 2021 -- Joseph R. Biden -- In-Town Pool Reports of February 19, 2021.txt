"I'm going to be a president for all Americans."
On major disaster declaration for TX:"I'm going to sign that declaration once it's in front of me."

It does not appear to be snowing here at the moment. There is an inch of waterlogged snow covering the tarmac on much of the base but not near the plane.
Biden spoke to someone for two minutes or so before going up the steps leading onto the plane. It seemed like he turned and waved to the motorcade before going in but the view was partially obstructed by the wing.
