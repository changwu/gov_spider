    NEW YORK â€“ Bernie Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver on Thursday issued the following statement concerning the senator's presidential campaign's participation in a lawsuit against Arizona over voter access during last month's primary election in the state:
"The handling of the primary election in Arizona was a disgrace. People should not have to wait in line for five hours to vote. How many people were turned away? What happened in Arizona is part of a pattern of voter disenfranchisement by Republicans."
