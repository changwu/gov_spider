    I send greetings to those observing Kwanzaa.
Established in 1966, Kwanzaa is celebrated each year as an opportunity for African Americans to honor African traditions of family, community, and culture. During the seven days leading up to the New Year, millions of individuals reflect on the past and renew their commitment to the principles of Kwanzaaâ€”unity, self determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith.
As family and friends gather to celebrate Kwanzaa, our citizens are reminded of the many African Americans who have contributed their talent and strength to this great Nation. I commend those observing this holiday for taking pride in your rich heritage. May the coming year be filled with the blessings of health and happiness.
Laura and I send our best wishes for a joyous Kwanzaa celebration.
