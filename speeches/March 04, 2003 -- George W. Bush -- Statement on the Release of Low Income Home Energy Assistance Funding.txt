    I am pleased to announce today that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson is releasing $150 million in Low Income Home Energy Assistance funding. This additional funding will provide much needed help for families struggling with rising heating costs. This new money, combined with emergency funds released in January, will help keep many Americans warm during this cold winter.
