    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Young (R) AK)
The Administration has no objection to H.R. 4068, as ordered reported, which would make a number of technical corrections to various laws relating to Native Americans.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 4068 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB estimates that the bill would increase direct spending by $8 million in FY 1999 and $6 million in FY 2001 and reduce direct spending by $14 million in FY 2003.
