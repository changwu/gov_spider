    Today, Biden for President announced new Spanish language radio ads reinforcing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' long-time dedication and commitment to the Latino community. The ads highlight the failed leadership of the Trump Administration to help the Puerto Rican community, call out the false socialism claims and emphasize the power of the Latino vote.
"Billones de Promesas" Billions of Promises, is a Spanish radio ad set to air in Orlando and Tampa, Florida, and Pennsylvania. The radio ad focuses on Trump's recent announcement for aid to Puerto Rico in response to Hurricane Maria's devastation to the island—three years too late. The ad features a conversation between a son living in the United States and his mother in Puerto Rico.
"No Hay Más Que Hablar" There's Nothing More To Say, is a Spanish radio ad airing in Miami, Ft. Myers and West Palm Beach in Florida. This ad presents a conversation between father and daughter regarding their fears of socialism, and debunks the portrayal of Joe Biden as a radical leftist.
"Arrepentido" Regret, is a Spanish radio ad to air in states with higher Mexican-American populations—Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota, North Carolina, Nevada, Virginia and Wisconsin. The ad focuses on David, a voter who regrets his 2016 vote for Trump due to the current president's divisive rhetoric, family separation policies at the border, and his failed response to COVID-19. An older and empathetic listener provides thoughtful advice and encourages forgiveness.
