    Florida Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen made the following statement on Mitt Romney's remarks at NALEO:
"The Hispanic community has been especially hurt by President Obama's failed economic policies and hostility to job creators. With a stagnant economy and a jobless rate that has been above 8 percent for the longest time since the Great Depression, now more than ever Americans need a leader who values entrepreneurship â€“ one who will create an environment friendly to small businesses, and one who truly believes in the powerful promise of America. Governor Romney is that leader for us and he will stop this administration's attack on our country's job creators. I applaud Governor Romney's efforts to ensure our country enjoys economic growth and prosperity in its future."
