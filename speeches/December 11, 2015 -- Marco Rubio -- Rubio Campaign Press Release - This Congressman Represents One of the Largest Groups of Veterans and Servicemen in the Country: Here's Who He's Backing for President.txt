"I have evaluated the field of viable presidential candidates with three important qualities in mind: experience, a clear vision for our future, and a strong resolve to improve our nation's fiscal state. The challenges facing our country are great, and the American people are desperate for leadership. … I strongly believe Marco Rubio is that candidate."
