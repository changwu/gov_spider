    The bipartisan legislation introduced today by Representatives Johnson and Stark, and cosponsored by every member of the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee is an important step toward strengthening Medicare for today's seniors and for future retirees. The proposal reflects important elements of the President's framework for Medicare legislation. The President remains committed to working with Representatives Johnson and Stark, and other members of Congress to build on this bipartisan foundation for strengthening Medicare.
