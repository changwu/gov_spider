This year's Congressional Picnic theme will be Summer Solstice in celebration of the start of the summer season.

The menu will be traditional picnic fare prepared by White House Executive Chef Cristeta Comerford. Items include charred lemon chicken, grilled plank salmon, charcoal grilled rib eye steak, and Baja shrimp tacos. Other sides include house made kettle chips, fresh salad greens harvested by the National Park Service from the White House garden, and locally grown vegetables and fresh fruits from California, Georgia, and Washington State. Dessert includes White House Honey and a variety of homemade cookies, brownies, and pies topped with vanilla ice cream.
"My husband and I are looking forward to tomorrow's Congressional Picnic," said First lady Melania Trump. "It's an opportunity for elected officials to put aside differences and come together as a community."
Performances will include "The President's Own" United States Marine Band and The United States Navy Band Cruisers.
President Trump will make brief remarks.
