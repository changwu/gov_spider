    Ladies and gentlemen:
The Attorney General has just returned from a very important mission which he carried out for the President and our country. He made a report to the Acting Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, and the ranking members of the foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees of the Congress.
We are of the unanimous opinion that he carried out his assignment constructively and with real achievement. We commend him for his efforts, and I have asked him to come here and make a brief report to you on the results of his mission.
I will see you a little later at the Lehman ceremony.
