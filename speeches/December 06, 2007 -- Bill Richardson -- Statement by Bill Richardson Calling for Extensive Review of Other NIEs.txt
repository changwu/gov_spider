    SANTA FE, NM-- New Mexico Governor and Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Richardson today released the following statement:
"The 180 degree change of this most recent National Intelligence Estimate on Iran from the one released just two years ago raises significant concerns about the accuracy of the intelligence the administration uses to make important national security decisions.
"The 2005 NIE said Iran had a nuclear program. This recent NIE says they abandoned that program in 2003. In the meantime, the Bush Administration seemed to be taking us to the brink of a new war, once again over a non-existent threat.
"Congress should employ its oversight role and demand the intelligence community move quickly to carefully review past NIEs to ensure that the conclusions they draw are well supported by the facts.
"I have worked for many years with intelligence. I know that 100 percent accuracy is not an attainable goal. But I also know that out intelligence services do a good job when they have the resources they need and are not subjected to political pressures.
"This Administration has repeatedly based major policy decisions, including the decision to go to war in Iraq, on weak or politicized intelligence. Every time another U.S. soldier dies or is wounded in Iraq we are reminded of the consequences of what this means.
"Asking our intelligence community to review their work at this time would be appropriate and prudent.
"We have seen horrible failures in the past. We must take reasonable steps now to avoid similar failures in the future."
