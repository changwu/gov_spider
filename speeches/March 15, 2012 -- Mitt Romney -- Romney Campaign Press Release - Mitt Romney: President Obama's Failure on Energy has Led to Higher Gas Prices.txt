    "[President Obama] has not pursued policies that convince the world that America is going to become energy secure, energy independent. He held off drilling in the Gulf, he's held off drilling out of ANWR, he said no to the Keystone pipeline from Canada.... So the world believes that America's not going to have the energy we need, and we're going to have to continue sending hundreds of billions of dollars out of our economy going into other nations. We need a president to open up these things." â€” Mitt Romney

BILL HEMMER, FOX NEWS: "So gas prices, they're ridiculous, as you know."
MITT ROMNEY: "Yeah."
HEMMER: "Up more than 30 cents in the past month, and every day Americans are paying a price for this. Do you hold President Obama responsible?"
ROMNEY: "Absolutely. He has not pursued policies that convince the world that America is going to become energy secure, energy independent. He held off drilling in the Gulf, he's held off drilling out of ANWR, he said no to the Keystone pipeline from Canada. His regulatory agency, the EPA, has held off drilling in North Dakota, Texas, Oklahoma, even our natural gas resources which were going to convince people that we were going to use them for purposes of getting off of our dependence on oil, that he hasn't pursued aggressively either. So the world believes that America's not going to have the energy we need, and we're going to have to continue sending hundreds of billions of dollars out of our economy going into other nations. We need a president to open up these things."
