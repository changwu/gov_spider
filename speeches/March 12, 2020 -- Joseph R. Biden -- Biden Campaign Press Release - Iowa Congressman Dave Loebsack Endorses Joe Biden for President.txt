    Today, Iowa Congressman Dave Loebsack released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"Growing up in a working class family, I know firsthand the challenges many Iowans and Americans are facing as they try to make ends meet. Unfortunately, Donald Trump has ignored these concerns and instead prioritizes the interests of wealthy corporations. As president, he has actively worked to limit access to critical health care coverage, adopted a trade war that leaves farmers behind, and fights for tax cuts that benefit the top one percent. Our country needs a new direction and that's why I am proud to endorse Joe Biden for President.
"Vice President Biden will restore character to the White House and bring the experience necessary to deliver meaningful progress for the American people. Whether it's building on the Affordable Care Act through the creation of a public option, tackling climate change, taking on the NRA, or revitalizing rural communities, Vice President Biden won't just fight for middle class Americans â€“ he will get things done on their behalf. I am very proud to join Joe Biden in the fight for the soul of America."
With his endorsement, Vice President Biden has earned the support of all three Democratic members of Iowa's congressional delegation, including Congresswoman Cindy Axne, Congresswoman Abby Finkenauer, and now Congressman Dave Loebsack. Loebsack was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006 and today serves on Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Education and the Workforce.
Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 2,100 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals
