Script for "It Matters":
Voice Over: "When corruption ruled, he challenged it. When welfare failed, he changed it. When crime thrived, he fought it. When government broke, he fixed it. And when the world wavered. And history hesitated. He never did. Rudy Giuliani. Leadership. When it matters most."
Mayor Giuliani: "I'm Rudy Giuliani and I approve this message."
