In-Town Pool Report #1: Morning
It is muggy and wet and Monday. Good morning. I am your in-town print pool reporter.
The president is set to lunch with the vice president at 12:30pm. Other than the regular coronavirus task force briefing, scheduled for 5:00pm, there are no public events as of yet.
The briefing will be live streamed, and you already know the drill. I will pass along any color that isn't visible on screen. I will also do my best to send along reports of any driveway gaggles. And that is the view from campus for now, where reporters spread out and look a little like western bandits with their face masks and bandanas.
