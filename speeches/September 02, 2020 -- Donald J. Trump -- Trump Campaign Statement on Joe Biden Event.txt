    "What we didn't hear was Joe Biden demand that Nancy Pelosi pass the $105 billion the President has requested to help schools reopen safely. We also didn't hear him condemn Antifa or call the rioters in our cities what they are: left-wing criminals aligned with the most extreme elements of the Democrat Party. He did, however, manage to find time to blame a Trump supporter in Portland for his own murder at the hands of leftist thugs. Joe Biden has already been defined in the minds of Americans â€“ he is too weak to stand up to the leftist mob and he is a tool of the radicals in his party."
- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
