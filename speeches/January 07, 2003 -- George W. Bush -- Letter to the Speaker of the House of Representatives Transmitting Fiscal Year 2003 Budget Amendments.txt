    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed requests for Fiscal Year 2003 budget amendments for the Departments of Agriculture, Health and Human Services, the Interior, Labor, and the Treasury; the Corps of Engineers; as well as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Federal Trade Commission.
The details of these requests are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and observations.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
