    President Obama spoke by phone today with President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and separately with President Ernest Bai Koroma regarding the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. In his conversations with both leaders, the President underscored the commitment of the United States to work with Liberia, Sierra Leone, and other international partners to contain the outbreak and expressed his condolences for the lives lost. The leaders discussed ongoing mitigation measures, including those directed through the Monrovia-based U.S. Disaster Assistance Response Team and deployed personnel in both Liberia and Sierra Leone from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The President further noted that, while their participation was missed, he appreciated President Sirleaf and President Koroma's decisions to forgo last week's U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington, D.C. to tend to the outbreak.
