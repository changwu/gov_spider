    I am pleased and proud to join my fellow Americans across the nation and around the world in celebrating Independence Day.
When our Founders set their hands to the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and gave life to the United States of America, they took an enormous leap of faith. They placed a great trust not only in their fellow citizens, but also in all Americans who would follow in their footsteps. That trust has been passed from generation to generation, and it has been honored by millions of men and women whose hard work, sacrifice, generous spirit, and love of country have seen us safely through more than two centuries of great challenge and change.
As we come together once again to celebrate the birth of our great nation, we reflect on the remarkable achievements that have placed us in a position of unparalleled world leadership. For the peace and prosperity we enjoy today, we owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the great patriots who have come before us. As 21st century Americans, we are not only the beneficiaries of their courage and vision—we are also the stewards of their sacrifice.
It is up to us to preserve the freedom that so many brave Americans risked their lives to secure. It is up to us to realize our country's highest ideals of justice, equality, and human dignity. It is up to us to reject the forces of hatred that would seek to divide us and instead embrace our common humanity and the values, history, and heritage we share as Americans. Our nation's journey to form a more perfect union is far from over; but, strengthened by our Founders' vision and inspired by our children's dreams, we are sure to reach our destination.
On this Independence Day, as we celebrate the past, present, and future of America, Hillary joins me in sending best wishes to all for a wonderful Fourth of July.
BILL CLINTON
