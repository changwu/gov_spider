Gov. Easley: These are tough times in America and I think that Hillary is the one we can count on to get the job done.
She's going to turn the economy around, she's going bring new jobs, she's going to get some tax cuts for the middle class for a change.
She's going to make health care available to everybody in this country, and she's going to do everything she can to help every child reach their full potential.
She is so resilient, so determined.
She knows how to deliver.
She'll be a great president.
Hillary Clinton: I'm Hillary Clinton and I approved this message.
