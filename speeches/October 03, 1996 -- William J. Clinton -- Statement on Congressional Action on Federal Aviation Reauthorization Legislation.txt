    In passing the Federal Aviation Authorization Act today, Congress has responded to my request to act quickly on the recommendations of the Gore commission and approved an important piece of legislation that will improve the security of our airports and airlines.
Because of this legislation, criminal background checks can now be conducted on airport personnel, new explosives detection technology can be deployed, baggage will be checked more thoroughly, passenger profiling will be instituted, and families who lose a loved one in an accident will be able to get the help that they need. I congratulate the Congress and I thank the Vice President, as well as Secretary Pena and his team, for making this important legislation a reality which I look forward to signing into law.
