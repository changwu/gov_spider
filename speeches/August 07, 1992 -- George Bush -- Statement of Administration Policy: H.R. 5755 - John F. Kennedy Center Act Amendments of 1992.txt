    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Roe (D) NJ and Hammerschmidt (R) AR)
The Administration supports amending the John F. Kennedy Center Act, and has no objection to House passage of H.R. 5755. However, as the legislative process moves forward, the Administration will work with Congress to clarify the respective responsibilities of Federal agencies and the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees.
Particular concerns include:

Authority for the Board to develop and submit to Congress a "comprehensive building needs plan" without the approval or concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior. In negotiations with the Administration and Members of Congress, the Kennedy Center explicitly agreed that concurrence would be provided.
Authority for the Board to plan for capital projects that are not limited to the existing features of the Center. In negotiations with the Administration and Members of Congress, the Kennedy Center agreed that the new capital projects authorized would be limited to existing features.
Blurred accountability for the expenditure of Federal funds. The bill changes the method of financing Center capital projects from direct Federal funding to Federal reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Board, a non-Federal entity.
No requirement for the Board to consult with the Secretary of Education and others in the development of arts and education programs.
