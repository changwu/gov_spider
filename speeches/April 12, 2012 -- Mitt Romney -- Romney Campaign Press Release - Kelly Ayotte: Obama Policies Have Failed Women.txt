Highlights From The "The Obama Economy Isn't Working For Women" Press Conference Call:
SEN. KELLY AYOTTE: "I think it was very insulting for President Obama's adviser and DNC strategist Hilary Rosen to make the comments she made about Ann Romney yesterday, that she never worked a day in her life. In fact it's insulting that the President's adviser would dismiss the value of the important and the hard work women do in raising children. You know, Ann Romney chose to stay at home and I admire her for that and for raising five boys. And as she said herself, it's hard work, truly hard work raising children. She also, of course, volunteers her time for charities and she's someone who suffered from multiple sclerosis and is also a survivor of cancer. But at the end of the day, what this...As you look at where we are, women have faced massive job losses under this administration and the policies of this president have failed women voters and men too. I mean, these are issues that impact all Americans."
...
REP. MCMORRIS RODGERS: "Since President Obama and the Democrats can't run on the record, which includes the longest streak of high unemployment since the Great Depression, a record increase in the national debt, and near-record gas prices they're working desperately to change the subject. And that's why they've created this whole ‘war on women' campaign. It's really designed to distract women from the real issues....There's no ‘war on women' by the Republicans. What's really going on, it's a war on reality by the Democrats."
...
REP. CYNTHIA LUMMIS: "Unlike Barack Obama, Mitt Romney has the record and the experience to solve the problems facing our nation. He succeeded in the private sector and helped to rescue an Olympic Games. He balanced a budget in Massachusetts that was facing a $3 billion deficit, and he did it without raising taxes. He left the state with a $2 billion rainy-day fund and an unemployment rate of 4.7 percent. He'll bring that same experience and passion for reform to Washington, D.C. ... American women are tremendously concerned about our debt, our deficit, jobs and the economy. They want better lives for their children and their grandchildren, and we are piling a mountain of debt on our children and grandchildren when we refuse to reform entitlement programs in order to save them and when we refuse to cut spending in a manner that creates a soft landing for our economy and will spur job growth. The Obama policies have failed. In fact, they've made the economy worse, and they've made it worse particularly for women."
...
DEL. BARBARA COMSTOCK: "I have three grown children. I've been a working mom, an at-home mom, small businesswoman and from all my experiences, and I know all the women here talked about, all moms are working moms. There's no such thing as a mom who's not a working mom, so this was an unfortunate incident, but it highlights some of the division that we've been seeing from the Obama campaign because they don't want to talk about the fact that the Obama Economy isn't working for women, because it's not their number one priority."
...
PENNY NANCE: "The key to this really is the fact that the Obama administration really does not understand what is happening with American women, that we actually hold the purse strings for the American family. Statistically we tend to be the ones that pay the bills and we work very hard to live within our means, within a budget and I think this administration would do well to stop disrespecting stay-at-home moms and listen to them."
...
STEPHANIE NIELSON: "This is putting a terrible message out to the youth of America that's belittling women as wanting to be mothers or choosing to be mothers and I think that when the President of the United States doesn't value a mother our society is really, really in trouble. That's where it all starts, is at home with our fathers and mothers leading."
...
SABRINA SCHAEFFER: "All moms are working moms, and the Obama campaign should be absolutely appalled by these comments. The fact is, women like Rosen and many, many people in the Democratic Party view the choices that women like Ann Romney make as the greatest threat to feminism."
