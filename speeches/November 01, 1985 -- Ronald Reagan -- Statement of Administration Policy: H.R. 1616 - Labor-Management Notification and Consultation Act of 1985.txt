    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Ford (D) Michigan and 172 others)
The Administration strongly opposes enactment of H.R. 1616 and any other legislation which would restrict the ability of employers to adapt to changing market conditions by imposing rigid procedures on them prior to plant closings or other changes of operations resulting in layoffs to workers.
Moreover, the Secretary of Labor is establishing a Task Force to study the issues of economic adjustment and worker dislocation and to evaluate current programs at the local, State, and Federal levels as well as the experience of foreign nations.
The enactment of any legislation dealing with these issues prior to the completion of the Task Force's activities would be inadvisable.
