    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Reps, de la Garza (D) and Bustamente (D) TX)
The administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 2046 but will work in the Senate to:

— clarify that any agreements under Sec. 2 should embody the "polluter pays" principle of the Border Environment Agreement;
— eliminate the Sec. 5 authorization of appropriations which is unnecessary because an annual authorization vehicle, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, exists for the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) and there is adequate authority to pay for projects from the State of Texas' allocation under the clean Water Act; and
— clarify whether the IBWC is exempted from complying with certain Federal environmental statues.
