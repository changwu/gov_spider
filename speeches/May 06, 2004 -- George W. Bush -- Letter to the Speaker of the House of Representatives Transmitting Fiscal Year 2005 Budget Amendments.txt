    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2005 budget amendments for the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Education, Energy, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, the Interior, Labor, and the Treasury; the Corps of Engineers; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2004 language proposals for the Departments of Health and Human Services and the Treasury. Overall, the discretionary budget authority proposed in my FY 2005 Budget would not be increased by these requests.
This transmittal also contains FY 2005 budget amendments for the legislative branch. As a matter of comity, appropriations requests of the legislative branch are commonly transmitted without change.
The details of these proposals are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
