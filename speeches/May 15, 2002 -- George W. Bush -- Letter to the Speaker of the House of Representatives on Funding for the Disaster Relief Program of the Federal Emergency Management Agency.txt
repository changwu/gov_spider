    Dear Mr. Speaker:
In accordance with provisions of Public Law 107-73, the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002, I hereby request and make available $500 million for the Disaster Relief program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
These funds will allow FEMA to continue providing assistance to victims of disasters in several States, including victims of recent tornadoes in Maryland and storms and flooding in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia. These funds also would be available for ongoing response to prior disasters and to ensure that FEMA has resources on hand to provide timely response to future disasters.
I designate the $500 million made available today as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.
The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and observations.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
