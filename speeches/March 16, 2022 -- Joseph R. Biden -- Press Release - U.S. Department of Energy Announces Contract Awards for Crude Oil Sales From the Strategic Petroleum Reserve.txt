    President Biden Ordered Emergency Drawdown as Part of International Energy Agency Collective Action
WASHINGTON, D.C. â€“ Today, the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management announced that contracts have been awarded for ALL 30 million barrels put up for sale from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This fully-subscribed sale is part of a coordinated action with the 30 member countries of the International Energy Agency to collectively release an initial 60 million barrels of oil from strategic petroleum reserves. This effort reflects a common focus and willingness to address significant market and supply disruptions related to President Putin's war on Ukraine, as the Administration continues to take action to help lower energy prices for Americans.
