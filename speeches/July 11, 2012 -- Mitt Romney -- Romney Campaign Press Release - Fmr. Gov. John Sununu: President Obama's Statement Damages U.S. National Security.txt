    Former New Hampshire Governor John Sununu today made the following statement on President Obama's comments on Venezuela:
"After nearly four years of ignoring our friends in Latin America, it is no wonder that President Obama fails to understand the disruptive activities of Hugo Chavez's Venezuela. Working hand in glove with the Castro brothers, Chavez has been working to fund and to foment anti-American hatred across Latin America. He's formed partnerships with rogue states around the world, including Syria and Iran. He's welcomed Hezbollah operatives into our backyard. He's crushed democratic forces in his own country and encouraged narco-terrorists throughout the region. When President Obama says, as he did in a television interview on Monday, that Chavez has not had 'a serious national security impact on us,' he's dead wrong. Such a statement by an American president itself damages U.S. national security by emboldening one of the most anti-American actors on the international stage."
