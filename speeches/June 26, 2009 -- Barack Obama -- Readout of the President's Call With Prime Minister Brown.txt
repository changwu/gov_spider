    The President and Prime Minister Brown spoke earlier today as part of their ongoing consultations. The leaders focused on climate change, the global economic recovery, food security, Iran, and progress on Middle East peace. The President welcomed the Prime Minister's speech on climate today as making a contribution to the debate over climate change at this critical time. He looks forward to working with Prime Minister Brown and the other 15 leaders of the Major Economies Forum on Climate and Energy meeting he will chair in L'Aquila, Italy, next month on the margins of the G-8 Summit to give momentum to the Copenhagen negotiations.
