Congressman @PeteSessions of Texas is a true fighter and patriot. Highly respected in D.C. by all he always gets what his district and our country wants and needs. Strong on Crime Border Military Vets and 2nd Amendment. Pete has my Full and Total Endorsement. A great guy!Retweets: 12374Favorites: 53036

The Failing New York Times did something I have never seen done before. They used the concept of 'time value of money' in doing a very old boring and often told hit piece on me.
