    President Bush offers his sincere condolences to the people of Russia and to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church on the occasion of the passing of Patriarch Alexsey. Alexsey became Patriarch at a time when Russia was in transition and during his term in office spiritual faith in Russia experienced an astounding revival after years of repression under Communism. The President's heart is with the community of Russian believers as they continue to rebuild the rich spiritual traditions of Russia.
