    President Obama dropped by a meeting today between Vice President Biden and Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk of Ukraine. President Obama and Vice President Biden both expressed unwavering support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and underscored the U.S. commitment to maintaining sanctions on Russia until it fully implements its obligations under the Minsk agreements. The President and Vice President commended the Government of Ukraine for the steps it has taken to implement its obligations under the Minsk agreements, including the submission to Ukraine's parliament of draft constitutional amendments on decentralization. The President and Vice President also welcomed the Government of Ukraine's ambitious economic reform agenda, which was discussed extensively today at the U.S.-Ukraine Business Forum in Washington, as well as the government's strong stand against populist measures that could undermine Ukraine's financial stability. The leaders agreed on the importance of Ukraine passing additional reform measures, including in the energy sector, to fulfil its commitments to the IMF and other international financial institutions.
