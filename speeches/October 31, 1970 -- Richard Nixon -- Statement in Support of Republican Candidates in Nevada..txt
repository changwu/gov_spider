    TO MEET the challenges which face us in the 1970's, our Nation needs leaders like Bill Raggio and Ed Fike. As part of our team, they will help solve the problems of violence, crime, and drugs; help us beat inflation and complete a smooth transition to a peacetime economy; and help us bring a generation of peace to the world.
With Bill Raggio in the Senate, the voice of the people of Nevada will be heard and heeded in the Congress and the White House. His expert law enforcement experience will be an asset to the Senate, and his strong support of fiscal responsibility will help us beat inflation and curb the irresponsible Federal spending which feeds it.
I have known Ed Fike to be a man of honesty, integrity, and great ability throughout our years of friendship. He is a hard-working leader who has won the respect of people all across the Nation. He has worked his way up in the best American tradition, and as Governor he will provide creative, firm, and dependable leadership of which Nevada can be proud.
