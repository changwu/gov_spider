CAMILLA HERRON: "People in China identified Apple products being sold in certain stores. And following the investigation, it turned out these entire stores were counterfeit. Apple went in and investigated and the prevalence of the stores just show how epidemic this has become that a company like Apple who is focused on solving this problem still finds these surprises in the marketplace."
HERRON: "My name is Camilla Herron. I investigate people that manufacture, distribute and sell counterfeit products globally and I work with federal and state law enforcement. The experts say that almost 70% or more of the value of any company is in their intellectual property. It's not in their buildings, or their office space. It's in their intellectual property."

HERRON: "And once you put that at risk and it's gone, you don't get it back. And if you look at what China is doing they are subverting us on every level."

VIDEO TEXT: "Industries Are Being Robbed On The Floors Of Chinese Factories"


    "America's Most Innovative Industries Are Being Robbed Every Day On The Floors Of Chinese Factories." (Ted C. Fishman, "How To Stop Intellectual Property Theft In China," Inc. Magazine, 6/1/06)
  

HERRON: "I don't recall him ever calling the Chinese out on any of these issues. The public is not being made aware of the job losses. 750,000 a year to a million job losses. That's a huge issue in this country. Innovation leads to new products, new products lead to manufacturing, manufacturing leads to jobs in distribution. Even retail clerks stocking shelves. Everything. If we don't stop the hemorrhage of intellectual property in the next three to five years we will have reached a point of no return."
