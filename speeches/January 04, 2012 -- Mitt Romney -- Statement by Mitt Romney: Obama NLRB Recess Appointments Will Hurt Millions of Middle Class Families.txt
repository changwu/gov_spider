    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on President Obama's recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board:
"Just back from vacation, President Obama has wasted no time in returning to one of the top items on his agenda: doling out favors to his big labor political allies and giving them a dangerous level of power over businesses and workers.  His recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board give this unaccountable and out-of-control agency the authority to continue acting in ways that create uncertainty for businesses, drive up their costs, and discourage hiring or investment.  President Obama's preference for partisan politics over economic growth will only hurt the millions of middle class families across the country who lose out every time the union bosses win.  As president, my focus from day one will be on getting our economy turned around by pursuing policies that strengthen rather than stifle job creation."
