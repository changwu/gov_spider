"I served in Congress with John. He really is the only candidate who can defeat Hillary Clinton in the general election," said Senator Simpson. "He also has the right temperament and realistic leadership skills required to advance smart and bold reforms to reduce the nation's debt and deficit so that we can restore fiscal sanity in Washington. Further, he has a proven record of experience that is wholly unknown to Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. Today, I am extremely proud to endorse Governor Kasich and support his campaign for president."

Senator Simpson served in the United States Senate for 18 years. He was a co-chair of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, more commonly known as the Simpson-Bowles Commission.
"Few public servants have had the courage to stand up for real, necessary and bipartisan reforms to reduce our national debt and put our entitlement programs on a sustainable path â€” but Senator Simpson has and he's done it with zeal," said Governor Kasich. "I am thankful for his support as we work to bring fiscal responsibility to Washington to get our economy moving again. Senator Simpson, welcome to our team."
