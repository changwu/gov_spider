    With great pleasure we received the news of Alann Steen's release after nearly 5 years of unjust captivity in Lebanon. We join his friends and family in relief at his safe return.
We are grateful for the successful efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in this endeavor and for their contributions, thank also the Governments of Iran, Syria, and Lebanon.
The task is not completed, however. We remember Terry Anderson and the other hostages still held outside the process of law in the region. Once again, we call for their immediate and unconditional release, for a full accounting of those who have died in captivity, and for a return of their remains. They must be returned to their loved ones, and this tragic practice of hostage taking must cease.
