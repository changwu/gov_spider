PAUL RYAN: "And look at where we are right now: 23 million Americans struggling to find work.
You know, we had a discussion about how women are faring in this economy last night. Five-and-a-half million women are still struggling for work in this economy. A half-million women more are unemployed today than when President Obama was sworn in. Twenty-six million women are trapped in poverty today. That's the highest rate in 17 years. We need to get people back to work. We need to get this economy turned around. The American idea is there. It hasn't gone away. But we have the wrong people and the wrong policies in place, and if we clear the way and go forward with the proactive, pro-growth solutions in the agenda that Mitt Romney is talking about, we will get people back to work. We will get people out of poverty, back in the middle class, we'll get back onto reaching their vision of the American dream."
