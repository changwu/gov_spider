Subject: Implementation of the Anomalous Health Incidents Provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022
In accordance with section 6603(a)(1) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (Public Law 117-81) (FY22 NDAA), I hereby designate the Senior Director for Intelligence Programs for the National Security Council staff to serve as the Anomalous Health Incidents (AHI) Interagency Coordinator. Consistent with section 6603(b)(1)(A) of the FY22 NDAA, I ask that you take rapid action to designate an appropriate senior official to serve as your respective agency's AHI Agency Coordination Lead, who will work closely with the AHI Interagency Coordinator through the National Security Council-led policy process on AHI.
In accordance with section 6603(e) of the FY22 NDAA, I further direct that, no later than February 25, 2022, you issue, updated guidance to the elements of your workforce who are determined to be at risk of exposure to AHI. This guidance should be developed and issued in close coordination with the AHI Interagency Coordinator.
Swift implementation of the AHI provisions in the FY22 NDAA will serve as an important demonstration of my Administration's continued commitment to the workforce and to enhancing the United States Government's response to AHI incidents.
