    Today, I have signed into law H.R. 2259, the "Sam Farr and Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act of 2018" (the "Act").
One provision of the Act, section 203, would forbid the Director of the Peace Corps from opening, closing, reducing, or suspending a domestic or overseas Peace Corps office or country program "unless the Director has notified and consulted with the appropriate congressional committees at least 15 days in advance." I hope that both notice and consultation will be possible in every case, and I recognize the benefits of working with the Congress on these kinds of decisions. Nevertheless, a requirement to consult with the Congress in executive decision-making violates the separation of powers. My Administration will, accordingly, make appropriate efforts to notify the specified committees, as provided for by the Act, but will treat the consultation requirement as advisory and non-binding.
