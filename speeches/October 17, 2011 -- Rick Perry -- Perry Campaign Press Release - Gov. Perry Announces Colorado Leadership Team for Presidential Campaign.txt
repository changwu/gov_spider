    AUSTIN â€” Gov. Rick Perry today announced key members of his Colorado leadership team. U.S. Congressman Mike Coffman will serve as the state chair, with House Majority Leader Amy Stephens and State Rep. Larry Liston serving as state co-chairs. Rep. Liston will also serve as the Perry state network coordinator, overseeing grassroots outreach efforts in the state.
"I am proud to have Mike, Larry and Amy heading up our efforts in this important state," said Gov. Perry. "I look forward to bringing my vision to get America working again to Colorado with the help of this outstanding team."
"Gov. Perry's experience, ideas and proven record of job creation make him the candidate we need to get our nation working again," said Rep. Coffman. "I am looking forward to being a part of Gov. Perry's campaign team."
Congressman Coffman serves the 6th district of Colorado and sits on the U.S. House Small Business, Armed Services and Natural Resources committees. He previously served in the Colorado General Assembly as secretary of state and state treasurer.
Majority Leader Stephens has represented Colorado House District 20 since 2006 and previously served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1996 and 2004. A mere eight months after she was elected to the House, her colleagues appointed her Minority Caucus Chairman and she became the House Majority Leader after Republicans took the majority in 2010. She has a tremendous track record helping to elect GOP leaders across the state at all levels, including Gov. Bill Owens, 4th Judicial District Attorney John Newsome and County Commissioner Wayne Williams.
Rep. Liston has represented House District 16 since 2004 and previously served as vice chair of the Republican Party of Colorado from 2001-2003. He was county chairperson for Gov. Bill Owens' campaign in 1998 and local co-chair for President George W. Bush in 2000.
