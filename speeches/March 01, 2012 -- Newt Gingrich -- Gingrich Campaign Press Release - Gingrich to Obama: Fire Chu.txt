    
Cherokee, GA — Speaking at the opening of the Cherokee County Republican Party office on Thursday, Newt Gingrich called on President Obama to announce the firing of Energy Secretary Chu.
"Just this week, Obama's own Energy Secretary, Steven Chu, admitted what we all know is true — that the Obama Energy Department really isn't trying to lower gasoline prices."
"President Obama must announce today in his Nashua address that he is firing Secretary Chu and replacing him with a pro-American-energy appointment. If he doesn't, then the American people will know the president is still committed to his radical ideology, which wants to artificially raise the cost of energy."
"America has more energy production potential than any country on the planet. My plan will lower gasoline prices to $2.50 per gallon and create millions of new jobs. The President's anti-American-energy policies are raising the cost of gasoline, killing jobs, and wasting taxpayer money on boondoggles like Solyndra."
As reported by Politico, on Tuesday, February 28th, Energy Secretary Chu testified to Congress that the goal of the Obama Energy Department is not to lower gasoline prices but instead to "decrease our dependency on oil."
Gingrich has released a 30 minute energy address airing in key Super Tuesday states outlining a detailed energy productions strategy to return gasoline prices to $2.50 per gallon, create millions of new jobs and make America more secure.
