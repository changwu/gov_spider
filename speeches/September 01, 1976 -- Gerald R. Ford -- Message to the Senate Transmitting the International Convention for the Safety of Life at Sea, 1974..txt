    [Dated August 31, 1976. Released September 1, 1976]
To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to acceptance, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, done at London, November 1, 1974. The report of the Department of State is enclosed for the information of the Senate in connection with its consideration of the Convention.
I also transmit a copy of the Final Act of the International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, held at London from October 21 to November 1, 1974.
Numerous technical amendments to the 1960 Safety of Life at Sea Convention have been proposed and accepted by the depository organization since 1966. The United States has accepted all of these amendments. However, none of them have received the necessary explicit acceptance by the required two-thirds of the contracting governments to enter into force. The 1974 Convention incorporates all of the amendments and contains an improved procedure which will accelerate acceptance of future amendments to the technical regulations. I recommend that the Senate give prompt consideration to this Convention and consent to its acceptance.
