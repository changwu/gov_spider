    "Scripted" Clinton: "One day in May, operatives from a Washington-based super PAC gathered New Hampshire mayors, state representatives and local politicos at Saint Anselm College for a day of training. They rehearsed their personal tales of how they met Hillary Rodham Clinton and why they support her for president. ... They scripted their arguments for why the Democratic front-runner has been 'a lifetime champion of income opportunity.' And they polished their on-camera presentations in a series of mock interviews. The objective of the sessions: to nurture a seemingly grass-roots echo chamber of Clinton supporters reading from the same script across the communities that dot New Hampshire, a critical state that holds the nation's first presidential primary." - The Washington Post, 7/8/15
"Unscripted" Christie: "More than anyone else, Chris Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, has made himself available for unscripted questions from the public. Last Wednesday's town hall meeting in Ashland — his 12th in New Hampshire since January — was no different, providing a microcosm of what is on the minds of voters. 'Not a lot of rules here,' Christie told a standing-room-only crowd at the American Legion post. 'You raise your hands, and I'll call on you.' And one after another, for more than an hour, Christie did just that, answering about a dozen questions." - The Boston Globe, 7/8/15
