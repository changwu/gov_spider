    I send greetings to those observing Passover, beginning at sundown on April 23.
This celebration marks the historic exodus of the Israelites from Pharaoh's oppression more than 3,000 years ago. During Passover, Jews around the world gather with family and friends to share the story of God's deliverance of the Israelites from slavery to freedom. Through songs and prayers, they remember the blessings and mercy of a just and loving God. By passing this story from generation to generation, they teach the triumph of faith over tyranny and celebrate God's promise of freedom.
The lesson of this story is timeless and reminds us that even in the face of struggle, hope endures. As we work to bring hope to the oppressed, we recall the words of the Psalmist, which are read at the Seder meal: "This is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it."
Laura and I send our best wishes for a joyous Passover.
