    In recent days the President has urged the House of Representatives to vote in favor of the Senate-passed bill to assist the Nicaraguan freedom fighters. But he also expressed his dismay that a backdoor parliamentary maneuver—attaching our bill to a huge and wasteful pork-barrel appropriations bill—would prevent the necessary aid from ever reaching the freedom fighters. This is, nevertheless, just what the House Democratic leadership chose to do. But today, 177 Republican Members of the House served notice together that they would not abide by this unfair tactic. The President fully understands the reasons for this strategy by the House Republicans and hopes that the House will act without having to overcome further obstacles. The President continues to believe that this is an urgent measure vital to our national security and calls on the House to act as soon as possible.
