TRANSCRIPT:
TIM SCOTT: Playing football taught me that it's good to fight, but it's better to win.
But in Joe Biden's America, everybody gets a participation trophy, and everybody is a victim.
The radical Left is indoctrinating our children. Teaching CRT instead of ABC, punishing excellence by eliminating honors classes, and promoting a transgender ideology that's ruining women's sports.
I'm Tim Scott, and I approve this message because, as president, I'll fight back, and I'll win.
