Marco's right — Hillary Clinton has disqualified herself from the Presidency.

She wouldn't just be a disaster. Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being Commander-in-Chief of the United States. Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be Commander-in-Chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi cannot be President of the United States.
Marco Rubio: "Hillary Clinton is disqualified" from being president.

Marco has consistently made the case that Hillary is unfit to serve as President. That's why she's afraid of facing Marco in November.
