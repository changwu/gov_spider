    The President announced his intention today to nominate Linda Tsao Yang to be Executive Director of the Asian Development Bank and Robert Gelbard to be the Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics Matters.
"As I return from my successful trip to Asia, I am pleased to make these two significant foreign policy nominations," said the President. "Linda Tsao Yang will bring impressive skills in capital development and a strong knowledge of Asia's economy to her post at the Asian Development Bank. Robert Gelbard has the strength, skill, and knowledge to make a real difference in fighting the international drug trade. I am proud of both of these choices."
