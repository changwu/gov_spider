My dear Mr. Clark:
I am deeply interested to learn of the formation of The National Economy League. There is great need for a nation-wide and nonpartisan organization designed to give persistent attention to keeping down governmental expenditures. The subject is too complicated to be dealt with by sporadic groups in temporary emergencies. The pressures upon governments to spend more are ceaseless, and no intermittent protests will stem the tide. Swarms of lobbies organize behind every form of expenditure and no organized group ever defends members of the Congress who withstand their pressures. Ceaseless vigilance alone can cope with them. Every branch of government activity should be scrutinized, and of State and city governments as well as Federal. I trust that your organization will not confine its useful labors to any narrower range, for the problem is all of one piece and should be so dealt with.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Grenville Clark, Chairman, Organization Committee, The National Economy League, New York City]
