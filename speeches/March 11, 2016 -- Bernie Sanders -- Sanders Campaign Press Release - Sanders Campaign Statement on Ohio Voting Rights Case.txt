    TOLEDO, Ohio â€“ Brad Deutsch, attorney for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign, issued the following statement after Franklin County Common Pleas Court Judge Richard Frye on Friday afternoon ruled that Secretary of State Jon Husted had "abused his discretion" when he issued a directive saying 17-year-olds could not cast a ballot in the presidential race:
"This is a huge victory for 17-year-olds across Ohio. Their votes for presidential nominees will now count when they vote on either Tuesday or over the weekend in early voting."
"The judge ruled, as a matter of law, that 17-year-olds otherwise qualified to vote (i.e., who will be 18 before the General in November) are entitled to have their choices for presidential nominees counted in the March 15, 2016 primary election."
"The judge further admonished the Secretary of State for abusing his discretion by prohibiting 17-year-olds from voting for presidential candidates and not only directed the Secretary to instruct poll worker to allow 17-year-olds to vote but also instructed them to make a reasonable effort to attempt to determine and record choices that have already been made by any 17-year-old who already voted in early voting."
