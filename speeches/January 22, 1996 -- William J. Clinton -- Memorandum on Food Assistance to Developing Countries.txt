    Presidential Determination No. 96-9
Memorandum for the Secretary of Agriculture
Subject: Presidential Determination on Food Security Wheat Reserve Release
By virtue of the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the Food Security Wheat Reserve Act of 1980 (the "Act") (7 U.S.C. 1736f-1) and section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code, I hereby delegate to the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to release up to 1,500,000 metric tons of wheat from the reserve established under the Act (the "reserve"). Wheat released from the reserve will be used to provide, on a sale or donation basis, emergency food assistance to developing countries during fiscal year 1996 under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (7 U.S.C. 1691, 1701 et seq.) to the extent that the Secretary of Agriculture determines that the domestic supply of wheat is so limited that quantities of wheat could not otherwise be made available for disposition consistent with the criteria set forth in the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, except for urgent humanitarian purposes.
Nothing in the delegation should be interpreted as affecting the coordination requirements of Executive Order 12752.
You are authorized and directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
William J. Clinton
