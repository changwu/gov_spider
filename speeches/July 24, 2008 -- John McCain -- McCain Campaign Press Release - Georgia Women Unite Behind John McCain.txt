    TALLAHASSEE, FL -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced the leadership of Georgia Women for McCain with events in Atlanta, Macon, Columbus and Savannah.
In Atlanta, Georgia Women for McCain held a town hall event with McCain's senior economic advisor, Carly Fiorina.
"Under the leadership of Georgia's Republican Party, Georgian women are forming a strong coalition for leadership in the political process," said Carly Fiorina, RNC Victory 2008 Chair. "The launch of Georgia Women for McCain is about getting Senator McCain elected, but it is also about empowering women to participate in the political process and having their voices heard. Senator McCain understands that all issues are women's issues, including access to health care, energy independence, and economic growth."
Georgia Women for McCain State Chair Suzi Voyles added, "To have Carly Fiorina here to help us launch Georgia Women for McCain has been absolutely exhilarating! She rallied our enthusiasm around McCain and it will spread through the grassroots to his victory in November. John McCain's broad appeal will continue to expand as the country sees that he is the only candidate uniquely validated by his record to lead the United States of America. Senator McCain's vast experience, sound judgment and strong character make him the only truly qualified candidate with whom women (and men) can trust our lives, our families, our jobs and our future."
