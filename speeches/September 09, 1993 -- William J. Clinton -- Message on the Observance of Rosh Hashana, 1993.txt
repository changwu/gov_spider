    Rosh Hashana is a time of reflection and hope—thoughtful reflection on the year just past and hope for a good year to come.
The days between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur are the most solemn of the Hebrew calendar. But in the midst of heartfelt repentance and prayer, it is the promise of life—the rich possibility of realizing our most compelling dreams—that inspires the soul and lifts the spirit.
The ancient customs that are handed down to each new generation in this season are reminders of life's enduring sweetness and its perpetual renewal. The Jewish people celebrate Rosh Hashana above all as a time to rejoice in God for giving us life, for sustaining us, and for again enabling us to reach this season.
May this holiday season be filled with good health and happiness for you and your families, and may the year ahead be one of peace for the people of the United States, Israel, and all the world.
Best wishes for a wonderful New Year.
