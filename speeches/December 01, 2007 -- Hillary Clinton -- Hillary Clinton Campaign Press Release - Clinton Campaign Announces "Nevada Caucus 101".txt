    Special Meetings, Website to Help Educate Nevadans About Caucus Procedures and Format
The Clinton Campaign today introduced "Nevada Caucus 101", a program designed to help educate and encourage potential caucus-goers to participate in Nevada's presidential caucus on January 19th. The program integrates both online tools and neighborhood meetings aimed at demystifying the caucus process and reinforcing that caucusing is both easy to do, and a great opportunity to get involved in the democratic process.
At the center of this effort is a series of "Nevada Caucus 101" meetings, which will be offered in neighborhoods around the state in the coming weeks. The meetings are designed to help Nevadans understand the format and procedure of January's caucus, emphasizing the ease of participation. More than 30 Nevada Caucus 101 sessions are scheduled for this week alone. All potential caucus-goers are welcome to attend these sessions.
The campaign also launched a new website: nevadacaucus101.com , where Nevadans can find information about the caucus â€“ and caucusing for Hillary, get answers to their questions, and find out about meetings in their area. Additional features will be added to the website in the run-up to January's caucus.
"Nevada's early caucus is an outstanding opportunity for Silver State residents to have a strong voice in the presidential nomination process," said Clinton Nevada Chair Rory Reid. "With less than 60 days to go, we want to ensure that Nevadans know there's no mystery or special qualification needed to participate in this historic event - it's as simple as arriving on time, standing with fellow Clinton supporters, and being counted.
"We are proud of the support Senator Clinton has received across the state and are working hard to build on that support every day. The 'Nevada Caucus 101' program provides a great set of resources for potential caucus goers to learn about Hillary and how to show their support at the caucus on January 19th."
