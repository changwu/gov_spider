    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Hyde (R) Illinois and Conyers (D) Michigan)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3303, which would authorize appropriations for the Department of Justice for FYs 1999-2001. The President's Budget and the authorizations in H.R. 3303 for FY 1999 support Administration priorities such as efforts to fight juvenile crime, launch a multi-agency initiative to reduce violent crime on Indian lands, continue to investigate and prosecute cyber-criminals, and combat drug use, particularly among young people.
