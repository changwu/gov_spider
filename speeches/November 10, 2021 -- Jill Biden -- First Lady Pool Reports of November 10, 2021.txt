FLOTUS pool report #4 — Joining Forces and Hidden Helpers fact sheet 
Flagging this fact sheet on today's announcement that FLOTUS' office just distributed…
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASENovember 10, 2021
FACT SHEET: Joining Forces and Hidden Helpers Coalition Pledge Support to Military and Veteran Children in Caregiving Families
In April 2021, Joining Forces partnered with the Elizabeth Dole Foundation and Wounded Warrior Project® to launch Hidden Helpers, a new initiative designed to create supportive programming for and bring awareness to the 2.3 million children of wounded, ill or injured service members or veterans.
On November 10, 2021, First Lady Jill Biden, Senator Elizabeth Dole, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough, and Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, alongside the Hidden Helpers Coalition of more than 50 public and private sector organizations, will announce a series of commitments to support children in military or veteran caregiving families and enhance the support services available to them.
Nearly 40 unique commitments for new and expanded resources, programs, and financial pledges mark a significant and unprecedented leap forward in how America supports its more than 2.3 million military-connected caregiver children and youth.
These commitments will support the gaps in support for these children identified by a new report, published today by Mathematica Research and commissioned by the Elizabeth Dole Foundation: Hidden Helpers at the Frontlines of Caregiving: Supporting the Healthy Development of Children from Military and Veteran Caregiving Homes. The Hidden Helpers Coalition's groundbreaking efforts to address the needs highlighted by the study serves as a call to action for all sectors to expand and build support for children in military caregiving homes.
Key Findings:

There are approximately 2.3 million children under the age 18 living with a disabled veteran. This is the first-ever evidence-based quantification of Hidden Helpers.
Attention to children's needs by their parents is often crowded out by caregiving needs.
Military and veteran families experiencing high levels of disruption because of injury were more likely to report high levels of child distress; this distress can severely impact the emotional and psychological development of children.
Hidden Helpers were more likely to: experience isolation and have fewer opportunities to interact with peers; have difficulties expressing emotion and learning in school; and have more health problems such as high levels of stress, burnout, and fatigue.
Children from military caregiving homes are more likely than children in non-caregiving homes to have high levels of anxiety and depression.

Commitments to Hidden Helpers:
Biden-Harris Administration

Through the Joining Forces Interagency Policy Committee, the White House has convened a Children in Caregiving Families cross-agency working group to explore existing data and programs. The working group will produce a report outlining plans for future research and identifying areas of collaboration between agencies to better support military and veteran children in caregiving homes.
The Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will convene an exploratory meeting to focus on transition efforts, specifically focused on military and veteran families and children to identify ways the Departments can work together to better support families in transition.
Working collaboratively, VA and the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services, along with stakeholders, will develop a toolkit for educators at all levels to help them better understand and support children who live in veteran households, and specifically, veteran caregiving households.
DoD has committed to train all non-medical counselors within the Military OneSource and Military Family Life Counselor programs on the needs of children and caregivers in military caregiving families.
In 2022, DoD's Office of Military Community and Family Policy will work with the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences to better understand where and how military children are accessing mental health care.
VA will implement a Family Coordinator Program, with social workers linking veterans with support for their spouses and/or children. The Family Coordinator will be knowledgeable about resources in the local community as well as the federal government to support veterans and their families.
VA's Elizabeth Dole Center of Excellence for Veteran and Caregiver Research is collecting qualitative data on the lived experiences of parents and youth who live in veteran caregiving households. This data will be used to inform the role of the new Family Coordinators.
The National Endowment for the Arts' Creative Forces initiative seeks to advance health, well-being, and quality of life for military and veteran populations, including families and caregivers. The initiative includes creative arts therapies at clinical sites and through telehealth, as well as resilience-building efforts through the new Creative Forces Community Engagement Grant program launched in 2021.

Financial Support

Wounded Warrior Project, co-chair of the Hidden Helpers Coalition, has pledged the largest investment in creating Hidden Helpers programming, with an outstanding commitment of $1.5M, that will directly align with the research findings and sustain a new culture of support for military children and youth nationwide.
The USAA Foundation, Inc., will commit more than $1.4 million in 2022 to support military caregivers and military children through alliances with key nonprofit partners;
Bob & Dolores Hope Foundation will commit $500,000 to the Elizabeth Dole Foundation's caregiver emergency financial relief fund to support military and veteran families in 2022.
The Bob Woodruff Foundation will commit to new funding opportunities in 2022 and work with the Coalition to improve impact evaluation efforts for programs serving Hidden Helpers.
Cerner will dedicate funding to making health care environments more knowledgeable and responsive to the experiences of Hidden Helpers.

 Education and Training Materials

Sesame Workshop will work with the Elizabeth Dole Foundation on new messages around military caregiving to share through its featured characters. Additionally, they will provide new online workshops about military caregiver kids for educators, health care professionals, and other relevant practitioners. Sesame Workshop joins other Coalition members in creating educational materials and experiences for and about Hidden Helpers.
Military Child Education Coalition (MCEC®) will lead an effort with educators nationwide by developing and curating evidence-informed content for military students in a caregiver role. MCEC will also develop a new student-to-student track focused on Hidden Helpers, and a new focused track on the needs of caregiving children at their MCEC Global Summit in July 2022.
PsychArmor will work with the Coalition to support educational development and training opportunities for educators and health care professionals on how to best care for Hidden Helpers.

 Health Care Commitments

The Elizabeth Dole Foundation will build on its existing Campaign for Inclusive Care to launch a new clinical transformation effort aimed at making health care environments more responsive to the needs of caregiving families, including children and youth. With the leadership of one of the nation's largest pediatric health systems, Nemours Children's Health, and the generous financial contribution of TriWest Healthcare Alliance, the Elizabeth Dole Foundation, together with Humana Military, Magellan Federal, and Cohen Veterans Network, will engage our nation's health care providers to create a new national model of support for Hidden Helpers within medical institutions. Together these commitments will ensure that the physicians, nurses, and mental health and allied health professionals better understand and address the unique challenges military children face at every stage of their development.
CareLinx, a Sharecare company, commits to extending their contribution and support to the Elizabeth Dole Foundation and VA's Respite Relief Program in 2022. The program has already supported more than 1,600 families since its launch in 2020 and allowed for military and veteran caregivers to care for their children and better manage their households.

 New Programming

Several number of Coalition members have also committed to an unprecedented number of new programs that will be launched to support Hidden Helpers with peer-support opportunities, mental health resources, and financial support over the next year. These include:

The American Red Cross will launch a new resiliency workshop for Hidden Helpers led by licensed mental health professionals. This workshop will provide an opportunity for participants to discuss challenges and concerns, and to develop and learn the tools to build upon their natural resilience.

FLOTUS pool report #6 — FLOTUS excerpts 
WH passing along excerpts of FLOTUS' prepared remarks
**EXCERPTS**Remarks as Prepared for DeliveryFirst Lady Jill BidenJoining Forces & Hidden Helpers Coalition Honor Children inMilitary & Veteran Caregiving FamiliesThe White HouseNovember 10, 2021
***In 2009, with two wars raging, I visited Walter Reed Hospital whenever I could. I would sit near the beds of the wounded warriors, usually with a spouse close by, and listen to their stories of courage and sacrifice. Over time, I built relationships with those families. And my heart went out to the spouses who cared for them—so often young moms, bouncing babies on their hips.
Back then, I marveled at how they seemed to carry their families on will and grit alone, seamlessly moving between feeding an infant and making complex decisions on their husband's treatment.
But today, at my very first in-person White House East Room event, I'm thinking about the children in those rooms.
I think about how they have grown up like Gabby and Ava, helping their dad cope with an injury that they can't see.
Like Sylvia's daughter, Zianny, who helps her dad keep track of his medications and doctor appointments.
Like Noah, who learned how to get his dad through a severe seizure if his mom wasn't home.
Like Kris, who worried so deeply about his father's wellbeing that he began to experience similar trauma.
Or like Mason, who became the family entertainer—always ready with a joke or story, to put a smile on his parents' faces when things seem hopeless.
The six brave kids here in our front row represent more than 2 million "hidden helpers" across the country, who are growing up in the shadow of 20 years of war.
Some are old enough to be going to college or pursuing careers—and some are young enough that you still don't understand what makes your family unique. But all of you are serving and sacrificing in your own way.
And it's time that we, as a nation, recognize you and commit to giving you the support you deserve.
Because from a young age, hidden helpers learn the cost of our wars up close.You see how difficult the road to recovery can be. You know the reality of changing bandages or long stays in hospital rooms. You get tired of having to be brave. And there's no way to stop you from feeling sad sometimes.
No, we can't shield our caregiving kids from the reality of war or its aftermath, but we can recognize that the costs last long after our troops come home—and that injuries can be felt throughout generations.
We can celebrate caregiver kids' strength and resilience.
We can—and we must—give our military and veteran caregiving families everything they need to care for their wounded warrior with compassion, dignity, and love.
We must bring hidden helpers' service out of the shadows—let their light shine—and give them the support they need to thrive.
That's why I am so grateful for the groundbreaking study that the Elizabeth Dole Foundation is releasing today on the experiences and needs of caregiving children across the country.
Senator Dole, for seven years, it has been an honor to stand with you, and now to join the Elizabeth Dole Foundation as a member of the Hidden Helpers Coalition.
Thanks to your work and the commitment of 60 public and private organizations like the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregivers, Sesame Street, MCEC, and PsychArmor, we have a powerful coalition ready to step up.
Through Joining Forces—my White House initiative that supports our military and veteran families, caregivers and survivors—we launched the first ever interagency working group focused on the needs of children in caregiving homes.
And the US Department of Veterans Affairs has committed to connecting caregiving families to resources in their communities.
Supporting our caregivers is critical to our national security. Our troops and their families need to know that if they ever face injuries, illnesses, or wounds, we will have your back.
Gabby and Ava, Zianny and Noah, Kris and Mason, today is all about you.
We're here to celebrate you. Your bravery. Your kindness. Your compassion and hard work.
We're here to thank you for everything you do to help out at home—all the extra chores you take on or the times you watch your brothers and sisters. We know you need a break sometimes—and that you need to be around kids and teachers who understand what you're going through, without needing it explained.
We're here to honor the sacrifices you've made—the time you've missed with friends or moments you feel lonely because your family is different.
And, most of all, we're here to tell you that you aren't "hidden" any more.
You're not alone. Don't forget that. The President and I see you. The Secretaries, Senator Dole, your military, and all of our partners see you. And we see the millions of kids out there just like you.
But not only do we see you, we stand with you. And we are going to work to live up to the example of courage and duty that you set every day.
Thank you and God bless your families.

FLOTUS pool report #7 — event ends 
… at 12:30pm. On her exit from East Room, FLOTUS responded to a question Kyle Mazza (UNF NEWS) about what she thought about the Hidden Helpers' individual stories… "It was beautiful. Heartwarming, wasn't it?," FLOTUS answered.
Another quick note (h/t Daily Mail's Emily Goodin), but it would appear that FLOTUS' dress is from Brandon Maxwell:https://modesens.com/product/brandon-maxwell-long-dresses-green-27940858/
