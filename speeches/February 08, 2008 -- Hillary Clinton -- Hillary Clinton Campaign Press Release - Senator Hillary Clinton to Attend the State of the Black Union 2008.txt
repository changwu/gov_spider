    The Hillary Clinton campaign today announced Hillary will attend this year's State of the Black Union, a symposium hosted each year by Tavis Smiley Presents.
"I care passionately about delivering solutions to the big issues we face in this country," said Senator Clinton. "After 35 years of working on issues like education, health care, and racial equality, I am ready to continue the dialogue with symposium participants and to further outline my platform to move this country forward," she concluded.
State of the Black Union 2008: Reclaiming Our Democracy, Deciding Our Future brings together a diverse group of participants including entertainers, political and community leaders who will discuss the state of the Black community and seek to educate, enlighten and empower America.
Tavis Smiley, oversaw the collaboration of The Covenant with Black America. In 2007, Smiley moderated and executive produced the Democratic and Republican All-American Presidential Forums on PBS. This marked the first time in history that a panel exclusively comprised of journalists of color was represented in primetime television conducting a presidential debate.
Senator Clinton is the only Democratic presidential hopeful scheduled for this year's event which will be held on February 23, 2008, in New Orleans, Louisiana.
