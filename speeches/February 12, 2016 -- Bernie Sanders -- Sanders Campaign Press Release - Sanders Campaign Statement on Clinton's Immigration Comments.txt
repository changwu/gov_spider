    LAS VEGAS â€” Bernie Sanders' National Latino Outreach Director Arturo Carmona on Friday issued the following statement on Secretary Hillary Clinton's comments on unaccompanied minors at last night's Democratic debate:
"Secretary Clinton is wrong. We should never put children back into harm's way to 'send a message' to anyone. That's why Sen. Sanders has put forward a serious immigration plan that focuses on protecting kids and keeping families together. It is time for Secretary Clinton to do the same.
"Sen. Sanders believes we must end inhumane deportations and strongly opposes the summary expulsion of Central American immigrant children. He will expand access to health care for aspiring Americans and will strengthen the rights of immigrant workers. He's the best choice for Democrats who believe our immigration policies must put families first."
