    To the heads of all executive departments and agencies:
I am sending you a copy of a letter I have addressed today to the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission, together with a copy of a report on Federal employee security programs which has been prepared by the Interdepartmental Committee on Internal Security.
On the recommendation of the Interdepartmental Committee and other interested Government agencies, I have requested the Civil Service Commission to prepare a plan for a single general program covering eligibility for employment in the Federal service, whether on grounds of loyalty, security, or suitability. To help the Commission in preparing this plan, all Executive departments and agencies are authorized and directed to cooperate fully with the Commission and to furnish it with such personnel and other assistance as it may require.
Each department and agency having an employee security program should give careful study to the report of the Interdepartmental Committee and should reexamine its own program in the light of that report with a view to making sure that adequate procedural safeguards are provided.
