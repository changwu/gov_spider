    Pella, IA- Newt Gingrich released the following statement condemning the Obama Administration's request for an injunction against South Carolina to block their immigration law:
After years of failure on the part of the federal government to achieve border security, it is an outrage that the Obama Administration would seek to block South Carolina and other states who choose to pick up the slack.
If the Obama Administration put as much energy and resources into controlling the border as it does into attacking our own states, we would have 100% border security by now. The fact that there are just as many Department of Homeland Security bureaucrats in Washington, DC as there are border patrol agents at our southern border demonstrates how unserious the Administration is about addressing these problems.
My Administration will remove every possible regulation and barrier to ensure that we have 100% border security by January 1, 2014.
