    On behalf of the United States, the First Lady and I send our greetings to the people of Australia and to all those gathered to commemorate the 77th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea. More than three-quarters of a century ago, American and Australian naval and air forces fought together to protect our shared values of freedom and democracy. The Battle of the Coral Sea demonstrated the strong relationship between the United States and Australia, which has continued to promote peace and prosperity around the world for more than a century. On this day, we remember the heroic and brave defenders who gave their lives for our freedom. Our nations and the world will be forever grateful for their sacrifice.
