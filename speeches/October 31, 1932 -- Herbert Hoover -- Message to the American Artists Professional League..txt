My dear Mr. Reid:
The sittings given by me to portrait artists during the last three years have been granted at the request of various organizations and groups who wished to have a portrait of the President. In each case, these groups have selected the artists by whom they themselves wished to have the portraits executed. There have been no portraits made as yet on my own order for my own use. I appreciate your friendly interest.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
