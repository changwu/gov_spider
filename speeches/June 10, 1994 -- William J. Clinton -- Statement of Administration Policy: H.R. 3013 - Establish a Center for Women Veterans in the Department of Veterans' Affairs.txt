    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 6/13/94)(House)(Rep. Waters (D) CA and 38 others)
A priority of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is to place a greater emphasis on the care, support, and benefits women veterans have earned and to bring about a greater awareness of their contributions to this country's defense. As a result, the VA established a Women Veterans Program Office in February 1994, devoted to developing programs to improve services to women veterans.
Because of VA's actions, the Administration believes that the requirement in H.R. 3013 to establish a new Center for Women Veterans in VA is now unnecessary. Nevertheless, the Administration would not object to House passage of the bill. However, it will work with the Senate to delete the following objectionable provisions contained in H.R. 3013:

—    A requirement that the Director of the new Center be a noncareer appointee to serve for a six-year term. This provision restricts the Secretary's managerial discretion.
—    A mandate that the new Center conduct certain types of research on the needs of women veterans. This requirement unnecessarily duplicates current responsibilities of other elements of the VA.
—    A requirement that the Secretary of VA report to Congress on the adequacy of resources proposed by the President in his annual budget for the new Center. This is an inappropriate intrusion into the decision-making process of the Executive branch.
