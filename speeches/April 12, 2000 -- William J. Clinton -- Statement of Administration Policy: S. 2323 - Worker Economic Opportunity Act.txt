    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Senator McConnell (R) KY and 25 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports prompt passage of S. 2323, which would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to exclude certain employer provided stock options, stock appreciation rights, and bonafide stock purchases from the calculation of covered employees' overtime pay. In today's tight labor market, many employers use stock option programs as an important tool to attract and retain good workers. The Administration supports such innovative efforts to reward workers. S. 2323 would provide employers with needed flexibility to reward their workers in a global economy without weakening the vital protections provided by the FLSA for American workers.
