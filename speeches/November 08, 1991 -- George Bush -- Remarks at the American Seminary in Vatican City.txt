    Thank you very much. I must say you guys know how to make somebody feel at home. May I say what an honor it has been for me to have all this time with His Holiness. We had a -- I shouldn't talk about what we talk about, but we had a major tour d'horizon, touching on all the trouble spots, and I had an opportunity to express my profound gratitude to the Holy Father for the spiritual and moral leadership, his commitment to peace, and the message that he sends across the world to all of these countries. It's a message of hope, and it is indeed a message of peace.
So, it was a privilege for me as President of the United States to have this time with the Holy Father. And may I express, Your Holiness, our gratitude from Barbara and me, from Jim and Susan Baker, and from this enormous traveling squad that we had inside. [Laughter] I believe the Holy Father was wondering if anybody was left back in the United States. [Laughter] But now we see that there are plenty here representing the spirit of this country. And bless you in your work, and God bless the United States.
Thank you very, very much.
