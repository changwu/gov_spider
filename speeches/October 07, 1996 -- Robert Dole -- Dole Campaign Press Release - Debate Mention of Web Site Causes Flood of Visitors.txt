    Site Receives More Than 762,000 Hits in Single Four-Hour Period Today
Following Bob Dole's mention of his campaign Web site address in his closing remarks last night in Hartford, the site has been deluged by a flood of first-time visitors. In a single four-hour period today, the Dole-Kemp '96 Web site received more than 762,000 "hits" -- the Web standard for measuring traffic on a site. The total hits on the site for today alone is expected to pass the 2 million mark.
The Dole-Kemp '96 Web site is the first political Web site to individually-customize itself for each user's interests, home state, and last visit.
The users first visit the site, they are given the option of setting up a custom Dole Web page. Each custom page contains a personal tool bar that welcomes the users by name, alerts them to an electronic "In Box" containing any new press releases or other campaign materials posted since their last visit, directs them to briefing papers on issues in which they expressed interest, and offers a home-state icon for local information about the Clinton record and the Dole agenda in the state.
Unlike other political Web sites, the Dole campaign also offers users a mechanism to give feedback to the campaign on policy positions. Each briefing paper is an interactive document that lets users tell the campaign what priority they a Dole administration should give the initiative.
An Interactive section on the site includes options for users to:
* Create custom Dole campaign buttons.
* Download official Dole for President computer "wallpaper."
* Design and mail their own e-mail postcards to friends.
* Make a personalized Dole for President campaign poster.
* Test their knowledge with Dole trivia questions and crossword puzzles.
* Review states issues and where Dole has visited through interactive maps.
