Boston, MA – Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement regarding Rosh Hashanah:
"As we approach the Jewish New Year, Ann and I wish the Jewish community a happy and healthy Rosh Hashanah. With this new year, we hope that new strides are made to reach lasting peace and security for all Americans, as well as comfort for Jewish communities around the world.
"Much of our country's strength derives from values deeply rooted in the Jewish tradition – values that stress the importance of the family and the home. The beginning of a new year ushers in a fresh start and an optimistic outlook on challenges that must be addressed and solved.
"Again, Ann and I wish the Jewish people a happy and healthy holiday with their family and friends. L'Shanah Tovah Tikatevu."
