Boston, MA â€“ Governor Mitt Romney today announced that U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) has endorsed his candidacy for President of the United States. Senator Hatch joins a growing list of U.S. Senators who have already announced their support, including Senators Robert Bennett (R-UT) and Jim DeMint (R-SC).
"For more than 30 years, Senator Hatch has been a powerful and effective conservative voice in the United States Senate," said Governor Romney. "Senator Hatch is a leading authority on judicial matters and has worked to cut down the size of government and let hardworking Americans keep more of what they earn. I am honored to have him on my campaign."
"Governor Romney has the leadership qualities we need to bring real change to Washington," said Senator Hatch. "Governor Romney has the vision needed to meet the new generation of challenges facing our country. People in Utah remember well his turning around the 2002 Winter Olympics. His record as Governor is equally remarkable. At a time of unprecedented challenges, we need to elect an innovative problem solver like Governor Romney."
