    On Thursday, September 28, Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Miami, FL as she continues her "Fight for Our Freedoms" College Tour with a moderated conversation at Florida International University, one of the largest Hispanic-Serving Institution in the country. This campus event will be the sixth stop on the Vice President's month-long college tour.
Vice President Harris's "Fight for Our Freedoms" College Tour is a high-energy national swing that is mobilizing thousands of young people in the ongoing fight for fundamental freedoms and rights. She is visiting around a dozen campuses including HBCUs, community colleges, apprenticeship programs, state schools, and additional Hispanic-Serving Institutions. At each stop, the Vice President is focusing on key issues that disproportionately impact young people across America – from reproductive freedom and gun safety to climate action, voting rights, LGBTQ+ equality, mental health, and book bans.
The Vice President's college tour kicked off with stops at Hampton University, North Carolina A&T State University, Reading Area Community College, and IBEW Local 743 where she spoke with members of an apprenticeship program. On Tuesday, Vice President Harris will participate in a moderated conversation with students from Morehouse College, Spelman College, Clark Atlanta University, and Morris Brown College – four HBCUs in Atlanta, GA. The tour is a continuation of her dedicated work to energize, engage, and partner with young people throughout the country. She has already been to 14 college campuses this year after visiting 14 schools in 2022.
