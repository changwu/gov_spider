    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee filed official paperwork today to place Mayor Giuliani on the ballot in the Illinois Republican primary. Filing on behalf of Rudy were Illinois State Representatives Bill Mitchell of Macon County and Chapin Rose of Champaign County.
"Mayor Giuliani's campaign made the first official step toward victory in Illinois," said Representative Mitchell. "Rudy is far and away the best organized in the state, with a fully staffed campaign headquarters, an impressive delegate slate and dedicated volunteers who have made over a quarter million phone calls throughout the state so far."
Rudy's Illinois campaign headquarters is located in Lisle and house eight full-time staff members. The campaign recently announced the endorsement of former Governor Jim Edgar. Rudy's Illinois team also includes Representative Tom Cross, Giuliani's State Chair, Congresswoman Judy Biggert, former Governor Jim Thompson, and former Attorney General Jim Ryan.
On Friday, Mayor Giuliani will make his eight campaign trip to the state, delivering remarks to the Illinois Manufacturers' Association's Annual Meeting and holding a town hall meeting with Illinois voters in the Chicago area.
