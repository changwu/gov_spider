My friend (always there when I've needed him!), Senator @RandPaul, was just tested "positive" from the Chinese Virus. That is not good! He is strong and will get better. Just spoke to him and he was in good spirits.Retweets: 30396Favorites: 195021

I watch and listen to the Fake News, CNN, MSDNC, ABC, NBC, CBS, some of FOX (desperately & foolishly pleading to be politically correct), the @nytimes, & the @washingtonpost, and all I see is hatred of me at any cost. Don't they understand that they are destroying themselves?Retweets: 46812Favorites: 219957

The New York Times changed headlines 3 times in order to satisfy the Radical Left. What should have been a good story got "worse & worse", until the headline alone made it very unfair. Fake & Corrupt News that is very dangerous for our Country!Retweets: 38471Favorites: 162290
