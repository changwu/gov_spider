    MRS. OBAMA: Thank you so much. (Applause.) Well, since I know I'm the only thing that stands between you and your 20-minute meal, I'm not going to take long. But it is a pleasure and an honor to be back here at the United States Naval Academy.
I was here a couple of years ago when we first came into office; I brought Sasha, and it was an amazing experience. Sasha is our youngest daughter and she was just taken by the experience. And I'm not sure yet, she's just 11 -- I'm not sure where her trajectory will lead her -- but this is an amazing place, and you all are an amazing group of men and women. We are incredibly proud of you.
I want to congratulate you on winning the Commander-In-Chief's trophy. Go Navy! (Applause.) Well done. And I know that my husband will be here in May for your commencement, so I am particularly pleased that I get a chance to stop by and say hello, but, more importantly, to thank you for your service and your sacrifice.
The degree of discipline and rigor that it takes to do what you do is truly amazing. And Barack and I, we are so proud of you all. And we know you are some of the best and brightest that this country has to offer, and it's just important that you know that you have a President and a First Lady who will keep working to make sure that this country serves you as well as you serve us.
So with that, I bid you a wonderful, delicious lunch -- I see a lot of greens on the plate, which is good. And congratulations on how far you've come, and I look forward to the leadership that you will exhibit in the years to come.
God bless you all. (Applause.)
