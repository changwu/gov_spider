    As a native of rural America, I grew up with country music and join with great enthusiasm with all those who celebrate Country Music Month.
Anyone who has spent time living and working on a farm or touring the rural areas and small towns of our nation has learned to appreciate the musical legacy of this part of our country. It embraces the joys, sorrows, experiences and hopes of daily life. It echoes the greatness, goodness and diligence of hard working men and women.
Along with millions of fans, I salute the creative genius of those to whom country music owes its ever-growing popularity.
