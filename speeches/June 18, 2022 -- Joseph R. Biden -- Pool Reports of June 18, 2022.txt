Travel Pool Report No. 5 - more quotes, color
Dr. Biden kept going so she missed her husband's fall. He stopped and came over to the waiting crowd, tried to unclip and fell over sideways, creating a mad scramble of Secret Service and press. Observers had tried to tell Biden "Happy Father's Day." He stood up right away and talked to the crowd before coming closer to the press – answering the questions below. There were no visible scrapes or bruises from the spill.
MORE QUOTES:
Asked "are you ok?"
"Yeah yeah yeah," he also said.
About what caused the fall: he said the "toe cages" on his bike got caught.
Asked about China tariffs, he joked with a reporter "I'm not going to talk to you on my vacation."
About his anniversary "Thank you."
How soon are you talking to Xi?
"Soon"
Have you mad up your mind about tariffs?
"We're in the process of doing that."
You're lifting the tariffs?
"I'm in the process of making up my mind."
Are you satisfied with progress on gun legislation?
"In Delaware, I am. Did you see what they did in Delaware? Passed an assaults weapons ban. They did what I did years ago. But I am happy with the progress.
"Alright guys, see you," Biden said as he got on the bike.

Travel Pool Report No. 7 - "No medical attention is needed"
From a WH official —
"As the President said, his foot got caught on the pedal while dismounting and he is fine. No medical attention is needed. The President looks forward to spending the rest of the day with his family."
Also a huge thanks to the NYT's Zachary Montague for helping transcribe Biden's comments to pool after the fall.
I've also updated the Dropbox with footage I shot of the incident:
