    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Carper (D) Delaware and 40 others)
The President's senior advisers will recommend disapproval if H.R. 4917 is presented to the President in its current form. Although the Administration would not object to exempting the financial institution regulatory agencies from the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law for 1987 and beyond, a retroactive exemption from the already-enacted 1986 sequester is highly objectionable and would set an undesirable precedent.
The Administration strongly opposes any effort to remove the budget development and execution of the Federal financial institution regulatory agencies from Executive branch oversight. The expenditures of these agencies are included within the Federal budget totals and any increases add to the Federal budget deficit. Moreover, these are Executive branch agencies, and the President cannot effectively perform his chief executive functions if his current oversight authorities are restricted or removed.
The President has proposed legislation to provide for a government-wide demonstration project for reform of the Federal personnel and compensation laws. The Administration opposes statutory pilot programs for individual Federal agencies, because such piecemeal approaches undermine the government-wide reform the President believes is necessary.
