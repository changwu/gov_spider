Today, Team Marco announced a growing number of Northeast Florida leaders endorsing Marco. Ahead of the March 15 primary, conservatives in the Jacksonville region and across the state of Florida know that Marco is the only candidate that can unite the Republican Party and defeat Hillary Clinton in November. 
Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry outlined what's at stake:
I am proud to support Marco Rubio because he not only has the optimistic message that can unite our party and grow it, but also gives Republicans the best shot at winning in November. Florida has an important role to play this cycle with all of our 99 delegates going to the winner and we need to make sure we elect a real conservative. With so much at stake, Marco Rubio is the best choice for the Florida March 15th primary and ultimately the White House.

Jacksonville City Councilman Aaron Bowman added:
Heading into the Florida primary on the 15th, picking a candidate was an easy decision for me. I am voting for Marco Rubio and I urge my fellow Floridians to join me in supporting a leader that has spent his entire career putting conservative principles into action.
