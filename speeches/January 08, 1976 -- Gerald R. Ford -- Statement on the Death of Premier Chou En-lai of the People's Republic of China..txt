    PREMIER Chou En-lai will be long remembered as a remarkable leader who has left his imprint not only on the history of modern China but also on the world scene.
We Americans will remember him especially for the role he played in building a new relationship between the People's Republic of China and the United States. We are confident that this relationship will continue to develop on the foundation of understanding and cooperation which he helped to establish.
The United States offers its condolences to the Government and people of the People's Republic of China.
