    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the House vote to repeal the medical device tax in Obamacare:
"I am encouraged that the House has done the right thing and voted to repeal the medical device tax. With unemployment stuck over 8 percent for 40 months, we can't afford policies that kill jobs and stifle innovation in one of America's most dynamic industries. The ill-considered medical device tax is only one of many fatal flaws in Obamacare. As president, I will work from my first day in office to dismantle Barack Obama's federal health-care takeover and replace it with real reform that strengthens our health care system and puts patients first."
