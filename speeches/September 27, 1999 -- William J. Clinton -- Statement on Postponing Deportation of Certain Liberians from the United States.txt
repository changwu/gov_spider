    Today I directed the Attorney General and the Immigration and Naturalization Service to defer for one year from September 29 the deportation of certain Liberians who are present in the United States on that date. This action is aimed at promoting stability in Liberia and west Africa. In particular, I am concerned that a decision by our Government to deport Liberians who have enjoyed the protection of our country for many years could cause governments in west Africa to deport many thousands of Liberians in their own countries. This would severely burden Liberia and threaten the fragile peace that has been recently achieved in west Africa. Furthermore, this action preserves the status quo for these Liberians while the Congress actively considers legislative relief for them.
