    Governor Romney On The Democrats And The Economy
Governor Romney: "Succeed or fail, America would be the land of opportunity. So when Republicans talk about change, we're talking about opportunity and freedom. We're talking about people, not government. Now Democrats look beyond our heritage to the Europe of the past when they talk about change. They're thinking about big government, big welfare, big taxes, big brother. But those are the very policies that led Europe to their decline. In short, it's a big mistake. Look at how the Democrats like Hillary Clinton think about our economy. She said the other day some very interesting things, you probably saw them. She said that it is 'time to reject the idea of an "on your own" society and replace it with shared responsibility.' She says she prefers a 'we're all in it together society.' I see, out with Adam Smith, in with Karl Marx!" (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At The 2007 Young Republican National Convention, Hollywood, FL, 7/7/07)

Governor Romney: The American People Are The Source Of Our Strength
Governor Romney: "Conservatism, Republicanism, it's a philosophy of strength. We believe in a strong military. We believe in a strong economy. We believe in strong families and values. We believe in the American people. ... The American people, of course, are the source of our strength – hard working, educated, risk taking, opportunity loving, God fearing American people. People who are willing to sacrifice for their families. People who will give of themselves for freedom, who love America. They've always been the source of our strength and they always will be!"

Governor Romney: "Senator Edwards says there isn't a War on Terror – it's only a slogan. You tell that to the people of London and Glasgow. And to the people in Bali and Malaysia, Pakistan and Lebanon, the people in Tanzania and Kenya, Saudi Arabia and Israel. Tell that to the people in New York and Boston and Washington, D.C. One thing you can count on if I'm President or any Republican is President, and that is if there's a war being waged by the terrorists, there will be war being waged on the terrorists."
