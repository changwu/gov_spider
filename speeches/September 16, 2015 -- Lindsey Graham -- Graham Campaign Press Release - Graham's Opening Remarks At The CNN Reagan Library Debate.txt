    One, thanks CNN for having people at this debate.
I'm Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, in case you can't tell. I want to thank Ms. Reagan for inviting me. It means the world to me.
I'm the only candidate tonight that served in the military while Ronald Reagan was our president and our commander in chief. It was one of the highlights of my life.
I'm running for president to destroy radical Islam, to win the war on terror, to protect you and your family. And in that quest, I have an uncompromising determination to end this war, just like president Reagan had an uncompromising determination to destroy the evil empire and win the cold war.
Above all others on both sides of the aisle, I'm most qualified to be commander and chief on day one. 33 years in the air force, 35 trips to Iraq and Afghanistan, I understand this war. I have a plan to win it, and I intend to win it.
