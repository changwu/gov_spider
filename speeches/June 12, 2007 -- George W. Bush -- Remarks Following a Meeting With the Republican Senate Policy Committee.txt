    I just had a good exchange with my fellow Republicans. We talked about a lot of issues. I briefed them on my trip to Europe. We talked about—they were very interested in the Ahtisaari plan for Kosovo. They were interested in my conversations with Vladimir Putin on missile defense. We talked about the energy bill. We talked about the appropriations process. And we talked about immigration. Some Members in there believe that we need to move a comprehensive bill; some don't. I understand that. This is a highly emotional issue, but those of us standing here believe now is the time to move a comprehensive bill that enforces our borders and has good workplace enforcement, that doesn't grant automatic citizenship, that addresses this problem in a comprehensive way.
I would hope that the Senate majority leader has that same sense of desire to move the product that I do—or the bill that I do and these Senators do, because now is the time to get it done. It's going to take a lot of hard work, a lot of effort. We've got to convince the American people that this bill is the best way to enforce our border. I believe without the bill, that it's going to be harder to enforce the border. The status quo was unacceptable. And I want to thank those Senators on both sides of the aisle who understand the time is now to move a comprehensive piece of legislation. The White House will stay engaged.
Thank you very much.
