    New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's commitment to making the 21st century an American Century: 
"Mitt Romney is committed to making the 21st century another American Century.  As president, Mitt Romney will work to restore America's economic and military strength, uphold the core values of liberty and democracy, and defend human rights around the world.  That's in stark contrast to President Obama, who has ignored his Secretary of Defense's warnings about impending additional defense cuts, who turned his back on the Iranian people in 2009 when they took to the streets in search of freedom, who pledged Russia more 'flexibility' if he's re-elected, and who has failed to lead an effective international effort to end the bloodshed in Syria."
