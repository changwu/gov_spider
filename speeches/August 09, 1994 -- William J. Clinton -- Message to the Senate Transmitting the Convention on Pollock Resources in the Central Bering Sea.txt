    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Pollock Resources in the Central Bering Sea, with Annex, done at Washington on June 16, 1994. The Convention was signed on that date by the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, and the United States. Japan and the Republic of Poland, the other participating countries in the negotiation of the Convention, are expected to sign the Convention in the near future. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, a report of the Secretary of State concerning the Convention.
This Convention is a state-of-the-art fishing agreement that will aid in ensuring the longterm health of pollock stocks in the central Bering Sea on which the U.S. pollock industry in the Pacific Northwest in part depends. Its strong conservation and management measures will be backed up with effective enforcement provisions. The agreement will require that each vessel fishing for pollock in the central Bering Sea carry scientific observers and use real-time satellite position-fixing transmitters. All vessels of the Parties fishing in the central Bering Sea must consent to boarding and inspection by authorized officials of other States Parties for compliance with the provisions of the Convention.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Convention and provide its advice and consent to ratification.
