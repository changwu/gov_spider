    Memorandum for the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations
Subject: Determination Under Section 202(b) of the Trade Act; Clothespins
Pursuant to section 202(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-618, 88 Stat. 1978), I have determined the action I will take with respect to the report of the United States International Trade Commission (USITC), transmitted to me on December 12, 1978, concerning the results of its investigation of import injury which was established on its own motion. The investigation was initiated as an outgrowth of information collected in conjunction with Commission investigations Nos. TA-406-2, TA-406-3, and TA- 406-4, conducted under section 406(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 and concerning clothespins from the People's Republic of China, the Polish People's Republic, and the Socialist Republic of Romania. All four investigations have concerned clothespins imported under items 790.05, 790.07, and 790.08 of the TSUS.
After considering all relevant aspects of the case, including those considerations set forth in section 202(c) of the Trade Act of 1974, I have decided to accept a variation of the injury relief recommendation made by the USITC. Within 15 days, I will issue a Presidential Proclamation authorizing that a three-year global import quota be established on wood and plastic clothespins (TSUS item 790.05) with a dutiable value not over $1.70 per gross in the amount of two million gross pins. The quota, administered quarterly on a pro rata basis, will be allocated as follows:
Yearly quota allocation
Category (gross)
Valued not over 80 cents per gross------------------------ 500, 000Valued over 80 cents per gross butnot over $1.35 per gross---------------------------------- 600, 000Valued over $1.35 per gross butnot over $1.70 per gross---------------------------------- 900, 000
Total --------------------------------------------- 2, 000, 000
During the course of each year, as it becomes apparent that the quota for any price bracket will not be filled for the year, then the remainder of the allocation may be reapportioned among the brackets whose quotas have been filled.
Relief is warranted for the following reasons:
1. The social costs of denying relief would be very high, since producers are located in isolated regions in the Northeast where alternative employment is scarce.
2. Assistance will not be costly and will not impose an inflationary burden on the economy. The major clothespin manufacturers have provided commitments to comply with the Administration's anti-inflation program.
3. Major clothespin producers have given their assurances that the relief period will be used to modernize facilities, improve distributional channels and promote their product. These steps should put them in a better competitive position once relief is lifted.
This determination is to be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER.
