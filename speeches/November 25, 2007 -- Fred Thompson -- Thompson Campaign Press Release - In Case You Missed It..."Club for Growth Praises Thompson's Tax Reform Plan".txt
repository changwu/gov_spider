The Club's release is below:
Washington - The Club forGrowth praised Senator Fred Thompson for the release of his pro-growth tax reform plan this morning on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace. The seven-part plan is the most comprehensive tax reform plan offered to date by a presidential candidate. The plan will:
• Permanently extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts
• Permenantly extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts
• Repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax
• Reduce the corporate tax rate to no more than 27%
• Permanently extend small business expensing
• Update and simplify depreciation schedules
• Expand taxpayer choice
Most commendable is Thompson's plan to expand taxpayer choice by adopting the Republican Study Committee's recent plan, called the Taxpayer Choice Act. This plan will give American taxpayers the choice of opting into a simplified tax code that contains only two rates rather than deal with the current monstrosity known as the U.S. tax code.
"While other candidates have adopted pieces of this plan, Thompson goes a step further by offering a specific corporate tax reduction and offering taxpayers the option of a simple tax plan," said Club for Growth President Pat Toomey. "His plan is based on the fundamental fact that lower rates and simpler rules across the board promote economic freedom and enhance economic growth. This is the kind of plan economic conservatives can rally around."
