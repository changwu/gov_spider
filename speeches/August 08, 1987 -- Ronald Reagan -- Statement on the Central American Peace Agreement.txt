    I welcome this commitment to peace and democracy by the five Central American Presidents, and I hope it will lead to peace in Central America and democracy in Nicaragua. The agreement makes clear that there is much work to be done by the parties involved. The United States will be as helpful as possible, consistent with our interests and the interests of the Nicaraguan resistanceâ€”who have already stated their readiness to take part in genuine negotiations for peace and democracy in Nicaragua.
We will study the agreement carefully with an eye to what the United States can contribute to the search for freedom and peace. The agreement emphasizes reconciliation, democracy, and full respect for political and civil rights. We are encouraged by that emphasis. The promise of this agreement can only be realized in its implementation. We look forward to the day when the commitments made in this agreement are a part of everyday life in Central America.
