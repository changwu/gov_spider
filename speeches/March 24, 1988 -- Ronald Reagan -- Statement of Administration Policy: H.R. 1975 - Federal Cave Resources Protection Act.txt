    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Boucher (D) Virginia and 29 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1975, because several of its provisions would unnecessarily hamper efficient land management. The overly broad definition of the terms "cave" and "Federal cave resource," for example, could significantly disrupt or delay road construction, timber harvesting, mineral exploration, and other activities on Federal lands if such activities would affect even inconsequential "caves." The Administration also opposes the earmarking of permit fees and receipts from civil and criminal penalties to a special fund dedicated to the benefit of cave resources.
