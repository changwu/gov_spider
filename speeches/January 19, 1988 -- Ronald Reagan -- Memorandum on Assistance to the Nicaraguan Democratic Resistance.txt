    Presidential Determination No. 88-6
In accordance with Section 111(b)(2)(A) of the Joint Resolution making further continuing appropriations for the fiscal year 1988 and for other purposes (Public Law 100-202), I hereby determine and certify that:
(a) at the time of this certification no cease-fire is in place that was agreed to by the Government of Nicaragua and the Nicaraguan democratic resistance;
(b) the failure to achieve such a cease-fire results from the lack of good faith efforts by the Government of Nicaragua to achieve such a cease-fire; and
(c) the Nicaraguan democratic resistance has engaged in good faith efforts to achieve such a cease-fire.
This determination and certification shall be transmitted to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate and shall be published in the Federal Register.
