    THANK YOU very, very much, President Kimball. I am deeply grateful, as is Mrs. Ford, for this very thoughtful and symbolic gift.
Mrs. Ford and I have had a great opportunity during our lifetime to spend some time in Utah, and it is a privilege to meet with you again. We are very familiar with the concepts and the beliefs of your church and your many people that are so devoted and so dedicated to the Christian sacrifice and the American adventure.
I think this statue, which I understand is a replica of one that is in Salt Lake, is symbolic of the many, many people who crossed this continent and came to a very difficult land and through their individual work and collective efforts turned Utah into a garden spot of the United States and, in fact, the world; not only a garden spot in what we see in material things but a real home for the family and for the kind of ideals and the kinds of principles that are good for America.
So, Mrs. Ford and I will treasure this thoughtful gift. It will bring back the many fine memories we have of our association with people from your church and the many fine associations we have had with those who are so dedicated as you and the others are. We thank you, and we wish you the very best.
I am delighted to see all these wonderful young children--a few older people in the background there--but these young people are really the hope and the thing we all look forward to, to work for, to make it a better America for you.
But then we expect all of you to make it a better America for those that follow you. And we have great faith in each and every one of you. And we know you will do your job, be good young boys and girls so that you can contribute to America and make it a better place for everybody.
Thank you very, very much, President Kimball.
