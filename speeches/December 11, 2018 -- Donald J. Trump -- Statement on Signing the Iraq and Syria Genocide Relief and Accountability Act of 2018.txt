    Today, I have signed into law H.R. 390, the "Iraq and Syria Genocide Emergency Relief and Accountability Act of 2018" (the "Act"). Sections 4, 5, and 6 of the Act purport to require the executive branch to adopt a particular foreign policy or direct certain negotiations with foreign persons and entities. My Administration will treat these provisions in a manner consistent with the President's exclusive constitutional authorities in the area of foreign relations. In addition, section 7 of the Act purports to require the Secretary of State to make certain legislative recommendations. My Administration will treat this provision in a manner consistent with Article II, section 3 of the Constitution, which provides the President the discretion to recommend for the consideration of the Congress only "such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient."
