  A Proclamation

Chronic diseases of the lung afflict well over 18 million Americans, cause more than 200,000 deaths annually, and cost the Nation more than $45 billion each year in lost wages, productivity and direct costs of medical care.
Emphysema and related pulmonary diseases have been the fastest rising cause of death in the United States in the past 14 years. Over six million Americans, including two million children, suffer from asthma. It is expected that lung cancer will soon surpass breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer deaths among American women.
Leading the fight to prevent illness, disability and death from lung disease in the voluntary sector is the American Lung Association, a nonprofit health organization supported by individual contributions to Christmas Seals and other donations. Beginning in 1907, Christmas Seals were used to raise funds through private contributions to provide education to Americans with the disease.
Today, the American Lung Association works with the National Institutes of Health to support research, training, and demonstration programs relevant to diseases of the lung. This year, the Association's Christmas Seals will be in 60 million American homes.
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 262, has designated the month of November as "National Christmas Seal Month."
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the month of November, 1982, as "National Christmas Seal Month."
I call upon all government agencies and the American people to observe this month with appropriate activities supporting the Christmas Seal program.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 2nd day of Nov., in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightytwo, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.

RONALD REAGAN
