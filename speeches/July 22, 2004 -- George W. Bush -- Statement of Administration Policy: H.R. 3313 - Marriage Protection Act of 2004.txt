    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Hostettler (R) Indiana and 48 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3313, which would ensure that Federal courts could not invalidate the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). DOMA provides that no State should be forced to recognize a same-sex marriage entered into in another State. The Act was strongly supported by a large bipartisan margin in Congress and signed by President Clinton. The Administration strongly supports DOMA and is vigorously defending it against legal challenge. To fully protect marriage from activist judges, including activist State court judges, the Administration also urges Congress to pass and send to the States for ratification a constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman.
