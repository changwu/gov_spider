    The United States welcomes today's passage of the UN Human Rights Council resolution on "Promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka." This resolution, which the United States co-sponsored as part of a cross-regional group, calls on the Government of Sri Lanka to fulfill its commitments to promote meaningful reconciliation for all Sri Lankans. The resolution also encourages the Government to credibly investigate allegations of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law as Sri Lanka continues to heal from more than two decades of conflict. Today's vote sends a clear message that the international community is committed to working with the Government of Sri Lanka to promote greater peace, stability, and prosperity for all of the people of Sri Lanka.
