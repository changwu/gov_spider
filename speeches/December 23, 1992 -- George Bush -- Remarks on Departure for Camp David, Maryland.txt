    I just want to wish everybody a very Merry Christmas. I want to say that to everybody that's worked so hard in our administration. I want to say that to Governor Clinton's new team, to wish them all the very best in the new year. I want to say it to all the press. The amnesty extended during the campaign to the photographers, it's been granted to Helen Thomas [United Press International] and all the rest of you guys. So have a wonderful Christmas and a very happy new year. And inasmuch as I've had 268 press conferences, I think it would kind of ruin the spirit of Christmas if I took any questions here. But I really hope you all have a good one.
