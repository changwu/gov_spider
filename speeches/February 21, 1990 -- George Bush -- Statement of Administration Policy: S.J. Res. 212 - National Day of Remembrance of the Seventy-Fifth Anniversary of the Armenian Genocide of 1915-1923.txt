    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Dole (R) Kansas and 47 others)
The Administration is deeply aware of the tragedy suffered by the Armenian people during the period of 1915-1923 when hundreds of thousands of Armenians lost their lives. Their suffering must never be forgotten or repeated.
The Administration supports commemorating the victims of that tragic period. Such a commemorative resolution must be balanced, however, in recognition of the differing views of how the terrible events of 1915-1923 should be characterized. During the period, Armenians and Muslims lost their lives. In commemorating this tragedy, we also must be sensitive to the close relationship the United States has with Turkey, our friend and ally.
Because the language of S.J.Res. 212 lacks balance, it is unacceptable to the Administration. If presented to the President in its current form, his senior advisers would recommend that S.J.Res. 212 be disapproved.
