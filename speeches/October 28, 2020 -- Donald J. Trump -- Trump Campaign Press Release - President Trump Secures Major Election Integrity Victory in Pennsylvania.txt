    Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. issued the below statement following the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's guidance on the Election Day ballot receipt deadline:
"President Trump secured a big victory when the Pennsylvania Secretary of State saw the writing on the wall and voluntarily complied with our injunction request, segregating ballots received after the legislature's November 3 deadline to ensure they will not be counted until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on our petition.
"The Supreme Court deferred the important issue in this case—whether state courts can change the times, places, and manners of elections contrary to the rules adopted by the state legislature—until after November 3."
-Justin Clark, deputy campaign manager and senior counsel
