CONCORD — A new, independent poll done for NH1 News has Republican Donald Trump well out in front but Jeb Bush slipping into second for the first time in months.
The upward blip for the former Florida Governor Bush comes when the poll surveys both Republicans and independents likely to vote in the Feb. 9 primary.
But in staggering fashion, Trump crushes the field and even more startling he opens up an even bigger lead when only women voters are surveyed.
REACH Communications did the random telephone poll on Thursday of 1,000 Republicans and independents. The margin of error for the poll was plus or minus 3.
When the poll is limited to the 416 Republicans who were sampled, the error margin edges up to 4.1 percent.
Among both political groups, Trump leads with 31.7 percent.
But Bush manages to barely edge his rivals — all within the error margin — with 11.9 percent to 11.8 percent for Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
