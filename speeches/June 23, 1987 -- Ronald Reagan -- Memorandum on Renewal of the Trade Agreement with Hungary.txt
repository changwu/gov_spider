    Presidential Determination No. 87-15
Memorandum for the United States Trade Representative
Pursuant to my authority under subsection 405(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2435(b)(1)), I find that a satisfactory balance of concessions in trade and services has been maintained during the life of the Agreement on Trade Relations between the United States of America and the Hungarian People's Republic. I further determine that actual or foreseeable reductions in United States tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers resulting from multilateral negotiations are satisfactorily reciprocated by the Hungarian People's Republic.
These findings and determinations shall be published in the Federal Register.
