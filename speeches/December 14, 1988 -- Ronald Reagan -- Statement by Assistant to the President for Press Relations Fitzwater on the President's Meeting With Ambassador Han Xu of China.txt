    Tomorrow, December 15, marks the tenth anniversary of the announcement of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China.
Today President Reagan met with PRC Ambassador Han Xu at the White House to convey his personal good wishes to the Chinese people on this occasion. The President noted the historically warm feelings of Americans for the Chinese people and the major contributions that Americans of Chinese descent have made, and continue to make, to the development of our country and the enrichment of our heritage.
During the meeting, the President recalled that his three predecessors, of differing parties and viewpoints, had all worked with China's leaders to bring our nations and peoples closer together. He expressed satisfaction at having been able to continue and expand on their efforts. The President looked back with pleasure on the warm hospitality he had received during his own visit to China in 1984, when he had been able to see firsthand the great strides China was making to implement reforms and better the life of its people.
In conclusion, the President expressed confidence that with our relationship firmly grounded on the three U.S.-China joint communiques of 1972, 1979, and 1982, China and the United States would be able to work together in the years ahead to forge even stronger ties and build a safer and more prosperous world.
