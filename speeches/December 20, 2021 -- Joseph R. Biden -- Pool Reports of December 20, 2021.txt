Travel pool #1: POTUS departure
Pool met up with motorcade near the Biden residence at 8:20.
We rolled to Brandywine Creek State Park, where POTUS boarded Marine One at 8:29 holding a small light brown briefcase.
Also boarding Marine One was Hunter holding his son, Beau.
POTUS was airborne at 8:34.
Pool is taking a bus back to D.C. Handing off to in-town pool. Happy Monday everyone.
