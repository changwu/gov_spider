    I was deeply saddened to learn today of the death of King Fahd bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. King Fahd was a man of wisdom and a leader who commanded respect throughout the entire world. He was a friend and strong ally of the United States for decades. As King, he had warm friendships with American Presidents. I send my condolences and those of the American people to King Abdallah, to the late King Fahd's family, and to the Saudi people on the passing of this historic figure. May God bless him.
