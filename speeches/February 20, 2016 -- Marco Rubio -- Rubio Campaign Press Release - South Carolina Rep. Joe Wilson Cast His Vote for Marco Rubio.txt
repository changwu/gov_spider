Wilson joins Governor Nikki Haley, Senator Tim Scott, and Rep. Trey Gowdy in backing Marco in the Palmetto State.What pushed Wilson into Marco's column? It all comes down to national security:
I believe [Rubio] is somebody who can bring a positive change, which is needed, to Washington. ... I also appreciate his stand for strong national defense, and he's very consistent we've got to have a strong national defense.

Rep. Wilson, welcome to Team Marco!
