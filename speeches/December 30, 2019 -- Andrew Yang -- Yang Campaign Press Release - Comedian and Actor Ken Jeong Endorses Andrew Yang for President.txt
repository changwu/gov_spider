    Today, comedian and actor Ken Jeong endorsed Andrew Yang for president. Jeong is best known for his roles in Community TV series and The Hangover film series. Born in Detroit, he's the son of South Korean immigrants, and he is a licensed physician in California.
"I love Andrew Yang and am proud to be endorsing him. He's offering me a thousand bucks a month to say this. Andrew is a visionary whose humanity is boundless. I'm honored to be part of the #YangGang," said Jeong.
"Ken's support of our Humanity First movement is an honor. The Yang Gang is made up of individuals from many different backgrounds and professions, and having Ken among our supporters is a thrill. Ken's contributions as an actor and comedian have been groundbreaking â€“ it's well-known that he left a secure role as a doctor to pursue his dream. Ken's career is an example that we can all do more than is expected of us," said Andrew Yang.
Jeong's endorsement follows Andrew Yang's commanding debate performance at the sixth Democratic primary debate in Los Angeles, along with endorsements from Steven Yeun and Donald Glover.
