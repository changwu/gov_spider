    Local Iowa Activist Praises Legislation
Washington, DC -- Today, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton held a press conference unveiling a new legislative initiative called the Expanding the Promise for Individuals with Autism Act (EPIAA). She was joined by autism advocates and families affected by autism who helped to underscore the need to expand access to treatment, interventions and support services for people with autism.
EPIAA would establish a Treatment, Interventions and Services Evaluation Task Force to evaluate current therapies and make recommendations on ways to expand access to effective autism treatments and services in Iowa and nationwide. Among other things, the bill would create a grant program to assist states in improving access to treatment and develop a grant program that targets autism in adults.
Lisa Heddens, the Family Support Coordinator for the Access for Special Kids (ASK) Resource Center in Iowa said of Clinton's legislation, "This initiative has the potential to make a positive difference in the lives of those affected by autism in Iowa. I'm thrilled that Senator Clinton has taken this important step to address mental healthcare in Congress."
