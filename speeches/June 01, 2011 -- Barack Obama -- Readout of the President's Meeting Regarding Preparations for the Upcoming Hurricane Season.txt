    Today, on the start of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, President Obama was briefed on federal preparations for the upcoming hurricane season and FEMA's "Whole Community" approach to disaster management by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate, NOAA Administrator Dr. Jane Lubchenco and National Hurricane Center Director Bill Read.
As part of the Administration's ongoing efforts to engage our entire nation in disaster preparedness, response and recovery, the briefing also featured input from state, local, non-profit, faith-based, as well as private sector partners.
Participants included North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue and members of her emergency management team, American Red Cross President Gail McGovern, National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (NVOAD) Chair Reverend Mickey Caison, and Verizon Wireless CEO Dan Mead.
Last year, at the end of August, as Hurricane Earl was approaching the shores of North Carolina and threatened almost the entire east coast, at the President's direction, FEMA responded by working with all the entities represented at today's briefing, to support Governor Perdue and her emergency management team.
The President stressed the importance of this team approach and engaging the entire nation in emergency preparedness. He also directed Secretary Napolitano and Administrator Fugate to continue building on this model and to be in close contact and coordination with the Governors, congressional delegations, and emergency managers in hurricane-prone states to ensure that they have the tools and resources needed to prepare for, respond to, and recover from any potential hurricanes this season.
