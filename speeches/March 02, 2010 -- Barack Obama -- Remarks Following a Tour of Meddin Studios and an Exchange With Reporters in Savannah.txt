    Q. Mr. President, what has impressed you about Meddin Studios? What do you see here that----
The President. Well, look, the--if you think about the two businesses we just visited, on the one hand you've got old-line manufacturing at a steel company that is in its third generation, but they've been able to adapt to a tough manufacturing environment and succeed, mainly around customer service, being able to turn around orders very quickly, specialized orders.
These guys here at Meddin, I think, are doing a similar concept, which is that whatever the customer needs in terms of film production, digital production, sound, you name it, they've got it all under one roof. And what it means is that anybody who comes here is going to be able to, from soup to nuts, do what they need to do very effectively.
The main reason that we wanted to highlight what they're doing is they took advantage of an SBA loan to get this thing started. And I was just finding out how that experience was. I'm sort of doing a customer satisfaction survey here--[Laughter]--with our SBA loans, and it sounds like it really was helpful in terms of making sure that these guys could get started with the business idea that they had, and it doesn't sound like, without it, they would have been able to get moving as quickly as they did.
So it's a testimony, I think, to the good work that the SBA is doing. It's an example of the kinds of additional capital we want to get out to small businesses and medium-sized businesses as part of the jobs package that hopefully will be working its way through Congress in the next several weeks.
