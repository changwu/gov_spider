VP Pool 1 — Bilat w Lee — no news 
VP and PM Lee came in at 3:18. She referenced their meeting from last year in Singapore and talked about the "enduring relationship" and the need to "strengthen and reaffirm" the relationship. She said they spoke about people if Ukraine and the economic costs that Singapore "levied" because of the invasion. She talked about standing up for rules and norms, sovereignty and territorial integrity.
She said as follow up to their last meeting, Singapore is signing Artemis accords on space.
Also talked about collaborating on supply chain and climate.
Lee thanked VP for "very warm remarks" and said they reaffirmed longstanding partnership. Said they talked Ukraine and rules-based order.
He noted that Singapore is home to nearly 5,500 US companies and its role in American investment.Lee referenced VP visit to US military base during her visit.He said they talked cyber security and multinational rules and Artemis accords, also issues from VP Harris' prior visit to Singapore.
The two leaders stood in the corner of the vice president's ceremonial office by the fireplace and large mirror.
The VP stood at the lectern on her left side, and PM Lee on the right. They had two flags from each country behind them.
The long table behind the pool had name cards and water bottles, presumably from the earlier bilat.
The two leaders left together out to the back patio at 3:27 as pool was ushered out. Wranglers drowned out a question to VP about whether Putin should be in power.
