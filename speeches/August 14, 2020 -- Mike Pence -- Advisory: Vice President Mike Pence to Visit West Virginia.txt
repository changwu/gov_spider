    On Saturday, August 15th, the Vice President will travel to White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. There, the Vice President will meet with Governor Jim Justice on efforts to combat COVID-19 and safely reopening West Virginia. Before the pandemic, the Trump administration's pro-growth policies created economic growth that led to a 4.7% unemployment rate in the state. As West Virginia continues to safely reopen, unemployment has dropped from 15.9% in April to 10.4% and recovered over 47,000 jobs. Later that evening, the Vice President will return to Washington, D.C.
This event will be covered by pool press only.
