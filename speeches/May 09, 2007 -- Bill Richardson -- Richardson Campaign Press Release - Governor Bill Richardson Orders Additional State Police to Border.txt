    SANTA FE â€“ Governor Bill Richardson today ordered the New Mexico State Police to increase its presence along the U.S. border with Mexico following several killings that have claimed the lives of at least six people in the Mexico town of Palomas, just across from Columbus, N.M. The violence during the past two weeks appears to be part of a drug war that has escalated on the Mexican side of the border, according to law enforcement officials.
As a result, the New Mexico State Police have indefinitely increased patrols in and around the town of Columbus. State Police officers are also working with U.S. Customs agents to form a roadblock in the town of Columbus to check every vehicle going back into Palomas, Mexico. The road block will continue for several days.
"The violence is escalating and I want to ensure that we are doing everything possible to keep New Mexicans in this community safe," Governor Bill Richardson said.
Governor Richardson is working with U.S. Sen. Jeff Bingaman to ensure that the federal response to this violence at the border is sufficient to protect New Mexicans who live in the area.
While all of the violence has occurred in and around Palomas, some of the victims and perpetrators have fled to Columbus for medical attention.
