With excitement building behind Marco, he began his three-day Nevada swing yesterday at a town hall meeting in Summerlin, where he told the crowd of over 1,200 about what he learned about the American Dream when he lived in Southern Nevada.
Watch the local channel Fox 5's coverage:

The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports that Marco returned to Nevada to share his vision for preserving the American Dream:
Voters can preserve the American dream, but only if they're willing to bring some new blood to the country's political establishment, Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio told a throng of receptive retirees at a Las Vegas rally Thursday night. The U.S. senator from Florida, who spent some of his teenage years in Las Vegas, touted his local ties to open the roughly one-hour campaign event at Mountain Shadows Community Center, in the heart of the Sun City Summerlin senior retirement community.

Additionally, Marco contrasted himself with Hillary Clinton and her ideas from yesterday by outlining his vision for a New American Economy for the 21st Century. As the Las Vegas Sun reports:
On economic issues, Rubio's speech previewed elements of a general election strategy designed to paint the 67-year-old Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, as out of touch. Rubio, 44, praised technology companies like Uber and Airbnb for their economic innovation.
