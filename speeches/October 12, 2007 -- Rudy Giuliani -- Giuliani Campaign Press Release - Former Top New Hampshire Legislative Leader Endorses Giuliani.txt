    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee announced today that Stewart Lamprey has endorsed Mayor Giuliani. He served as Speaker of the New Hampshire House and as President of the State Senate. Lamprey also has helped lead several Granite State Presidential campaigns.
"After taking a good look at the GOP field, I am endorsing Rudy Giuliani for President based on the strength of his record leading New York City and his singular ability to challenge the Democrats," said Lamprey, who lives in Moultonborough. "Here in New Hampshire, we take fiscal discipline seriously. Rudy cut taxes 23 times and dramatically reduced the size of city government during his time as Mayor. He is a strong leader with a proven record of getting results who will defeat the Democrats next year."
"Stewart Lamprey has deep experience in New Hampshire politics, whether it is with his own campaigns or helping Republican Presidential candidates over the years. Given his long and distinguished background, Secretary Lamprey's support for Mayor Giuliani reflects the strength and appeal of Rudy's candidacy. It is an honor to have this endorsement," said Wayne Semprini, Giuliani's New Hampshire Chairman.
