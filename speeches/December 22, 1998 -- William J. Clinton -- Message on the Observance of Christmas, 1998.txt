    Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Christmas.
Each year during this season of light and hope, of sharing and giving, we celebrate the birth of a Child. This Child came into the world with only a stable's roof to shelter Him; yet He grew to teach a lesson of love that continues to enrich our lives 2,000 years later.
That love is at the heart of Christmas. It is the love we give our children, who make our world radiant with joy and promise. It is the love of family and friends that inspires every gift and greeting we receive. It is the love that moves us to reject the prejudices that divide us. It is the love that calls us to ease the suffering of those touched by poverty, illness, injustice, or oppression. Above all, it is the love of God for each of us, revealed in the timeless gift of His Son.
Wherever Americans gather to celebrate the birth of Jesus, let us give thanks for the precious gift of love that graces our lives and lights our way toward a better future.
Hillary joins me in sending our warmest wishes for a memorable Christmas and a new year bright with the hope of joy and peace.
BILL CLINTON
