    Dear Mrs. Ritter:
It was with a deep sense of sadness that Mrs. Nixon and I learned of the death of your husband and our good friend, Tex. His passing is a great loss to our Nation and I am sure Americans throughout the land join me in expressing our heartfelt sympathy to you and your family.
Few people have captured in song and words the rich heritage of the American spirit as did Tex. With rare compassion and understanding he used his immense talents to tell of the joys and the sorrows, the good times and the sad times which each of us has known as an individual and all of us have shared in common. In his career, both in film and music, and in the conduct of his personal and public life, Tex Ritter set an example of concern and devotion to his fellow citizens which won him the profound respect of his colleagues and the enduring admiration of fans around the world.
While words have little meaning at this time, Mrs. Nixon and I want you to know that our hearts and prayers are with you. You may be sure that your husband will be remembered with affection and that he will continue to enrich the lives of countless people through his songs about the land he loved so well and so long.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[Mrs. Tex Ritter, Nashville, Tennessee]
