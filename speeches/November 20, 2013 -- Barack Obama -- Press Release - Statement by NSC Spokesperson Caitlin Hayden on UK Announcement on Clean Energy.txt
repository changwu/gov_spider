    We are delighted that the United Kingdom is joining the United States in shifting public financing toward cleaner energy sources. This is an important component of President Obama's Climate Action Plan, and we look forward to working with the UK to encourage other countries to implement similar polices.
The President's Climate Action Plan calls for an end to U.S. support for public financing of new coal-fired power plants overseas except for plants deploying carbon capture and sequestration technologies or in the world's poorest countries, and encourages other countries to adopt similar policies.
