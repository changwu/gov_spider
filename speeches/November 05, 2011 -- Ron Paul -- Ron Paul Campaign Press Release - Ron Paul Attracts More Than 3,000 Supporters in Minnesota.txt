    St. Cloud rally kicks off Minnesota state operations
LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul attracted more than 3,000 supporters at a rally in St. Cloud held to kick off his Minnesota state operations.
The event took place in the district of Dr. Paul's colleague Rep. Michele Bachmann. The last time Rep. Paul visited Minnesota was in 2009 when the pair held a town hall meeting.The exceptionally large crowd gathered at the St. Cloud Civic Center despite the hunting opener that can sometimes distract Minnesota families from attending large public gatherings."We are extraordinarily pleased to see the turnout so high," said Marianne Stebbins, the Ron Paul 2012 Presidential Campaign's Minnesota Chair."We know Ron Paul's platform is popular with Minnesotans, but it's especially gratifying to see the tremendous outpouring of support and concern for his message of Constitutionally-limited government, a return to sound money, and a strong national defense," said Ms. Stebbins.
In the coming weeks, the Ron Paul 2012 Presidential Campaign will formally launch its Minnesota state operations with a new office in Minnetonka.
