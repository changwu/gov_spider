    Mary Gall did not lose today, bipartisanship lost today. Mary Gall has been confirmed unanimously by the Senate twice, once when nominated by former President Bush and again in 1999, when she was nominated by President Clinton. Many of the same Senators who voted for Mary Gall when she was nominated by President Clinton just two years ago, voted against her today demonstrating the purely partisan nature of this vote. Mary Gall is a committed consumer advocate, and the Senate Commerce Committee has lost its opportunity to confirm a fair and dedicated Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
