    I commend the work already done by Secretary O'Leary, other members of the Cabinet, and the many other agency officials on the issue of Government-sponsored human radiation experiments which took place during the past 50 years. Today's first meeting of the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments is another step by the administration to have an honest and open approach to its investigation of the cold-war-era experiments.
The Advisory Committee has an important task in determining whether the U.S. Government treated its own citizens wrongfully through human experimentation. Both those Americans who were the subject of these questioned experiments and the scientists who performed them deserve a fair and thorough investigation.
Only by dealing honestly with the past can we hope to build a better future.
