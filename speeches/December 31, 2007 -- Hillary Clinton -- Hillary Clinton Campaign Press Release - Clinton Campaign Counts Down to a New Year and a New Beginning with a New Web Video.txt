    Video Features Clinton's Priorities for a New Beginning in 2008
DES MOINES, IA - In the final days rolling up to the Iowa caucuses, the Clinton campaign today released a new web video outlining Senator Clinton's priorities for the New Year.
The new 31-second video, entitled "Countdown," lays out her plan to create a new beginning for the New Year for all Americans by providing universal healthcare, bringing our troops home and fixing our broken economy. America faces big challenges today and in the coming years and it's time for a President who will truly lead our country back to greatness. Senator Clinton has a 35 year track record of creating real change for the American people by providing healthcare for over six million children, getting body armor for our troops and boosting the economy through common sense initiatives.
