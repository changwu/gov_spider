    Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency 
Subject: Expediting Federal Decisions Relating to the Siting and Operation of Power Plants in California
Governor Davis of California has directed State and local agencies to expedite the review and licensing of new power generation facilities, and he has requested that Federal agencies do the same.
The Federal Government should make every effort to work with California and to help its citizens. I hereby direct all relevant Federal agencies to expedite Federal permit reviews and decision procedures with respect to the siting and operation of power plants in California. All actions taken must be consistent with statute and ensure continued protection of public health and the environment while preserving appropriate opportunities for public participation.
