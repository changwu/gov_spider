    I am pleased to congratulate Chairman Bennett Johnston, Senator Malcolm Wallop and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on the energy bill they approved today. The 17 - 3 vote by the committee demonstrates a genuine bipartisan commitment to balanced, realistic, and comprehensive energy legislation.
When I announced my National Energy Strategy (NES) on February 20, I challenged the Congress to do its part to pass the legislation recommended in the NES. The committee's action today, taken on a bipartisan basis, marks a very constructive first step in this process.
The committee's action helps move America toward a more secure, cleaner, and more efficient energy future.
