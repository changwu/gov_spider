    The First Lady. Everyone, ladies and gentlemen, somebody was able to make it to the talent show. It's my husband! It's the President!
The President. So I just want to say, I've got talent. [Laughter] I've got some talent, but I wasn't invited to be part of the show. [Laughter]
So the—this is the First Lady's outstanding initiative, along with all of you. But I just wanted to come by and say that the arts are central to who we are as a people, and they are central to the success of our kids. This is not an afterthought. This is not something you do because it's kind of nice to do. It is necessary for these young people to succeed that we promote the arts.
And I hope that events like this help send a message to school districts and parents and Governors and leaders all across this country: You've got to support the arts. It's a priority.
And you guys were all outstanding. So congratulations.
The First Lady. Thank you, honey. Thank you, honey. That's how—you guys, I want all the kids to know just how important you are that the President of the United States came by to tell you how proud he was.
I just want to thank everyone. To all our principals, to all our teachers, to our Turnaround Artists, to our funders: This wouldn't be possible without you. And remember what I said early on: Just think about the millions of kids who aren't being touched by the arts. Look at how much we're missing. We can't afford to miss out on any kid's talent, reaching their—I have seen these kids from little to—this little one has grown up so much. And I am so proud of them. But we have to make this a reality for every child in this country. We just have to.
You all, thank you so much. Kids, great job. Well done. You all take care. Have a great afternoon. Keep working hard.
