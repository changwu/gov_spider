    Baltic Nations and Russia
Q. Mr. President, did you make any progress in your conversation with Mr. Yeltsin?
The President. I think we're making good progress. I think we're making good progress toward completing the troop withdrawals on schedule, working out some of the remaining controversies over the rights of Latvian minorities. I feel good about it.
We talked about that here, as well as about our economic cooperation. And this agreement is, I think, just the beginning of what will be a long and very deep relationship between these two countries and with the United States and the Baltics generally.
Q. Did Yeltsin give you a firm commitment on August 31 withdrawal?
The President. Well, he certainly clearly wants to complete the troop withdrawal, and he's worked very hard. You know, this has been a priority issue between the two of us, and I think that it will proceed apace. I feel good about where we are right now.
