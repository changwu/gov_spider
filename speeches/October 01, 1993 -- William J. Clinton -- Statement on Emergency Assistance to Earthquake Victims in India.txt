    The people of the United States are shocked and saddened by the devastating earthquake that has taken thousands of lives and left thousands more homeless. I have directed our Government to take immediate action to help ease the suffering. I have also asked Ambassador Ray Flynn to accompany the supplies, to assess the situation, and report back to me.
