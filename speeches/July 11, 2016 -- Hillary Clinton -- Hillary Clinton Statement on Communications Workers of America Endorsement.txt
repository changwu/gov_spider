    After receiving the endorsement of the Communications Workers of America, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement:
"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of the Communications Workers of America.
"For decades, the CWA has connected Americans to each other—and along the way, they've helped build the American middle class.
"As President, I will always stand with the CWA to protect workers' fundamental rights to organize, to bargain collectively, to be safe on the job, and to retire with dignity and security after years of hard work. I was proud to join the CWA on the picket line this year as they stood up to Verizon and fought for a fair deal.
"And I will do everything in my power to defend American jobs and American workers. Any trade deal must meet three tests to earn my support: It must create good American jobs, raise wages, and advance our national security. I do not believe that the Trans-Pacific Partnership meets this high standard. That's why I oppose the TPP — and that means before and after the election.
"Above all, we must make sure unions have a seat at the table and a champion in the White House. Because when workers are strong, families are strong—and when families are strong, America is strong."
