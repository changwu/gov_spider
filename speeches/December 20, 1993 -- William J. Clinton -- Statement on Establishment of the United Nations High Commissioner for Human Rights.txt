    I welcome the decision today by the United Nations General Assembly to establish a High Commissioner for Human Rights. Since Eleanor Roosevelt first fought for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, the United States has led the way to ensure that the United Nations is a strong force for human dignity and respect for basic civil and political rights. The High Commissioner will be an influential and persuasive advocate for human rights around the world.
The High Commissioner's mandate to promote human rights worldwide will include coordinating human rights activities within the United Nations system, providing advisory services and technical assistance to governments and regional human rights organizations, and engaging in dialog with governments on promotion of human rights.
Today's action achieves one of my key goals for this year's U.N. General Assembly and advances an enduring goal of American foreign policy. The United States will lend its full support to the High Commissioner's efforts to ensure that the citizens of the world are able to live free from repression and fear.
