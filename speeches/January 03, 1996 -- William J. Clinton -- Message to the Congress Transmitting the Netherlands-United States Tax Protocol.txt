    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification, the Protocol between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Respect of the Netherlands Antilles Amending Article VIII of the 1948 Convention with Respect to Taxes on Income and Certain Other Taxes as Applicable to the Netherlands Antilles, signed at Washington on October 10, 1995. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol.
The Protocol amends Article VIII (1) of the Convention to limit the exemption from U.S. taxation of interest on debt instruments to interest paid on instruments issued on or before October 15, 1984, by a U.S. person to a related controlled foreign corporation that was in existence before October 15, 1984.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Protocol, and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
