    We were saddened to learn of the passing of former Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez of Spain. As the first elected prime minister after the restoration of democracy, Prime Minister Suarez was instrumental in helping Spain transition to a more pluralistic society, free market economy, and parliamentary system of government. He helped Spain become the nation it is today -- a leader in the international community and an example to other countries struggling to find their path to a freer and more open society and government, rule of law, and economic development. On behalf of the American people, we extend our condolences to his family and to the Spanish people.
