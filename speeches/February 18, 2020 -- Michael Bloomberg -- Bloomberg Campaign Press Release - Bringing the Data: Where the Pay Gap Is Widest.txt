Pay is nearly equivocal for men and women working in food service, community and social service, and healthcare occupations.

There are clear differences associated with race and gender. Men consistently make more than women and this disparity is most pronounced at higher incomes. Asian men had the highest overall income, followed by white men. White women make on average nearly $13,000 per year less than white men, whereas Hispanic women make $8,000 per year less than Hispanic men (who in turn also make $13,000 per year less than white men).
