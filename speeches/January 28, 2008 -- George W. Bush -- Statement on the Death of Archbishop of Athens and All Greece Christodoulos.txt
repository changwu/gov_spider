    Laura and I offer our condolences to the people of Greece at this time of mourning for the death of the Archbishop of Athens and All Greece Christodoulos. The late Archbishop was well known as an articulate voice of the Orthodox faith, for his engagement in interreligious dialogue, and for his promotion of social programs to help the vulnerable. Our prayers are with the people of Greece and all those who followed his spiritual guidance.
