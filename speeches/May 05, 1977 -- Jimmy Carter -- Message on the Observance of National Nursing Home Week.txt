    I welcome the opportunity to salute the dedicated individuals who serve institutionalized older Americans and make their golden years as pleasant and as dignified as possible.
It is a priority task of my Administration to ensure that the contributions of our aging citizens are fully recognized. We must make certain that the great benefits our nation has derived from these contributions are acknowledged in full measure by the quality of our concern for those who made them.
As our knowledge increases and as we become more fully aware of the needs of the elderly, I know that those who minister to them will respond with sensitivity and compassion to the challenges of their important mission.
