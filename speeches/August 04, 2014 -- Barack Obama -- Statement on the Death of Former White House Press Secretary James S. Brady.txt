    Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the family of former White House Press Secretary James Brady on his passing. Jim is a legend at the White House for his warmth and professionalism as Press Secretary for President Reagan, for the strength he brought to bear in recovering from the shooting that nearly killed him 33 years ago, and for turning the events of that terrible afternoon into a remarkable legacy of service through the Brady Campaign To Prevent Gun Violence. Since 1993, the law that bears Jim's name has kept guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals. An untold number of people are alive today who otherwise wouldn't be, thanks to Jim.
Every day, reporters and White House staffers walk past a plaque marking the day in 2000 that the White House Briefing Room was renamed the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room. It reads, "May his courage and dedication continue to inspire all who work in this room and beyond." Those words will endure, as will his legacy. Our thoughts and prayers are with Jim's wife Sarah, who has been Jim's steadfast partner in advocacy, and their children Scott and Melissa.
