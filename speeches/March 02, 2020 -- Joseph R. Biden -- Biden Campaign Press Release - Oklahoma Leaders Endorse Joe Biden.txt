    Today, former Oklahoma House Minority Leader Scott Inman, former Oklahoma House Minority Leader Steve Kouplen, Oklahoma Activist Jana Harkins and twelve additional Oklahoma elected officials endorsed Joe Biden for President of the United States. Oklahomans go to the polls on Super Tuesday.
"I'm for Joe Biden because he is the only candidate with the broad, diverse coalition that reflects America, and that we absolutely need to beat Trump â€“ and the only one with the proven experience to bring us together afterwards, to fix Trump's mess and get big things done," said former Oklahoma House Minority Leader Scott Inman.
"Joe Biden is the candidate we need to beat Donald Trump and bring people together to get things done again. His experience means that he can hit the ground running on day one, without any on-the-job training, and start delivering for Oklahomans immediately. I am excited to get to work over the coming weeks and months to make sure Joe Biden is our next President," said former Oklahoma House Minority Leader Steve Kouplen.
"Our country needs a leader who understands the struggle of the working class. Vice President Joe Biden has been working for Oklahomans his entire career -- from expanding the Affordable Care Act to writing and passing the Violence Against Women Act, Joe has always had our back and it's time that we have his," said Jana Lewis Harkins, Oklahoma Community Activist.
