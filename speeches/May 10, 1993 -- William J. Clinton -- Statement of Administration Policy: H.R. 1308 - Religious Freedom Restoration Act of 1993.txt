    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Schumer (D) New York and 168 others)
The Administration supports H.R. 1308, as legislation essential to restoring full legal protection from governmental interference in the free exercise of religion.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 1308 would increase spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is that it would result in increased spending of less than $500,000 annually.
