    I am pleased to announce today a unified antitrust enforcement policy for mergers and acquisitions, by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission.
This new enforcement policy is an important part of the administration's ongoing efforts to improve the competitiveness of American business and to provide jobs for our people. A common policy will provide the business community with greater certainty about the standards to be applied in enforcing the antitrust laws. And where stiff international competition already exists, the new guidelines will make it easier for American companies to achieve the economic clout to compete effectively in the global marketplace.
I commend Attorney General Bill Barr and FTC Chairman Janet Steiger for this important contribution to American competitiveness.
