    President Biden committed to addressing Putin's Price Hike at the pump, and gas prices have now returned to the levels they were at prior to Putin's unprovoked war against Ukraine.
The national average is $3.47 per gallon, down about $1.50 from the June peak and the lowest since February. That's saving American families with two cars about $160 per month on average. The most common price is $2.99 per gallon. This is important breathing room for American families, and meets a key commitment the President made to them on lowering costs.
It's no accident either. President Biden has been releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. He rallied international partners and allies to release oil too. And he has been calling on oil and gas companies to pass on their savings to consumers at the pump. Notably, the President's actions are helping bring prices down for families while continuing to power robust economic and jobs growth.
