    LAKE JACKSON, Texas - 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul released the following statement concerning Newt Gingrich's departure from the race for the Republican nomination. Below please find comments from Congressman Paul:
"As he exits the race for the Republican nomination, I'd like to acknowledge my former colleague in the House Newt Gingrich for running a spirited campaign.
