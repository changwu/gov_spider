    I commend the House of Representatives for passing legislation that will restore our Nation's authority to negotiate trade agreements. Trade promotion authority will give me the flexibility I need to secure the greatest possible trade opportunities for America's farmers, workers, families, and consumers.
Trade promotion authority is a key part of our trade agenda. It will help us pursue and complete trade agreements, including the global trade negotiations launched last month in Doha, Qatar. By promoting open trade, we expand export markets and create high-paying jobs for Americans, while providing opportunities for other nations as a result of free trade.
Now that the House has acted, I urge the Senate to move quickly to send me a trade promotion authority bill I can sign.
