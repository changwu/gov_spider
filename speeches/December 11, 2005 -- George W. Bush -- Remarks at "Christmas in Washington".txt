    Thank you all. Thank you very much. Laura and I have really enjoyed the program tonight. We want to thank all the entertainers for their wonderful performances. I thank Dr. Phil and Robin for being such fine emcees for this event. I want to thank Carrie Underwood, CeCe Winans, Ciara, Jane Monheit, Rascal Flatts, The Click Five, and all the performers and choirs that were here.
We particularly want to thank George Stevens, the executive producer of "Christmas in Washington," and his wife, Liz, as well as Michael Stevens, who's the producer and director of "Christmas in Washington," and his wife, Ali, who is the talent producer for "Christmas in Washington." I thank Dick Parsons, who is the chairman and the CEO of Time Warner, and his wife, Linda.
In this season of giving, we count our blessings, and we remember that we are called on to do good works for those in need. On a special day in Bethlehem, the birth of a child brought hope to the world. And at this time of year, we are especially grateful to those whose work brings hope and health to children.
"Christmas in Washington" supports the Children's National Medical Center. All year long, the doctors and nurses and staff of this hospital are providing care, restoring health, and putting the light back into the eyes of children. I thank tonight's sponsors and contributors for their support of this important work.
As we celebrate the holidays, we also remember the men and women who serve and defend America. Our military men and women and their families have the support and the gratitude of our entire Nation.
To all Americans, Laura and I wish you a joyful and peaceful holiday season. God bless you all, and Merry Christmas.
