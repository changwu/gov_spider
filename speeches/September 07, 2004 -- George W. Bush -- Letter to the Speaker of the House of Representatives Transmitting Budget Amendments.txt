    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2005 budget amendments for the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, and the Corps of Engineers. In total, these amendments would not increase the discretionary budget authority proposed in my FY 2005 Budget.
The details of these proposals are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
