    Alexandria, VA â€” Today, Senator Lindsey Graham responded to reports of Iran's apparent test launch of a new ballistic missile capable of reaching Israel and other U.S. allies:
"Iran's apparent test launch of a new precision-guided ballistic missile capable of hitting Israel and other U.S. allies is dangerous new evidence of President Obama's disastrous policies and complete lack of leadership in the Middle East. After capitulating to Iran on every major negotiating objective in his nuclear deal, which is set to release over $100 billion in funds to the Iranian regime, the Ayatollah has demonstrated exactly how he will use that money: building its war machine and strengthening its capacity to wreak havoc in the Middle East, terrorize our allies, and directly threaten the security of the United States. Just as Vladimir Putin has exposed President Obama's weakness by sending troops into Syria, the Ayatollah is demonstrating to the world that U.S. leadership under Obama is in retreat. I am running for president because we need a Commander in Chief who understands this region, will rebuild our capability and capacity to secure our homeland, and has the will to take the fight to our enemies when they directly threaten our safety and our interests."
