    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Hughes (D) New Jersey and Moorhead (R) California)
The Administration supports H.R. 2632, which is based on legislation proposed by the Department of Commerce.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2632 would increase offsetting receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate is that this bill would increase offsetting receipts by $2 million in FY 1994.
