    With five days to go until Republicans vote in South Carolina, Senator Fred Thompson's campaign is surging. A new Rasmussen poll released today shows the Tennessee Senator in a statistical dead heat for second place in the Palmetto State.
"Fred Thompson is surging in South Carolina, just as expected," said Campaign Manager Bill Lacy. "As South Carolina voters focus on Saturday's primary election, they agree that Fred is the true conservative in this race who can bring together the Reagan Coalition of limited government and strong national security."
According to the Rasmussen survey, "Over the past several days, the only real movement in South Carolina's Republican Presidential Primary has been a four-point gain for Fred Thompson and a five-point decline for Mike Huckabee."
The new poll results come on the heels of Sen. Thompson's winning debate performance last Thursday, which received praise from Rush Limbaugh, Bill Bennett and virtually every conservative blog and pundit.
Friends of Fred Thompson also announced today it will launch a new statewide television ad in South Carolina on Tuesday in which the senator speaks directly to voters stating, "Friends, we're in a fight for our conservative values." The spot, titled "Always," can be viewed at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmVJ7fQGC7Q
