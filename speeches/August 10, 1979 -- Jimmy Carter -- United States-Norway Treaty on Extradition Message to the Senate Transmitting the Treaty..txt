    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty of Extradition Between the United States of America and Norway signed at Oslo on June 9, 1977.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the treaty.
The treaty is one of a series of modern extradition treaties being negotiated by the United States. It expands the list of extraditable offenses to include aircraft hijacking and obstruction of justice, as well as other offenses not now covered by our existing treaty with Norway. Upon entry into force, it will terminate and supersede the existing Treaty of Extradition of 1893, the Amendatory Extradition Treaty of 1904, and the Supplementary Extradition Treaty of 1938.
This treaty will make a significant contribution to international cooperation in law enforcement. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
