    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Reps. Mica (D) Florida and Snowe (R) Maine)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 4151 but will work in the Senate and in Conference to modify a number of the bill's provisions.
The major areas requiring modification involve:
— amendment of titles I and III to reflect adequately the authority and responsibilities of the (1) Director of Central Intelligence for intelligence activities and the protection of sources and methods and (2) the Secretary of Defense as Executive Agent for communications and computer security.
— deletion of section 509, regarding restrictions on certain exports to countries supporting terrorism, since (1) existing legislation already provides ample authority for controlling such exports to terrorist-supporting countries and (2) it is Administration policy not to approve license applications for the export of military or dual use items that would make a significant contribution to the military capabilities of terrorist supporting countries;
— deletion from title IX of the unnecessary authorities and the authorization of appropriations for the Coast Guard, which are basically duplicative of existing Coast Guard authority and operations;
— deletion or amendment of certain provisions regarding international nuclear terrorism that are unnecessary or counterproductive; and
— combination into one annual report by the Secretary of State to the Congress of all but one group of the numerous reporting requirements scattered throughout the bill.
