    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Conyers (D) Michigan and one other)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 5241 but strongly believes that the bill should be amended in the Senate to incorporate the provisions of S. 1236, the Administration's package of minor and technical crime amendments, which passed the Senate on April 17, 1986. As the President noted in approving H.R. 4801 (Public Law 99-363) on July 11,
1986, early enactment of the Administration's comprehensive set of minor and technical proposals is highly preferable to the piecemeal approach taken by the House in considering that earlier legislation. The same is true of H.R. 5241.
