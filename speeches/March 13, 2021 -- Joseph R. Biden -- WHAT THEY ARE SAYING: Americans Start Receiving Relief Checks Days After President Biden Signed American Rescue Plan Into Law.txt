    On Friday, a day after President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan into law, Americans across the country began receiving their stimulus checks. 85% of American households will get direct aid from the relief package, which, for many families, will help put food on the table, pay rent, and keep the lights on. Americans took to social media to express the impact the relief checks will have on their ability to make it though the challenges brought on by the pandemic.
