Congratulations to legislators in New Jersey for not passing taxes that would have driven large numbers of high end taxpayers out of the state. Many were planning to leave & will now be staying. New York & others should start changing their thought process on taxes fast!Retweets: 14260Favorites: 66802

Thank you to President Moon of South Korea for hosting the American Delegation and me immediately following the very successful G-20 in Japan.

'In my opinion the President has done more good on the Korean issue in the last year and a half than President Obama did in eight years.

It is very hard and expensive to live in New York. Governor Andrew Cuomo uses his Attorney General as a bludgeoning tool for his own purposes. They sue on everything always in search of a crime. I even got sued on a Foundation which took Zero rent & expenses & gave away...Retweets: 19767Favorites: 91791

....New York businesses in search of anything at all they can find to make me look as bad as possible. So on top of ridiculously high taxes my children and companies are spending a fortune on lawyers. No wonder people and businesses are fleeing New York in record numbers!Retweets: 16327Favorites: 78716

That's right The Trump Foundation gave away 100% plus with Zero rent or expenses charged and has been being sued by Cuomo and New York State for years - another part of the political Witch Hunt. Just in case anyone is interested - Clinton Foundation never even looked at!Retweets: 25121Favorites: 91746
