White House In-Town Pool Report #1 — checking in
Good afternoon from the White House, where the weather is positively glorious: a cloudless Wedgwood sky and just a whisper of a breeze. Your pooler is tested*** and awaiting the call to gather for the first of two scheduled events with President Biden today.
Here's the schedule:
At 1.45 p.m. Eastern, President Biden will give remarks from the South Court Auditorium honoring the 230 recipients of the Presidential Rank Award, the most prestigious honor for career civil servants. Winners, who are granted the award for their "sustained extraordinary accomplishment," receive a cash bonus of 35 percent of their salary, plus a framed certificate and a gold pin.
At 4 p.m. Eastern, President Biden will celebrate Eid al-Fitr, the Muslim holiday marking the end of the Ramadan fast. The president will be joined in the East Room by Dr. Jill Biden and Doug(las) Emhoff.
Today's briefing is set for 2.30 p.m. Eastern.
More soon!
Best,
Scott
