    JOZSEF CARDINAL MINDSZENTY stood for courage, integrity, and unfailing faith. In his long life, he fought against tyranny wherever he encountered it.
There was an heroic quality about him that marked this man as a crusader for liberty as well as a man of spiritual contemplation.
His deep faith made him an inspiration not only to the Hungarian people he served and loved but to all those who value virtue, truth, and strength of will.
Cardinal Mindszenty will be missed. He will not be forgotten.
