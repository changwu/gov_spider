    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13536 of April 12, 2010, with respect to Somalia is to continue in effect beyond April 12, 2016.
On January 17, 2013, the United States Government announced its recognition of the Government of Somalia. Our first U.S. Ambassador to Somalia in over two decades is awaiting Senate confirmation. Although these developments demonstrate progress with respect to Somalia's stabilization, they do not remove the importance of U.S. sanctions, especially against persons and entities who have threatened the peace, security, or stability of Somalia (including those responsible for acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia) or acted in violation of the United Nations Security Council arms embargo. For this reason, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency with respect to Somalia and to maintain in force the sanctions to respond to this threat.
Sincerely,
BARACK OBAMA
