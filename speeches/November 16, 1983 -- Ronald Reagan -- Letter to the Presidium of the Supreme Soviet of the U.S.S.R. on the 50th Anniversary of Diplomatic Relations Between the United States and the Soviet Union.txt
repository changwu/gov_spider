    To: The Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet
Fifty years have passed since diplomatic relations were established between our countries. As we note this anniversary, I hope that we can recommit ourselves to working constructively on the problems before us.
The United States has no higher aim nor more urgent goal than achieving and preserving world peace and security.
Let us seek ways, despite the differences in our governments, philosophies and values, to cooperate in reducing international tensions and creating a safer world.
If we can work together to this end, we shall be fulfilling the promise of November 16, 1933, when formal ties between our countries began.
RONALD REAGAN
Mr. President:
November 16th will mark 50 years from the moment of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America. This is a major landmark in relations between our two states.
In establishing diplomatic relations, both sides proceeded from a recognition of the fundamental difference in their socio-economic systems, but at the same time from a recognition that this difference is not an obstacle to normal interstate relations.
This principle is of lasting significance. The Soviet state, unfailingly devoted to the cause of peace among peoples and to the development of equitable, mutually advantageous relations, is to this day firmly guided by this principle in its relations with the USA.
We assume that there is a basis in our countries for proper appreciation of the significance of such a date as the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations.
