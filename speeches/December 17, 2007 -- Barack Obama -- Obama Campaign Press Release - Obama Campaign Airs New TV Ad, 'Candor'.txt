    Ad Shows That For Obama, "It's Not Politics As Usual"
Des Moines, IA - Today the Obama Campaign began airing a new television advertisement in Iowa entitled, "Candor."
The ad highlights Obama's "refreshing" candor as described by the Des Moines Register's David Yepsen and his "scrupulous honesty." The ad also shows how Obama has taken on powerful interests - by offering a universal health care plan that cuts costs for the typical American family by $2500 per year, by challenging Wall Street executives to protect the interests of Main Street, and by consistently standing up for middle class families - even when it's not convenient.
