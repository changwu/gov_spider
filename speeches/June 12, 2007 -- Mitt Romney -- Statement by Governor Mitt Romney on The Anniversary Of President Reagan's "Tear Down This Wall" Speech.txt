Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement to mark the 20th anniversary of President Reagan's "Tear Down This Wall" speech:
"Twenty years ago, standing at the Brandenburg Gate, Ronald Reagan delivered one of his most memorable and inspiring speeches demanding that the Soviet Union 'tear down' a wall which had fractured Germany and Europe for decades. Two years later, the world watched as the people of Berlin and Germany took the first step towards reconciliation and brought that wall down.
"On the twentieth anniversary of Ronald Reagan's speech, we remember his courage in challenging tyranny and celebrate what became a rallying cry for the German people's dream of a free and unified Germany."
