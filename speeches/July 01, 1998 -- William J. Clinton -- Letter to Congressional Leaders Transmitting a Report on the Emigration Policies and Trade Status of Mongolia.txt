    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
On September 4, 1996, I determined and reported to the Congress that Mongolia was "not in violation of " the freedom of emigration criteria of sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974. This action allowed for the continuation of most-favored-nation status for Mongolia and certain other activities without the requirement of an annual waiver.
As required by law, I am submitting an updated report to Congress concerning the emigration laws and policies of Mongolia. You will find that the report indicates continued Mongolian compliance with U.S. and international standards in the area of emigration.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
