Never thought I'd say this but I think @johnrobertsFox and @JillianTurner @FoxNews have even less understanding of the Wall negotiations than the folks at FAKE NEWS CNN & NBC! Look to final results! Don't know how my poll numbers are so good especially up 19% with Hispanics?Retweets: 2386Favorites: 9078

Tariffs on the 'dumping' of Steel in the United States have totally revived our Steel Industry. New and expanded plants are happening all over the U.S. We have not only saved this important industry but created many jobs. Also billions paid to our treasury. A BIG WIN FOR U.S.Retweets: 27849Favorites: 125958

Howard Schultz doesn't have the 'guts' to run for President! Watched him on @60Minutes last night and I agree with him that he is not the 'smartest person.' Besides America already has that! I only hope that Starbucks is still paying me their rent in Trump Tower!Retweets: 23035Favorites: 112069
