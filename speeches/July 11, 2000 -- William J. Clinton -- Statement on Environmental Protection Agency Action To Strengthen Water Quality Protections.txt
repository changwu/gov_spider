    Today's action by the Environmental Protection Agency to strengthen water quality protections nationwide is a critical, commonsense step to ensure clean, safe water for all Americans. While we have made tremendous progress over the past quarter-century, too many of our rivers, lakes, and bays are still too polluted for fishing or swimming. With the new strategy we launch today, we will work in close partnership with States and communities to tackle our remaining pollution threats and complete the job of cleaning up America's precious waterways.
