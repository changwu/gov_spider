    Today, Jill and I join with the people of France in marking five years since the horrific ISIS terrorist attacks in Paris, which took the lives of 130 innocent people and wounded nearly 500 others. This was an assault not just on the people of Paris but against our common humanity and shared values. My administration will work steadfastly to protect the safety and security of Americans and our allies and partners, countering terrorism and extremist violence in all of its forms â€” no matter the ideology or origin. We will restore and improve cooperation with our partners and allies, including France, in order to confront the many shared challenges we face.
