    500 Come Out for Clinton, Largest Crowd in Recent Memory for Berlin Campaign Event
Berlin, NH -- Hillary Clinton's kick-off event in Berlin, New Hampshire this morning drew a record crowd for the small North Country city.
Three hundred people packed Berlin's City Hall and 200 people filled an overflow room across the street to capacity. It's the first time in recent memory that a presidential candidate has kicked off a campaign in the North Country and has drawn a crowd this size.
Clinton's decision to kick off her New Hampshire campaign in Berlin reflects her commitment to running a strong campaign in the Granite State. It's also a metaphor for the kind of national campaign she'd run as the Democratic nominee in 2008: Just as she will visit every corner of New Hampshire, she'll campaign in communities throughout the country.
