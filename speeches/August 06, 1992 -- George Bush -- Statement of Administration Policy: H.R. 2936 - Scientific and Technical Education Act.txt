    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 8/7/92)(House)(Price (D) North Carolina and 64 others)
The Administration supports the goal of providing greater opportunities for scientific and technical education. However, the Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 2936. The National Science Foundation (NSF) already has the authority in its Organic Act necessary to carry out the objectives and programs of H.R. 2936. In fact, NSF is currently supporting programs for curricular reform; assistance for academically unprepared students; and partnerships between two-year colleges and the private sector.
