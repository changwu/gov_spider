    Verona, PA - This evening, in a message to her many supporters at the Eagle Forum, venerable conservative leader Phyllis Schlafly said:
"This is just a quick note to my Missouri friends to let you know that I'm planning to vote for Rick Santorum in the non-binding presidential preference primary on Tuesday, February 7.
Faithfully,
Phyllis Schlafly"
