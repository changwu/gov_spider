    The United States offers condolences to the families and loved ones of those who perished on Indonesia Air Asia Flight 8501, and our thoughts and prayers are with those who await news on the passengers and crew who remain missing. At the request of the Government of Indonesia, the United States Navy has already deployed the USS SAMPSON to support the search and rescue effort, and is ready to deploy another ship if needed. We continue to work with Indonesia to identify what additional resources may be required, and the United States stands ready to provide additional assistance during this difficult time.
