    One of the most enjoyable things I do as the President is to hear stories of my fellow citizens, stories of compassion, stories of care. I just talked to social entrepreneurs who have decided to help improve the lives of our service men and women and their families. There are some remarkable acts of kindness by people who have taken it upon themselves to serve their country by helping a neighbor in need. And whether it be helping the chaplains help kids, or whether it be helping a family of the injured, whether it be working at Walter Reed, or supporting troops getting ready to go into combat, these good men and women really represent the very best of America.
I ask my fellow citizens to support our troops and their families. There are all kinds of ways you can find out how to do so. AmericaSupportsYou.mil, for example, is a web site that if you really do want to participate like these citizens have, that you can find out a way to contribute your time, your money, your talents to really send a message that America supports these brave volunteers who are out defending our country in the war on terror.
And so I thank you all for joining us. It's been my great pleasure to hear from you. I'm proud to be the President of a country with so many decent citizens. Thank you.
