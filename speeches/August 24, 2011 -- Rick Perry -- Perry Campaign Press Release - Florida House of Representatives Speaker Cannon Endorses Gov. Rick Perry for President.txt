    TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, Dean Cannon (R-Winter Park, Fla.), today endorsed Governor Rick Perry in the Republican Primary for President of the United States.
"President Obama's big-government, Washington experiment has cost our nation more than 2.3 million jobs," said Speaker Cannon. "Meanwhile, since just June 2009, Rick Perry's Texas is responsible for approximately 40 percent of the net new jobs in America."
"America is at a crossroads. Time and time again, President Obama's agenda has damaged the confidence of the private sector and made it harder — not easier — to create the jobs Americans desperately need," continued Speaker Cannon. "The President has failed, and it's time for a different approach."
"Governor Perry knows that we must reduce government spending. You cannot tax your way into prosperity, and you cannot borrow your way out of debt. Governor Perry's record of creating jobs and cutting spending is exactly what we need to get our country back on track, and I am excited to support his campaign to get America working again," Speaker Cannon said.
"I am honored to have Dean Cannon's support and look forward to working with him to build a strong campaign in Florida. I know that with Speaker Cannon's help, we will win Florida's primary, the Republican nomination, and ultimately, the Presidency."
