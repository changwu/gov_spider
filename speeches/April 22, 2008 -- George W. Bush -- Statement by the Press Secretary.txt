    The President is pleased to receive the Federal Environmental Executive's 2004-2006 Report on the Federal government's environmental and energy efficiency accomplishments. The report shows that Federal agencies have significantly increased their use of renewable energy and alternative fuel vehicles and continue to purchase more energy efficient and environmentally friendly products. These actions have resulted in decreased energy consumption, reduced pollution, and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
According to the report, by Fiscal Year 2005, Federal agencies had improved energy efficiency by almost 30 percent over the prior 20 years. Last year the President signed an Executive Order requiring Federal Agencies to lead by example and called for an additional 30 percent reduction in the next ten years. In addition, the number of federal facilities that have implemented or initiated implementation of environmental management systems (EMS) increased from 180 in 2001 to 2,378 in 2006. The President is pleased with the progress that we have made, and with our commitment to the future.
The Federal government should lead by example in environmental stewardship, while meeting its mission in an efficient and reliable manner. Today's report shows that through intelligent stewardship and sustainable practices, Federal agencies are significantly improving the environment and helping to promote the use of more energy efficient, technologies, and products.
