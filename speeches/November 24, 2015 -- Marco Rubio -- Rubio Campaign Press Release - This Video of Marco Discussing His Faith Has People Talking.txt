Toward the end of his answer, he talked about how he handles his own doubts about his faith:
We are biblically ordered not to be afraid. You know why? Because God is telling us no matter what happens it it's part of my plan. I will give you the strength to endure it whether you like it or not. And so every time we fear, every time we're anxious about something, what we're basically saying is I know that God is very powerful but this problem is so big that not even God can solve it, it's going to be up to me to solve it . . .
If we did take more time to do that, to stop, and ask for that guidance, which, you're not going to get the answer that you want. That's not what we pray for, we pray for peace, and we're ordered to have peace. . . .
In the daily occurrences of everyday life, when your faith is being tested, you're constantly reminded that you should be turning to God in all things, the big and the little. . . .
Because the question was, how could God allow these bad things to happen, and it always challenges us to understand that God's ways are not our ways. What we may interpret as bad and what most certainly is in the case of Paris or 9/11, even that is part of a broader plan for the universe and our lives that we're just not going to know the answer to. God's ways are not our ways . . .
