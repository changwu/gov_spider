    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Saxton (R) New Jersey and 10 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports the goals of conserving and protecting coral reef ecosystems. However, as explained below, the Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 2233.
Ten years ago, the Congress created the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to provide federal agencies with a vehicle for forming private-public partnerships for natural resource conservation. The effort, which has included coral reef conservation projects, has been highly successful in attracting private donors to match limited federal funds. Creation of a new grant program in the Commerce Department is duplicative and unnecessary.
