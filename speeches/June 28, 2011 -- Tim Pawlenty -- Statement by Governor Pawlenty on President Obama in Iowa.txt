    "Speeches like the one President Obama gave today will not create a single job. Leadership that is heavy on rhetoric and light on results does not grow our economy. We need a President who will not only talk about making tough choices, but actually has a record of results. As President, I will set ambitious economic goals and pass spending cuts and free-market reforms. America cannot afford more leadership that talks a good game but then cannot deliver."
