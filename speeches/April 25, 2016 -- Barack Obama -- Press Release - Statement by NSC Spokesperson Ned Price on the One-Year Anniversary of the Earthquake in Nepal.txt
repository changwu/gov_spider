    One year ago today a devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Nepal, killing nearly 9,000 people, injuring tens of thousands more, and leaving millions without homes. Today we remember those who perished in the earthquake and its massive aftershocks. We are humbled by those who risked their lives to save others, including the six United States Marines who perished in Nepal while providing relief to Nepalis in need. As we honor the victims, we draw inspiration from Nepalis of all walks of life - men and women, young and old, from the mountains, the hills, the plains, and even overseas - who came together after the tragedy to aid the survivors and rebuild their country.
Much of the hard work of rebuilding Nepal still lies ahead. The United States Government and the American people will continue to extend our friendship and partnership to Nepal as we work together to ensure a brighter, more prosperous, and safer future for all Nepalis.
