    REPORTER. Any thoughts on the court ruling this morning on the constitutionality of your oil tariff?
THE PRESIDENT. We are analyzing, of course, the decision by the Circuit Court of Appeals, and I will not know until later this afternoon what the Department of Justice and what my White House Counsel will recommend. But sometime this afternoon, I can give you a decision.
Q. Was there a thought of taking that off anyway when decontrols lapsed?
THE PRESIDENT. That, of course, is an option that exists, and I have indicated on several occasions that we had a number of administrative options, and that is in the group that we will have to look at if and when we decontrol, which we probably will.
REPORTER. Have a nice game, Mr. President. Thank you.
