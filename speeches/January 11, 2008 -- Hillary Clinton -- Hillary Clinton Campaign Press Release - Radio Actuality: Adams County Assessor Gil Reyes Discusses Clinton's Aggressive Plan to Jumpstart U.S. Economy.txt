    (Adams County, CO) - Adams County Assessor Gil Reyes today discussed Hillary Clinton's aggressive $70 billion economic stimulus package and its importance to Colorado.
"In Adams County we are hurting. The foreclosure crisis is not just affecting homeowners; it is hurting our schools and our neighborhoods, and is forcing people to leave our communities."
"I applaud Hillary's plan to stimulate our economy. It will empower families to remain in their homes and keep their kids in school within our community."
"This is the kind of aggressive response that has been missing and is needed to get our economy back on track."
