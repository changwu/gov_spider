    Legislative Agenda on Education
The President. Thank you all for coming this afternoon. I've had the honor of hosting a group of distinguished folks who have had experience with Government here, that happen to be of the Democrat persuasion. We had a discussion about— an advisory session about what to think about in Washington, about how to move issues such as education. We've spent a lot of time talking about education and how to get an education agenda moving forward in this important town.
I can't thank the former Senators and a man who has seen enough Klieglights in his day to know what they're all about, and of course, the Ambassador and Bill Gray, the distinguished chairman of the United Negro College Fund, for being here. For me, it's been a very helpful discussion.
Ambassador Strauss said something that's really important and is so true. He reminded me that Democrats are just as patriotic about their country as Republicans, that there is good in everybody. And that's what I'm going to look for. This administration is going to seek the good in everybody and find that ability to come together for the good of the country, as well.
So I want to thank these distinguished citizens of the country for being here, people who brought class and distinction when they held power and set a good legacy for those of us who follow.
Thank you.
Mr. Ambassador, do you want to say something?
Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Robert Strauss. I want to say, all of us are delighted to be here, and all of us are pleased that the President extended this invitation. I think that the group not only is appreciative, but they've tried to be responsible to the discussion.
Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, how do you square your decision—how do you square your decision, Mr. President to——
The President. I'm not sure. [Laughter]
