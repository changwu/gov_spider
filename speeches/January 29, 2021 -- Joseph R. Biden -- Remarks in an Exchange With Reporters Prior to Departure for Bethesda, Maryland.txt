The President's Visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland/Coronavirus Vaccine Distribution 
Q. Mr. President, why are you going to Walter Reed?
The President. I'm going out to visit some of the soldiers and sailors that are—been wounded and look at the vaccination procedure.
I've been at Walter Reed a lot. I spent almost 6 months there myself as a patient. And in addition to that, as Vice President, every single Christmas, we spent all of Christmas Day at Walter Reed. These kids are amazing.
And thank God there's not as many people to visit, so all the people I'm seeing today, who are being treated, or—four of them amputees—are people who, in fact, are retired and—but they're real heroes.
And then, we're going to go see the vaccination distribution. So they're—I spent a lot of time at Walter Reed. They're great Americans. They're great people.
Nice to see you all.
