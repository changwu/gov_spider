    My dear Mr. Lewis:
I am sorry that in your letter to me early this afternoon you have not replied to my request that, in the interest of the defense of our country, the captive coal mines be kept running.
Whatever may be the issues between you and Mr. Taylor or you and Mr. Morgan, the larger question of adequate fuel supply is of greater interest and import to the national welfare. There is every reason for the continuance of negotiations. There is no reason for stoppage of work.
It is, therefore, essential that the mining of coal should go on without interruption.
For the third time your Government, through me asks you and the officers of the United Mine Workers to authorize an immediate resumption of mining.
Very sincerely yours,
