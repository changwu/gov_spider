    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Boucher (D) Virginia and Brown (D) California)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3254 with amendments to conform the appropriations authorizations for FYs 1995 and 1996 to the requests in the President's Budget. This would require a decrease in the authorizations for modernization of academic research facilities and an increase for high priority research and education activities. Assistance for academic facilities is being addressed through an interagency process coordinated by the National Science and Technology Council. In addition:

-- Section 211, "Indirect Cost Reimbursement," should be deleted so that indirect cost recovery can be addressed on a government-wide basis to treat all universities and other grantees and contractors fairly.
-- Section 501, "Requirement for Funding," should be deleted. The additional reporting requirement placed on grantees is counter to the recommendations of the National Performance Review. The need for the detailed information has not been demonstrated and the costs would be borne at the local level without reimbursement. 
These and other amendments will be sought to improve the Foundation's ability to carry out effectively its responsibilities.
