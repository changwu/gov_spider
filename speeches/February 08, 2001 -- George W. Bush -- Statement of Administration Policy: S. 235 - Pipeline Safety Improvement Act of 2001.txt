    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(McCain (R) Arizona and 7 co-sponsors)
The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 235, which would significantly strengthen the enforcement of pipeline safety laws. The Administration appreciates the Senate's action in making consideration of pipeline safety legislation one of its first priorities. The tragic deaths last year of 12 family members in Carlsbad, New Mexico, and the earlier deaths of three youths in Bellingham, Washington, underscore the need for action.
The Administration looks forward to working further with Congress to secure enactment of pipeline safety legislation.
