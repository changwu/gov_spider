    President Bush has invited President Boris Trajkovski of Macedonia for a meeting at the White House on May 2. Macedonia, a democratic and multi-ethnic state in the Balkans, is a good friend and partner to the United States and plays an important role in support of US and NATO operations in Kosovo. The visit will underscore the United States' strong endorsement of President Trajkovski's efforts to broaden the inter-ethnic dialogue in Macedonia and resolve peacefully the current insurgency there. Secretary Powell delivered the invitation from President Bush during his meeting with President Trajkovski in Skopje on April 12.
