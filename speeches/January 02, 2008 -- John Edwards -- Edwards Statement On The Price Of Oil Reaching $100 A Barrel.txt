    Des Moines, Iowa â€“ Today, Senator John Edwards released the following statement on the price of oil reaching $100 a barrel:
"Today's report that the price of oil has reached $100 a barrel is just another example of how corporate greed is squeezing the middle class. This increase shows the urgency of taking on the big oil companies so we can build a new energy economy and transition away from oil to other affordable sources of energy.
"And in the short term, we must take immediate steps to help families struggling with unaffordable home heating costs this winter. I have called on President Bush to release oil from the strategic petroleum reserve and fully fund LIHEAP to help families with the increased cost of oil.
"America's dependence on oil not only leaves families vulnerable to rising prices, but it compromises our national security and contributes to the crisis of global warming. It's time for us to rise up and take on the corporate greed that is taking over our democracy so we can leave a better America to our children."
