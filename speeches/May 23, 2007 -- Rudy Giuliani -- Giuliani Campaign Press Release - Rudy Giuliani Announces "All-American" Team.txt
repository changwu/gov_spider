    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee announced today the early leaders of Mayor Giuliani's new "All-American" Team. The Team is comprised of professional men and women under the age of 45 from all across the country and from various industry sectors. The goal of the initiative is to engage both young political veterans and newcomers in the political process, as well as help recruit new leaders to Team Rudy.
Each member of the Team has made a financial commitment to raise money for the Committee at one of the following levels: $25,000 All-American Pitcher; $50,000 All-American Slugger; $100,000 All-American All Star; $200,000 All-American MVP; and $1,000,000 All-American Team Captain.
Bryan Pickens, President of Pickens Capital, is serving as the "All-American" Team National Chairman. He is the owner of a successful investment company in Dallas and serves on the board of several organizations, including the Texas Parks & Wildlife Foundation and the Circle Ten Council of the Boy Scouts of America. President George W. Bush appointed Mr. Pickens to serve on the White House Commission on Presidential Scholars and he is the founding Chairman of Maverick PAC USA.
"I enjoy working with the "All-American" Team. This is a tremendous network of young professionals supporting and working to elect Rudy Giuliani as the next President of the United States," said Bryan Pickens.
"We are excited to have so many young successful business leaders join Team Rudy, get involved in the campaign and make their voices heard," said National Finance Chairman Roy Bailey.
