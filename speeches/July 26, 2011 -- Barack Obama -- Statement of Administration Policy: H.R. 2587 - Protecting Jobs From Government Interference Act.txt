(House Rules)
(Rep. Scott, R-SC, and 18 cosponsors)
The Administration opposes H.R. 2587 because it undermines enforcement of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The NLRA establishes the legal rights of employers and employees with respect to workplace organizing and collective bargaining. The NLRA does not restrict the location of company operations, provided companies comply with the law. H.R. 2587 would leave employees no meaningful recourse in certain situations where an employer has violated the NLRA.
