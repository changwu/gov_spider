    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced it will launch a new radio ad in Iowa, entitled "Them." The ad highlights Rudy Giuliani's fiscally conservative record as Mayor of New York and draws sharp contrasts between his forward looking economic plan for America and that of the Democrats.
Script for "Them":
VOICE OVER: "Here's Rudy Giuliani."
MAYOR GIULIANI: "Democrats want to move in the direction of much bigger government, socialized medicine, increasing government regulation, much higher taxes.

"They are making the promise to raise taxes, the only thing I can tell you in addition to that is that they'll raise taxes even more then they promised. They want to take more of the people's money.
"I want to give the people back more of their own money, because I know that's going to create more jobs for us. Lower taxes â€“ you are going to see your economy grow. Raise taxes and we are going to see ourselves in a very, very difficult situation, with fewer jobs and jobs fleeing America. When I was mayor of New York they gave me this group of recommendations to raise taxes and raise fees and I immediately threw it in the garbage can.
"Instead I did just the opposite. I lowered taxes. I reduced the growth of government. I made government more accountable, and New York City boomed. A deficit to a surplus. From high unemployment to low unemployment. I have no question that I can the same thing for Washington that I did for New York City."
