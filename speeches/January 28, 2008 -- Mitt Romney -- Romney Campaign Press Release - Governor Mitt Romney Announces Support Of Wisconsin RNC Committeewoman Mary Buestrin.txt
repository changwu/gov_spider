Boston, MA â€“ Today, Wisconsin Republican National Committeewoman Mary Buestrin announced her endorsement of Governor Mitt Romney. Committeewoman Buestrin has a long history of working in Wisconsin Republican politics to promote conservative policies and candidates with proven conservative principles of leadership.
"Committeewoman Buestrin is a dedicated Republican leader and her support will be a big help as we campaign across Wisconsin talking to voters about bringing real conservative change to Washington," said Governor Romney. "I look forward to working with her to share my optimistic vision for the future of our country."
Committeewoman Buestrin added, "Governor Romney has impressed me with his leadership and his optimism as he discusses our nation's future. We need real change in Washington, and Governor Romney is the candidate who will roll up his sleeves and get to work on day one to strengthen the economy, the military and our families. He has done this in the private sector, at the 2002 Winter Olympics and as Governor, and I know he will do the same as President. I encourage Wisconsin voters to join me in supporting the candidate with the experience we need, Governor Mitt Romney."
Committeewoman Buestrin joins U.S. Congressman Tom Petri and the Wisconsin Romney for President Finance Steering Committee who have been previously announced as supporting Governor Romney's campaign for the Republican nomination.
