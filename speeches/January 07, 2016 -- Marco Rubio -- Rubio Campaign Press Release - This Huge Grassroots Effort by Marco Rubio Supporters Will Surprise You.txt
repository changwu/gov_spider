Illinois has some of the toughest rules for qualifying for the presidential ballot anywhere in the country. 
To get it done, campaigns often spend tens of thousands of dollars hiring consultants to gather signatures.
@marcorubio Marco Rubio is on the ballot in the state of Illinois. We worked for this. Now on to victory!

Marco's campaign filed for the ballot this week, and we did something a little different: All of the thousands of signatures in Illinois were gathered by volunteers. 
Team Marco didn't pay anyone to collect a single signature.
Even the bitter cold can't keep us from collecting signatures for @marcorubio in Illinois! @_SFRNC #signformarco pic.twitter.com/q7thy08jUu

Team Marco volunteers got the job done, and were fired up doing it.

Illinois co-chair Sen. Mike Connelly praised the effort:
It tells the story that some 400 volunteers secured Marco Rubio's place on the Illinois primary ballot. He is a candidate who can unite Republicans and inspire the next generation of conservative leadership in America.
Illinois Republicans will have their opportunity to vote for Marco on March 15th — we're already off to a good start there!
