To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the provisions of Section 5305 of Title 5 of the United States Code, I hereby report on the comparability adjustment I am ordering for the Federal statutory pay systems in October 1976.
The Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Chairman of the United States Civil Service Commission, who serve jointly as my agent for Federal pay, have proposed a 4.83 percent average increase in pay rates for the Federal statutory pay systems. The Advisory Committee on Federal Pay and the Federal Employees Pay Council have proposed adjustments of 5.82 percent and 8.2 percent, respectively.
I have decided that I should choose the 4.83 percent increase. My selection of this proposal will implement immediately several reforms which are clearly necessary for the continued integrity of the pay adjustment process.
I am transmitting herewith the reports of my agent and the Advisory Committee, as well as a copy of the Executive order [11941] I have promulgated to put this pay adjustment into effect.
