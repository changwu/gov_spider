That candidate should be John Kasich, the Ohio governor who offers a heaping measure of maturity, competence and experience to a GOP race that has taken on the air of a junior high class officer's election. Kasich also possesses the temperament that can command respect both at home and abroad.
Those should be the minimum qualifications for a nominee. And yet, of the remaining candidates, only Kasich has demonstrated them consistently on the campaign trail. It doesn't hurt that Kasich also has a record of success in Ohio and, before that, in Congress.
Under his leadership the past five years, state taxes have been slashed by nearly $5 billion. The budget, once facing an $8 billion shortfall, is now enjoying a surplus. The jobless rate has fallen to 5.2 percent, from above 9 percent when he took office. Ohio's economy has grown at twice the Midwest average, as has household income. America could use those kind of numbers.
Kasich is continuing in Ohio what he began as a congressman. In 1997, he was a key player in the deal that led to a rare balanced federal budget, and was also a driver of sensible welfare reform. And 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee highlights his national security background. The congressional experience rounds out a resume that should give voters confidence that Kasich can handle challenges both domestically and overseas.
