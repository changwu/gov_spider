    Recently the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the government had acted lawfully in imposing market-oriented rates for parking facilities used by Federal employees. The regulation, which took effect on November 1, 1979, directed agencies to develop procedures to charge fees based on the ongoing commercial rate of the area. A legal challenge resulted in a March 1981 decision by the U.S. District Court blocking further implementation of the fee schedule and ordering the refunding of fees already collected.
The government can now resume collection of parking fees. After consulting a delegation of Members of Congress, including Marjorie Holt, Stan Parris, and Frank Wolf, I have decided, however, not to do so. To resume those fees would impose yet another financial burden upon thousands of hard-pressed Federal employees who have had only 4.8 percent increases in their pay.
Many employees have limited access to public transportation and appreciate the flexibility and security of automobiles. I feel that energy conservation goals will not be affected by this decision, since existing car pool and van pool priorities at parking facilities will remain in effect.
