    I am pleased to receive the Church of God in Christ's strong endorsement of my Faith-Based and Community Initiative. The Church of God in Christ's support is even greater evidence that people dedicated to serving their communities and neighbors are fully supportive of my plan. This influential organization joins groups including the Roman Catholic Bishops, Salvation Army, Prison Fellowship, and AMEN, our Nation's largest Latino community-serving ministries network, in supporting this important initiative.
