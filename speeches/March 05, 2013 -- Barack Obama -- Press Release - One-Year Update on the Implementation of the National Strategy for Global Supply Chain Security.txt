    The National Strategy for Global Supply Chain Security, released in January 2012, established the U.S. Government's policy to strengthen the global supply chain to protect the interests of the American people and enhance our Nation's economic prosperity.
The Administration, in coordination with private sector stakeholders and foreign government partners, made significant progress in implementing the Strategy throughout 2012 and in defining our priorities for future work. As required by the Strategy, Federal Departments and Agencies prepared a consolidated report outlining these efforts and defining 2013 implementation goals. The public version of this report is available HERE.
