He seems dedicated to putting it once again in the business of formulating America's foreign policy at home and conducting it with America's friends and enemies overseas."

"Shaheen, for all of our differences, has been one of the grown-ups in Washington on foreign policy.

As CIA director, he has been a professional, demonstrating his competence and qualification to be secretary of state.... Pompeo deserves Senate confirmation."
NATIONAL REVIEW: Pompeo Deserves Confirmation
"Mike Pompeo is qualified to be secretary of state. There is no doubt about that. He is competent — as director of the CIA, he has managed a complex organization deftly, winning the respect of intelligence professionals... He is experienced... he has served in Washington, initially as a congressman, since 2011. He is highly credentialed — he graduated top of his class at West Point and went to Harvard Law School, where he edited the Harvard Law Review."
WASHINGTON EXAMINER: A Soldier then a Spy, Pompeo Now Must Don the Diplomat's Hat
"We hope the Senate will approve CIA Director Mike Pompeo's appointment as secretary of state... Diplomacy and America First can go together. We think Pompeo — both a tough guy who has Trump's respect and a smart guy who understands how hard and how crucial geopolitics can be — is the man who can arrange this marriage."
THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Party Over Country
"There is no question Pompeo is qualified. He graduated from West Point at the top of his class. He served as a tank officer in the U.S. Army and patrolled the Berlin Wall before its fall. He went to Harvard Law School and was an editor of its famous law review. He built a successful business and, after his election to the House of Representatives from Kansas's Fourth District, established himself as a leader on foreign policy and national security issues. He served three terms in Congress, and then Trump picked him to run the Central Intelligence Agency.... Pompeo is a smart, thoughtful leader who has the trust and the ear of the country's president. He's used his influence to shape Trump's thinking on such difficult issues as Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, and North Korea."
