    Mexico-U.S. Antidrug Efforts
Q. President Zedillo, could you——
President Zedillo. The press conference will be later on, and I'll be delighted to answer there any questions.
Q. Well, while we've got this opportunity, let me just clarify what the Mexican Government's position is on DEA agents being allowed——
President Zedillo. No, we'll talk about that in the press conference. Now we have to have our private conservation, and I have spoken about that before.
Thank you.
Q. Do you want DEA agents to stay here——
President Zedillo. We'll speak about all of those issues later.
President's Visit
Q. Mr. President, are you sorry you waited until the 5th year of your Presidency to come to Mexico?
President Clinton. I'm just glad to be here now. You know, we've had—I'm coming to Latin America 3 times in less than a year, and in the first term I did a lot of work on it. You know, we had the Summit of the Americas, and we had a lot of involvement with Mexico with NAFTA and the difficulty with the peso, so I think we've had a lot of very close contact. And I'm glad to be here. I like it here.
