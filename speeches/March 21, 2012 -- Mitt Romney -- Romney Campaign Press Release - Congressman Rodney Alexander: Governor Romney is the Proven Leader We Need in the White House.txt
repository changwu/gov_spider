    Louisiana Congressman Rodney Alexander made the following statement on Louisiana's upcoming primary:
"Governor Romney's strong victory last night shows that Republicans of all stripes are uniting behind his campaign and his bold economic plan is just what Louisiana needs. By lowering taxes and reducing burdensome regulations, Louisiana small businesses will flourish and our energy sector will help us become less reliant on foreign oil. I support Governor Romney because our country can't afford four more years of President Obama and his failed policies, and we need Governor Romney to turn things around. I urge all Louisianans who want a conservative businessman and proven leader in the White House to support Mitt Romney on Saturday."
