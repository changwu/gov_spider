Boston, MA - Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement today regarding Peru's Independence Day, which will be celebrated on Saturday:
"On the 186th anniversary of Peru's independence, we celebrate the contributions of the Peruvian-American community to the economic, civic and family life of the United States. We also express our support for the Peruvian people who have fought to strengthen their nation's democracy. For many years, Peruvians have made significant progress against terrorism and drugs and have demonstrated their commitment to free markets and the rule of law.
"Latin America stands at a crossroads, with one path leading to freedom and prosperity and the other to the disappointment and misery that tyrants have imposed on the region for decades. The United States must strengthen its partnership with Peru, and this means Congress must move forward with the pending free trade agreement. In order to help realize the promise of prosperity in the Western Hemisphere, we cannot allow mutually beneficial efforts like our trade agreement with Peru - negotiated in good faith with our friends - to languish as our Congressional leaders show a fundamental disrespect for one of our strongest allies. The best way to confront leftist tyrants in the region today is to embrace our allies and strengthen the relationships that benefit all of our people."
