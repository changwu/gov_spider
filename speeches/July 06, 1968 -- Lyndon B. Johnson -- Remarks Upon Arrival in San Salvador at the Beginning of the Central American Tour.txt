    President Sanchez, my fellow Presidents of Central America and their ladies, ladies and gentlemen:
I come to San Salvador to learn. I come to find out from my fellow Presidents what our nations have achieved toward improving the lives of the people. I come to ask what more can we do together.
I know that in a few short years you have virtually completed the framework of a common market. More than that, you have moved beyond the purely economic aspects of integration to produce important social advances.
This great work is vital to every citizen of these lands and to their children. And to the cause of Central American integration, my Government has given wholehearted support. Where we saw we could help, we have helped.
--We have helped to provide more than 8 million textbooks and 250,000 teacher guides.
--We have helped to create the resources of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration, which today total more than $200 million.
--We are helping to eradicate malaria, improving nutrition, and raising agricultural productivity.
But nothing would have been possible without the leadership and determination of the Central Americans themselves. And it must always be so.
The unity that we seek is above all else a state of mind.
--If we all believe that societies can and must change, they will.
--If we all believe that men can and must cooperate with each other to insure peace and progress, they will.
--If we all believe that poverty and misery, disease and injustice can and must be eliminated, they will. So we come to San Salvador knowing all of this. And I come to learn how we can hasten the day of progress.
We know this is going to be an exciting experience. We thank you so much for your gracious and your warm welcome. We look forward to seeing more of your beautiful land.
