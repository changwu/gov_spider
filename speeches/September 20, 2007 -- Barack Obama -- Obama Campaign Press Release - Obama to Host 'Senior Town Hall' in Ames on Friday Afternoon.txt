    Unveils New TV Ad Touting Obama's Universal Health Care Plan
Des Moines, IA - The presidential campaign of Senator Barack Obama today announced he will host a "Senior Town Hall Meeting" - bringing together senior citizens and high schools seniors -- in Ames tomorrow. At the meeting, Obama will answer questions and participate in a conversation about his vision for uniting Americans, young and old, behind the effort to change Washington.
"Americans of all ages, from high school seniors to senior citizens, are tired of being divided by Washington politicians looking to score political points," Obama said. "We're building a grassroots movement of generations of Americans who are ready to challenge the divisive, special interest-driven system in Washington and unite the country around our shared values."
Obama's campaign will also begin airing a new 30-second television ad in Iowa on Friday in which Obama highlights his commitment to changing the system in Washington and reforming our nation's health care system. The ad, titled "Mother", opens with Obama talking directly to the camera about how his mother was burdened by a failing health care system as she battled cancer during the last few months of her life.

"For twenty years Washington's talked about health care reform and reformed nothing," Obama says in the ad. "I've got a plan to cut costs and cover everyone. But unless we stop the bickering and the lobbyists, we'll be in the same place 20 years from now."
On Friday, the Quad City Times will publish an op-ed from Senator Obama in which he writes about his commitment to strengthening Social Security and firmly opposing any effort to privatize Social Security.
