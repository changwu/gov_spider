    Mitt Romney today issued the following statement on the November employment numbers:
"Today's unemployment figures bring to 34 the number of months that unemployment in the United States has been over 8 percent, the longest such spell since the Great Depression. The Obama administration may have come to accept such a high level of joblessness as the new normal. I will never accept it. To me, the fact that so many millions of Americans are unemployed only highlights the urgent need for a fundamental change in the direction of our country. We can't afford another year of President Obama's failed economic policies. And we certainly can't afford five more years. This is not exactly the hope and change that the American people bargained for."
