    On May 3, 1994, President Clinton signed a Presidential Decision Directive establishing "U.S. Policy on Reforming Multilateral Peace Operations." This directive is the product of a year-long interagency policy review and extensive consultations with dozens of Members of Congress from both parties.
The policy represents the first, comprehensive framework for U.S. decisionmaking on issues of peacekeeping and peace enforcement suited to the realities of the post-cold-war period.
Peace operations are not and cannot be the centerpiece of U.S. foreign policy. However, as the policy states, properly conceived and wellexecuted peace operations can be a useful element in serving America's interests. The directive prescribes a number of specific steps to improve U.S. and U.N. management of U.N. peace operations in order to ensure that use of such operations is selective and more effective.
The administration will release today an unclassified document outlining key elements of the Clinton administration's policy on reforming multilateral peace operations.
