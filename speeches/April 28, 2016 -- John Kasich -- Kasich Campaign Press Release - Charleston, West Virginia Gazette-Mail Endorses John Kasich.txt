When you think of the qualities you want — and don't want — in the president of the United States, the leader of the free world, what qualities come to mind?
Boldness, preferred to boastfulness.
Confidence, preferred over arrogance.
Statesmanship, preferred over bombasity.
Calculating, preferred over spontaneity.
Reasonable, preferred over illogical.
Astute over uninformed.
Of the five serious candidates in the race for president, only one — Ohio Governor John Kasich — has all of these qualities and has proven himself to be a strong administrator, an effective leader and an astute statesman.

[K]asich has a true plan that calls for downsizing the federal government and returning power to the people and the states, and shrinking the ever-growing regulatory state that suffocates innovation and job growth in America.
For those that don't think Kasich has a chance, perhaps the voters of West Virginia can show the nation he does. The Daily Mail recommends a vote for John Kasich, and just as importantly, a vote for delegates to the Republican convention who have committed to Kasich or who are uncommitted.
No other candidate has expressed the messages and has the experience that Kasich has to make America great again.
