    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the 1992 Partial Revision of the Radio Regulations (Geneva, 1979), with appendices, signed by the United States at Malaga-Torremolinos on March 3, 1992 (the "1992 Partial Revision"), together with declarations and reservations of the United States as contained in the Final Acts of the World Administrative Radio Conference for Dealing with Frequency Allocations in Certain Parts of the Spectrum (WARC-92). I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State concerning these revisions.
The 1992 Partial Revision, which was adopted at WARC-92, constitutes a revision of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Radio Regulations (Geneva, 1979), as revised, to which the United States is a party. It provides for additional spectrum for new or expanding telecommunication services, primarily terrestrial and satellite broadcasting, terrestrial and satellite mobile and space services and is consistent with the proposals and positions taken by the United States at the conference.
Subject to the U.S. declarations and reservations mentioned above, I believe that the United States should become a party to the 1992 Partial Revision, which provides additional spectrum for existing and new telecommunication services in which the United States plays a significant leadership role. It is my hope that the Senate will take early action on this matter and give its advice and consent to ratification.
