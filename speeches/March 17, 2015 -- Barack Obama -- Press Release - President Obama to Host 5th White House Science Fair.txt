    WASHINGTON, DC â€“ On Monday, March 23rd, the President will host the 5th White House Science Fair, celebrating the student winners of a broad range of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) competitions from across America. The President will also announce new steps as part of his Educate to Innovate campaign to get more girls and boys, especially those from traditionally underrepresented groups, inspired and prepared to excel in the critical STEM fields. Building on these announcements, this year's White House Science Fair will include a focus on diversity and inclusion in STEM.
The President hosted the first-ever White House Science Fair in 2010, noting then, "If you win the NCAA championship, you come to the White House. Well, if you're a young person and you produce the best experiment or design, the best hardware or software, you ought to be recognized for that achievement, too."
