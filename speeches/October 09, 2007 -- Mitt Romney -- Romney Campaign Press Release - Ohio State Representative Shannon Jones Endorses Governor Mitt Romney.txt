Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced the endorsement of Ohio State House Representative Shannon Jones from the 67th House District in Ohio. Representative Jones joins previously announced State Senator Kevin Coughlin in endorsing Governor Romney from Ohio.
"Governor Romney is a dedicated leader who understands the needs of everyday Americans," said Representative Jones. "Like many Ohioians, he believes we need to bring conservative change to Washington by reducing government spending, keeping taxes low, and governing with the highest ethical standards. Unlike any other candidate, Governor Romney has laid out a comprehensive strategy to prevent a nuclear Iran. He understands that the best ally for peace is a strong America and he is the best choice to keep us safe from the threat of terrorist sponsored regimes."

She is a dedicated leader and an active member of her community, constantly working to improve the lives of her constituents. She will be an important member of my team in Ohio, making sure voters know my vision to create a stronger economy, stronger military and stronger families."
