LAKE JACKSON, Texas — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul attracted a remarkable more than 2,000 supporters and undecided voters to his college campus town hall meeting held in College Park, Maryland.
The event took place tonight — Wednesday, March 28th — at 7:00 p.m. at the University of Maryland — Ritchie Coliseum, located at the intersection of Baltimore Avenue and Rossborough Lane, College Park, MD 20742. More than 1,800 people filled the Ritchie Coliseum and 200 more were left outside, as the venue filled to beyond capacity.
The 12-term Congressman from Texas spoke to the crowd about his platform of constitutionally-limited government, the enduring bond between civil and economic liberties, and elements of his 'Plan to Restore America,' an economic blueprint that earns high praise for its seriousness in cutting the federal budget by $1 trillion in year one of a Paul presidency.
Upon taking the podium, Congressman Paul received a two-minute standing ovation and was treated to chants of "President Paul!" throughout his remarks.
