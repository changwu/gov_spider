    Chicago, IL -- "Joey Cheek has been a courageous and leading voice for international action to stop the genocide in Darfur. China's decision to revoke his visa is deeply disturbing, and contradicts Beijing's promises to run an open Olympic Games. Many of the strongest voices on Darfur have come from grassroots organizations like Team Darfur, and these voices must not be silenced. The United States must continue to demand that China bring pressure to bear on Khartoum to stop the genocide in Darfur."
