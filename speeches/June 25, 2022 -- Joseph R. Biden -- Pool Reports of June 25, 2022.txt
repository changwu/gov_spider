In-town pool report #2- bill signing
POTUS, wearing a blue suit and tie. entered the Roosevelt Room at 8:35 with FLOTUS, who wore a purple dress. A blue folder and pens were waiting for him on a small desk near the podium.
POTUS initially spoke out on "shocking" decision from SCOTUS in Dobbs and said his administration would work with states on implementation and protecting women.
POTUS said he and FLOTUS would hold an event on July 11 for lawmakers who voted for the gun deal.
Commending families who advocated for gun reform, POTUS said: "Nothing is going to fill that void in their hearts, but they have led the way, so others" won't have to endure the same thing."
POTUS said many people have said,For God's sake. Just do something," adding, "Well, today we have." POTUS added, "While this bill doesn't do everything I called for," it does many of the things.
POTUS signed the bipartisan gun deal at 8:41, then said, "God willing, this help save a lot of lives."
After the signing, reporters shouted a series of questions. POTUS said he had a helicopter waiting and proceeded to exit.
But POTUS took one question from a reporter Wall Street Journal, who asked POTUS aid he thought SCOTUS was broken.
POTUS: "I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions."
POTUS didn't respond to other Qs about expanding the court and term limits as he exited at 8:42.
