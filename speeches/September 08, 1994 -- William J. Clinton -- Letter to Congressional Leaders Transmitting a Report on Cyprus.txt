    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I am submitting to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question. The previous report covered progress through May 20, 1994. The current report covers the remainder of May through July 31, 1994.
During this period both sides in the Cyprus dispute said that they accept the U.N. proposed package of confidence-building measures. We will be working closely with the United Nations to reconcile the remaining differences concerning the modalities of implementation.
I would also like to take this opportunity to express my sincerest gratitude for the efforts of Robert Lamb, who retired as Special Cyprus Coordinator on June 1 after 32 years of distinguished service in the U.S. Foreign Service. Special Cyprus Coordinator Lamb's dedication and commitment to finding a solution to the Cyprus problem was unbending. He worked diligently to bring both sides closer together and is responsible for the recent significant progress. We are actively searching for a replacement for Robert Lamb.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
