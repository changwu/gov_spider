    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of India, signed at Washington on June 25, 1997.
In addition, I transmit, for the information of the Senate, a related exchange of letters signed the same date and the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. As the report states, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.
The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content of extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.
Upon entry into force, this Treaty would enhance cooperation between the law enforcement authorities of both countries, and thereby make a significant contribution to international law enforcement efforts. With respect to the United States and India, the Treaty would supersede the Treaty for the Mutual Extradition of Criminals between the United States of America and Great Britain, signed at London December 22, 1931, which was made applicable to India on March 9, 1942, and is currently applied by the United States and India.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, September 23, 1997.
