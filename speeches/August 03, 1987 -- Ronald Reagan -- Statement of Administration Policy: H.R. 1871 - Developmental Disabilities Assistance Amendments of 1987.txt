    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Madigan (R) Illinois)
The administration supports House passage of H.R. 1871, but will seek in the conference on this legislation to eliminate section 7 of the House bill, which would impose a new burdensome and unnecessary reporting requirement on the States.
