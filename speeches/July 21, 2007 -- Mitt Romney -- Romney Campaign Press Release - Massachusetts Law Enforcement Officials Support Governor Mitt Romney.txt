Boston, MA - This week, Governor Romney announced that he would propose a "One Strike, You're Ours" law for those convicted of preying on children using the Internet. Today, Massachusetts Republican District Attorneys and Sheriffs released the following statement supporting Governor Romney and his proposal for stiff mandatory jail time to be followed by lifetime tracking by Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) for first-time offenders:
"As Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney was a strong defender of children. He led the effort to put photos of the state's most dangerous sex offenders on the Internet and made it easier to extend civil commitments for sex offenders. As a candidate for president, Governor Romney is once-again demonstrating strong leadership in protecting our children. His 'One Strike, You're Ours' law is an important initiative to strengthen law enforcement and protect America's sons and daughters. We are proud to stand alongside Governor Romney in his campaign for our nation's highest office."
Signing Today's Statement Are:
- District Attorney Tim Cruz, Plymouth County
- District Attorney Michael O'Keefe, Cape and Islands
- District Attorney Elizabeth Scheibel, Northwestern Counties
- Sheriff Frank Cousins, Essex County
- Sheriff James Cummings, Barnstable County
- Sheriff Tom Hodgson, Bristol County
Background On Governor Romney's "One-Strike, You're Ours" Law:
Governor Romney Will Propose A "One-Strike, You're Ours" Law For Those Convicted Of Preying On Children Using The Internet. As President, Governor Romney will propose new, tougher federal penalties for first-time offenders who use the Internet to sexually assault children, including stiff mandatory jail time to be followed by lifetime tracking by Global Positioning Satellite (GPS). This will represent a "One-Strike, You're Ours" law for child predators.
- The Growing Threat Of Crimes Committed Against Children Via The Internet Is A Disturbing Trend. In February 2006, the Department of Justice (DOJ) launched Project Safe Childhood, an initiative designed to protect children as they navigate the Internet. The Bush administration correctly recognized that as technology advances and the Internet becomes more accessible, there is a real danger that computer-facilitated crimes committed against children will continue to rise.
- By Enacting Tougher Laws, The Federal Government Will Be Following The Lead Of States Across The Country. Governor Romney's "One-Strike, You're Ours" Law will impose on the federal level the same tough sentences that states like Florida and California have put in place with "Jessica's Law." In Massachusetts, Governor Romney successfully fought to put the photos of the state's most dangerous sex offenders on the Internet, and he signed legislation to make it easier to extend the civil commitments of sex offenders. In 2006, President Bush signed the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, which significantly strengthened the nationwide sex offender registration system and created new federal crimes and enhanced penalties for other pre-existing crimes. Yet, most federal laws are not tough enough when sentencing a first-time offender for sex crimes against a child.
