    I strongly support action to end the soft money raised by both political parties. That is why last year I asked the Federal Election Commission to ban soft money, under its current legal authority. I am very pleased that the agency's General Counsel has proposed a new rule prohibiting national parties from raising soft money. Now I ask the members of the Commission to step up to their responsibility and act, within their legal authority, to end the soft money system.
