Pool report #8 president walks in

He greeted one of the spotters, though the conversation was out of earshot of your pooler.
The climbers in here have continued to climb the walls — some hanging freely from ropes — even as the president walks in. Each climber has a partner spotting them below on the ground, holding the rope. Among them, your pooler only spots three wearing a mask.
One employee repelled down from a wall to fret the president, joking it was time for him to start climbing. He had worked at the center for 10 years, he said, since he was 14.
President spoke briefly with reporters, sizing up which wall he'd want to climb
Remarks are expected to start shortly

POTUS out-of-town pool report #2 - arrival and two minute warning
POTUS landed at Joint Base Langley-Eustis around 1:30 p.m., as Karine Jean-Pierre was gaggling.
The flight from JBA to JBLE was a little turbulent at times.
POTUS and FLOTUS deplaned around 1:37 p.m. They spoke briefly with greeters and did not respond to questions from the press.
POTUS and FLOTUS took a very, very brief motorcade (less than two minutes) to an airport hanger here where POTUS will give remarks shortly.
A stage is set up with a massive American flag behind it. There are F-22 raptors positioned on either side of the stage. Classified equipment on the planes have been covered, per a military aide.
The audience is largely made up of members of the military, who are wearing fatigues, and are seated on black folding chairs that are socially distanced (a light reminder of the pandemic.) But only one or two people are wearing masks inside the hanger as we wait for POTUS.
Biden's remarks will be live streamed.

POTUS out of town pool report #3 - Color from Joint Base Langley-Eustis
Hail to the chief played as Biden walked into the airplane hanger here at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia.
Members of the military stood as he walked in and as the music played. The audience is about 75 people, by my estimation.
Colonel Clinton Ross introduced FLOTUS. She mentioned that the two have known each other for a decade.
POTUS was introduced to Britteny Beene, and POTUS gave her a side hug after her remarks.
POTUS spoke in a low voice that was at times hard to hear in the auditorium which did not have great acoustics — the microphone created a bit of an echo that made it hard to understand everything for those in the room, though my Washington Post colleagues watching the live-stream said the sound was better for them.
POTUS finished his remarks at 2:29 PM*More details on the arrival here per the White House:Upon arrival at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, the President and the First Lady will be greeted planeside by:

Governor Ralph Northam (VA)
Congresswoman Elaine Luria (VA-02)

Chief Master Sergeant Greg Peterson, Command Chief
Judy Peterson, Spouse of Chief Master Sergeant Greg Peterson
Colonel Clinton Ross, Commander
Kristi Ross, Spouse of Colonel Clinton Ross
Colonel Edward Vedder, Vice Commander

POTUS out of town pool report #4 - Departure from Joint Base Langley-Eustis
POTUS and FLOTUS got into very brief motorcade from the air hanger to the plane on the runway at 3:08 pm.
POTUS and FLOTUS departed from Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia at 3:09. POTUS is now heading to DANG in Wilmington.
Before leaving POTUS did not give brief remarks.
POTUS is switching planes and is loading into the smaller AF1, and the cell service on that plane is rather difficult.
Both the large and the small AF1 planes were parked on the runway here, which is a bit unusual (at least for me) to see them together.



May 28, 202116:19

POTUS out of town pool report #5 - land in DANG
POTUS landed at DANG at 3:59 pm after an uneventful flight from Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia.

POTUS did not answer questions shouted to him about the Jan. 6 commission. This is the third time during this trip Biden has had an opportunity to address the Senate vote.
The motorcade started rolling at 4:07 pm. There does not appear to be much Memorial Day traffic here, and it's lightly raining.*From the WH
