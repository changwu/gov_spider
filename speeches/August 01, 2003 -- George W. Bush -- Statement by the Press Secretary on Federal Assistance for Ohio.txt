    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Ohio and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by tornadoes, flooding, severe storms, and high winds on July 21, 2003, and continuing.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in Mahoning, Medina, Portage, Summit, and Trumbull Counties.
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
