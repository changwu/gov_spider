    President Barack Obama met with Leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Manila to adopt a set of ambitious initiatives under this year's theme of "Building Inclusive Economies, Building a Better World."
Now in its 26th year, APEC has contributed to a tremendous rise in economic prosperity that directly benefits approximately 40 percent of the global population who live in APEC economies. Since APEC's establishment in 1989, members have seen a ten percentage point reduction in their average applied tariff rate, trade grow to $20 trillion, and their collective GDP rise to 58 percent of the global total.
Under the chairmanship of Philippines President Benigno Aquino III, APEC Leaders committed to a number of concrete actions to support inclusive economic growth under the broad priorities of: 1) enhancing the regional economic integration agenda; 2) fostering Small and Medium Enterprises' (SMEs) participation in regional and global markets; 3) investing in human capital development; and 4) building sustainable and resilient communities.
The United States worked with APEC economies this year to expand trade and investment, promote shared prosperity and inclusive growth, address challenges to our health systems, and provide cleaner and more resilient communities for our citizens.
Enhancing Regional Economic Integration
APEC Leaders and Ministers expanded trade and investment liberalization by:
•      Launching substantive work to explore ways that APEC economies can reduce barriers to digital trade, including its consideration as a potential next generation trade and investment issue. Data flows and the use of digital inputs into all forms of business models make this a key 21st century trade issue.
•      Enhancing the ability of SMEs to access the digital economy through the Digital Economy Action Plan.
•      Facilitating cross border business activity through the expansion of globally interoperable privacy frameworks through economy and industry participation in the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) System, as well as working to develop bridges between APEC CBPR's and similar systems in Europe.
•      Endorsing the APEC Services Cooperation Framework (ASCF), which marks an important step in focusing APEC's attention on this vital segment of the world economy. The future roadmap under the ASCF aims to expand trade and investment in the service sectors, which will lead to job creation and growth in areas where the United States has a strong advantage.
•      Welcoming progress on the Collective Strategic Study on Issues Related to the Realization of the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP). The United States looks forward to a finished product at next year's APEC Economic Leaders' meeting in Peru.

•      Demonstrating leadership on the WTO Information Technology Agreement (ITA) expansion. The United States is pleased that expansion participants were able to successfully conclude the product coverage list, and now looks to conclude the negotiations to put those tariff cuts into effect by the 10th WTO Ministerial Conference. This outcome will result in the first tariff-eliminating result in the WTO in 18 years.
•      Supporting progress made on the WTO Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA) negotiations. The EGA will build on the success of the APEC Environmental Goods commitment by eliminating tariffs on a broader set of clean energy and environmental technologies, supporting U.S. green jobs while advancing global environmental protection efforts.
•      Reaffirming they would reduce applied tariffs on the APEC Environmental Goods List to 5 percent or less by the end of this year, a ground-breaking Leaders commitment that originated in the 2011 U.S. APEC host year.
•      Adopting a roadmap to encourage the use of electric vehicles.
•      Welcoming substantial progress toward the goal of a 10 percent improvement in supply chain performance by reducing the time, cost, and uncertainty of moving goods and services through the Asia-Pacific.
•      Agreeing to redouble efforts to make it easier, faster, and cheaper to do business across the Asia-Pacific with a new 10 percent improvement target by 2018.
