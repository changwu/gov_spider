    President Biden's economic plan is working. Since President Biden took office, there has been historic job growth—more than 4 million jobs created—the most in any President's first six months, with 832,000 jobs created on average per month over the last three months and 943,000 jobs created in July alone. The average number of new unemployment insurance claims has been cut by more than half since President Biden took office and more than 70 percent of Americans say that now is a good time to find a quality job (up from less than 30 percent this time last year).
Yesterday, the OECD released a new report showing that the U.S. economic recovery is outstripping other major economies. In fact, the OECD finds that the United States is the only Major Seven Economy that already returned to pre-pandemic levels. These findings build on independent projections from the CBO, the IMF, the Federal Reserve, and the World Bank—in addition to second quarter GDP data released last week—that suggest America will this year reach the highest levels of growth in nearly four decades. The Biden economy is booming.
