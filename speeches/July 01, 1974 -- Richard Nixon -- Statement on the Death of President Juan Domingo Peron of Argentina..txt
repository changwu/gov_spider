    MRS. NIXON and I, on behalf of the American people, have sent a message of condolence to the wife of former President Peron. We are saddened by the death of the President of the Argentine Republic, Juan Domingo Peron, who was a source of inspiration to his countrymen. At a time when others would have been content to retire from public life, he accepted the challenge to return to his country to guide and assist the Argentine people. He dedicated the last years of his life to this task.
