Your prayers and words of encouragement mean so much to our family. While we have seen many miraculous improvements over the past few days, David has a long and difficult path to recovery ahead. As I return to the campaign trail, we just want to thank everyone for your incredible support and ask that you please keep David and Allie in your prayers.
Here is an interview update on a number of issues and on David's health.
