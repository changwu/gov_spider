    TERMINATION OF EXPEDITIOUS NATURALIZATION BASED ON MILITARY SERVICE
By the authority vested in me as President of the United States of America by Section 329 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended by Sections 1 and 2 of the Act of October 24, 1968 (82 Stat. 1343; 8 U.S.C. 1440), and by the authority of Section 3 of that Act of October 24, 1968 (82 Stat. 1344; 8 U.S.C. 1440e), it is hereby ordered that the statutory period of Vietnam hostilities which began on February 28, 1961, shall be deemed to have terminated on October 15, 1978, for the purpose of ending the period in which active-duty service in the Armed Forces qualifies for certain exemptions from the usual requirements for naturalization, including length of residence and fees.
