    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question. The previous submission covered progress through November 30, 1995. The current submission covers the period December 1, 1995, through January 31, 1996.
The continuing lack of a solution on Cyprus is in marked contrast to the recent advances achieved in Bosnia and the Middle East. My Administration remains committed to pursuing a settlement in 1996. We are confident that if the parties to the dispute are prepared to engage seriously and with flexibility, we can move to active negotiations and to a final settlement, which creates a bizonal, bicommunal federation. We will need the full support of Greece and Turkey for our efforts. My Special Emissary, Richard Beattie, travelled to Cyprus in December for further discussions with the two Cypriot leaders. The progress he made, although modest, gives us a basis to pursue our initiative once circumstances in the region are more favorable.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the U.N.-sponsored settlement process and Cyprus' course toward accession to the European Union (EU) affect each other. For that reason, my Administration will strive to ensure the closest possible coordination among efforts by the United Nations, the EU, and ourselves to address the question of Cyprus.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
