He was born January 19, 1926, in New York City. He received a B.S. in engineering from Columbia University and an M.S. and Ph.D. in physics from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. During World War II, Frieman served with the U.S. Navy and participated in the Bikini A-bomb tests. After the war, he taught at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn.
In 1952 Frieman joined Princeton University's controlled thermonuclear research project, now known as the Princeton University Plasma Physics Laboratory. In 1953 he was appointed the head of the laboratory's theoretical division. In 1964 he was awarded a National Science Foundation senior postdoctoral fellowship and assumed the position of associate director of the Plasma Physics Laboratory. In 1970 he received a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship.
Frieman has served as a consultant to a number of government agencies, and is the author of numerous articles in scientific journals, particularly in the areas of MHD theory, statistical mechanics, plasma transport theory, and plasma stability.
