    The Hillary Clinton for President Campaign today named Elizabeth Cantrell as Kentucky Political Director. Cantrell, a Greenup native and University of Louisville graduate, has worked on numerous campaigns throughout the state.
"We have an incredibly talented and hardworking staff here in Kentucky," said State Director Jonathan Hurst. "Elizabeth's experience, commitment, and knowledge of the state made her the natural choice for Political Director. Kentucky is critical to winning the nomination and we look forward to working hard over the next 18 days."
Cantrell's hire is another example of Hillary's commitment to the Bluegrass State. The campaign has opened offices in Louisville, Lexington, Pikeville, and Covington, and further office openings will be announced next week. Yesterday, Hillary visited the campaign's Louisville headquarters, and former President Clinton, and Chelsea have all campaigned throughout the Bluegrass State.
