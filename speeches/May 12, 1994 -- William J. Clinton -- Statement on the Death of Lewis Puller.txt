    I am saddened by the death of my friend Lewis Puller, who served his country with honor and distinction. As the son of America's most decorated Marine veteran of World War II and a winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his moving story of his personal struggle, "Fortunate Son," Lewis Puller was a true American hero. His death reminds us all of the grief that still haunts so many of America's veterans today, of the wounds that never heal, and the loved ones left behind.
My most memorable moment with Lewis was on Memorial Day a year ago at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, when he appeared at that ceremony unexpectedly and wheeled himself up next to me on the platform. I want his wife, Toddy, and his children, Lewis and Maggie, to know that it was an honor for me to be by his side on that day, and as Memorial Day approaches again, Lewis will hold a special place in my thoughts and prayers.
