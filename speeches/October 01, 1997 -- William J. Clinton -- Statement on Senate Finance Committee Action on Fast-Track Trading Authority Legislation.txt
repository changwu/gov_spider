    I am pleased that the Senate Finance Committee, with overwhelming bipartisan support, has reported out legislation that renews the partnership between the President and the Congress in reaching trade agreements, a negotiating authority every President has had since 1974. To keep the American economy strong, we must continue to break down unfair foreign trade barriers to our goods and services. This legislation will allow us to tear down those barriers and help American businesses and workers compete and win in the global marketplace. I look forward to working with the congressional leadership to build on the bipartisan spirit we saw in the Senate Finance Committee today and to secure passage of this important legislation this year.
