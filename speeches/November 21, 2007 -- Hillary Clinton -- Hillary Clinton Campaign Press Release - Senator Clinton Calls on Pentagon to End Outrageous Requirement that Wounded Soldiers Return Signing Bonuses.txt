    Legislation to Guarantee Full Payment to Veterans to be Introduced by Clinton
Senator Hillary Clinton today called on the Pentagon to immediately end a policy that requires repayment of enlistment bonuses by medically discharged wounded soldiers. She also requested that the Army disclose the number of wounded soldiers who have been affected by this policy and promised to introduce new legislation to guarantee the fully payment of bonuses and incentives to wounded veterans.
In the wake of recent news reports of wounded combat veterans forced to repay thousands of dollars in signing bonuses to the Army because they could not complete their tour of duty (see: http://kdka.com/kdkainvestigators/military.signing.bonuses.2.571660.html), Senator Clinton sent a letter to Secretary of the Army Pete Geren, strongly urging a reversal of policy.
"Requiring soldiers who are being medically discharged to return their bonuses is outrageous. It dishonors their service and undermines the Army's solemn commitment to soldiers and their families," Senator Clinton said. "If the Administration does not reverse this misguided policy, Congress should pass legislation to set this right."
Senator Clinton announced that she will introduce legislation that requires the military services to continue to pay certain bonuses to a member of the Armed Forces who is medically retired or separated due to a combat-related injury. The legislation would amend Title 37 of the United States Code to guarantee full payment for various incentive payments for wounded servicemembers.

The Honorable Pete Geren
Secretary of the Army
Department of the Army
Washington, D.C. 20310
Dear Mr. Secretary:
I write to request the immediate reversal of an Army policy that requires repayment of enlistment bonuses by medically discharged wounded soldiers. According to recent media reports, the Army is directing wounded soldiers who have been medically discharged to repay their enlistment bonuses because they are unable to complete their term of enlistment. This policy is outrageous and should be reversed immediately. Soldiers who have enlisted in the Army have made a commitment to serve our nation. With our nation at war in Iraq and Afghanistan, we should honor those who make that commitment. By agreeing to serve and then suffering wounds during their service, these soldiers have earned their bonuses. To ask soldiers who are being medically discharged to return their bonuses dishonors their service and undermines the Army's stated commitment to soldiers and their families.
Since the beginning of the war in Iraq, wounded soldiers have faced numerous bureaucratic hurdles that have resulted in treatment that does not measure up to their service and sacrifice. Whether it is the disgraceful treatment as outpatients at Walter Reed Army Medical center or the pay problems experienced by wounded soldiers, many wounded soldiers have been treated with indifference and neglect.
As a Senator on the Armed Services Committee, I have continuously raised the problems faced by wounded soldiers to Army leadership at hearings, meetings, through correspondence and by offering legislation. At each point, I have been assured by the Army and Defense Department leadership that they are working to improve the treatment of wounded soldiers. In light of this history, it shocks the conscience that the Army could demand that wounded soldiers return their enlistment bonuses.
Therefore, I again request a reversal of the flawed policy of requiring wounded soldiers to repay their enlistment bonuses. I also request any data that reflects the total number of medically discharged wounded soldiers who have been affected by this enlistment bonus repayment policy to date and the total amount of enlistment bonus repayment money collected to date.
With soldiers bravely serving every day in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, it is important that we demonstrate our commitment to soldiers and their families by reversing this flawed policy.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely yours,
Hillary Rodham Clinton
