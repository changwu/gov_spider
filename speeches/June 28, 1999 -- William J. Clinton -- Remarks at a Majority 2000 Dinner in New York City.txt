    Hello, everyone. I really came over here just to have a chance to shake hands and say hello, because you were all in the theater, so you heard me speak, and I don't think you should have to endure two speeches.
I would like to say again how much I appreciate the leadership role that you assumed in making this evening a great success. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. And again, I want to thank the cast and all the people who put the production on. I thought it was magnificent.
But mostly, I came here to thank you for making this a success and for helping Mr. Gephardt and the other members of our congressional leadershipâ€”you're very happy. We're giving them a chance to have a good November next year.
Thank you, Congressman Engel, Congressman Kennedy, Congressman Rangel, Congresswoman Lowey. Thank you all very much. Congressman Payne, thank you.
God bless you. Thank you.
