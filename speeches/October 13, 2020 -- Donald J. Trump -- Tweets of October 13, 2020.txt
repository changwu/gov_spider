It was great to be back in my home state of FLORIDA to make my official return to the campaign trail. I am energized by your prayers, humbled by your support, and absolutely determined to finish what we started and Make America Greater than Ever Before!  https://t.co/XrQG0KPdUoRetweets: 18458Favorites: 74504

Joe Biden's agenda would be a catastrophe for Florida Seniors. For years, Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty and federal healthcare for illegal aliens—decimating Medicare and destroying Social Security...  https://t.co/GgHP0NvpEeRetweets: 11728Favorites: 40141

Biden refuses to answer questions on packing the Supreme Court. He says voters don't deserve to know. If they win, Dems will pack the #SCOTUS w/ radical left justices who will shred the #2A, empower violent mobs, and shield deadly criminals & terrorists.  https://t.co/alVSZUDc73Retweets: 11893Favorites: 41396

I keep reading Fake News stories that my campaign is running low on money. Not true, & if it were so, I would put up money myself. The fact is that we have much more money than we had 4 years ago, where we spent much less money than Crooked Hillary, and still easily won, 306-223!Retweets: 24810Favorites: 113697
