Check out this statement:
I'm proud to endorse my Senate colleague and friend Marco Rubio to be the next president of the United States. This should not be a surprise to anyone for two reasons. First, back in 2010, I endorsed Marco in his Florida Republican primary race for the U.S. Senate over the establishment candidate. Second, I believe, as many polls reflect, Marco is the strongest Republican candidate when matched up with Hillary Clinton. Marco has proven to be a solid conservative voice over the years, recognized not only by organizations like the American Conservative Union, National Rifle Association, Family Research Council, National Right to Life, Citizens Against Government Waste, among others, but also by his colleagues and, most importantly, his constituents.  
Inhofe hits on two big things: Marco has beat the establishment before, and he's ready to run against Hillary Clinton.Senator Inhofe, thank you for your support and welcome to Team Marco!
