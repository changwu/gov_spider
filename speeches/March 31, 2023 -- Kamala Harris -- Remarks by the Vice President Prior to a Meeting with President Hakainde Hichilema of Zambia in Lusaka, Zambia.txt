    PRESIDENT HICHILEMA: Thank you very much, (inaudible). Wonderful afternoon. And I start the afternoon by warmly welcoming -- welcoming the Vice President of the United States of America and your delegation to State House and to our country, Zambia.
For you, Vice President, this is like a homecoming. The nation is ecstatic about it, very delighted. And we know you have been up and about for so long, to say so, especially when you're traveling, you may be fatigued, but we'll treat you like you have 100 percent energy -- (laughter) -- so we can discuss the issues we want to discuss.
Welcome here. Thank you very much.
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Thank you, Mr. President, for the warm welcome. It is good to see you again. This is our third visit together. I was honored to host you in the White House and then to see you again in the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit.
There are longstanding ties between our people. And as you have noted, there is -- there -- there are personal reasons that I feel connected to this beautiful country as well.
So, I'm honored to be with you. I look forward to the conversation and the continuing work that we will do to strengthen the partnership between our countries.
Thank you.
