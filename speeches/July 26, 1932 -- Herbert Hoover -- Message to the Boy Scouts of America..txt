My dear Mr. Head:
It was most heartening to me to receive recently from your Chief Scout Executive the report of the activities of the Boy Scouts of America for the year 1931 and for the first part of this year, showing that you have not only maintained your strength, but actually increased.
It is most important at this time that the activities of the Boy Scouts of America and indeed the activities of all of our character-building agencies, should be maintained. I hope that your Local Council units will, as heretofore, receive from the general public, such generous support that the splendid record you made for 1931 may be equalled in 1932.
It is gratifying to learn that the challenge which I gave to your organization on the occasion of the Washington Meeting has resulted in the development and adoption by your National Council of a comprehensive program of growth covering the next ten years. This will not only bring to thousands of additional boys the joys and satisfactions of the Game of Scouting, but make the character-building and citizenship results a vital factor in advancing our democracy.
I sincerely hope that every Scout and Scouter in your organization will heartily cooperate in making your plans effective.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Walter W. Head, President, Boy Scouts of America, 2 Park Avenue, New York City]
