    The President was very disappointed to hear that President Serrano of Guatemala has suspended the Congress and courts and other democratic rights protected by the Guatemalan Constitution. This illegitimate course of action threatens to place Guatemala outside the democratic community of nations. We strongly condemn such efforts to resolve Guatemala's problems through nondemocratic means. We hope the Guatemalan leadership will reverse its course and immediately restore full constitutional democracy.
