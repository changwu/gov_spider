    (CHARLOTTE, NC, January 11, 2020) –– From January 17 – January 20, presidential candidate for the Democratic nomination Tom Steyer will take his "People Over Profits" bus tour to the Carolinas. Steyer will start in North Carolina, making stops in Charlotte, and continue his tour in South Carolina by spending Martin Luther King Jr. weekend in Hartsville, Florence, Effingham, and Columbia.
Over the course of this bus tour, Steyer will layout how we can build an economy that works for all Americans, and pursue economic and environmental justice by addressing and undoing the purposeful exclusion of communities of color. The tour will give Steyer the opportunity to continue to listen, learn, and show Carolinians that his economic expertise, commitment to justice, and ability to build an inclusive, winning coalition of Americans, makes him the best Democrat to beat Donald Trump on the economy and win in November.
