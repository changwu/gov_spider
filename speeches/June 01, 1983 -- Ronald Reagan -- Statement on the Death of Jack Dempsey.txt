    Jack Dempsey was a champion who never lost his title in the hearts of the American people. He was a true winner, remembered as much for his dignity, easy manner, and generous nature as for his remarkable skills in the boxing ring. He was one of the golden athletes of that golden era of American sports, the 1920's. Our attachment to America's colorful past is weakened by his passing.
I convey my deepest sympathy to Mr. Dempsey's family and to all who admire the ideals of sportsmanship he embodied.
