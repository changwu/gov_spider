    Today, United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Union Local 1625 in Florida announced its endorsement of Joe Biden for President of the United States.
"After conferring with our members across the state, as well as our Executive Board, we have decided to support Vice President Biden because our nation needs a President that will fight for and defend the rights of working Americans. Joe will be that President. He has always had our backs, and dedicated his life to fighting for working families and our causes. The frustration of workers across Florida is real, and Vice President Biden not only understands, but will work to protect our rights, and secure a better life and future for our families," said UFCW Union Local 1625 President Ed Chambers.
UFCW Local 1625 is a statewide local headquartered in Lakeland, Florida, and represents over 15,000 members in healthcare, manufacturing, food processing, and the public sector, and hospitality including Walt Disney World.
