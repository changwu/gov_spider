    The President's Budget builds on his first term's progress by focusing resources on the Nation's priorities while exercising responsible spending restraint in order to achieve the President's goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009.

The 2006 Budget funds efforts to defend the homeland, transform our military for the 21st Century, support our troops as they fight the War on Terror, spread freedom throughout the world, promote high standards in our schools, and continue the pro-growth economic policies that have helped to produce millions of new jobs.
Meanwhile, overall discretionary spending grows by only 2.1% under the President's Budget – less than the projected rate of inflation – even with significant increases in defense and homeland security. Non-security discretionary spending is reduced by nearly 1% – the first such proposed cut since the Reagan Administration.
The Budget contains more than 150 reductions and terminations of non-defense discretionary programs, saving over $20 billion in 2006. The Budget also contains $137 billion in savings over 10 years in mandatory spending.
By holding Federal programs to a firm test of accountability and focusing resources on top priorities, we are taking the steps necessary to achieve the President's deficit-reduction goals. With the Budget submitted by the President, the deficit is forecast to fall from 3.5% of GDP in 2005 to 3% in 2006, and to 1.5% by 2009, well below the 40-year historical average of 2.3% of GDP.

Assisting those most in need by promoting accessible health care, fighting the global HIV/AIDS pandemic, and supporting the efforts of faith-based and community groups to transform lives, including:
