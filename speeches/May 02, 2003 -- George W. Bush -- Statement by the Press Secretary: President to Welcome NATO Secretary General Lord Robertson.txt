    President Bush will meet with NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson at the White House on May 5, 2003. NATO remains a cornerstone of America's relations with Europe, and a vital player in our efforts to deal with the security challenges of the 21st century. Under Lord Robertson's leadership, NATO provided support to Turkey during the Iraq war, and has now agreed to take over the leadership of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan later this summer.
