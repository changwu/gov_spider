    Former Minnesota Governor and Romney for President National Co-Chair Tim Pawlenty made the following statement on the Democratic National Committee's misleading advertisement and press conference call:
"President Obama's policies have been utter failures for the middle class: he has failed to create jobs and has burdened future generations with massive amounts of debt. This Administration does not want to campaign against Mitt Romney and be forced to defend three years of failure. Instead of focusing on the middle class and job creation, President Obama and Democrats are focused on campaigning and trying to tear down Mitt Romney."
