KLOBUCHAR: If we don't stop Donald Trump this time, shame on us. Americans deserve a President who has their back, who isn't afraid to take on powerful forces, who has a record of bringing people together, and most importantly who gets things done. I know what it takes to win in the midwest. It's not flyover country to me, it's home. I'm Amy Klobuchar. I approve this message because we need a President who can win for all of us.

KLOBUCHAR: He'll do everything he can to hold on to power, but I'll take the fight to Donald Trump. I've won in rural, urban, and suburban areas everytime. Even districts Donald Trump won. Whether it's passing 100 laws or standing up to partisan Supreme Court nominees. I've always known that you do a job no matter how hard it is, because it's the work that needs to get done. Our job now is to elect someone who will fix the mess that Donald Trump created and take on the challenges facing America. Like the high costs of prescription drugs, rebuilding our infrastructure, and tackling climate change. If you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics and you're tired of the noise and the nonsense, you've got a home with me. I'm Amy Klobuchar. I don't want to be the President for half of America, I want to be the President for all of America. That's why I approve this message.
