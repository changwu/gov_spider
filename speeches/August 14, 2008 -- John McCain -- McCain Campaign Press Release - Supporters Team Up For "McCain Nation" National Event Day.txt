    ARLINGTON, VA -- Supporters of U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign will hold events Thursday, August 14th across America for the first "McCain Nation" national event day. Supporters will meet at house parties in all 50 states and will recruit volunteers, organize grassroots activities, make voter contact phone calls, and register new voters.
Across the country, John McCain's supporters will invite friends, family and co-workers into their homes to participate in this grassroots effort. They will have the opportunity to speak with Cindy McCain, Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman and a McCain senior adviser on two national conference calls.
"The McCain Nation events that are taking place around the country this evening show just how energized our grassroots campaign has become," said Mrs. McCain, who will participate in a call with supporters attending events in the East. "It's the American people who are the best spokespeople for our campaign, and that will help ensure victory in November."
Gov. Huntsman, who will speak with supporters in the West, added: "We've put together an impressive grassroots effort and our supporters are clearly committed to helping elect John McCain. The nationwide McCain Nation events are an important step in organizing a strong, robust network at the local level."
