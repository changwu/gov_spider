This would be especially harmful for farmers, who could lose control over their land and be forced to comply with expensive permitting requirements. For example, the Iowa Farm Bureau estimates that 97% of Iowa could be covered by the rule.
I am opposed to this power grab, plain and simple, and I want to thank my friend Joni Ernst for leading the fight against it. A federal court recently blocked the rule temporarily, but I believe WOTUS should be stopped for good. That's why I've proposed a detailed plan to limit the costs that regulators can impose on the economy.
We must pursue policies that reduce government burdens on American farmers, not increase them. Stopping WOTUS is a good first step.
