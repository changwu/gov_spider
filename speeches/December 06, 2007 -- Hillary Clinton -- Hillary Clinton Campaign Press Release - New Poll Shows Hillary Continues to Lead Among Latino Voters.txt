    Hillary Clinton continues to lead all Democratic presidential contenders among Hispanic voters -- by 44 points, according to a new poll released today by the Pew Hispanic Center. The poll also found that most Hispanics view the Democratic Party as the one that shows more concern for Latinos. In addition, the report found that at a rate of 3 to one, Latinos believe that the Bush administration's policies have been harmful to Hispanics.
The Clinton campaign issued the following statement from National Co-Chair for the campaign Raul Yzaguirre regarding the poll:
"We are very proud and grateful to have such strong support from Latinos for Hillary Clinton. Hillary has spent her life fighting for the issues that are important to our families, such as quality education for all children, access to affordable health care, good jobs and economic opportunity. As President, she will continue working to make sure that everyone in America has access to the American Dream."
