    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Kastenmeier (D) Wisconsin)
The Administration continues to support bona fide "intent to use" (in addition to actual use, per current law) as a basis for filing an application to register a trademark. However, the Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5372 because it would impose administrative responsibilities on the Patent and Trademark Office that would be unduly burdensome, prohibitively expensive, and of no benefit to trademark applicants. It would also include consumer rights of action in the Lanham Act with far-reaching implications, which had neither the benefit of hearings nor the opportunity for comment.
The Administration continues to support H.R. 4156 and S. 1883, which would allow "intent to use" as the basis for filing a trademark, but which do not contain the burdensome administrative requirements of H.R. 5372.
