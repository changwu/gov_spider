    Laura and I are pleased that you came to our backyard picnic. [Laughter] We really want to thank the Speaker, Speaker Hastert, and Senator Frist, Congresswoman Pelosi, and all the Members of Congress who joined us today. I want to thank you for your hard work, and I want to thank you for your devotion to your constituents and to our country. I look forward to continuing to work with you, as we serve the American people.
Laura and I also want to thank all the families who are with us here for your extraordinary service and sacrifice. Public service puts great demands on our families and our country is grateful to you all.
Laura and I want to thank WETA and all tonight's performers, Tom Wopat and Shirley Jones, Harolyn Blackwell, and Car-tier Williams. You put on such a fantastic performance, and we're grateful.
Again, thank you all for coming. We hope you've enjoyed this evening. And may God bless your families, and may God continue to bless our great country.
