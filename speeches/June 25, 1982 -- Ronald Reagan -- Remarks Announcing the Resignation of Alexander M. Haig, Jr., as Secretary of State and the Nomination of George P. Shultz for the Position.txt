    Ladies and gentlemen, let me say first of all, I'm going to make an announcement-very brief. There will be no—I will take no questions on it. I understand that a press conference is scheduled next week.
It's an announcement that I make with great regret regarding a member of our administration who has served this country for 40 years, above and beyond the call of duty; who has served me so well and faithfully; whose wisdom and counsel I have respected and admired for all the time that our administration has been here, but who now is resigning and leaving government service after all this great time. And with great regret, I have accepted the resignation of Secretary of State Al Haig.
I am nominating as his successor—and he has accepted—George Shultz to replace him.
And that's the extent of the announcement. Again, as I say, I do this with great regret.
