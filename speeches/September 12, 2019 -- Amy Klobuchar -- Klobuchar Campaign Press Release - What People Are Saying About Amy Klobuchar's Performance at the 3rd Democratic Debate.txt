    Sen. Amy Klobuchar Shines in 3rd Democratic Debate"Best debate, best moment."
HOUSTON, TX — Tonight, as millions of viewers tuned in from around the country, Senator Amy Klobuchar showed why she is the strongest candidate to unite the country and take on Donald Trump. As she said, "I am someone that tells the truth. I don't make promises that I can't keep, I have people's back and I believe that to win you bring people with you and that is how you govern."
See what others are saying:
• The Washington Post: "Klobuchar had one of her best moments of the campaign in her opening remarks. Like Harris, Klobuchar shined in the health-care portion of the debate. She said bluntly, 'While Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill and on page 8 ... it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it.' She added, 'I don't think that's a bold idea. I think it's a bad idea.' She also played peacemaker in the gun debate when she pointed out all the candidates support banning assault weapons and background checks. She turned the argument to attack Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who refuses to bring gun legislation to the floor. Finally, she hammered Trump on his erratic, unfocused tariff war. She made a smart case that as someone from the Midwest she can talk to the heartland in a different way. Her closing was one of her strongest moments as she shared her story growing up with an alcoholic father and then her daughter's rocky birth, which started her career in politics. She was heartfelt and demonstrated the 'grit' she promised to bring to the office."
