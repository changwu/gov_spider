    Today we took additional steps in our effort to maintain pressure on the government of Iran. Specifically, the Departments of Treasury and State imposed sanctions on several companies and individuals engaged in activities such as assistance to Iran's nuclear program, support for terrorism, or aiding Iran's evasion of international sanctions. Just as we announced these measures and continue to enforce pre-existing sanctions on Iran, the United States remains committed to working with our P5+1 partners toward a long-term, comprehensive solution that provides confidence that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively peaceful. Our actions today and since the start of the talks are consistent with our commitments under the Joint Plan of Action, which provided limited relief of certain sanctions in exchange for Iranians steps that halted its nuclear program and rolled it back in key respects.
