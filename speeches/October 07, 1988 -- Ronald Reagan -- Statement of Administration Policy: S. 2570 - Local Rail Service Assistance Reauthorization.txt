    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Exon (D) Nebraska and 20 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of S. 2570, and the Secretary of Transportation and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget would recommend that it be vetoed if it were presented to the President. The Local Rail Service Assistance Program has already fulfilled the purpose for which it was created, and the authorization of additional appropriations is contrary to the need to reduce the deficit.
