The Administration supports the enactment of H.R. 3235.
Scoring for Purposes of Pay-As-You-Go
H.R. 3235 would affect direct spending and receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is zero.
