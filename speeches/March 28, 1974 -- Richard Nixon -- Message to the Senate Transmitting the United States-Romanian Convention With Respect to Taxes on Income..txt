    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, the Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Socialist Republic of Romania with Respect to Taxes on Income, signed at Washington on December 4, 1973.
The Convention was signed during the visit to the United States of the Romanian President, Nicolae Ceausescu. It is evidence of the continued improvement and expansion of United States-Romanian relations.
The primary purpose of this Convention is to promote economic and cultural relations between the two countries by removing many tax barriers. The convention follows generally the form and content of conventions recently concluded between this government and Western European countries.
I hope that the Senate will act favorably on this Convention at an early date.
