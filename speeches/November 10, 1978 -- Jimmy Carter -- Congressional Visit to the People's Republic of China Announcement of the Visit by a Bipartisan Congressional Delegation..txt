    The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China has invited a bipartisan congressional delegation to visit China during November.
The delegation will depart November 10 and return November 27. The group will be led by Senator Edmund S. Muskie, Democrat of Maine, who will be accompanied by his wife.
Other members of the group include Senators Bob Packwood (R-Oreg.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Dick Stone (D-Fla.), Representative Butler Derrick (D-S.C.), Tom Bevill (D-Ala.), the Lee Carter (R-Ky.), and James Scheuer (D-N.Y.), who will be accompanied by their wives, and Representative Wyche Fowler (D-Ga.), who is single and will be joined by his father.
The Congressmen will be accompanied by Frank Moore, Assistant to the President for Congressional Liaison, and his wife; David Dean, Department of State, former Deputy Chief of Mission, Peking; Madeleine Albright, National Security Council; and Richard Faulk, Department of State.
Since the first congressional delegation went to the People's Republic of China in 1972, more than 100 Members of Congress have visited China.
The exchange relationship fulfills that part of the Shanghai Communiqu√© in which both sides pledged to foster broader understanding and engage in cultural and scientific exchanges.
This will be the third congressional delegation to visit China in 1978.
