    Governor Matheson has expressed his concern over the possible health implications for people in Utah who were exposed to radioactive particles as a result of Defense Department testing of atomic bombs in the 1950's.
The Governor has asked me to review the findings of earlier Federal studies in Utah on the effects of exposure to radioactive particles on health and to determine whether or not a more comprehensive study is indicated.
I am today directing the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to take the actions:
—reevaluate the findings of earlier studies conducted in the State to determine whether or not the rate of illness or death from leukemia is dis* proportionately large in Utah, particularly in the southwestern counties;
—reopen a study conducted in the late 1960's on the incidence of thyroid disease; and
—consult with State officials and consider the possibility of developing a larger, more complete study if indicated.
I have asked Secretary Califano to work closely with the State of Utah as he proceeds. and I have asked the Secretary of Defense to cooperate fully in this endeavor.
