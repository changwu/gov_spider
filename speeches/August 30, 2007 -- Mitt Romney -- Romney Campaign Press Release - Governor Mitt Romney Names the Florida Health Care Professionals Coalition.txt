Boston, MA â€“ Governor Mitt Romney today named the Romney for President Florida Health Care Professionals Coalition. Led by Statewide Chairs Frank Farmer, Patrick Hutton and Carl Lentz, this group of health care professionals will work to ensure Florida voters know that Governor Romney is the candidate who supports free-market health care reform that will enable more Americans to become insured through the private market.
"Health care leaders in Florida and across the nation understand the critical need to make health insurance more available and more affordable for all Americans," said Governor Romney. "The answer is not more government, but more innovation. We must harness the power of free market reforms to provide private insurance options to our citizens without a tax increase and without a big government takeover."
In a joint statement, the Coalition Chairmen said, "As Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney applied conservative principles to address the health insurance crisis in his state and is widely recognized as a national innovator in this field. As evidenced by the reform plan he presented to the Florida Medical Association last week, Governor Romney is the best equipped candidate to reform our health care system while protecting American taxpayers from a one-size-fits-all program that would result in increased spending and greater regulatory burdens."
