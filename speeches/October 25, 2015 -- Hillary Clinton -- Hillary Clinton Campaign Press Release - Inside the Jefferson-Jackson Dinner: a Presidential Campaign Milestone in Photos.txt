The Iowa Jefferson-Jackson Dinner—also known as the JJ—is a Democratic Party tradition, a political pageant, and a campaign milestone marking the final stretch before the Iowa caucuses.
Ninety-nine days from now, Iowans will decide the first presidential race of the 2016 election. So this weekend, Hillary supporters from across the Hawkeye State (and a few familiar faces from out of town) came together to let the rest of the country know that Iowa is Hillary country.
