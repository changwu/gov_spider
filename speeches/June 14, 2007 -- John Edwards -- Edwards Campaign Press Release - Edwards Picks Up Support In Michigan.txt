    50 Democrats endorse Edwards for president
Detroit, Michigan â€“ As Senator John Edwards visits Detroit to discuss his plan to guarantee quality, affordable health care to every American, the John Edwards for President campaign announced that 50 Michigan Democratic leaders are endorsing Edwards for president. Edwards' campaign to transform America already has the support of two Michigan leaders: Congressman Bart Stupak, who endorsed Edwards in February and former Congressman David Bonior, who is leading Edwards' campaign as the National Campaign Manager. In April, Edwards delivered the keynote address at the Michigan Democratic Party's Jefferson-Jackson Dinner.
"I can't think of anything more important that I could be doing than working to elect John Edwards our next president," said Bonior. "He is a leader in the fight for social and economic justice in our country and I'm proud to be a part of his campaign to create a working society where every person who works hard has the chance to achieve the American Dream."
"Through his leadership on poverty, the minimum wage and with the victims of Hurricane Katrina, John Edwards brings morality and voice to issues too often ignored," said Rev. Michael C. Murphy. "The prophet Amos said 'let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.' Senator Edwards' willingness to speak truth to power embodies this spirit."
Former State Senator and environmental leader Lana Pollack endorsed Edwards saying, "I'm thrilled that John Edwards is running for president because he is not afraid to speak the truth on even the toughest issues. He is the only one taking on the issue of poverty in a way that counts. He clearly has the strongest position on the biggest environmental challenge we face -- global warming."
Sheriff Mark Hackel said, "John Edwards is committed to the working people of this country. He cares about our future, jobs, and health care. He's the one person who can bring us all together."
"These are tough times in Michigan with many complicated issues," said State Representative Fred Miller. "John Edwards is the kind of leader with real plans to address the problems we are facing in these tough economic times in Michigan. As the son of blue-collar workers, John understands the concerns of Michigan's working families and knows that now is the time to stand up and fight for what is right. My colleagues and I are proud to endorse John Edwards for president and ask others to stand with us to create a better America."
