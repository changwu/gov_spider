    The Speaker of the House of Representatives:
I have the honor to transmit herewith for the consideration of Congress thirty-two supplemental estimates of appropriation for the War Department, for the fiscal years 1939 and 1940, totaling $185,440,000, of which $2,500,000 is to remain available until June 30, 1941, and $46,600,000 is to remain available until expended. In addition, these estimates provide for the granting of contract authorizations aggregating $64,560,000.
'These estimates are for the purpose of carrying out the recommendations contained in my message to Congress of January 12, 1939, as subsequently embodied in the act of April 3,1939, for an emergency program for the expansion of the Army Air Corps; and I trust that the Congress will expedite its action thereon.
The details of these supplemental estimates of appropriations, the necessity therefor, and the reasons for their transmission at this time are set forth in the letter of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, transmitted herewith, with whose comments and observations I concur.
Respectfully,
