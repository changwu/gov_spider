    As the eviction moratorium deadline approaches tomorrow, I call on all State and local governments to take all possible steps to immediately disburse these funds given the imminent ending of the CDC eviction moratorium. State and local governments began receiving Emergency Rental Assistance funding in February and were eligible for an additional $21.5 billion passed in the American Rescue Plan. Five months later, with localities across the Nation showing that they can deliver funds effectively, there can be no excuse for any State or locality not accelerating funds to landlords and tenants that have been hurt during this pandemic. Every State and local government must get these funds out to ensure we prevent every eviction we can.
State and local governments can and should use both the Emergency Rental Assistance and their American Rescue Plan State and local funds to support policies with courts, community groups, and legal aid to ensure no one seeks an eviction when they have not sought out Emergency Rental Assistance funds. State and local governments should also be aware that there is no legal barrier to moratorium at the State and local level. My administration will not rest—nor should State and local governments—until Emergency Rental Assistance dollars reach Americans in need.
