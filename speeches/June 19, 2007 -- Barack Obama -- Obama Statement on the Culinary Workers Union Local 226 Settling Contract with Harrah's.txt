    Las Vegas, NV - Barack Obama made the following statement today on the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 settling their contract with Harrah's.
"This is a positive step forward, but this is bigger than one contract or negotiation and it is time for other companies to follow suit. I pledged my support for the workers when I met with the negotiating committee two weeks ago and I'll be there with them on the picket line until every worker has a fair contract.
What we are fighting for is making real the idea that in this country, we value the labor of every American. That we're willing to respect that labor and reward it with a few basic guarantees - wages that can raise a family, health care if we get sick, a retirement that's dignified, a home you can afford. We will not achieve success for all workers until we have fair contracts that make it possible for workers to achieve the American dream."
