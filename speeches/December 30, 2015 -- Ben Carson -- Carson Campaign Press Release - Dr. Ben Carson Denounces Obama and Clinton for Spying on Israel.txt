    Alexandria, Va. - December 30, 2015 - Today, Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and 2016 GOP presidential candidate, condemned the Obama administration for spying on Israel.
The Wall Street Journal has reported that although President Barack Obama announced two years ago that he would curb U.S. surveillance on friendly heads of state, he has consistently spied on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders. The administration has used the information gathered to counter Israeli opposition to the U.S. nuclear arms agreement with Iran.
As part of its eavesdropping efforts, the Obama administration has also collected private conversations between Israeli leaders and U.S. policymakers in Congress.
"It is truly disgraceful that the Obama administration has spied on Prime Minister Netanyahu, his colleagues and pro-Israel lawmakers in Congress," said Dr. Carson. "Instead of focusing on deterring the Iran nuclear threat and fighting against the Mullahs who chant 'Death to America,' President Obama has treated Israel, our staunch, democratic ally in the Middle East, as his real enemy. Not only did he not curtail surveillance on our close friend, he has once again proven himself to be a president that our enemies need not fear and our friends cannot trust."
"No doubt President Obama's former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton knew of the administration's spying efforts on Israel," added Dr. Carson. "It is shameful that she participated in undermining the U.S.-Israeli relationship. Once again, she has shown that her experience in government is merely an indication that she is unfit to lead. When I am president, I will stand firmly with Israel, and one of my first acts in office will be to revoke Obama's nuclear agreement with Iran."
