    Earlier today, President Obama called Guatemala's President-elect Otto Perez Molina to congratulate him on his recent electoral victory and to commend the Guatemalan people for their dedication to democracy. The Presidents discussed the shared responsibility for enhancing citizen security in Guatemala and underscored the importance of institutional reforms, respect for human rights, and inclusive economic growth in advancing the well being of all Guatemalans. President Obama reaffirmed the United States' commitment to working in partnership with Guatemala, noting the deep ties between the two countries, based in part on the significant contribution of Guatemalan-Americans to both countries.
