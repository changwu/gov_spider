    The attack on American diplomatic personnel in Pakistan today outrages all Americans. I have instructed relevant U.S. Government agencies to work with the Government of Pakistan to apprehend the perpetrators of this cowardly act. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for the excellent cooperation it has already provided.
Our hearts go out to the families of Gary Durell, a communicator, and Jacqueline van Landingham, a consulate secretary, who were killed. We pray for the speedy recovery of Mark McCloy, a consulate spouse, who was wounded.
Attacks such as these should make the international community rededicate itself to efforts to stamp out terrorism everywhere.
