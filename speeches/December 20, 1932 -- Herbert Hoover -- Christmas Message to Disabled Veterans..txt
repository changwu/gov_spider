    To All Disabled Veterans:
Once more it is my privilege to send to you my cordial Christmas greetings and an earnest wish that the New Year will bring you restoration of health and much happiness.
Your country's continued remembrance of your sacrifices in its behalf is evidenced in the establishment and maintenance of a vast service dedicated to your needs; its gratitude and affection you have always.
That the New Year may bring you many blessings and a complete return to health is my heartfelt wish.
HERBERT HOOVER
