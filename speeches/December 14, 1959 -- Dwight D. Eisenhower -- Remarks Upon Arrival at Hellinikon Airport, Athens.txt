    Your Majesty, Ladies and Gentlemen:
It is a great privilege to be welcomed to this city for the first time in 7 years. I come back to a country that is responsible for much that belongs to Western culture and civilization.
When I came here 7 years ago, I found this nation to be one-in its courage, in its hardihood, in its adherence to principle--truly as great as those Greek city states that we learned to love and admire from the days when as little boys we learned our ancient history.
So I assure you again that the welcome from His Majesty, the audience, and the people--individuals here, it means much to me, and I hope as I have my talks with His Majesty, His Majesty's Government, that we will find much that we can exchange between ourselves that will be fruitful for the solution of any problems between us.
Thank you very much.
