    Earlier today, Vice President Biden greeted volunteers during registration for the 25th annual National Disabled Veterans Winter Sports Clinic in Snowmass Village, Colorado. Over 600 volunteers will participate in the week-long program that brings together nearly 400 veterans with disabilities through adaptive winter sports. The clinic is organized by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Disabled American Veterans.
