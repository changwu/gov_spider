    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Canady and 181 cosponsors)
H.R. 929 contains the same serious flaws as H.R. 1833, a virtually identical bill that was passed during the 104th Congress and vetoed by the President on April 10, 1996.
The President will veto H.R. 929 for the reasons he expressed in his veto message of April 10, 1996, which is attached.
