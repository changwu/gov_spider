    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit the first Annual Report on the implementation of Section 403 of the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978, which was prepared by the Department of Energy and submitted to me by Secretary Duncan.
The Report describes actions taken by Federal agencies pursuant to Executive Order 12217, which I issued on June 18, 1980, to increase the conversion of Federal facilities now burning oil or natural gas to coal or other alternate fuels. All Federal agencies must survey and identify facilities subject to the Act and submit annual plans for funding their conversions beginning in Fiscal Year 1982. Five major Federal installations are now in the process of converting twelve units to coal. These conversions will displace 920,000 barrels of oil per year.
The Report also discusses the results of Executive Order 12185, in which I directed all Federal agencies to establish rules to encourage conservation of petroleum and natural gas by recipients of Federal financial assistance. Agencies published final rules and guidelines to implement this Executive Order on August 29, 1980.
