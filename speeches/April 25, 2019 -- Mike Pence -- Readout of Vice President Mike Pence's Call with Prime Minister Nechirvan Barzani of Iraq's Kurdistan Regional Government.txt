    Vice President Mike Pence spoke today with Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani of Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government. Prime Minister Barzani provided Vice President Pence an update on the security situation in Iraq's disputed territories and underscored the importance of continued U.S. support to stabilize these areas and allow for the return of more than one million Iraqis who remain displaced following the defeat of the ISIS caliphate. Vice President Pence commended Prime Minister Barzani and the Kurdistan Regional Government for providing refuge for many of these displaced civilians and for leading Iraq's efforts to protect religious components who suffered a genocide at the hands of ISIS. The leaders also discussed opportunities to deepen the U.S. partnership with Kurdistan and work more closely to counter malign actors that seek to destabilize Iraq and undermine its sovereignty.
