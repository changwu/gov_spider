    Bernie Sanders visited Mt. Rushmore on Thursday. He called the National Park Service monument to "four great presidents" of the United States an "unbelievable accomplishment" and "America at its best."
After walking a trail to see the six-story-tall granite carvings, Sanders shook hands with a group of tourists. One woman said she had come to see four great American leaders of the past and one future president.
