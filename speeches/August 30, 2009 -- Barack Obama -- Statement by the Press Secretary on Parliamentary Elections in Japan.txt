    The people of Japan have participated in an historic election in one of the world's leading democracies. As a close friend and ally, the United States awaits the formation of a new Japanese government. We are confident that the strong U.S.-Japan Alliance and the close partnership between our two countries will continue to flourish under the leadership of the next government in Tokyo. President Obama looks forward to working closely with the new Japanese Prime Minister on a broad range of global, regional and bilateral issues.
