Marco exposed Donald Trump as a total empty suit last night, and he's not letting up today.Appearing on Today, Marco picked up right where he left off, calling out Trump as a con artist who's taken advantage of working people:


We are not going to turn over the conservative movement to a con artist, who is telling people one thing but has spent 40 years sticking it to working Americans and now claims to be their champion.
â€¦ this is a guy who has taken Trump Airlines bankrupt. Trump Vodka? Nobody wanted it. Trump mortgage was a disaster. Trump University was a fraud.
If that wasn't enough, Marco also made his case on CBS This Morning and Good Morning America. 
The stakes of this election couldn't be clearer. You can choose Marco, a conservative leader who is ready to unite the party, or you can choose a con artist.
