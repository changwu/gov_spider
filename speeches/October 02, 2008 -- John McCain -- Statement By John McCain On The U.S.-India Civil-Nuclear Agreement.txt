    ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, U.S. Senator John McCain issued the following statement on the U.S.-India Civil-Nuclear Agreement:
"Yesterday, the U.S. Congress passed legislation clearing the way for the U.S.-India Civil-Nuclear Agreement to come into force. Governor Palin and I congratulate the Congress on moving this important legislation forward. India has been a responsible democracy and this agreement allows it to become further integrated into the global effort to control proliferation of dangerous technologies. The agreement will also allow the U.S. and India to cooperate in taking maximum advantage of new technologies that can provide energy without relying on greenhouse gas-emitting fossil fuels.
"Our friendship with India is rooted in the norms and values we hold in common with the great democracies of Asia. Indian Prime Minister Singh has called liberal democracy 'the natural order of social and political organization in today's world.' When Governor Palin met with Prime Minister Singh in New York last week, they once again reaffirmed the shared values that are the bedrock for the prosperity and stability we all desire. They also stressed their commitment to moving forward on the civil nuclear accord as part of a deepening of our relations. During the Senate's previous consideration of this important legislation, Senator Obama supported efforts that would have killed this accord. His own running mate, Senator Joe Biden, described one of the provisions Senator Obama voted for as a 'deal breaker.' We took a different approach: I wanted to make the deal, not break it, and I have supported the US-India Civil Nuclear Accord from the beginning. Accordingly, yesterday's Congressional action is welcome."
