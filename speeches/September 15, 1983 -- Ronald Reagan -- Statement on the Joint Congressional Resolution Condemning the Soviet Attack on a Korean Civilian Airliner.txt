    On behalf of all Americans, I salute the House and Senate for their overwhelming, bipartisan support of a resolution condemning the Soviet Union's murder of 269 innocent people aboard KAL 007. This wanton, barbaric act violated the most basic principle of international law and morality—the sanctity of human life.
The Kremlin is on notice: When it comes to responding to its aggression, there are no Republicans or Democrats—only Americans, united and determined to protect our freedom and secure the peace.
I urge the American people to stand by the families whose loved ones were taken from them. And let us appeal to the conscience of the civilized world: The passengers of KAL 007 must never be forgotten; nor must we rest until the world can prevent such a crime against humanity from ever happening again.
