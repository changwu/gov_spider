    Today, Biden for President released a new digital ad featuring Meghan, a frontline health care worker from Southeast Michigan. The ad, titled "Very Much Alone," will run as the United States surpasses 200,000 deaths from the coronavirus, a grim milestone six months into the pandemic.
Airing on digital platforms nationally, the ad follows Meghan as she discusses her experience on the frontlines during the pandemic, from a lack of PPE to the pain of patients saying final goodbyes to loved ones over FaceTime. "There is a lot of suffering right now," says Meghan. "But President Trump has provided very little leadershipâ€¦I think Joe Biden is the right person to lead this country because we need somebody who cares about us and can build us back. I trust Joe Biden to do that."
