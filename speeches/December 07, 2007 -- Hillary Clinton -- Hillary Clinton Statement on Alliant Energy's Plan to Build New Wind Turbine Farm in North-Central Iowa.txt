    Senator Hillary Clinton released the following statement commending Alliant Energy's plan to build a new wind turbine electrical-generating operation in Hampton:
"I congratulate Alliant Energy on their investment in a wind-turbine electrical generating operation in Hampton. This operation will not only generate an ongoing source of reliable, clean energy, it will create good jobs for the local community. As President, I will invest in alternative energy and be a strong partner for Alliant Energy and other companies and innovators who are helping to address some of the most pressing problems of our time -- dependence on foreign oil and global warming."
