Pool report #8a: POTUS quotes on surplus vaccines 
After POTUS finished his prepared remarks, reporters shouted out questions at him, including "What will you do with a surplus?" POTUS responded to that one.
"Surplus will, if we have a surplus, we're going to share it with the rest of the world," POTUS said. "We've already decided we were going to work with [inaudible] COVAX, we've committed 40 billion dollars to help get the funding."
"This not something that can be stopped by a fence no matter how high you build a fence or a wall. So we're not going to be ultimately safe until the world is safe," said POTUS. "So, we're going to start off making sure Americans are taken care of first, but we're then going to try to help the rest of the world."
He didn't respond to any other Qs.
