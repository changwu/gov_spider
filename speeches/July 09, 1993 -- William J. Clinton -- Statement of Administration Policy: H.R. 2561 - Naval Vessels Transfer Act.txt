    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Hamilton (D) IN and Gilman (R) NY)
The Administration supports H.R. 2561.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2561 would increase receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB'S preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is that it would increase receipts by $15.8 million over FYs 1994-1998.
