    I was saddened by the news of the death of former President Roh Moo-hyun of the Republic of Korea. During his tenure, President Roh contributed to the strong and vital relationship between the United States and the Republic of Korea. On behalf of Government of the United States, I offer my condolences to his family and to the Korean people.
