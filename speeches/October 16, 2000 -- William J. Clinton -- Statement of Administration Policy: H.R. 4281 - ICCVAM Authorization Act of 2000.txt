    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Calvert (R) California and 73 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 4281, which would establish the Interagency Coordinating Committee for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) as a permanent committee within the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Under H.R. 4281, the ICCVAM would continue its mission to increase the efficiency and effectiveness for reviewing chemical test methods for use by Federal agencies and Departments. This ensures that new and revised methods meet the specific needs of the agencies and departments, while at the same time reducing, refining, or replacing the use of animals for testing purposes where feasible.
The use of these alternative test methods will be contingent upon their effectiveness in generating data in an amount and of a scientific value that is at least equivalent to the data generated by the existing test methods they are meant to replace. H.R. 4281 does not apply to medical research or research using biotechnology, but rather to chemical testing that is required by Federal statute or regulation. The ICCVAM has proven to be an effective institution. Accordingly, the Administration supports both making the ICCVAM permanent as called for by H.R. 4281 and providing it with resources necessary for its continued operation.
