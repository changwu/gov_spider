In-town pool report #4 - Till event ends
POTUS said it was hard hold back his anger while he was preparing his remarks. He spoke of Mamie Till-Mobley's courage in choosing to let the world see what happened to her son by having an open-casket funeral.
"Only with truth comes healing, justice, repair and another step forward towards a more perfect union"
"Silence is complicity. I will not be silent nor will you be silent about it," he said.
He made a reference to GOP efforts to ban books.
"At a time when there are those who seek to ban books, bury history, we're making it clear - crystal, crystal clear. While darkness and denial can hide much, they erase nothing. We can't just choose to learn what we want to know. We have to learn what we should know."
He said another hero in this story was the Black press. They were "unflinching" in covering this story.
He quoted Ida B Wells: "The way to right wrongs is to shine the light of truth upon them."
"It was barbaric, barbaric what happened, POTUS said.
"To all you moms out there, imagine the courage it took to let them see."
Said it's his honor to sign the proclamation, adding that we "need to keep pushing" and promising to continue to make process.
He stopped speaking at 12:38pm and walked over to a desk next to the podium. The VP stood behind him along with members of the family, administration members and members of Congress.
He signed the proclamation at 12:40 pm. and handed the pen to one of the attendees.
"Hail to the Chief" began playing as he greeted the guests and shook hands while seated at the desk. He rose and continued to talk to attendees before walking over to other guests to chat on the far side of the room. He spoke to Rev. Parker briefly and waved to the photographers stationed on the balcony above. POTUS exited at 12:44pm ET.

In-town pool report #8 - POTUS remarks
POTUS stood to the left of the podium along with Richele Keas from the National Alliance on Mental Illness. She shared her story of her struggle to seek access to mental health care for her daughter before introducing POTUS.
POTUS hugged Keas before he began speaking at 3:23pm ET.
He said her story is one millions of people share. He thanked Sen. Stabenow and said, "we wouldn't be here if it weren't for Debbie." He also thanked acting Sec. Julie Su, who was in the crowd. Pool also spotted former Rep. Patrick Kennedy.
On his administration's push for greater health insurance coverage to include mental health programs, POTUS said, "It's essential to be people's well-being."
"I don't know what the difference between breaking your arm and having a mental breakdown is. It's health," he said. "There's no distinction. It's health."
Says mental health care and treatment for substance abuse is out of reach for most Americans.
"We must fulfill the promise for mental health parity for all Americans."
He announced new steps his administration is taking to dramatically increase access to mental health care.
POTUS said improving mental health means addressing the "three C's": Coverage, care and causes. "Today we took a big step in coverage." Says we need to now address care and prevention.
"It's important for people to realize they're not alone," POTUS says, adding that mental health care can be life-saving and life-changing.
He stopped speaking at 3:38pm and immediately began working the rope line. He exited at 3:40 pm.
POTUS did not respond to shouted questions. It was hard to hear as "God Bless America" blared from the speakers. Two of the questions were whether he had an update on Trevor Reed and if he had spoken to Hunter Biden.
