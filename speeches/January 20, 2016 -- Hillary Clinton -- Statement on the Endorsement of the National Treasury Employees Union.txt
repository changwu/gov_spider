    Hillary Clinton released the following statement after the  National Treasury Employees Union endorsed her campaign for President. Clinton now has the endorsement of 22 national labor unions or labor alliances representing over 12 million American workers.
"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of the National Treasury Employees Union and their 150,000 employees in 31 agencies and departments.
"For decades, NTEU members have helped America work—and along the way, they have helped build the American middle class by fighting for higher wages, paid family leave, and a secure and dignified retirement.
"As President, I will always stand up for workers' rights and protect retirement security, including defined benefit plans and Social Security. I'm proud to stand with federal workers, including the men and women of NTEU, to build a better future for working families. Because when workers are strong, families are strong—and when families are strong, America is strong."
