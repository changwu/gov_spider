    On behalf of all Americans, I wish to express my condolences to the families of the recent victims of terrorist violence in Spain. We stand with the people of Spain who condemn these cowardly acts and hope the perpetrators will be brought swiftly to justice. There is no place for violence and terrorism in the pursuit of political goals.
