    President Jiang. On behalf of the Chinese Government and people, I would like to once again extend our warm welcome to you, Mr. President. We have just had a very good discussion about issues of utmost concern, and now I'm prepared to have a continued exchange of views with you on other aspects of the bilateral ties, as well as the international situation.
You will have the floor first.
President Bush. Well, Mr. President, first of all, thank you again for your gracious hospitality. I am so pleased that my wife, Laura, is traveling with me so that she can see the progress of your great country.
I also want to reiterate what I said inside about how thankful our Nation is—my Nation is for your strong support in our war against terror and how gracious you were with your phone call right after September the 11th, expressing your condolences.
We look forward to finding areas where we can work together, such as energy cooperation—is a chance for us to explore technologies that will enable your country to grow and our country to grow at the same time, work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
I gave a speech in the United States the other day outlining our vision of making sure we have economic growth and, at the same time, employ new technologies that will help us reduce greenhouse gases. And I announced to the country that I look forward to working with nations such as yourself, China, to explore ways that we can work together to deal with this issue in a cooperative spirit.
Another area where we can work together is on HIV/AIDS. I understand your Minister of Health is coming to the United States soon, and we can have a good chance for our Secretaries of Health to be able to work together and share information and share hope of able to deal with this very important issue, not only in our own countries but around the world.
