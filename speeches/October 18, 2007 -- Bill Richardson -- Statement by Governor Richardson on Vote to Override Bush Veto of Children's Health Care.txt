    Santa Fe, NM -- Today Governor Bill Richardson issued the following statement with regard to the failed vote to override the President Bush's veto of this bipartisan legislation:
"By siding with the President on this failed override vote, 154 Republican members of Congress chose to protect President Bush's misguided view, rather than protect the health of 10 million children nationwide. This President needs to stop playing politics with the lives and health of 20,000 New Mexico children and start supporting this bipartisan legislation, which is the highest health care priority for Governors across the country."
