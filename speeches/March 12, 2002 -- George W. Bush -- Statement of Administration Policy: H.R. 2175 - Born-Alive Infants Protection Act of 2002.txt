    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Chabot (R) OH and 105 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports enactment of H.R. 2175, a bill that would ensure that infants who are born alive, at any stage of development, are individual human beings who are entitled to the full protections of the law. H.R. 2175, which is similar to laws in a majority of States and the District of Columbia, would provide guaranteed legal protection whether or not the infant's delivery was natural or the result of an abortion.
