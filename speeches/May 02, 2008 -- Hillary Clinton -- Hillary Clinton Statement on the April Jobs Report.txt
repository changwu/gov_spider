It marks the fourth straight month of job loss, and means we have now lost more than a quarter-million jobs in 2008. This job loss is hitting families at a time when they are already facing record gas prices, record declines in home values and skyrocketing costs for everything from food to health care.
"We need a President who understands that a good job is the ticket to the American Dream, and who will fight every day for an economy that creates, not loses, jobs. That's what my campaign is about: jobs, jobs, jobs and jobs. And it is why I am focused on providing struggling middle class Americans real relief right now, with extended unemployment insurance, a $30 billion emergency housing fund, and having the big oil companies pay the gas tax this summer instead of families."
