Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced the Romney for President Puerto Rico Steering Committee Co-Chairs. The committee will be chaired by Republican National Committeewoman Zoraida Fonalledas and former Puerto Rico Attorney General Jose Fuentes-Agostini. These leaders will help Governor Romney organize grassroots efforts on the island and in mainland Puerto Rican communities, as well as communicate his message of conservative change in Washington.
In announcing the Puerto Rican Steering Committee, Governor Romney said, "With the help of Zoraida and Jose, we will take our message of a strong military, strong economy and strong families to Puerto Ricans on the Isle of Enchantment and across the United States. Puerto Ricans are among the most patriotic, family-oriented and entrepreneurial Americans you will find, and I am honored to have the support of these respected leaders. With their help, I will provide the leadership to move forward a final resolution of Puerto Rico's century-old status issue."
Announcing her endorsement of Governor Romney, Fonalledas said, "It is a great honor to join Governor Romney's growing team. He will bring a refreshing new brand of leadership to Washington, and I am confident Puerto Ricans in the island and across the U.S. will be attracted to his message of change through strong conservative leadership."
Fuentes-Agostini said, "I am proud to support Governor Romney's candidacy for President of the United States. We need to elect someone with conservative credentials and the proven ability to get things done. Washington is broken and incapable of addressing the great issues of the day. Governor Romney is a proven problem-solver who can get Washington to work. I am pleased to chair his Puerto Rico Steering Committee."
