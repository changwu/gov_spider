First Lady Jill Biden pool report, #1 and done.
First Lady Jill Biden toured the renowned Templo Mayor Museum Tuesday afternoon alongside the first ladies of Canada and Mexico.
The trip to the museum followed a trilateral spousal luncheon at the National Palace nearby.
Lunch was closed press, but the pool was present for a brief photo spray at the museum. We were positioned on a railing overlooking one of the museum's premier exhibits: a 15th century volcanic stone carving of Tlaltecuhtli (cq), the "Mesoamerican earth goddess associated with fertility," according to an online entry in the World History Encyclopedia.
"Envisioned as a terrible toad monster, her dismembered body gave rise to the world in the Aztec creation myth of the 5th and final cosmos," per the encyclopedia.
The first lady troika came into view at 3 p.m., about 90 minutes after their scheduled arrival. Dr. Biden wore a blue dress, blue scarf, and blue sneakers. The first ladies stood side-by-side and studied the exhibit, listening to an explanation from the museum director, Patricia Ledesma.
At one point, they all looked up toward the cameras and Mexico's first lady, Dr. Beatriz Gutiérrez Müller, waved and smiled. Then they turned around to inspect some other glass-enclosed exhibits in the hall.
The pool was immediately ushered out. As we made our way toward the exits, Mexican security agents objected and insisted that we wait. But our dauntless press lead forged ahead and in minutes we were through the metal gates and out on the street.
That's the first lady's sole pool event on this second and final day of the North American Leaders' Summit.
Dr. Biden is bound for JBA later today.
