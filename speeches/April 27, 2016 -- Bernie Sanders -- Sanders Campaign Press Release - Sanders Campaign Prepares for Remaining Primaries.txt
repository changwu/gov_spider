    TERRE HAUTE, Ind. - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' spokesman, Michael Briggs, issued the following statement on Wednesday:
"Our campaign has now completed 80 percent of the primaries and caucuses. We look forward to winning here in Indiana next Tuesday and in the few remaining states and territories holding primaries and caucuses in May and June. That means that we no longer require many of the loyal and dedicated state and national support staffers who helped us in places like New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania and other states where the nominating contests have been completed.
"We will continue to have a strong and dedicated staff of more than 300 workers who are going to help us win in California and other contests still to come.
"This campaign believes that we have a path toward victory and we're going to marshal our resources to do everything we can to win the Democratic nomination."
