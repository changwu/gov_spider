    Ww've had a great day in the wonderful State of Illinois, and this is the culmination of a great experience, particularly in Peoria. I want to thank Mayor Carver. I want to thank my very dear friend Bob Michel, your outstanding Congressman. Most of all, I want to thank the just overly friendly and generous people from Illinois for making this day a wonderful one in my political career. I can't thank all of you enough.
But let me talk, if I could, Nobles1 and your lovely ladies, a little about my feelings about and experiences with the Shrine. I come from Saladin Temple in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I'm proud of it. My father was very, very active.
My first real personal exposure to the Shrine came in late December of 1934. I was selected to be on the East team of the Shriners East-West football teams. We went out to San Francisco where the Shrine has an outstanding hospital for crippled children. It was a tremendous experience for us on the Eastern football team to go to that hospital to see what is done to help unfortunate people, primarily young people. And I learned at that point not only what my father had sort of imbued in me but I learned what great people like all of you do, on a day-to-day basis, to help those less fortunate than yourself.
I've been proud ever since having the experience, and I thank you for inviting me tonight. I am deeply grateful for the association that I've had with my fellow Nobles at Saladin Temple, and it's just nice to see all of you from this temple here in Peoria.
Thank you very, very much.
