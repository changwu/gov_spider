    DES MOINES, IA â€” Iowa State Senator Todd Taylor today endorsed Senator Amy Klobuchar for president, her second Hawkeye state legislative endorsement this week. In announcing his support, Taylor cited Klobuchar's pragmatic approach to governing and strong support of organized labor.
"As the product of a union family, Amy understands the importance of the labor movement and the need to restore the dignity of work in this country," said State Senator Todd Taylor. "As President, I know she'll fight for new protections for America's workers. She reaches out to voters of all backgrounds and knows how to build consensus to make a real difference in the lives of working Americans. I believe she is the right candidate to lead our ticket to victory next year and I'm proud to support her campaign."
Taylor, a long-time champion for strong unions and labor protections in the Hawkeye state, became a member of the Iowa Senate earlier this year and had served in the State House since 1995. He currently serves as the Ranking Member of the Iowa Senate's Labor Committee.
His announcement comes as Klobuchar completes her 25th trip to Iowa as a presidential candidate and visits her 70th of the state's 99 counties today. To date, Klobuchar has the support of more current and former Iowa legislators than any other candidate in the race.
