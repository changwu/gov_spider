TRANSCRIPT:
SCOTT: China is the biggest threat to America's security.
Emboldened by Joe Biden's weakness, they are buying up our farmland, spying on our kids, and stealing our jobs.
As president, I'll keep China out of our homeland and out of our data.
I'll protect American workers, and I will return our military to the fiercest fighting machine in the world.
I'm Tim Scott and I approve this message because we need a commander in chief with a backbone.
