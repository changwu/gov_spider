Last night, with our nation one week away from default, President Obama and Speaker Boehner offered their respective visions for what would be needed to raise the debt ceiling. Gov. Huntsman supports the Boehner plan, which includes cuts commensurate with the debt ceiling increase, no tax increases, and takes real steps toward a balanced budget amendment - which is a critically necessary safeguard against reckless government spending.
The President should support this plan, and then immediately begin working with Congress on entitlement reform and revenue-neutral tax reform. Instead, he is calling for a "balanced" approach - code for $1 trillion in tax increases which would further dampen our economic recovery.
The President correctly noted that raising the debt ceiling has traditionally been a "routine" occurrence. Yet it's precisely that routine - in which Washington automatically piles up more and more debt without accompanying reforms - that's left us in this financial and economic crisis.
The President also pleaded with the American people to pressure lawmakers into supporting his plan. But with 14 million unemployed and millions more struggling to keep their heads above water, I think families have enough to worry about without being sucked into another political fight.
Yet last night the American people were once again shamefully subjected to another round of Washington theatrics, where elected leaders are playing a game of chicken with our economy, and risking the full faith and credit of the most powerful nation on earth for political games. The American people deserve better.
