    HENDERSON, Nev. – U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday welcomed a major endorsement by U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison for Sanders' Democratic Party presidential campaign.
"Keith Ellison is one of the great progressive leaders in the country leading the fight for the rights of working families and the environment," said Sanders. "I look forward to working with him to create a government which represents all Americans and not just the billionaires."
In a written statement, Ellison explained why he endorsed Sanders. "I'm endorsing Bernie because he is talking about the issues that are important to American families," Ellison said. "His candidacy is important for many reasons, but I believe the most important part of his candidacy is that it has the ability to create a renaissance in voter participation, which was at its lowest in decades this past election cycle. We've all seen the massive crowds he is attracting, and I think that is a testament to his message connecting with people — people we will need to turn out in November."
The Minnesota Democrat is a co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.
U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat who is Ellison's counterpart at the Progressive Caucus helm, endorsed Sanders in remarks at a big outdoor rally on Friday attended by more than 13,000 people in Tucson, Arizona.
Now the largest caucus in Congress, the progressive group was founded by Sanders in 1991.
Sanders is in Nevada preparing for Tuesday night's Democratic Party debate.
