    Dear Bob:
I've been delighted by the progress in moving our economic recovery program forward. I'm sure you regret as I do the House Budget Committee's recent actions, however. I fear that too many of our colleagues in the House prefer that we return to business as usualâ€”that we can solve the problems of the future by continuing the economic mistakes of the past.
On my behalf, would you please convey my strongest concern that we redouble our efforts to enact all the key elements of our plan for economic recovery. Together, we can gain a significant victory for the American people.
Sincerely,
RON
P.S. I promise to "suit up" and come off the bench as soon as possible.
[The Honorable Robert H. Michel, House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. 20515]
