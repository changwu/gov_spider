    Since the end of the cold war, the once-familiar threats facing our Nation, our friends, and our allies have given way to the less predictable dangers associated with rogue nations, global terrorism, and weapons of mass destruction. We have been actively transforming our defenses to address these changes. While we continue to make progress in the transformation of our uniformed military, it remains for us to realign the global posture of our forces to better address these new challenges.
Beginning today, the United States will intensify our consultations with the Congress and our friends, allies, and partners overseas on our ongoing review of our overseas force posture. We will ensure that we place the right capabilities in the most appropriate locations to best address the new security environment.
U.S. national security is closely linked to the security of our friends, allies, and global partners, and this review will serve to strengthen existing relationships and increase our ability to carry out our defense commitments more effectively. To meet this objective, we will invite the full participation of our friends and allies. And because any initiatives and adjustments resulting from this review must necessarily be comprehensive and affordable, it will be conducted in close consultation with the Congress of the United States. Secretary Powell and Secretary Rumsfeld will describe further our efforts at the NATO ministerial meetings in early December. High-level U.S. teams will begin consultations in foreign capitals in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere following those meetings.
The collective security of free nations depends now more than ever on modern capabilities and security cooperation. A fully transformed and strengthened overseas force posture will underscore the commitment of the United States to effective collective action in the common cause of peace and liberty.
