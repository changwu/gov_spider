    Dear Mr. Chairman: (Dear Senator:)
The Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1991 (Public Law 101 - 507; 104 Stat. 1351) (the "Act"), requires the President to prepare and submit to the appropriate committees of the Congress a report describing the use of funds made available by the Act to the Points of Light Foundation (the "Foundation"). Because the Foundation has been operational for such a short period of time, I submit herewith the Foundation's fiscal year 1992 budget submission in lieu of the aforesaid report.
I believe you will find that the fiscal year 1992 budget submission sufficiently describes the activities of the Foundation and the uses to which it intends to put the monies appropriated.
Sincerely,
George Bush
