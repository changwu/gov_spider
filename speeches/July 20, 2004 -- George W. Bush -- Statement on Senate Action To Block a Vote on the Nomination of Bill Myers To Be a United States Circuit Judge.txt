    Today a minority of Senators once again used obstructionist filibuster tactics to block a vote on an outstanding nominee to the United States Court of Appeals. Bill Myers has had a distinguished career as a public servant and practicing attorney and enjoys widespread support from across the political spectrum, yet he has been denied a simple up-or-down vote.
These tactics are unfair to Bill Myers and unfair to the American people. Bill Myers has the support of a bipartisan majority of Senators and would be confirmed if given an up-or-down vote. He would be an asset to the Ninth Circuit, which is seriously overworked and in need of more judges. He would fill a seat that has been designated a judicial emergency by the Judicial Conference of the United States. More Americans will be denied speedy access to our justice system by the obstruction of a few.
I continue to call on the minority in the Senate to stop playing politics with the American judicial system and give judicial nominees the fair treatment they deserve and the American people expect.
