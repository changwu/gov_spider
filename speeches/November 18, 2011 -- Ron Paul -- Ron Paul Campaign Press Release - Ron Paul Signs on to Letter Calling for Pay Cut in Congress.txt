    Advocates cutting compensation to reduce deficit
LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” Yesterday, 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul joined a bipartisan group of legislators in a letter sent to the members of the Super Committee calling for a reduction in Congressional compensation as part of any proposal to reduce the deficit.
The letter advocates reducing Congressional pay to "send a powerful message to the American people that Congress should not be exempt from the sacrifices it will take to balance the budget." It also highlights the fact that members of Congress are paid salaries 3.4 times the average full-time American workers.
"Congressman Paul has always voted against congressional pay raises, and he not does participate in the lucrative pension program," said Ron Paul 2012 Presidential Campaign Committee Chairman Jesse Benton.
"Ron Paul understands that Washington has to tighten its belt just like the rest of America, which is why as President, he plans to take a salary of $39,336, which is approximately equal to the median personal income of the American worker."
