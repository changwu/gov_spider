    Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with the provisions of section 1512 of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Public Law 105-261), I hereby certify that the export to the People's Republic of China of one two-inch fluid energy mill for the research and development of pharmaceutical powders and ten accelerometers for incorporation into railway geometry measurement systems is not detrimental to the United States space launch industry, and that the material and equipment, including any indirect technical benefit that could be derived from such exports, will not measurably improve the missile or space launch capabilities of the People's Republic of China.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
