Pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1994, Public Law 103-139, I hereby certify that proposing "detubing" of nuclear powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) as an option for eliminating submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) launchers under the START treaties to the other START Treaty signatories in the Joint Compliance and Inspection Commission (JCIC) would not be in the national interest.
You are hereby authorized and directed to notify the Congress of this determination and to publish it in the Federal Register.
