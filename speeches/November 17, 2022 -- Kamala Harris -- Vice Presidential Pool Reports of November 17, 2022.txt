Travel pool report #1
Good morning from Joint Base Andrews where it is a chilly 39 degrees. The pool has gathered and been swept for a scheduled departure of 7 a.m. EST. The Vice President boarded Air Force 2 at 6:53 a.m. she was wearing a tan blazer and black pants. She waved to the pool as she boarded but she didn't approach us and answer a question about the missile strike in Poland. Next stop on the way to Thailand is Elmendorf Air Force Base to refuel.

Air Force 2 was wheels down on Yokota Air Base at 3 p.m. local time, where it was cloudy and a chilly 59 degrees. A "Welcome Vice President Kamala Harris" sign was set up in front of a red walkway from the plane's entrance.

During the refueling, the Vice President greeted staff from the base inside the lounge, according to a White House official. That meeting was closed to press. We were wheels up at 4:55 p.m.

Travel pool report #4 - Arrival
We are wheels down at Don Mueang International Airport at 9:57 p.m. The Vice President and Second Gentleman deplaned at 10:13 p.m., down a staircase adorned with yellow, pink and purple bows. At the bottom, they were greeted by Thai officials (see list below). Your print pooler could not make out what was said, but the TV pooler said she at one point heard Harris say that she liked Thai food. We boarded into the motorcade at 10:19 p.m. and are en route to the hotel.
