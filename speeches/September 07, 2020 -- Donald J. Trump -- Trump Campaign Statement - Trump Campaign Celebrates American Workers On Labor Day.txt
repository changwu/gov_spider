    In honor of Labor Day, Lara Trump, Senior Advisor to Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., released the following statement:
"The Trump Campaign wishes all Americans a very happy Labor Day. Today, as we rise up as a nation from the fallout of the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, we are especially grateful that more and more Americans are getting back to work – as reflected in the latest jobs report that once again beat expectations – and reopening their businesses each and every day. President Donald Trump's signature achievement, creating millions and millions of jobs including 600,000 new manufacturing jobs before the pandemic, demonstrates he's the leader who is the most qualified to return America to greatness once again. All American workers understand that under President Trump's leadership, our best days lie ahead."
