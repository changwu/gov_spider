America has seen enough tragedies result from its open borders

It is a travesty that sixteen years removed from the devastating attacks of 9/11, we are still struggling as a nation to prevent foreigners with bad intentions from entering our country and killing innocent Americans. Sayfullo Habibullaevich Saipov, the alleged perpetrator of the Halloween day attack in New York City, came to the United States from Uzbekistan via the "visa lottery."
...
The visa lottery awards 50,000 green cards to foreign nationals with absolutely no ties to the U.S. and no special skills, through a computer-generated random drawing. According to the former chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, almost 1,900 aliens from state sponsors of terrorism were selected in the 2005 visa lottery.
...
This is not a program in America's best interests.
Chain migration is another feature of our immigration system that does nothing to help America and its legal citizens.
...
While a formal amnesty for illegal immigrants has been debated on Capitol Hill, we already have a de facto amnesty program in the form of chain migration. President Trump announced that Saipov, through chain migration, alone brought 23 family members to the United States with him. Chain migration has deemed over three million immigrants eligible, but many must wait because of category limitations. This has served as a driver for illegal immigration, as these applicants choose not to wait for the U.S. immigration bureaucracy to process them.
...
A Pulse Opinion Research poll taken over the summer showed a majority of likely midterm voters support ending the visa lottery.
...
Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.) have introduced the RAISE Act, which would, among other objectives, end the visa lottery program and refocus immigration policy in terms of merit, not need. In light of the carnage in his home state, will Schumer and others in his camp see the error of their ways and support legislation that protects American citizens? The time to act is now.
