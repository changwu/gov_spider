(Senate)
(Sen. Reid, D-NV, and Sen. Mikulski, D-MD)
The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of the amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 2775, making continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2014, and for other purposes. The legislation represents a bipartisan agreement to reopen the Government and remove the threat of default that would harm middle-class families, American businesses, and the Nation's economic standing in the world. The Administration urges the Congress to act swiftly to pass the bill in order to protect the full faith and credit of the United States and end the Government shutdown. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on fiscal year 2014 appropriations legislation for the full year.
