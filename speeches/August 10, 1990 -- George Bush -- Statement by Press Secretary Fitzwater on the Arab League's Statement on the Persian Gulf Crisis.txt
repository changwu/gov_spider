    We welcome the Arab League statement as a positive and significant statement.
We are pleased with the very strong condemnation of Iraqi behavior and the equally strong support for Kuwaiti sovereignty and the return of the legitimate government. We are gratified to see the explicit statement of support for the measures taken by Saudi Arabia as regards its right to self-defense. We see as positive the fact that the Arab summit resolution provides a basis for individual governments to send forces to support Saudi Arabia and other Arab States of the Gulf.
National security adviser Brent Scowcroft called the President aboard the Fidelity this afternoon to discuss the Arab League statement.
