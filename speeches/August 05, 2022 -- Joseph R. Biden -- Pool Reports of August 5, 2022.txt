White House In-Town Pool Report #1 — checking in
Good afternoon from the White House –
The air outside is roughly the temperature and consistency of cafeteria gravy, and your pooler has been tested and is awaiting the call to gather for President Biden's (remote) signing of the "PPP and Bank Fraud Enforcement Harmonization Act of 2022."
Here is today's full schedule:
1 p.m. Eastern: Signing of the PPPABFEHA (acronym assumed)
2 p.m. Eastern: Press briefing
For planning purposes, heavy rain and thunderstorms are expected later this afternoon, so remember to bring an umbrella and stay safe!

White House In-Town Pool Report #2 — gathering for bill signing

The signing is scheduled for 1 p.m. Eastern and will be livestreamed here: https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/

White House In-Town Pool Report #5 — remarks conclude
President Biden concluded his remarks at 1.28 p.m.
Asked from the pool about Brittney Griner, he responded: "I'm working hard and I'm hopeful."
The president did not respond to (and may not have heard) other questions from the restricted pool shouted from the Red Room.
In your pooler’s opinion, there was room in the Red Room — if not an abundance of fantastic vantage points — for the full pool to have covered the remarks.
