 In-town pool report #1 — testing 
Good morning on a perfect fall Tuesday at the White House. Pool just received COVID tests. Y'all know the drill: no news is good news.
POTUS was up early tweeting about a number of issues but currently has nothing on the public schedule. Pool asked the press if/when we will have a briefing with Sean Conley and the rest of Trump's medical team. Will pass along any info as soon as it's received.
Please feel free to reach out to me directly with any questions.

 In-town pool report #2 — Farah walk and talk 
WH communications director Alyssa Farah did not stop to gaggle after her live hit but responded to a few questions while walking back inside at 11:12am.
On reports of national address from POTUS: "I anticipate you will hear from him at some point today"
On any new confirmed cases among WH staff: "Not to my knowledge..."
Said she would get us an "update" on new coronavirus guidelines for WH staff
Here's a link to bad audio if anyone cares to listen: https://otter.ai/s/lrP6IE_1SuShVqxw0jhFtw
