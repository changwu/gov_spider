The Caravan is largely broken up thanks to the strong immigration laws of Mexico and their willingness to use them so as not to cause a giant scene at our Border.

The Fake News Washington Post Amazon's 'chief lobbyist' has another (of many) phony headlines 'Trump Defiant As China Adds Trade Penalties.' WRONG! Should read 'Trump Defiant as U.S. Adds Trade Penalties Will End Barriers And Massive I.P. Theft.' Typically bad reporting!Retweets: 24732Favorites: 93542
