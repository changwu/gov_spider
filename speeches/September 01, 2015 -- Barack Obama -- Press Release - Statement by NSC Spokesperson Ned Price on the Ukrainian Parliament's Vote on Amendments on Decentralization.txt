    The United States welcomes the Ukrainian parliament's vote on constitutional amendments on decentralization. This action represents an important step toward comprehensive reform of Ukraine's governance and the empowerment of regional and local authorities. In addition, this vote shows that Ukraine is steadfastly upholding its commitments under the Minsk agreements to adapt governance structures in certain parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. The United States condemns the clashes in Kyiv that left at least two dead and dozens wounded outside the parliament and urges all Ukrainians to refrain from violence as a means to achieve political objectives.
