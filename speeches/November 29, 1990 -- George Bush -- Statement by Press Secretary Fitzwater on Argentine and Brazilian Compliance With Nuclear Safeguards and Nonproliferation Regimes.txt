    The United States applauds the November 28 announcement by Argentina and Brazil to work with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to apply safeguards to all nuclear facilities and activities in their countries and to bring into force the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which establishes a nuclear weapon-free zone in Latin America. The prospects for a Latin America forever free from the dangers of nuclear weapons have brightened.
President Menem and President Collor have acted boldly to enhance regional and world stability in pledging to use nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes. We anticipate that yesterday's announcement of mutual inspections and negotiations with the IAEA will lead to the early implementation of a full-scope IAEA safeguards agreement. This will facilitate peaceful nuclear cooperation with Brazil and Argentina while broadening their access to other advanced technologies.
We also welcome and commend the commitment by the Governments of Argentina and Brazil to bring the Treaty of Tlatelolco into force. We urge them to do so swiftly. We also urge those countries in Latin America which have not done so to bring the treaty into force as Argentina and Brazil are pledging to do and to support the international community's nonproliferation regime. President Bush will visit the region next week and looks forward to discussing these issues in greater detail with Presidents Menem and Collor.
