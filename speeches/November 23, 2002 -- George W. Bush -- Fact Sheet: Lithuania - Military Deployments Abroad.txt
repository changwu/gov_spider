    Lithuania has contributed regularly to peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions. In the Global War on Terrorism, 37 Lithuanian Special Forces troops have been made available for deployment to Afghanistan to participate in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). Lithuania is also making available four physicians to work with the Czech field hospital in Afghanistan as part of the International Security Assistance Force (USAF).
In Southeast Europe, Lithuania shares an arrangement with Latvia and Estonia to send a contingent of forces for six-month rotations, with the other two Baltic States doing subsequent six-month rotations. About 100 personnel are assigned to the Danish contingent of NATO's Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia. A 95-person company rotated to NATO's Stabilization Force (SFOR) from February 2002 to August 2002. In Kosovo, Lithuania has maintained a 30-person platoon with the Polish battalion. Lithuania also assigned nine policemen to the UN Interim Administration in Kosovo.
In addition, since April 2001, an AN-26 and crew of seven have provided air support to NATO in the Balkans flying out of Naples.
