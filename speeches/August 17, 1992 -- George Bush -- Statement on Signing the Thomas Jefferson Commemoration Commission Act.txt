    Today I am signing into law S. 959, the "Thomas Jefferson Commemoration Commission Act." This bill would establish the Thomas Jefferson Commemoration Commission, which would be responsible for planning and developing programs to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Jefferson's birth. In doing so, it is my understanding that in light of the constitutional requirement that all executive functions be exercised by officers of the United States appointed in conformity with the Appointments Clause, Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), only those Commission members so appointed may exercise the executive authority granted in this bill. In addition, the Archivist of the United States, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Education, the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Librarian of Congress are members of the Commission who also are officers of the United States properly appointed for this purpose. Other members may directly participate only in the ceremonial or advisory functions of the Commission.
