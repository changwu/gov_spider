POLITICO: New Hampshire lawmaker endorses Booker
Cory Booker isn't soaring in the national polls or in the 2020 fundraising race. Still, the New Jersey senator is quietly making early presidential state inroads.
On Monday, Booker captured his first legislative endorsement in New Hampshire when state Sen. Jon Morgan gave him his official backing.
Morgan has met numerous 2020 candidates and attended recent campaign events for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney. But he said Booker's message, which centers on uniting a deeply divided nation, is what most resonated with him.
I've had a chance at this point to meet and speak with and get to know many of them; I respect and admire every single one of them," Morgan told POLITICO. "But the fact of the matter is we need a specific set of skills for the problems of today. I just believe we need a leader that's committed to bringing us back together, someone who recognizes we have more in common than divides us and especially someone who is going to be real leader not letting themselves be baited into these childish games we see being played out so frequently on various different platforms."
