    It's always gratifying when the honor of a just man is vindicated, and that's exactly what has happened with the report of the Independent Counsel on Ed Meese. It's a particularly happy moment for me because I've known and worked with Ed Meese for many years, and I know how much he's given of himself in service to his country and community. He is one of the most decent and honorable men I've ever known, so I'm not surprised by the outcome, but congratulate him in any case on his vindication.
I intend, if I am reelected, to resubmit his nomination as soon as Congress reconvenes in January. I'm confident that the Senate will confirm him, and I know he'll be a truly distinguished Attorney General.
