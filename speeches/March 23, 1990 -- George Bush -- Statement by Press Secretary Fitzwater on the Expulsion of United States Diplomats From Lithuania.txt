    Our Embassy in Moscow today was informed that two U.S. diplomats in Vilnius were ordered to depart in 12 hours. They will comply. They will return to the U.S. consulate in Leningrad.
This action certainly adds to our concerns. It does not contribute to a lessening of tensions that would make productive dialog easier. We have protested, especially in light of the fact that the United States has not acted in any way to exacerbate tensions.
In addition, it is unclear what specific actions have been taken against journalists. But we are opposed to any infringements on freedom of the press. The expulsion of journalists undermines the spirit of glasnost.
