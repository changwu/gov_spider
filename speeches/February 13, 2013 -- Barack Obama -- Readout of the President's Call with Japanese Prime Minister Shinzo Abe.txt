    The President spoke to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe today to discuss North Korea's nuclear test and to consult on steps to respond to this highly provocative violation of North Korea's international obligations. They pledged to work closely together to seek significant action at the United Nations Security Council and to cooperate on measures aimed at impeding North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. President Obama reaffirmed that the United States remains steadfast in its defense commitments to Japan, including the extended deterrence offered by the U.S. nuclear umbrella. The President indicated that he looked forward to in-depth discussions when the Prime Minister visits Washington later this month.
