    With today's vote in the United States Senate, Congress has given the hope of life to millions of people in countries most afflicted by AIDS. This historic legislation will enable us to provide critical treatment and care for millions who suffer and greatly expand successful prevention programs to help those at risk.
I look forward to this legislation reaching my desk as soon as possible so we can begin to turn the tide in the fight against AIDS.
