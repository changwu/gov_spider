    I am saddened by the death of Gen. Lucius D. Clay, who served his Nation throughout the world, in time of peace and war, as soldier, engineer, diplomat, statesman, industrialist, and financier.
After serving as General Eisenhower's deputy during World War II, General Clay went on to achieve worldwide eminence in his own right as Military Governor of the U.S. Zone of Germany and Commander in Chief of the United States forces in Europe.
He demonstrated America's determination that Berlin must remain free when he defied the Russian blockade of that city with the Berlin airlift. Perhaps of equal importance historically was his dedication to the reconstruction of West Germany's postwar economy.
I join millions of Americans in mourning General Clay's passing and in offering my sympathies to his family.
