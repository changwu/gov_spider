    BURLINGTON, Vt. â€“ Stirring images of everyday Americans and swelling crowds of grassroots supporters for Bernie Sanders are featured in a new message that will begin airing Friday in Iowa and New Hampshire.
"They've all come to look for America," sing Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel in their classic folk rock anthem as faces flash on the screen of people backing Bernie's insurgent campaign for president.
In Iowa alone, Sanders has spoken to more than 40,000 people at rallies and town halls since his campaign began last spring.
"This campaign is not about me," he often says. "It is not about Hillary Clinton or any other candidate. This campaign is about you, your kids and your parents. It is about creating a political movement of millions of people who stand up and loudly proclaim that this nation belongs to all of us and not just a handful of billionaires."
