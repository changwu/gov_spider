    IN BEHALF of the American people, I extend my deepest sympathy to you and to the people of France on the passing of Andre Malraux.
France has lost one of her finest sons. Modern civilization has lost a dynamic and creative spirit. The deep concern of Andre Malraux for his fellow man, his contributions to shaping a better world, and his creativity as a philosopher, novelist, and historian will endure as a lasting memorial.
