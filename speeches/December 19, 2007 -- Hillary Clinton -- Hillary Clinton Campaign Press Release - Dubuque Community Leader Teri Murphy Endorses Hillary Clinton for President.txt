    DUBUQUE, IA â€“ In a show of growing campaign momentum, Dubuque Community Leader Teri Murphy endorsed Hillary Clinton for President today. The nod comes on the heels of endorsements from the Des Moines Register, U.S. Representative Leonard Boswell, and former Senator Bob Kerrey.
"From my personal experience as a nurse, I know Hillary Clinton deeply cares about the working conditions of nurses and she will advocate on our behalf in the White House," said Teri Murphy of Dubuque. "Hillary is a powerful agent of change and I am proud to support her candidacy for President. I plan to stand for Hillary on January 3rd because I know she has the strength and experience to stand for me, and all nurses, on day one as President."
"I stood with Teri in the past in an effort to support the work of Iowa nurses and I am honored to have her support," Senator Clinton said. "As president, I will work to give nurses in Iowa a real voice in hospital procedures that affect patient care and work to retain the most qualified nurses at the bedside. Nurses need change in America and as president; I will begin working towards that change on day one."
Teri Murphy is a longtime emergency room nurse in Dubuque and is the wife of Speaker of the Iowa House Pat Murphy. She has four children and five grandchildren.
