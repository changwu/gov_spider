Pataki, who spoke for 15 minutes at the start of the dinner at the DoubleTree hotel, said if elected president he would reduce the size of the federal workforce in Washington, abolish the Common Core, and repeal Obamacare.
Pataki heads next to Colorado to participate in the third GOP debate Wednesday night.
Pataki, who served as governor from 1995 to 2007, said he's seen the America he loves change over the last several years.
"We've seen a world in flames," he said. "We've seen an economy that hasn't recovered. We're seeing a president who is devastating the greatest military that the world has ever known. It has got to stop."
Pataki also talked about how he wants to change the culture in Washington. He described Washington as being ruled by elites, who control how Americans run their lives.
"They speak a different language. They think they're better than us," Pataki said.
He commented on Hillary Clinton, Democratic presidential candidate, who spent hours on Thursday being questioned before the Congressional Select Committee on Benghazi.
