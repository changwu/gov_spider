    Chicago, IL — Senator Obama today released the following statement in support of striking Bay Area janitors.
"As thousands of Bay Area janitors continue their courageous fight to win a higher standard of living for themselves and their families, I offer my support."
"It's thanks to the bravery and sacrifice of these workers—and union men and women before them—that we've made progress in the fight to ensure that every American has rights on the job and the chance to improve their lives."
"The hundreds of mostly Latino janitors who walked off the job this week throughout the Bay Area took a stand against the unacceptable and ever-growing divide between the wealthiest and poorest among us—and they're inspiring other working people to do the same."
"This week, when janitors traded their brooms for picket signs, they also sent a message about the urgent need for good-paying jobs with health care and dignity to ensure that families aren't just surviving, but thriving. By speaking out against the injustice of having to share a home with other families just to stay alive, these hardworking janitors are demonstrating their abiding faith in the power of hope—and paving the way for others around this country to follow in their footsteps."
"It is my own hope that the employers in the Bay Area will take real responsibility for the kind of jobs that are offered within the confines of their offices and take swift measures to bring the janitors back to work."
"Until they do, the Bay Area janitors will have my support."
