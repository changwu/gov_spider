    The United Nations Security Council vote underscores the unity and determination of the international community to end Iraq's illegal occupation of Kuwait. We are pleased to note the common stance and determination of the world in this endeavor. The United States will continue working with all countries for the express purpose of having the United Nations Security Council resolution fully implemented. We continue to favor a peaceful settlement of this crisis; at the same time, and as the Security Council vote demonstrates, there is growing resolve that Saddam's occupation of Kuwait not be allowed to stand and that all necessary means be employed to ensure this is the case.
