    In a repeat of Oregon Senate candidate Ron Wyden's much- publicized grocery quiz failure, Lamar Alexander today was left speechless when asked the price of two common groceries.
According to the Associated Press, "Alexander was asked by a reporter how much a gallon of milk and a dozen eggs cost. He didn't respond and started walking slowly away, mingling with people. But moments later, Alexander grabbed an aide and said, 'I need to know the price of a gallon of milk and a dozen eggs, now.' Alexander, pressing aide Mike Tuffin, repeated with urgency, 'I need to know right now.' Tuffin returned a few minutes later and whispered in Alexander's ear."
"Lamar Alexander likes to practice his ABC'S, but he seems to have trouble with basic math," said Dole Campaign Manager Scott Reed. "Lamar may be an outsider when it comes to grocery stores, but he's an insider when it comes to politics. Next time he's walking across New Hampshire, he might want to stop at a supermarket."
