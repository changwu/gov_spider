President Obama's rejection of the Keystone XL Pipeline is a huge mistake, and is the latest reminder...

that this administration continues to prioritize the demands of radical environmentalists over America's energy security.

When I'm president, Keystone will be approved, and President Obama's backwards energy policies will come to an end.

This isn't just about Keystone, as Marco pointed out: It's about President Obama's entire dysfunctional energy policy, which has put political pandering ahead of new jobs and lower prices for Americans.
As President, Marco will pursue a completely different set of policies, which he's laid out over the course of his campaign. A 21st century energy plan will keep government out of the way of innovators and energy producers, allowing coal, oil, natural gas, and renewables to compete with each other on a level playing field. He would approve Keystone, and streamline permitting processes for new energy projects and infrastructure proposals like it.
