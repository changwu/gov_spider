    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Michigan Congressman Bill Huizenga.
"I'm truly honored to have Congressman Huizenga's support," said Mitt Romney. "Like me, Congressman Huizenga understands that we must stop Washington's out-of-control spending and put in place conservative policies that create jobs. With his help, I look forward to bringing my message of a 'Smaller, Simpler, and Smarter' federal government to Michiganders and voters across America."
"As a small business owner, I know that Michigan and our country needs a president who will empower entrepreneurs to create jobs and grow the economy," said Congressman Bill Huizenga. "With Obamacare, higher taxes, and unnecessary regulation, the Obama presidency has been a disaster for small businesses. Mitt Romney will reverse these policies and put in place an economic agenda that will rebuild the middle class. He understands that it truly is the private sector, not the government, that creates jobs. He is the conservative candidate that Michigan needs in the White House and I am proud to stand with him."
