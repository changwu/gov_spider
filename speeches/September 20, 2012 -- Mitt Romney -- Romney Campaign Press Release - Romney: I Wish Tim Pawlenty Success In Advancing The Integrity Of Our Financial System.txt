    Mitt Romney and Tim Pawlenty made the following statements following the announcement of Pawlenty accepting the Chairman and CEO position at The Financial Services Roundtable, a bipartisan organization that does not allow political activity:
"It is an honor to call Mitt and Ann my friends," said Tim Pawlenty. "My new position as CEO of The Financial Services Roundtable does not allow me to participate in partisan campaign activities. For that reason, I am stepping down from my position as co-chair of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. My work with Mitt has been a privilege.Â  Mitt Romney is a truly good man and great leader. As the campaign moves into the home stretch, he has my full support and continued faith in his vision and his policies."
"Tim Pawlenty is a dear friend," said Mitt Romney. "He's brought energy, intelligence and tireless dedication to every enterprise in which he's ever been engaged, and that certainly includes my presidential campaign. While I regret he cannot continue as co-chair of my campaign, his new position advancing the integrity of our financial system is vital to the future of our country. I congratulate him on his new position and wish him every success in carrying out his new mission."
