    Manchester Mayor Ted Gatsas made the following statement on tonight's debate:
"Mitt Romney won tonight's debate by clearly outlining his plans to turn around our economy. On the issues most important to Granite Staters - jobs, spending and taxes - there is no other candidate voters can trust more than Mitt Romney. His vision for limited government, balanced budgets, and low taxes stands in stark contrast to President Obama's abysmal economic policies. After three years of fiscal mismanagement, Granite Staters are looking for a new leader who can undo the damage caused by the Obama Administration's failed agenda. That leader is Mitt Romney."
