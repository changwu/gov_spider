    Chicago, IL-- Today, Senator Barack Obama released the following statement in response to reports that food pantries and food banks are struggling with shortages:
"As Americans gather with family and friends and reflect on what we're thankful for, let's all do our part to help the growing number of people who have no place to go for a meal on Thanksgiving - or any other day."
"As a result of rising costs on everything from health care to gasoline, more and more Americans can't afford to put food on the table. At the same time, pantries are being stretched thin as a result of reduced donations and cuts in government assistance. A report released last week showed that the number of Americans without food security grew by 300,000 from 2005 to 2006. That is unacceptable in this country, of all countries."
"To help address this, we need to stand up to the special interests, bring Republicans and Democrats together, and pass the Farm Bill immediately. And while we're at it, let's strengthen the Emergency Food Assistance Program, the Food Stamp Program and the Commodity Supplemental Food Programs and launch additional anti-hunger initiatives to help ensure that no American goes hungry."
"As we celebrate Thanksgiving this week, I'll be visiting the New Horizons food pantry in Manchester, New Hampshire. And I encourage all Americans to do what they can every day to help those in need - because the best way to show our gratitude for what we have is by doing our part for those who have less."-- Today, Senator Barack Obama released the following statement in response to reports that food pantries and food banks are struggling with shortages:
