    Campaign to Collect Toys At all 37 Offices Across Iowa
Des Moines, IA - At Saturday's event with the Obamas and Oprah Winfrey, the Obama Campaign will kick off a toy drive to collect toys which will be donated to Toys for Tots and distributed to local children in need.
"We invite everyone to join us in making a difference in the lives of local children in need," Iowa Deputy State Director Marygrace Galston said. "We encourage folks to bring toys to our rallies on Saturday and to stop by each of our 37 offices across Iowa to contribute."
Collection centers will be located at both the Des Moines and Cedar Rapids rally with the Obamas and Oprah Winfrey. New, unwrapped toys will also be collected through December 17 at each of the 37 Obama Campaign offices across Iowa. Each field office across the state will have donation boxes for area community members who would like to contribute.
Yesterday, Senator Obama issued a "Call to Serve" and detailed his commitment to making national service an important cause of his presidency in a major policy address at Cornell College in Mt. Vernon, Iowa. In his remarks, Obama discussed his personal experience in public service, as well as his plan to call on Americans from all walks of life to serve and to build an architecture that focuses their service toward achieving leading national goals.
