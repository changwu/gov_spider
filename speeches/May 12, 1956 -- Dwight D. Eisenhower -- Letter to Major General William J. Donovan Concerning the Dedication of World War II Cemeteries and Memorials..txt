Dear Bill:
I am delighted to know that you can represent me at the ceremonies to be held in Europe during July, at which the American Battle Monuments Commission will dedicate the cemeteries and the memorials it has constructed to the Americans who gave their lives in their country's service in World War II.
As you know, the program of ceremonies which the Commission is arranging will be international in scope. The Commission has just advised me that the specific program will be:
Cambridge, England 16 July
St. Laurent (Omaha Beach) France 19 July
St. James, Manche, France 20 July
Epinal, France 23 July
Draguignan, France 26 July
Nettuno (Anzio) Italy 30 July
General North, the Secretary of the Commission, can advise you in more detail concerning specific plans and arrangements.
With warm regard,
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
