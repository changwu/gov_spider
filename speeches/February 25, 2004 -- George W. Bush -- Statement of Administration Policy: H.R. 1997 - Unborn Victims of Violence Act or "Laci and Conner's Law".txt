    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Hart (R) PA and 136 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports protection for unborn children and therefore strongly supports prompt enactment of H.R. 1997. The legislation would make it a separate Federal offense to cause death or bodily injury to a child in utero if that offense was committed in the course of committing any one of 68 Federal offenses. The bill also would make substantially identical amendments to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The Administration would strongly oppose any amendment to H.R. 1997, such as the so-called "One-Victim" substitute, which would define the bill's crimes as having only one victim -- the pregnant woman.
H.R. 1997 is almost identical to legislation passed by the House with bipartisan support during the 106th and 107th Congresses.
