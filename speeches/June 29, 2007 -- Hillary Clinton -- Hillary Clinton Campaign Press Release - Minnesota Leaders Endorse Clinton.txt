    Hillary Clinton received the endorsements of more than 40 leading Minnesota officials and community leaders today.
"I sat next to Senator Clinton for six years in the Senate Chamber and I saw her experience, dedication and tremendous ability at work for all Americans," said former Senator Mark Dayton. "I know that she will be our party's best nominee and our country's best President."
Ramsey County Attorney Susan Gaertner said Hillary has the focus and resiliency needed to be President. "Americans are ready for change, and Hillary Clinton is the only candidate with the experience to do the job from her first day in office."
"I am grateful for the overwhelming support I've received in Minnesota," Clinton said. "With the help of these local leaders, we'll take our message of change across the state and this nation."
