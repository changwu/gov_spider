    I commend the Senate for passing legislation to strengthen and improve Medicare for America's seniors.
This legislation is largely consistent with my framework for reform that allows seniors to choose the health care that best meets their individual needs, including the option of staying in their traditional plan.
Seniors will have more choices and better benefits, including long-awaited prescription drug coverage, under a modernized Medicare that provides seniors access to the newest and most effective medicines and treatment. I will continue working closely with the Congress to improve this legislation as we move forward.
