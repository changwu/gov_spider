Citizen Security 
"And as the nations of Central America develop a new regional security strategy, the United States stands ready to do our part through a new partnership that puts the focus on where it should be – on the security of citizens. And with regional and international partners, we'll make sure our support is not just well-intentioned, but is well-coordinated and well-spent."
President Barack Obama

President Obama and President Funes committed to work together to reduce the insecurity and violent crime that is at the top of citizens' concerns in El Salvador and most countries in the Americas. Presidents Obama and Funes committed to enhancing flexible, practical partnerships in the El Salvador to advance shared interests and protect our citizens.
This cooperative approach is based on a deeper recognition of new and traditional threats to the safety of our citizens in the hemisphere. This strategy is grounded in our shared responsibility for addressing such challenges: The critical importance of political will, rule of law, and effective institutions of governance, and the common aspirations for secure, prosperous and inclusive societies. The U.S.-El Salvador bilateral efforts are part of a broader effort to confront citizen insecurity in Central America and throughout the Americas.
