    The President today announced that he has granted Federal recognition to "Energy Expo '82," an international exposition on energy to be held in Knoxville, Tenn., from May to November 1982. The President directed the Secretary of State to notify the Bureau of International Expositions for formal registration.
Pursuant to Public Law 91-269, the Department of Commerce evaluated the plans for the exposition and submitted a report recommending that Federal recognition be granted.
Among the reasons for the Commerce Department's favorable recommendation are the timeliness and importance of the theme of energy. The Knoxville area was judged appropriate because of its energy. contributions in the past and the proximity of the Oak Ridge National Laboratories, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and other energy projects.
