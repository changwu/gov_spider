Happy Saturday afternoon from Joint Base Andrews. I'll be your print pooler for President Biden's trip to Wilmington, Delaware this weekend.
We're flying on baby Air Force One today.
Marine One landed at JBA at 3:11 p.m.
The president is traveling with Dr. Jill Biden today. They got out of Marine One at 3:15 p.m. FLOTUS is wearing a long black coat with a patterned scarf.
They walked slowly with the greeters.
Biden saluted twice and ignored calls from the pool. He and the First Lady waved at the top of the stairs and boarded Air Force One at 3:17 p.m.
We'll be wheels up shortly.
