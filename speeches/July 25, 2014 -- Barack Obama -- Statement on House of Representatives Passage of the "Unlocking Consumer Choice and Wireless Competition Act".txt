    I applaud Members of Congress for passing the "Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act." Last year, in response to a "We the People" petition from consumers across our country, my administration called for allowing Americans to use their phones or mobile devices on any network they choose. We laid out steps the FCC, industry, and Congress should take to ensure copyright law does not undermine wireless competition and worked with wireless carriers to reach a voluntary agreement that helps restore this basic consumer freedom. The bill Congress passed today is another step toward giving ordinary Americans more flexibility and choice so that they can find a cell phone carrier that meets their needs and their budget. I commend Chairmen Leahy and Goodlatte and Ranking Members Grassley and Conyers for their leadership on this important consumer issue and look forward to signing this bill into law.
