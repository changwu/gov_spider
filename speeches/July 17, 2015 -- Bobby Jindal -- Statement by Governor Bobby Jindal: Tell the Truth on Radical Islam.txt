    Today, Governor Bobby Jindal called on the President to tell the truth on Radical Islam.
Gov. Jindal said, "It's time to stop pretending that things are fine in the world of Islam. America's political correctness must now come to an end. And America's President must stop pretending and he must speak clearly and plainly about the fact that Islam has a problem, and that problem is Radical Islam. You cannot defeat evil until you admit that it exists.
"Islamic leaders must do more than simply condemn violence. They must clearly say to every Muslim in the world that murder will not be rewarded in the afterlife, but rather it will be severely punished. They have to say that these acts are evil and will be punished.
"I've said this before and it gets glossed over. This must happen. We have no idea how many people are being wooed by Radical Islam, with the sick and deceitful promise of glory in the afterlife if they will murder innocent people.
"Islamic leaders must put a stop to this. This is not too much to ask, and President Obama should demand this of all Islamic leaders."
