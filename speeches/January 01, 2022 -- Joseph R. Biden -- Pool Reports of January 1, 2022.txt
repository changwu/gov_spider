Out of Town Pool Report #1 - Waiting to be Swept
Good afternoon everyone, and happy new year! Pool is currently waiting to be swept.
Near Biden's home, there was a group of protesters holding flags. Their cause was not immediately clear, but it seemed to be the group of climate change protesters who were also near his home on Friday. There was a sign of a sun.

Out of Town Pool Report #3 — Leaving Church 
POTUS exited church around 4:47 pm. He waved at the press, who shouted questions about what he would tell Zelensky tomorrow and his New Years resolution. He was far enough that the pool could not hear what he said, if anything.
Outside, people held a sign that said: "BIDEN: DEFEND DEMOCRACY & PROTECT EVERY VOTE NOW!" Others held a sign that said: "DECLARE a Climate Emergency" Protesters shouted, "What do we want?" "Climate justice" "When do we want it?" "Now!"
