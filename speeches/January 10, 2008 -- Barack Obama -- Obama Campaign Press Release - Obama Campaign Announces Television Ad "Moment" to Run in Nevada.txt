    Las Vegas, NV - The Obama campaign announced today they will begin running a new :60-second campaign ad entitled "Moment," which features footage from Obama's widely-praised Jefferson-Jackson dinner speech in Des Moines. In the ad, Obama talks about his desire to move past the old textbook campaigns that seek to divide America instead of solving the country's problems.
The Obama campaign is augmenting its current ad buy today with "Moment" and will continue airing the :30-second spot "Mother" in the Las Vegas and Reno markets.
