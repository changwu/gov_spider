    Little Rock, AR â€“ Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee said today that a new television ad, called "Believe," will help voters understand his record in public service and his vision for America's future.
"Faith doesn't just influence me, it really defines me," says Huckabee on camera, echoing a sentiment he often expresses on the campaign trail.
The 30-second spot (the second in two weeks) also reiterates Huckabee's strong stand on pro-life issues, including his belief that life begins at conception, and dedication to conservative values. "Let us never sacrifice our principles for anybody's politics. Not now. Not ever," said Huckabee.
Huckabee became politically active because of the life amendment when he helped pass Arkansas' Unborn Child Amendment. As governor, he fought for passage of a constitutional amendment to protect the right to life and other pro-life initiatives including signing legislation to ban partial birth abortion and a litany of other measures. He supports, and has always supported, passage of a federal Life Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. As president, he has vowed to fight for passage of this amendment.
Recognizing that "our true strength comes from our families," Huckabee strongly supports and has consistently supported passage of a federal constitutional amendment that defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman. As Governor of Arkansas, he led the successful effort to pass a similar state constitutional amendment in 2002 and a successful effort to make Arkansas one of three states to adopt "covenant" marriage.
The new television ad hit the airwaves this morning in Iowa. To view the ad, please visit www.mikehuckabee.com <http://www.mikehuckabee.com/> .
