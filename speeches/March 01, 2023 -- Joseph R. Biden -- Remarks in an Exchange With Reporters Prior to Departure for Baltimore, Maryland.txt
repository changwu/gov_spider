    Insulin Prices/Consumer Fees 
Q. Sir, what do you make of Eli Lilly's decision on insulin, capping prices at $35 a month?
The President. We just thanked them. They're all going to do that.
Look, everybody knows, once we passed that legislation, it uncovered the paucity of the argument why these numbers were charged. They're the biggest producers in the United States. Who's going to stick with the price now—the old price?
No, I think it's good. And by the way, look what—look at the effect we've had not just on Eli Lilly and—and drugs, but look at the effect we've had on hotel costs and air—two of the major air carriers have now said: "Well, no, you can bring your kids. We're going to let you"——
I mean, once you expose these things, it's awful hard to defend them. And once one major carrier or one major operator changes it, it changes everything.
So I think we made a lot of progress.
Federal Student Loan Debt Relief Program 
Q. Sir, on student loans, are you still confident that you will be able to win in the Supreme Court?
The President. I'm confident we're on the right side of the law, but I'm not confident about the outcome of the decision yet.
