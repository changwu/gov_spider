    Today, President Obama met with Latino, Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI), labor and immigration advocacy leaders to provide an update on the Administration's immigration accountability executive actions. The meeting was also an opportunity to have a dialogue with the immigrant advocacy community on the Administration's continued efforts to push Congress to fund the Department of Homeland Security and to pass comprehensive immigration reform. The President also highlighted that despite the Texas district court's ruling, the Administration will continue to make progress on many components of the executive actions and is confident we will ultimately be able to implement the deferred action policies. Many of the participants have been involved in outreach efforts to inform and educate the immigrant community on the executive actions. The advocates in attendance agreed to continue their outreach to the community, work with the Administration on its efforts to fully implement the executive actions that were not blocked by the district court, and to push for commonsense immigration reform as the only lasting and permanent solution to fixing our broken immigration system.
