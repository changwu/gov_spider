    The United States District Court for the District of Columbia today vindicated the Government's claims against former National Security Adviser John Bolton, ruling that "Bolton likely jeopardized national security by disclosing classified information in violation of his nondisclosure agreement obligations." The court rightly chastised Bolton for treating as "intolerable" a review process for his book that the court believed was "reasonable." As the court explained, "Bolton has gambled with the national security of the United States," hoping to secure profits by violating his nondisclosure agreements. But Bolton bet wrong, and the downside of his losing bet is that he "stands to lose his profits from the book deal, exposes himself to criminal liability, and imperils national security."
The court denied the Government's request for an injunction solely because Bolton's wrongful conduct—carried out in secret—had already ensured that the book was so widely disseminated that the court believed it could no longer grant an effective remedy.
The Government intends to hold Bolton to the further requirements of his agreements and to ensure that he receives no profits from his shameful decision to place his desire for money and attention ahead of his obligations to protect national security.
