VOICE OVER: "Here's Rudy Giuliani, talking about his 12 Commitments to the American People, including his commitment to cut taxes and reform the tax code."
BACKGROUND:
On June 12, 2006, Mayor Giuliani Announced His "12 Commitments To The American People," Including A Commitment To "Cut Taxes And Reform The Tax Code." "During a speech at the Old Bedford Town Hall in New Hampshire today, Mayor Rudy Giuliani announced Twelve Commitments to the American people, a bold vision aimed at moving America forward through change and reform, overcoming new challenges and increasing accountability in Washington. … The Twelve Commitments: … 4. I will cut taxes and reform the tax code." (Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee, "Rudy Giuliani Unveils Twelve Commitments To The American People," Press Release, 6/12/07)
AD FACT:
GIULIANI: "I was given a report, shortly after I was Mayor-Elect, and the report was all of the things that should be done to take New York City out of the deficit. The biggest ones were raise taxes. They asked me what I was going to do with the report, and I said I'm going to throw it in the garbage. It doesn't make any sense. It's exactly why we are in the trouble we are in…"
BACKGROUND:
In 1993, Giuliani Rejected Dinkins Panel Plan To Raise Taxes. "Sketching a grim portrait of New York City's fiscal condition, a panel appointed by Mayor David N. Dinkins reported yesterday that the city's long-term budget problems were more severe than previously estimated. The committee also outlined what it called a ‘menu' of Draconian and politically unpalatable measures -- including … increases in the sales tax and in property taxes for single-family homeowners … from which city officials could choose to achieve long-term budget balance. … But Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani rejected the panel's proposal for tax increases and reiterated his pledge to phase out several business taxes including the hotel tax and the commercial rent tax to spur the local economy." (Alan Finder, "Dinkins Panel Has Grim View Of Fiscal Gaps," The New York Times, 12/3/93)
The New York Times Criticized Giuliani For Rejecting Panel's Recommendations. "Mayor-elect Rudolph Giuliani was too quick to reject new proposals to end the annual agony of closing New York City's budget gap. … Tax increases are only a fraction of the advisers' proposals, smaller than their recommendations for increased state aid to the city, and smaller still than the proposed spending cuts. But Mr. Giuliani campaigned on the comfortable promise of tax cuts. It would be hard for him to do the reverse at this time, but wise for him to examine his revenue needs and the possibility of delaying reductions until the budget is in better shape." (Editorial, "Budget Advice For The Mayor-Elect," The New York Times, 12/4/93)

GIULIANI: "… and then I went ahead and reduced taxes. I reduced the rate for income tax by about 23-24 percent. The revenues from the income tax went up 40 percent. That's what we have to do. I will cut taxes and reform the tax code because I realize that that's how you stimulate an economy."
