    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to submit to the Congress the Third Annual Science and Technology Report as required by the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization and Priorities Act of 1976.
Science and technology affect our lives in many ways, and policy decisions very often involve issues of a scientific and technical nature. Systematic assessment of scientific and technological developments is therefore a crucial element in the formation of effective public policy. My Administration has sought to make better use of science and technology in responding to challenges in many areasâ€”energy, health, agriculture, environmental protection, national security, the quest for peace, economic productivity, and the renewal of our industrial base. The decisions, actions and programs described in this report show how developments in science and technology have interacted with recent public policies in these areas.
I hope that this report, like its predecessors and its companion, the Five-Year Outlook on science and technology will contribute to the informed discussion so essential to our scientific and technological capabilities and our future national strength.
