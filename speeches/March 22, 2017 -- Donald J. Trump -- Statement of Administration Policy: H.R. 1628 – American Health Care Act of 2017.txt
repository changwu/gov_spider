    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Black, R-TN)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017 (AHCA). This bill begins to fulfill the President's commitment to rescue Americans from the failures of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and expand access to affordable, quality healthcare. The AHCA offers patient-centered healthcare solutions that will promote innovation, reduce health insurance premiums, and empower doctors and patients to make healthcare choices.
The AHCA makes significant and important changes as part of a three step process to repeal and replace the ACA. The AHCA would provide tax credits for Americans to promote affordability; improve Medicaid's sustainability and target resources to those most in need; and return healthcare choices to patients by expanding the use of health savings accounts. The AHCA also would provide for a stable transition from the onerous requirements of the ACA, while providing peace of mind to Americans with pre-existing conditions.
If H.R. 1628 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.
