(Brian Early, "Clinton Proposes Cutting Corporate Tax Breaks," Reuters, 5/29/07)
At 2007 DNC Winter Meeting Hillary Told Democrats "I Want To Take" Oil Company Profits. "The other day the oil companies reported the highest profits in the history of the world. I want to take those profits and I want to put them into a strategic energy fund that will begin to fund alternative, smart energy. Alternatives and technologies that will begin to actually move us toward the direction of independence." (Sen. Hillary Clinton, Remarks At Democrat National Committee Winter Meeting, Washington, DC, 2/2/07)

Barack Obama's Pledge To Raise Taxes
Obama Said "People Didn't Need" The Tax Relief And Called For The Lapse Of The 2001 And 2003 Tax Cuts. "There is no doubt that the tax system has been skewed, and the Bush tax cuts, people didn't need them and they weren't even asking for them. And that's why they need to be lapsed…." (Sen. Barack Obama, PBS' All-American Presidential Forum, Howard University, Washington, DC, 6/28/07)

INSURANCE RATES RISING
"Since Katrina, The Rising Cost Of (Re)Insurance In Areas With A High Concentration Of Natural Disasters Like Florida Has Led The Public And Their Elected Representatives To Accuse The Industry Of Making Money From People's Misery (See Last Year's Record Profits)." (Mairi MacDonald, "US Cat: State Vs Private – Fed Up?" Reinsurance Magazine, 12/19/07)

Florida Insurance Rates Are High Due To Potential For Devastating Storms. "The difference was that the two worst storms, Category 5 hurricanes, struck south of the U.S. this year. Had those two storms hit Florida, the insurance industry might have been faced with the long-expected — and dreaded — storm season with $100 billion in damages. The possibility of such devastating storms will keep Florida's homeowners-insurance rates high." (Anika Myers Palm, "State Still Seen As Catastrophe Magnet," Orlando Sentinel, 11/30/07)
Tightening Credit Market Hurts Insurance Market. "Tightening credit-market conditions also could have been a problem if Florida had been struck by a catastrophic storm. If the state and insurers had needed to borrow money, the cost to borrow $1 billion would have been 12 percent higher in August than it would have been in January, [Robert Hartwig, president and chief economist of the New York-based Insurance Information Institute] said." (Anika Myers Palm, "State Still Seen As Catastrophe Magnet," Orlando Sentinel, 11/30/07)
Insurance Rates In Florida Are Expected To Rise Well Above National Average. "When it comes to homeowner insurance rates, the news still isn't pretty for Florida consumers. Bob Hartwig, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry trade group, said Florida remains the most catastrophe-prone state because of its exposure to hurricanes. For homeowners, that means insurance rates in Florida are well above the national average and they're likely to go higher." (Beatrice E. Garcia, "Expect Insurance Rates To Rise, Expert Warns," The Miami Herald, 11/29/07)
U.S. FACING "SEVERE HOUSING CRISIS"
U.S. Facing "Severe Housing Crisis." "The Bush administration is working to combat the country's severe housing crisis but there is no simple solution, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said Monday, adding that a correction in the housing market is 'inevitable and necessary.' Paulson said the country was facing an unprecedented wave of 1.8 million subprime mortgages that are scheduled to reset to sharply higher rates over the next two years. He said this raised the threat of a market failure and was the reason the administration brokered a deal with the mortgage industry to freeze certain subprime mortgage rates for five years to allow the housing market to recover." (Martin Crutsinger, "Paulson Says There Is No Simple Solution To Housing And Mortgage Crisis," The Associated Press, 1/7/08)
"Contracts To Sell Existing Homes Fell In November And There Could Be Darker Days Ahead For Home Values, Which Are Expected To Post Their Biggest Decline On Record This Quarter As A Full-Year Rebound In Prices Now Isn't Expected Until 2009, According To An Industry Trade Group."

BACKGROUND:
MAYOR GIULIANI FULLY SUPPORTS THE NATIONAL CATASTROPHE FUND
Giuliani Supports Catastrophe Fund As A "Federal Backstop." "Giuliani supports one of the top priorities of Crist and other Florida leaders from both parties: creation of a national fund to help cover catastrophic loses from national disasters. The idea is to spread the risk and limit the liability of insurance companies so they can provide more affordable rates. 'You should have a federal backstop for once-in-a-century catastrophes, once-in-a-decade catastrophes, these horrible things that happen,' he said. He said beneficiaries and state and local governments need to absorb some risk. Noting New York's potential vulnerability to hurricanes and the West Coast's susceptibility to earthquakes, Giuliani said such a program would be good for other parts of the country as well as Florida." (Anthony Man, "Giuliani Visits Florida," South Florida Sun-Sentinel, 12/7/07)
"Former New York Mayor And GOP Presidential Hopeful Rudy Giuliani Stopped In Tallahassee On [4/4/07], Vowing To Support A National Catastrophe Fund …" (Joe Follick and Lloyd Dunkelberger, "Parliamentarianism Clogs Clarity Quest," The [Lakeland, FL] Ledger, 4/8/07)
"Giuliani Told Legislators While In Tallahassee That He Backs A National Catastrophe Fund To Bail Out States Hit By Disasters, Including Hurricanes, One Of The Top Federal Government Priorities Of Florida Leaders." (William March, "Giuliani Puts Democrats On Defensive," Tampa Tribune, 4/5/07)
Giuliani Said He Thought National Catastrophic Insurance Was A "Very Good Idea." QUESTION: "Can you share your thoughts on a national catastrophic insurance program?" GIULIANI: "I just talked to your Governor about that. Talked to your Governor about it many times. He's explained it to me in great detail. The Attorney General, when he was a candidate, when I supported him, I think it is a very good idea. I think it's a very good idea not just for Florida, it's a very good idea for the whole country. We all need it. You need it for hurricanes, California needs it for earthquakes, somebody else needs it for tornadoes. New York needs it for ice storms and for hurricanes. During the time I was the mayor, my governor, Governor Pataki, had to deal with two really catastrophic ice storms in northern New York. We sent him some help, he did a great job of doing it, but we need that help. The parts of the country that think it only helps Florida, I think are missing all the other natural catastrophes and disasters and maybe they are not hurricanes, but they are all the other things I mentioned." (Mayor Giuliani, Remarks To Florida Legislators, Tallahassee, FL, 4/4/07)
OTHER REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES HAVE NOT ENDORSED CATASTROPHE FUND
Romney Wouldn't Fully Support National Catastrophe Fund. "Addressing a question about the impact of high property insurance rates on Florida's economy, Romney said he would like to investigate options for expanding the private insurance market before he supports a national catastrophic insurance fund, an idea endorsed by Florida Gov. Charlie Crist. If he were to support a multistate catastrophe fund, Romney said, it should include only states at high risk for natural disasters. 'I do not believe that you're going to hear the nation say we're going have other states subsidize states that are high risk,' he said." (Mike Salinero, "Romney Supports Letting All Cubans Migrate To U.S.," The Tampa Tribune, 11/28/07)
With Little Thought On The Topic, Thompson Was Inclined To Oppose The Plan. "Though he appeared not to have given the topic much thought, Thompson also seemed inclined to oppose a national catastrophe insurance plan that could make property insurance more affordable in states prone to natural disasters, a critical issue in Florida." ("Thompson Sets Off Florida Alarms," Tampa Tribune, 9/20/07)
Huckabee Was "Sympathetic" To Some Homeowners' Plight But Did Not Endorse Fund. "Asked about a national catastrophe fund to ease the property insurance crisis in Florida and other states, [Huckabee] was receptive but said he'd have to see the details. Rebuilding people's beach homes doesn't appeal to him, but, 'I come from a state that's prone to tornadoes and floods. I understand how devastating it can be, so I'm very sympathetic.'" ("State Is Gaining Clout, GOP Told," St. Petersburg Times, 5/20/07)
McCain Wanted To Read More "Of The Fine Print" Before Offering Support Of Catastrophe Fund. "During their private meeting, Crist and McCain discussed the possibility of a national catastrophe fund, about which McCain said he wants to learn more. 'I want to read some of the fine print, but I think that what is being done here is the outline and the model of what needs to be accomplished,' he said." (Dara Kam, "McCain: I Meant To Say 'Judeo-Christian' Values," Palm Beach Post, 10/3/07)
