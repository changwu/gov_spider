    Alexandria, VA — In response to Senator Graham's performance in this evening's FOX News "Happy Hour" debate, campaign manager Christian Ferry today released the following statement:
"Senator Lindsey Graham was the clear winner in today's 'happy hour' debate. He is ready to be Commander-in-Chief on day one.
"He is ready to give the American people an honest plan for how we protect our homeland — defeat them over there before they come here. If a candidate for president does not understand that we must put American troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria, as part of a regional coalition, you are not ready to be Commander-in-Chief. Lindsey Graham is.
"He clearly articulated how we defeat radical Islam: whatever it takes, as long as it takes, until we defeat them. No one else on the stage has spent more time in the region understanding the challenges we face and planning the right solutions.
"He is also the candidate ready to take on Hillary Clinton. Better than anyone else on the stage, he knows how to define the failures of the Obama Administration and the role Secretary Clinton played in creating and executing its feckless foreign policy than anyone.
"If you want to put radical Islam in a box and nail it shut, if you want to defeat ISIL, if you want to restore the American Dream and reverse the onerous regulations that are stifling out the economy, Lindsey Graham is the only choice. The only one ready to lead."
