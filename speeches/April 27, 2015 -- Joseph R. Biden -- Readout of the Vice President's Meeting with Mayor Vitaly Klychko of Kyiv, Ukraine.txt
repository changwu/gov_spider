    Vice President Joe Biden met at the White House today with Vitaly Klychko, the Mayor of Kyiv, Ukraine. The Vice President and Mayor discussed the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the vital importance of implementing reforms in Ukraine. Mayor Klychko outlined reforms undertaken in Kyiv over the last year to improve transparency in public procurement and the city's budget, as well as efforts to implement e-government solutions to reduce corruption and streamline the provision of city services. The Vice President underscored the importance of such efforts and noted one of the clearest measures of progress in implementing rule of law reforms would be holding individuals legally accountable for corruption.
