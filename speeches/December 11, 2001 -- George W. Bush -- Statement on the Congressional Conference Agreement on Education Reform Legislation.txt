    The education of every child in America must always be a top priority. I commend the conferees for agreeing on a series of profound reforms to help provide our children the best education possible. I also thank the bipartisan leadership of the conference chair, Congressmen Boehner, as well as Senators Kennedy and Gregg and Congressman Miller, for taking major steps toward improving education throughout our country.
The conference agreement will ensure that no child in America is left behind, through historic education reforms based on real accountability, unprecedented flexibility for States and school districts, greater local control, more options for parents, and more funding for what works. I urge Members of the House and Senate to act soon and send me this legislation so that States and school districts can begin implementing these important reforms.
