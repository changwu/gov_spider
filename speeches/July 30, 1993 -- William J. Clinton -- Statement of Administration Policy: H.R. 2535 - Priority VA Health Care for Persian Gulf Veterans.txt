    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 8/2/93)(House)(Rowland (D) GA and 31 others)
The Administration supports H.R. 2535.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2535 would increase direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. The bill does not contain provisions to offset the increased direct spending. Therefore, if the bill were enacted, its deficit effects could contribute to a sequester of mandatory programs.
OMB's preliminary scoring estimates of this bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If H.R. 2535 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within five days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending and receipts will be reported to Congress at the end of the Congressional session, as required by OBRA.
