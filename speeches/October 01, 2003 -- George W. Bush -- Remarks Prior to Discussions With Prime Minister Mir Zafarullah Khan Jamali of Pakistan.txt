    President Bush. Listen, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you. It's my honor to welcome you to the Oval Office. I look forward to our discussions. We will have discussions here in the Oval Office. Then we'll go to have lunch. And over lunch we'll discuss a wide range of issues: Our mutual desire to fight terror; our keen desire to bring stability and peace throughout the world; look forward to discussions about our bilateral relations in regards to commerce and opportunities to enhance the livelihood of our fellow citizens.
There's a lot of Pakistani Americans who are pleased you are here today, sir. And on their behalf, I welcome you to the Oval Office. And it gives me a chance to say publicly how much we appreciate the friendship of Pakistan.
Prime Minister Jamali. Thank you, Mr. President.
President Bush. You're welcome.
Prime Minister Jamali. Well, I can see you're pleased. I'm sure that the Pakistan community is pleased that I'm here. And Pakistan is helping as a partner—is a partner as far as the fight against terrorism is concerned, as far as our bilateral relations are concerned. We want a long, lasting friendship with the United States, and that is why I'm here, to bring a message of the new democratic setup which I set in Pakistan the last 10 months. And in short, we intend getting that through—of course, with a pat on the back as far as President Bush is concerned. [Laughter] Will that be all right?
Thank you very much.
President Bush. Thank you, sir. Glad you're here.
