travel pool report 1 - positioning for POTUS 
Just a heads up. Travel pool is at Ft McNair, leaving for the Delaware Air National Guard base at New Castle on an Osprey. That will position us for POTUS’ arrival from the White House scheduled later this afternoon. Stay glued to your in town pool feed for the departure and I will take the baton.
