    Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann today announced the team of grassroots leaders who will propel her campaign to victory in South Carolina. This announcement leaves little doubt that the Bachmann campaign has the most organized ground game in the Palmetto State.
Led by campaign chairman Lee Bright, campaign director Sheri Few, four paid field staff and senior advisors Ron Thomas and Wesley Donehue, the team of 33 county chairmen join the previously announced 56 Tea Party leaders and other new grassroots leaders to form the state's strongest "Get Out The Vote" machine. The grassroots county chairmen consists of five S.C. Republican Party executive committeemen, former GOP county chairmen, and local GOP officers and executive committee members.
"Grassroots activists across the state are tired of Washington insiders, flip-floppers and fake conservatives," State Sen. Lee Bright said. "Michele Bachmann is the consistent conservative we need as President of the United States and we've built the best political machine in South Carolina to get her to the White House."
Upstate Chairman State Rep. Bill Chumley said, "Our network is ready to catch the momentum Michele will receive from a big showing in Iowa.  Our team is energized, active and enthusiastic. They're not going let some Washington insider win in the nation's most conservative state."
Fifth District Chairman and State Rep. Ralph Norman said, "This race isn't going to be won by who has the most money — it's going to be won by the most organized team of passionate conservatives who are putting in hours of sweat equity for their candidate. We have the hardest working team in South Carolina and we intend to work hard for a win for Michele Bachmann."
"We are excited to announce South Carolina's most organized and energetic grassroots network," Bachmann said. These are hardworking conservatives who are ready to return our country back to prosperity.  They're working around the clock to ensure that a consistent conservative wins the nation's first-in-the-south presidential primary. I'm honored to have them on our team."
