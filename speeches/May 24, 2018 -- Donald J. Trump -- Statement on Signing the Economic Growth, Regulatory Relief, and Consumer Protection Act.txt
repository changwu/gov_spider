    Today, I have signed into law S. 2155, the "Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act" (the "Act"). Section 211(a) of the Act, though styled as a congressional finding, purports to direct my subordinates in the executive branch to take certain positions before international bodies and to "achieve consensus positions" with State insurance regulators in negotiations before such bodies. These directives contravene my exclusive constitutional authority to determine the time, scope, and objectives of international negotiations. My Administration will give careful and respectful consideration to the preferences expressed by the Congress in section 211(a) and will consult with State officials as appropriate, but will implement this section in a manner consistent with my constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations.
