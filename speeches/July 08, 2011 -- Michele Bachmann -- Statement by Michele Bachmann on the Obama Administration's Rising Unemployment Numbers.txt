Washington, D.C. â€” Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has issued the following statement in response to the Obama administration's report showing unemployment rising to 9.2 percent.
"Today's unemployment report is another stark reminder of the failure of President Obama's economic policies. The President promised if we passed the massive stimulus package that unemployment wouldn't go above 8 percent, we are now at 9.2 percent. Unfortunately, millions of Americans are suffering today as a result of the president's broken promise and his policy of attempting to create jobs through massive government spending that has added over 35 percent to our national debt.
"Amidst this economic freefall, it should not be lost that the architect of the President's failed economic policies, Timothy Geithner, will head for the door after he attempts to cement the President's legacy of massive spending and debt by raising the debt limit another $2.4 trillion dollars. We can only hope that the President will be right behind him after the next election.
"The President promised 'shovel-ready' projects that would create jobs, but now the President says 'shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected.' Mr. President, it's time to take the shovel out of your hand and stop digging. ATM's aren't responsible for our high unemployment rate; your administration's threat of higher taxes, massive government spending, and overregulation are."
