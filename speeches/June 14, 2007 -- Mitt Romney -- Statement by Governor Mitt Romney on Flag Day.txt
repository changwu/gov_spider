Boston, MA - Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement commemorating Flag Day:
"Throughout our nation's history, the American flag has always been a source of pride and honor. In 2002, we were all inspired when the flag that had flown above the World Trade Center entered the Olympic Stadium. Today, I am humbled by the brave men and women of our armed forces that carry the flag with them as they defend our homeland and ensure that new generations of Americans will be able to live in liberty."
