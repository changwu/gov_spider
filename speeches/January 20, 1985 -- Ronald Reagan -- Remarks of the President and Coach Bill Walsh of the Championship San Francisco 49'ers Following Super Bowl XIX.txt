    The President. Coach Walsh, there ought to be a bigger word than "congratulations" for all that we saw tonight and what you and that team of yours have accomplished. But that's the word to use, and I just want to say congratulations to you and, of course, congratulations to Joe Montana for his being picked and for the performance. But for all of that team—I guess as a coach you couldn't have asked for anything greater than they gave you tonight. So—
Mr. Walsh. Well, they—
The President. Yes?
Mr. Walsh. Well, I tell you, they've given it all year, Mr. President. This is the greatest football team and the greatest group of people I've ever been around. And I hope we've added to today's festivities.
The President. You certainly did. And, you know, if now that the season's over and you fellows haven't anything to do for a while, I have to go up on the Hill and deal with Congress in a few days—how would you like to come back and I could use a front-line four?
Mr. Walsh. Well, I think we'll stick to football, Mr. President. You're equipped for your job. We'll just try to deal with this one.
Congratulations to you on your election. We're all behind you, and we're praying for you.
The President. Thank you very much. And again, God bless you all, and it was just great.
