    After 30 Months: Obama: -2.0 million or
Gingrich +7.4 million
Atlanta, GA - The U.S. Department of Labor's October jobs report marks the thirtieth month in a row President Obama's dependence on over-spending and over-regulating American companies has failed to spur the economy and lower the unemployment rate below 9 percent. At the same point in Newt Gingrich's service as Speaker of the U.S. House, October 1997, the U.S. had gained 7.4 million jobs while President Obama has overseen a net loss of 2 million jobs.
A stark contrast.
Newt Gingrich led the first Republican majority in the U.S. House in over forty-years to reform welfare, balance the federal budget and make the biggest capital gains tax cut in American history.
During his time in office, President Obama has done nothing but add uncertainty to the U.S. economy. Constantly threatening tax increases, imposing burdensome requirements and regulations and insisting on using class warfare to turn Americans against each other.
Who is best for job creation: Gingrich or Obama?
If President Obama had chosen a path similar to the one used by President Reagan and Speaker Gingrich things would be different now. At this point in Gingrich's speakership, the American people had created 7.4 million new jobs. During President Obama's term in office the United States has seen a net loss of 2 million jobs.
