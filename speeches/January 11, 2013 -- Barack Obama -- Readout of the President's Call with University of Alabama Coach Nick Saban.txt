    Yesterday afternoon, the President called Coach Nick Saban to congratulate him and the University of Alabama on once again winning the BCS Championship. The President noted that this was the third time he's made a call to Coach Saban, and joked that he and the Crimson Tide are beginning to make this a habit. He commended Coach Saban on the incredible organization he has built and told him that he looks forward to congratulating the team in person at the White House.
