LAKE JACKSON, Texas - 2012 Republican Presidential Candidate Ron Paul issued the following statement today in response to President Obama's appointment of Richard Cordray to the Consumer Finical Protection Board and Sharon Block, Richard Griffin, and Terence Flynn to the National Labor Relations Board:
"By making 'recess' appointments to the Consumer Financial Protection Board (CFPB) and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) when Congress is not actually in recess, President Obama has acted in clear disregard of the Constitution.
"And the President must be called to account for his actions.
"It is disappointing that a former constitutional law professor does not understand that the President is not a dictator or a king who can simply ignore the Constitution whenever he feels frustrated by the system of checks and balances wisely put in place by our Founders.
"I have opposed unconstitutional power grabs by Presidents of both parties throughout my Congressional career, and this consistency leaves me as the only Republican candidate with the credibility and the record to challenge President Obama on his continuous overstepping of his constitutional boundaries.
"If the President insists on behaving in such a cavalier manner with regard to requirements set forth by the Constitution, then action by Congress may become necessary to rein in his flagrant contempt for the rules."
