    The President today signed S. 2042, authorizing the construction of a statue of a woman veteran in a place of honor at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC.
Over 10,000 women served the cause of freedom in the Republic of Vietnam in military and civilian capacities. Many served as military nurses; others served in administrative, intelligence, and supply positions. Just as the men with whom they served, some women were wounded, disabled, and killed in action.
It is important that we acknowledge their countless contributions, sacrifices, and achievements because they participated in one of the most heroic chapters in our nation's history. Just as they stood with their brothers in Pleiku and Cu Chi, just as they died with them at Chu Lai and Qui Nhon, women have earned the right to stand for all time in a place of honor at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
