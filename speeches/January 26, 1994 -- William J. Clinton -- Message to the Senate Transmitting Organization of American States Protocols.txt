    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the "Protocol of Washington" adopted on December 14, 1992, by the Sixteenth Special Session of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS) and signed by the United States on January 23, 1993, and the "Protocol of Managua" adopted by the Nineteenth Special Session of the OAS General Assembly on June 10, 1993, and signed that day by the United States. I also transmit for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the two Protocols, both of which comprise amendments to the Charter of the Organization of American States.
The Charter amendments of the "Protocol of Washington;" (a) incorporate a procedure for suspending the right of a Member State to participate in OAS policy bodies when its democratically constituted government has been overthrown by force; and (b) address the situation of extreme poverty in the hemisphere.
The Charter amendments of the "Protocol of Managua" are aimed at rendering the delivery of OAS provided technical cooperation more effective and thereby giving practical effect to the Organization's efforts to eliminate extreme poverty. The Charter amendments would create a single Inter-American Council for Integral Development to replace the existing Inter-American Economic and Social Council (CIES) and the Inter-American Council for Education, Science and Culture (CIECC).
Early and favorable action by the Senate on the "Protocol of Washington" and the "Protocol of Managua" would send a strong signal to other OAS Member States that the United States is firmly committed to strengthening the multilateral and institutional means for protecting and promoting democracy in the region and to addressing the problems of extreme poverty and integral development.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Protocols and give its advice and consent to ratification of the Protocols at an early date.
