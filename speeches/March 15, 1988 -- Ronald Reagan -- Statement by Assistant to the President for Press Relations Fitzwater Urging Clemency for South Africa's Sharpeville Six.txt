    The President has directed that a demarche be delivered immediately to the South African Government urging clemency for the Sharpeville Six on compassionate and humanitarian grounds. We have been in consultation with other governments on this matter and understand that similar appeals will be made to the Government of South Africa by Britain and West Germany, among others. We trust the South African Government will respond favorably to these requests for clemency. An act of compassion such as this by the South African Government would be welcomed by all Americans.
