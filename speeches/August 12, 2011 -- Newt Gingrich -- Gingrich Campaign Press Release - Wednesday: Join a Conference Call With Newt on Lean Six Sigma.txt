    Americans deserve a government that is both limited and efficient. They deserve to have politicians that look for ways to save taxpayer money and get back to a balanced budget. One way to get there would be to apply Lean Six Sigma to every aspect of the federal government, which could save taxpayers over $500 billion a year. As President, Newt would work to get this done.
If you work in the Six Sigma field, please join Newt for a conference call so he can listen and learn from you, get your feedback and ideas, and answer your questions - so together we can shrink and reform government to get back to a balanced budget.
