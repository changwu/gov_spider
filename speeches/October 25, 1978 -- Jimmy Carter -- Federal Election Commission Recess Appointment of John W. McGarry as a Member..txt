    The President today announced the appointment of John W. McGarry as a member of the Federal Election Commission.
McGarry, 56, was nominated to be a member of the FEC last April, but his nomination was not confirmed before the Senate adjourned. He was special counsel on elections to the Committee on House Administration of the U.S. House of Representatives.
McGarry was born June 11, 1922, in Boston, Mass. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, and after the war graduated from Holy Cross College and earned a law degree at Georgetown Law Center.
From 1959 to 1963, McGarry served as assistant attorney general of Massachusetts. He then combined private law practice with services as chief counsel for the Special Committee To Investigate Campaign Expenditures, which was created as a temporary unit every 2 years until 1972 to oversee House elections.
McGarry served as special counsel on elections to the Committee on House Administration from 1973 to 1978.
