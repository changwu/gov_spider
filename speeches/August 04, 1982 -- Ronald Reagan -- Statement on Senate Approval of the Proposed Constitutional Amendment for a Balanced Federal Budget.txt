    Today I happily join millions of Americans in saluting the Senate for bringing the United States one step closer to a constitutional amendment requiring balanced Federal budgets. Forty-seven Republicans and 22 Democrats stood shoulder to shoulder to pass the amendment and resist intense special interest pressure for still more red-ink spending.
I particularly want to commend the strong leadership of Senators Baker, Thurmond, Hatch, and DeConcini.
Now it is up to the liberal leadership in the House to heed the will of the people. Americans, in overwhelming numbers, have just one message for the House leadership: "Let our Representatives vote."
The legacy of 21 unbalanced budgets in 22 years saddled us with severe problems that brought our economy to its knees. Making government live within its means again will not be easy; it will be very difficult. It will require a strong, sustained commitment from everyone, on both sides of the aisle. The time for partisan politics is long gone. Let us work together, honoring the trust of the people, so we can put this country back on track.
