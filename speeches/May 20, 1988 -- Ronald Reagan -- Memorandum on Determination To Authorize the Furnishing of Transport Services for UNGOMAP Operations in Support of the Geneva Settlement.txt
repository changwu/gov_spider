    Presidential Determination No. 88-15
Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by Section 552(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended ("the Act"), I hereby determine that:
(1) an unforeseen emergency exists which requires the provision of assistance in amounts in excess of funds otherwise available for such assistance; and
(2) providing such assistance by immediate drawdown of resources of the Department of Defense is important to the national interest.
Therefore, I hereby authorize using Department of Defense services to provide air transport for observers and equipment of the United Nations Good Offices Mission to Afghanistan and Pakistan (UNGOMAP) under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act.
You are authorized and directed to report to the Congress immediately and to publish it in the Federal Register.
