    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Young (R) Alaska and 2 cosponsors)
The Administration supports legislation to authorize the expeditious reimbursement of "transit fees" paid by U.S. fishermen to Canada last summer. The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 716 but will seek perfecting amendments as the bill continues through the legislative process.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 716 would increase direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary estimate is that H.R. 716 would increase direct spending by less than $500,000 in FY 1995. Final scoring of this legislation may differ from this estimate.
