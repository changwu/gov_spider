HOUSTON, Texas – Presidential candidate, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, today announced State Rep. Jim Lyons, 18th Essex District, chairman of the Cruz campaign in Massachusetts. Rep. Lyons and his wife, Bernadette, hosted Cruz at their home in Andover this past May, which drew a crowd of 600 who came to hear Sen. Cruz's optimistic vision for the future of our nation.
"I had the honor of meeting Ted and Heidi in May and I can tell you, Sen. Cruz is the strong conservative leader our country needs," Rep. Lyons said. "Together we will build a strong team of courageous conservatives – tea party, faith, and liberty leaders – to run a strong campaign for Massachusetts' Super Tuesday Primary."
Representative Lyons is currently serving his second term in the House of Representatives. He represents the 18th Essex district, representing parts of Andover, North Andover, Boxford and Tewksbury. Lyons has worked in the family-owned retail flower and ice cream business for more than three decades. He has been a champion on Beacon Hill for funding public safety, slashing taxes and making state government more accountable, open and transparent.
