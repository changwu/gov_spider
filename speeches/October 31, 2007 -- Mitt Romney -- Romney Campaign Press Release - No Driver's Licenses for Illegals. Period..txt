    "Those who are here illegally should not receive tacit support from our government that gives an indication of legitimacy. If they are here illegally, they should not get driver's licenses."â€“ Gov. Mitt Romney (Scott S. Greenberger, "Romney Stand Dims Chances Of License For Undocumented," The Boston Globe, 10/28/03)

Gov. Romney Said He Would Not Provide "Tacit Support" Or "Legitimacy" To Illegal Immigrants By Granting Them Driver's Licenses. "'Those who are here illegally should not receive tacit support from our government that gives an indication of legitimacy,' the governor said, echoing arguments that opponents have voiced in the Commonwealth and in other states considering similar license measures." (Scott S. Greenberger, "Romney Stand Dims Chances Of License For Undocumented," The Boston Globe, 10/28/03)
Gov. Romney "Doesn't Think The Government Should Be Condoning Illegal Behavior." "'We are a nation of laws,' [Romney spokesman Eric] Fehrnstrom said. 'In the case of immigration, our laws are being broken every day. In the past, Romney has vetoed legislation to provide tuition breaks to illegals. He's opposed to giving them driver's licenses. He doesn't think the government should be condoning illegal behavior.'" (Rebecca Fater, "Feds Say State Can Bust Illegal Immigrants," The Lowell [MA] Sun, 12/6/06)
SEN. HILLARY CLINTON AND THE DEMOCRATS: LICENSES FOR ILLEGALS "MAKES A LOT OF SENSE."
The Democrats Believe In Legitimizing Illegal Immigrants By Granting Them Driver's Licenses:
At Last Night's Democrat Debate, Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) Said Giving Driver's License To Illegal Immigrants "Makes A Lot Of Sense." NBC's TIM RUSSERT: "Senator Clinton, I just want to make sure what I heard. Do you, the New York Senator Hillary Clinton, support the New York governor's plan to give illegal immigrants a driver's license?" ... SEN. HILLARY CLINTON: "You know, Tim, this is where everybody plays gotcha. It makes a lot of sense. What is the governor supposed to do? He is dealing with a serious problem." (MSNBC, Democrat Presidential Candidate Debate, Philadelphia, PA, 10/30/07)
- Sen. Clinton Has Previously Said Giving Licenses To Illegals "Makes A Lot Of Sense." "'I know exactly what Governor Spitzer's trying to do, and it makes a lot of sense because he's trying to get people out of the shadows. He's trying to say, "O.K., come forward and we will give you this license,"' Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., recently told The Telegraph editorial board." (Eduardo A. de Oliveira, "Police And Customs Working Together," Nashua [NH] Telegraph, 10/22/07)

Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) Agrees That Licenses For Illegals Are "The Right Idea." SEN. BARACK OBAMA: "I think that it is a -- the right idea. And I disagree with Chris, because there is a public safety concern. We can make sure that drivers who are illegal come out of the shadows, that they can be tracked, that they are properly trained, and that will make our roads safer. That doesn't negate the need for us to reform illegal immigration." (MSNBC, Democrat Presidential Candidate Debate, Philadelphia, PA, 10/30/07)
