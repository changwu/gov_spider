    With the death of Congressman William Ketchum of California, the Nation has lost a fine public servant who ably served his district in Congress.
Since he was first elected to the Congress in 1972, Representative Ketchum led the important fight for responsible public spending and a balanced Federal budget. His efforts on behalf of the elderly earned the respect not only of the voters of his district but of senior citizens across the Nation.
I extend my own deepest sympathies to his family.
