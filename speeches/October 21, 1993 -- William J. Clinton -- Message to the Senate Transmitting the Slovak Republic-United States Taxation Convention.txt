    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the Convention Between the United States of America and the Slovak Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital, signed at Bratislava on October 8, 1993. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
The Convention will be the first income tax convention between the two countries. It is intended it reduce the distortions (double taxation or excessive taxation) that can arise when two countries tax the same income. It will modernize tax relations between the two countries and will facilitate greater private sector U.S. investment in the Slovak Republic.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Convention and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, October 21, 1993.
