    Dear Aubrey:
I have your letter of resignation in which you thank me for the opportunity of serving as Administrator of the National Youth Administration. I want to thank you for that serviceâ€”for the great job you have done in the splendid human and democratic enterprise of giving over four million young people a chance to acquire training and education through work.
I can well understand your statement that you leave the N.Y.A. with regret. I, too, regret the termination of this great activity for American youth. Nevertheless, while Congress brought an end to the N.Y.A.'s existence nothing can end the long results of its usefulness. It would be difficult to evaluate the proportions of the resource which this training of young men and women has been to America in the war crisis. You have a right to pride and America a reason for appreciation in the fact that at the time its functions ceased N.Y.A. was continuing to render a 'national war service by supplying 30,000 young people, thoroughly trained in some skill, to essential places in the production program every month.
We may rejoice together in the confidence that whatever is done with respect to young people in the future, we know that through the National Youth Administration a valuable contribution has been made to our knowledge and experience in assisting young Americans to make the greatest use of their capacities for themselves and for their country.
Very sincerely yours,
Hon. Aubrey Williams,
Administrator,
National Youth Administration
