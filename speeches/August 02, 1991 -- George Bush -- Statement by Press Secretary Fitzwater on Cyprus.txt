    Prime Minister Mitsotakis and President Ozal have informed President Bush that Greece and Turkey have agreed to attend a well-prepared meeting concerning Cyprus.
The meeting would be convened and chaired by the United Nations Secretary-General under his Security Council mandate. Greek and Turkish leaders will work in support of the Secretary-General's efforts to narrow differences in advance of it. The meeting is planned for September in the United States, provided that adequate progress in the effort to narrow those differences is made in the meantime.
