    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, with Protocol and related exchange of letters, signed at Washington on August 27, 1993. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to this Treaty.
This is the first bilateral investment treaty with an Andean Pact country, and the second such Treaty signed with a South American country. The Treaty is designed to protect U.S. investment and encourage private sector development in Ecuador, and support the economic reforms taking place there. The Treaty's approach to dispute settlement will serve as a model for negotiations with other Andean Pact countries.
The Treaty is fully consistent with U.S. policy toward international and domestic investment. A specific tenet, reflected in this Treaty, is that U.S. investment abroad and foreign investment in the United States should receive fair, equitable, and nondiscriminatory treatment. Under this Treaty, the Parties also agree to international law standards for expropriation and compensation for expropriation, free transfers of funds associated with investments, freedom of investments from performance requirements, and the investor's freedom to choose to resolve disputes with the host government through international arbitration.
I recommend that the Senate consider this Treaty as soon as possible, and give its advice and consent to ratification of the Treaty, with Protocol and related exchange of letters, at an early date.
