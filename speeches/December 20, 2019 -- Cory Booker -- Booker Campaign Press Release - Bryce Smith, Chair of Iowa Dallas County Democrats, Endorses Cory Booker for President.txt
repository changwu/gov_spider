    Adel, IA - At an event in Adel today, Bryce Smith, chair of the Dallas County Democrats, officially endorsed Cory Booker for president. Smith joins more than 100 other high profile Iowa elected officials and activists in supporting Cory's campaign for the Iowa Caucuses, including Waukee Mayor Courtney Clarke and State Representative Kenan Judge.
"For my husband and me, civic engagement is about rolling up our sleeves and getting to work for the causes that make a positive difference," said Smith. 
"This is why I'm all in for Cory Booker. He exemplifies the meaning of moral courage and standing up for what is right, even when what is right is not always the easiest. I know a President Booker will call upon us, the American people, to do more for one another with him, and we will see him by our side fighting the good fight."
Smith endorsed Cory on the first stop of the "Cory Booker for America Tour," a four-day bus tour across the state of Iowa. Find more details about the tour here.
