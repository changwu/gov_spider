    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Applegate (D) OH)
The Administration objects to the enactment of H.R. 1047 because it does not include offsets to the increases in direct spending contained in the bill as required in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). The Administration however, does not object to the substantive provisions contained in H.R. 1047.
Scoring for the Purpose of Pay-As-You-Go and the Caps
H.R. 1047 would increase direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of OBRA. No offsets to the direct spending increases are provided in the bill. A budget point of order applies in the Senate against any bill that is not fully offset under CBO scoring. If, contrary to the Administration's recommendation, the Senate waives any such point of order that applies against H.R. 1047, enactment of this legislation would add to the end of year pay-as-you-go requirement, which must be met to avoid sequester.
OMB's preliminary scoring estimates of this bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If H.R. 1047 were enacted, final OMB's scoring estimates would be published five days after enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effect of all enacted legislation on the pay-as-you-go requirement will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to Congress.
