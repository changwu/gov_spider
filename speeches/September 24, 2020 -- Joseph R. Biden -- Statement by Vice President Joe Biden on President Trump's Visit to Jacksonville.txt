    Since President Trump's last visit to Florida just two weeks ago, over 40,000 more Floridians have tested positive for coronavirus and the state marked 13,000 COVID-related deaths. Black Floridians in Duval County are being hit especially hard by this pandemic, where the number of cases is 2.6 times higher for Black residents than white residents, small businesses are struggling to keep their doors open, and families are reeling from the loss of loved ones. President Trump's focus is not on ending this crisis, though; he's instead fighting to get the U.S. Supreme Court to tear down the entire Affordable Care Act, including its protections for as many as 7.8 million Floridians with pre-existing conditions. If he succeeds, insurers could deny coverage for Floridians with lasting COVID-19 complications.
President Trump does not have a plan, but I do â€” to beat COVID-19, build our economy back better, and protect and build upon the Affordable Care Act by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system less complex to navigate.
