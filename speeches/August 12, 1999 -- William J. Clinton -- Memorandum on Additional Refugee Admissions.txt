    Presidential Determination No. 99-33
Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Subject: Emergency Presidential Determination on Additional FY 99 Refugee Admissions Numbers Pursuant to Section 207(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act
In accordance with section 207(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the "Act") (8 U.S.C. 1157(b)), and after appropriate consultations with the Congress, I hereby determine that an unforeseen refugee emergency exists in Europe, and that the admission to the United States of Kosovar refugees in response to this emergency is justified by grave humanitarian concerns and is in the national interest. The admission of these refugees cannot be accomplished under the worldwide refugee admissions ceiling of 78,000 for Fiscal Year 1999, as authorized in Presidential Determination 98-39 of September 30, 1998, and an increase to 91,000 is warranted. The revised regional allocations are as follows:
Africa: 12,000 East Asia: 9,000 Europe: 61,000 Latin America/Caribbean: 3,000 Near East/South Asia: 4,000
Unallocated 2,000 The provisions of Presidential Determination 98-39 are retained, except to the extent superseded by this determination.
You are hereby directed to report this determination to the Congress immediately and to publish it in the Federal Register.
William J. Clinton
