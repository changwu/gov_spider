    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to accession, I transmit herewith the United Nations Convention on the Limitation Period in the International Sale of Goods done at New York on June 14, 1974, and the Protocol amending the Convention done at Vienna on April 11, 1980. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
This is the second Convention in the field of international sales of goods law produced by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) that has been transmitted to the Senate for its advice and consent. The first, the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, was ratified by the United States and entered into force for this country on January 1, 1988. Both of these Conventions establish uniform international standards in the commercial law of sales of goods in order to facilitate commerce and trade. Both benefit the United States by removing artificial impediments to commerce that arise from differences between the national legal systems that govern international sales of goods.
The Secretary of State's Advisory Committee on Private International Law, on which 11 national legal organizations are represented, in May 1989, and the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association, in August 1989, endorsed U.S. accession to the Convention and amending Protocol, subject to a U.S. declaration permitted under Article XII of the Protocol. The declaration is set forth with reasons in the accompanying report of the Department of State.
I recommend that the Senate promptly give its advice and consent to accession to this Convention together with its amending Protocol.
