    Herman Kahn was a futurist who welcomed the future. He brought the lessons of science, history, and humanity to the study of the future and remained confident of mankind's potential for good. All who value independent thinking will mourn the loss of a man whose intellect and enthusiasm embraced so much.
I convey my deepest sympathy to Mr. Kahn's family and to all those who believe tomorrow can be better than today.
