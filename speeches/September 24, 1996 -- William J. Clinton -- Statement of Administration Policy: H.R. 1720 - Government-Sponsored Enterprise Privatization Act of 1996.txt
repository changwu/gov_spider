    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICYThis Statement Has Been Coordinated by OMB with the Appropriate Agencies
(House)(Rep. McKeon (R) CA)
The Administration has concerns about the substitute for H.R. 1720 in its current form. It should be modified to meet Administration concerns prior to consideration in the House. This bill would make no significant improvement in education and job training programs. It is not a substitute for considered reform of Federal education and training programs along the lines of the President's G.I. Bill for America's Workers.
Scoring for Purposes of Pay-As-You-Go
H.R. 1720 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's scoring estimate of the bill is under development.
