    Dear Mr. Chairman:
The Intelligence Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1990 (Public Law 101 - 193; 103 Stat. 1711) specified that I submit a report describing how intelligence activities relating to narcotics trafficking can be integrated across the defense, law enforcement, and intelligence communities.
The Control and Coordination of Counternarcotics Intelligence Activities report prepared by the Director of Central Intelligence is enclosed for your information. I am pleased with the progress the Department of Defense and the intelligence community are making in the national effort to counter the flow of illegal narcotics, and I request your continued support for this program.
Sincerely,
George Bush
