'The FBI declares in a court filing that it has absolutely no records of disciplinary action against any lawyers in Russia Fisa Case despite 17 acts of misconduct. There is nothing noble about their leadership. FISA Court appears to be either corrupt or incompetent.' @LouDobbsRetweets: 26675Favorites: 87881

After watching the disgraceful way that a wonderful man @BrettKavanaugh was treated by the Democrats and now seeing first hand how these same Radical Left Do Nothing Dems are treating the whole Impeachment Hoax I understand why so many Dems are voting Republican!Retweets: 27531Favorites: 112271

Chuck Schumer sat for years during the Obama Administration and watched as China ripped off the United States. He & the Do Nothing Democrats did NOTHING as this $ carnage took place. Now without even seeing it he snipes at our GREAT new deal with China. Too bad Cryin' Chuck!Retweets: 32723Favorites: 121863

The last time I spoke to Debbie Dingell was her call thanking me for granting top memorial and funeral service honors for her then just departed husband long time Congressman John Dingell. Now I watch her ripping me as part of the Democrats Impeachment Hoax. Really pathetic!Retweets: 24694Favorites: 105268

Hard to believe that @FoxNews will be interviewing sleazebag & totally discredited former FBI Director James Comey & also corrupt politician Adam 'Shifty' Schiff. Fox is trying sooo hard to be politically correct and yet they were totally shut out from the failed Dem debates!Retweets: 23441Favorites: 92695
