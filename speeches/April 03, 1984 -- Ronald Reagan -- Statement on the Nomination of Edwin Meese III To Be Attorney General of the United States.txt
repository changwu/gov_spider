    I am pleased that the judicial panel has acted promptly in responding to the Attorney General's request to name an independent counsel. The counsel's responsibilities are to assure the full and impartial investigation of the allegations concerning Ed Meese that have been raised in connection with his confirmation hearings. This will provide an opportunity to determine the facts in a fair and expeditious manner.
I have instructed all members of the administration to cooperate fully with the independent counsel. Pending completion of his inquiry, the White House will have no further comment on this matter.
