    Mt. Pleasant, SC - The Rick Santorum for President campaign is proud to announce that South Carolina State Senator Chip Campsen (R-Charleston) has endorsed Rick Santorum for President.
State Senator Chip Campsen said: "For much of this primary, I was like most South Carolinians. I watched the process and looked for the conservative alternative to Governor Romney who would be the best standard-bearer for our party and our nation. As the campaign has progressed, it became clearer and clearer that the candidate who stands head-and-shoulders above the rest is Rick Santorum. Rick Santorum understands the foundational principles that make our nation great and will fight each day to preserve America's founding principles."
Rick Santorum said: "I am thrilled to receive Chip's endorsement. He is a true conservative leader in South Carolina and his vote of confidence today is a terrific boon to our campaign just a week before the First-in-the-South primary. I am looking forward to working with Chip to galvanize our support in the Lowcountry, and win the South Carolina primary."
In his endorsement, State Senator Campsen agreed with conservative nationally syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer who called Santorum "the first challenger (to Governor Romney) to be plausibly presidential: knowledgeable, articulate, experienced, and of stable character."
