    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Jones (D) North Carolina and 16 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 5013. The Administration recommends, however, that the bill not be considered under suspension of the rules. Instead, it should be subject to normal floor debate and amended to:
— delete requirements for specific safety and survival equipment regulations which would unnecessarily and inappropriately interfere with voluntary programs now underway; and
— focus the provision establishing a Commercial Fishing Industry Safety Advisory Committee on vessel safety, while eliminating unnecessary and objectionable restrictions on the Secretary of Transportation's authority to act with respect to fishing, fish processing, and fish tender vessels.
