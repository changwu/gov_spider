    I am pleased to announce that Thomas H. Kean, former Governor of New Jersey and president of Drew University in New Jersey, will serve as Chairman of the national commission to investigate the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the events that led up to it.
Tom Kean is a leader respected for his integrity, fairness, and good judgment. I am confident he will work to make the Commission's investigation thorough. It is important that we uncover every detail and learn every lesson of September 11th.
Governor Kean served on the Advisory Board to the President's Initiative on Race from 1997 to 1998, served as Vice Chairman of the U.S. delegation to the Fourth U.N. World Conference on Women in 1995, and led the U.S. delegation to the World Conference on Education for All in Thailand in 1990.
