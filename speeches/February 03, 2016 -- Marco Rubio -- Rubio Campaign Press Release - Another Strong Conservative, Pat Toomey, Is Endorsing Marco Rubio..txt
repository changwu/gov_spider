Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey is a proven conservative with a record of winning in a purple state.
So it's no surprise he's backing the candidate who can unite the Republican Party and defeat Hillary Clinton: Marco Rubio.

Toomey, a former President of the Club for Growth, is perhaps one of the best known advocates in the country for fiscal conservatism. 
Team Marco is Growing! Chip in $25 Now!
As a Senator, he's continued that fight, opposing job-killing tax and spending increases.
Here's what people are saying about Toomey's support:
