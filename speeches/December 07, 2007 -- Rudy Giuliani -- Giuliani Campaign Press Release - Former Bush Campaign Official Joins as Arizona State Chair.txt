    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that Lisa James will serve as Rudy's Arizona State Chair. James served as Arizona Executive Director of President George W. Bush's successful 2004 reelection campaign.
"Rudy is the strongest candidate to defeat the Democrats in the general election," said James. "He is a proven leader with proven executive experience and a track record of cutting taxes, reducing crime and turning a deficit into a surplus."
James filed official paperwork earlier today to place Rudy Giuliani's name on the Arizona Republican Primary ballot.
