  A Proclamation

1. The Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) provide in headnote 3 to subpart A, part 8, schedule 7 as follows: If the President determines that the estimated annual domestic consumption of whiskbrooms of a bind described in items 750.26 to 75018 TSUS, inclusive, or of other brooms of a kind described in items 750.29 to 750.31, inclusive, has substantially changed since 1965 or since the date of the immediately preceding proclamation under this headnote (if any), the tariff rate quota provided for in item 750.26 or 750.29, shall be modified by the percentage by which the President determines the estimated annual domestic consumption of the relevant brooms has changed in comparison with their estimated consumption in 1965 or at the time of such immediately preceding proclamation (if any).
2. On the basis of a report of the United States International Trade Commission submitted in accordance with Executive Order No. 11377, of October 23, 1967, I have determined that the estimated annual domestic consumption of brooms of a kind described in items 750.26 to 750.28 TSUS, inclusive, and of other brooms of a kind described in items 750.29 to 750.31 TSUS, inclusive; has substantially changed since 1965, that no proclamation has been issued previously under said headnote 3, and that the tariff-rate quotas set forth in items 750.26 and 750.29 should be modified, as provided below, to reflect the changes in the estimated annual domestic consumption of such whiskbrooms and other brooms in comparison with the estimated annual consumption in 1965.
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including headnote 3 to subpart A, part 8, schedule 7 of the TSUS (79 Stat. 948; 19 U.S.C. 1202) do proclaim that--
(1) Â Items 750.26 and 750.29 of subpart A, part 8, schedule 7 of the TSUS, are modified by deleting the quantities 115,000 and 205,000 from the respective article descriptions, and substituting in lieu thereof 91,885 and 161,540, respectively.
(2) The modifications of subpart A, part 8, schedule 7 of the TSUS made by this proclamation shall be effective as to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on and after May 27, 1976.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundredth.

GERALD R. FORD
