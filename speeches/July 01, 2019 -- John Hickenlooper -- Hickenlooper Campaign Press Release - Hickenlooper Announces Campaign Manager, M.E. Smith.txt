    DENVER, CO - Today, former Colorado governor and Democratic presidential candidate John Hickenlooper named M.E. Smith as his campaign manager. Smith most recently served as the campaign manager for Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. Smith led Casey's campaign to a 13-point victory, the largest victory for a Democratic senator running in a state won by Trump. Previously, Smith served as the deputy campaign manager for Sen. Michael Bennet in 2016 and the deputy campaign manager for Gov. John Hickenlooper in 2014.
"M.E. has shown again and again that she knows how to lead successful campaigns in politically-difficult terrain," said Governor Hickenlooper. "With her extensive experience in political strategy, campaign management, and policy, I could not be more excited to have her leading the team."
Hailing from Idaho, Smith has an undergraduate degree from Tufts University and a graduate degree from Harvard Kennedy School of Government. She is a resident of Denver.
"It's been my privilege to work with Governor Hickenlooper closely over the years, and I'm honored to serve him in this new role," said M.E. Smith. "The Governor has a unique record of accomplishment. He's achieved the big progressive goals everyone else is just talking about -- beating the NRA, achieving near universal healthcare coverage, creating the number one economy in the country -- and he did it all without relying on massive expansions of government. I'm excited to be leading the talented team that's working to make sure we have a Washington outsider, an experienced executive, and a pragmatic progressive in the White House."
