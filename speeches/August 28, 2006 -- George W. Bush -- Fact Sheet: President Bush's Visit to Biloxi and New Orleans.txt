The One-Year Anniversary Of Hurricane Katrina
President Bush Is Committed To Helping The People Of The Gulf Coast Fully Recover From Unprecedented Devastation. One year after Hurricane Katrina, the Gulf Coast is rebuilding, and the Nation is better prepared for future natural disasters. Commerce is returning to the region, and as rebuilding plans are firmed up, growth and progress will follow, and New Orleans will once again be a vibrant American city.
Hurricane Katrina Was The Most Destructive Natural Disaster In U.S. History, And Rebuilding Will Take Time - The One-Year Anniversary Is Not A Finish Line. Challenges still remain, including crime and housing needs.
We Have Learned From Last Year's Inadequate Response And Today Are Better Prepared For Future Disasters. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is dramatically increasing the Nation's stockpiles of relief supplies, retooling FEMA, updating disaster plans, supporting State and local partners, and emphasizing individual and community preparedness. DHS has four times the emergency meals and ice, and 2.5 times the water available this year than were available prior to Hurricane Katrina. These supplies have the capacity to sustain 1 million people for one week.
The Federal Government Has Provided More Than $110 Billion In Resources - $118 Billion Including Tax Relief - To The Gulf Region. This funding is helping fulfill vital needs, including relocation, rental assistance, levees, housing and other infrastructure repair, flood insurance payments, education, and debris removal.

Over $77 Billion Of The $110 Billion Either Has Been Dispensed Or Is Available For States To Draw From. We are working with State and local leaders to help them rebuild the region, and the remainder of the funding will become available as States roll out their housing plans to the public.

The Administration Has Demonstrated Its Commitment To The Gulf Coast:

President Bush has visited the Gulf Coast 12 times since September 2005 and this trip will be his 13th visit.
Mrs. Bush has visited the Gulf Coast 13 times since September 2005 and this trip will be her 14th visit.
Cabinet officials have visited the Gulf Coast 82 times since September 2005.

Fulfilling The Federal Government's Obligations To The People Of The Gulf Coast
