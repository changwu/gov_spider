    Newton resident gets one-on-one meeting with Elizabeth Edwards to discuss her ideas for change
Des Moines, Iowa â€“ Today, the John Edwards for President Iowa campaign announced that Kathy Grimes, a retiree and undecided caucus goer from Newton, Iowa, is the winner of its "Big Change, Real Ideas" drawing. As the winner, Grimes will get a private one-on-one meeting to discuss her ideas for changing America with Elizabeth Edwards.
During the Harkin Steak Fry on September 16th, the campaign handed out "Big Change from John Edwards" - large papers coins that gave Iowans the opportunity to write Senator Edwards a message about what change they want for our country. Grimes wrote that she would like to see change on health care. Attendees dropped off the completed coins at the "Big Change for America" jar at the John Edwards for President campaign table, and were entered into the drawing. Additionally, supporters who were unable to attend the Steak Fry were able to enter the contest and tell Senator Edwards their ideas for change through the JohnEdwards.com/Iowa website. More than 1,000 people from across Iowa participated and submitted their ideas.
"The great movements in our history have not started in the Oval Office, but on the ground, with the American people," said Senator Edwards. "From ending the war in Iraq to guaranteeing universal health care, Iowans are ready for big change. I am proud so many Iowans shared their ideas for change in our 'Big Change, Real Ideas' drawing. With real, specific ideas and the courage to fight for change, we can build One America."
Senator Edwards believes we need to put our policies back in line with our values and help regular Americans, not special interests, get ahead. He is running for president to fight for hard-working families like those he grew up with in his small, rural hometown. He is asking Iowans for their ideas for change because he is committed to being a voice for regular Americans.
