    You know, the other day the President, I guess it was just yesterday, he was in Ohio and he said that this campaign is going to come down to his vision, his vision for America. If you want to know where his vision leads, open your eyes because we've been living it for the last three years. It leads to lost jobs, lost homes, lost dreams. It's time to end that vision and have a vision of growth and jobs and economic vitality." â€” Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "Now, as you can tell, we're in a factory. This factory is empty, it's owned by National Gypsum. It was closed in 2008, at the beginning of the economic downturn. Had the President's economic plans worked, President Obama's plans worked, it would be opened by now. But it's still empty and it underscores the failure of this president's policies with regards to getting this economy going again. You know, the other day the President, I guess it was just yesterday, he was in Ohio and he said that this campaign is going to come down to his vision, his vision for America. If you want to know where his vision leads, open your eyes because we've been living it for the last three years. It leads to lost jobs, lost homes, lost dreams. It's time to end that vision and have a vision of growth and jobs and economic vitality."
