    Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Subject: Red Cross Month, 1984I have just issued a proclamation which designates March 1984 as Red Cross Month. This has been an especially tragic year for hundreds of thousands of our fellow countrymen left destitute by disasters. To assist these victims, the Red Cross has spent a record amount for help and for disaster preparedness. As a recipient of blood voluntarily donated through the Red Cross, I know the value of its Blood Services and its efforts to ensure that we constantly have supplies for the sick and injured. Also through the Red Cross, we help the men and women serving in our country's military forces, their families and veterans. Millions of us are trained in first aid, water and boating safety, and health care courses given by the Red Cross. Our Nation's young people, through the Red Cross in schools, obtain leadership skills and learn the value of being of service to their communities.
Within the Federal government, the Red Cross is part of the Combined Federal Campaign. During March, more than onehalf of the Red Cross chapters will raise funds, while others will use the period to inform the public about Red Cross services and to recruit new blood donors.
As President of the United States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, I urge all civilian employees of the Federal government and members of the Armed Forces to support in every way possible this vital voluntary effort.
