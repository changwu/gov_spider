    Hillary Clinton released the following statement after Congressional negotiators released an end-of-year omnibus package that includes reauthorization of the Zadroga 9/11 Health Act. Clinton was an original sponsor of the legislation when she served in the Senate and has repeatedly urged Congress to reauthorize it in the face of its expiration.
"It is a disgrace that Republicans in Congress allowed the Zadroga 9/11 Health Act to lapse and used its reauthorization as a bargaining chip in negotiations to keep the federal government open. Thankfully, Congress is finally moving forward on renewing the promise of health care we made to our heroes. It is about time. Too many of those who responded on 9/11 and in the days that followed are still suffering lasting health effects for their courage and bravery in the face of tragedy. We must continue to honor and keep faith with their sacrifice. There is no commitment more sacred than the bond we share with those who put their lives and health at risk to keep us safe. This is a commitment from which I will never waver."
