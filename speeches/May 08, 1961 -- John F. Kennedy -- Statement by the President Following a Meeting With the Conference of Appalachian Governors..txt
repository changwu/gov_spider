    WE DISCUSSED at a meeting this morning, and at lunch, the economic problems faced by the Appalachian region. Here many of the economic problems that face our nation find special emphasis.
Certainly, there is an urgent need for development of this region to utilize its full resources. To achieve this objective, I have directed that:
1. The Area Redevelopment Administration focus particular attention upon the opportunities-as well as the problems--of the Appalachian region along the lines of my discussion with the Appalachian Governors.
2. The re-training program for workers be expanded.
3-The Defense Department review its policies with regard to the placement of contracts in areas of substantial unemployment.
4. A special liaison be established within the Area Redevelopment Administration to evaluate, and where possible, to put into effect, suggestions by the Conference of Appalachian Governors. The Conference of Appalachian Governors will be constituted as an advisory group to work closely with the Area Redevelopment Administration.
The Appalachian Governors are to be complimented upon their resourcefulness in the treatment of unusual multi-State regional problems. It is the first time an entire section of a Nation has been organized to develop an important regional program of this magnitude.
The meeting has been productive and I am confident that cooperation between State and Federal governments will lead the way toward a prosperous Appalachian region.
