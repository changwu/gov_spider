    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am transmitting today proposed legislation, the "President's Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1984," together with a section-by-section analysis and supporting justification.
On July 10, 1984, the thirtieth anniversary of the P.L. 480 Food for Peace Program, I announced a major five-point emergency food aid initiative designed to reduce the suffering and loss of life brought about by acute hunger situations overseas. The proposal I am transmitting today carries out, in part, that initiative by authorizing:
—the creation of a special $50 million Presidential fund designed to provide emergency food and related assistance more quickly and effectively; and
—the payment of inland freight and distribution costs under Title II of P.L. 480 in special emergency cases.
I consider enactment of this legislation of great importance and would appreciate your efforts in seeing that it is enacted.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
