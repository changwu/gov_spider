    Atlanta, GA - Pastor Tim LaHaye has endorsed Newt Gingrich for president, and will be joining his Gingrich Faith Leaders Coalition as a national co-chair.
In a letter to South Carolina pastors, LaHaye urged them to vote for Gingrich because he is in the best "strategic position" to improve America.
"During the last three years our nation has been led by liberal secularists who have tried their best to remove God from our public square and the elimination of the Biblical principles our founding fathers built this nation on" said LaHaye.
"Please prayerfully consider going to the polls on January 21 and help elect Newt Gingrich, a proven conservative who has the best chance of replacing the present occupant of the White House with a man with a proven record of appointing conservatives to office that can return this country to the constitutional principles that God has chosen to bless for over two hundred years" he said.
Pastor LaHaye also pointed to Speaker Gingrich's qualifications as the best candidate to defeat President Obama as one of the reasons for his endorsement.
"It seems apparent the Republican candidates have come down to two possible winners," LaHaye said. "As my friend, the late Dr. Jerry Falwell told me personally, 'Speaker Newt Gingrich is the most qualified man in America to run as president of the United States"... We agree!'"
"I am honored to have Tim's endorsement. His work as both a minister and author is truly unmatched," said Gingrich. "Tim will be a terrific partner for the Gingrich Faith Leaders Coalition as we work to combat the influence of radical secularism and activist judges."
LaHaye will join the rapidly growing coalition launched yesterday, led by Christian market researcher, George Barna. It also includes Dr. Jim Garlow, the California pastor behind the Proposition 8 Battle, Congressman J.C. Watts, Don Wildmon of the American Family Association, and Mat Staver, Founder and Chairman of Liberty Counsel.
