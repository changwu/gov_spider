    Arizona Senator John McCain made the following statement on tonight's third presidential debate:
"Tonight, Mitt Romney showed that as Commander in Chief, he'll keep America safe by renewing our strength at home and restoring our leadership abroad. By contrast, from his confused and misleading response to the terrorist attack in Libya to the continued massacre in Syria to the resurgence of Al Qaeda in Iraq, President Obama's feckless foreign policy has weakened our standing in the world and made America less safe. We cannot afford another four years of President Obama 'leading from behind,' and Mitt Romney's commitment to peace through strength is exactly what America needs to protect our national security in a dangerous world."
