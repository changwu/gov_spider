    AUSTIN — The Perry campaign today released a 60-second radio advertisement entitled "Game Show," airing in Iowa.  The ad highlights — using the Senator's own voice — Rick Santorum's long record of backing irresponsible congressional earmarks and pork.


"Senator Santorum's real record is the "Bridge to Nowhere,' billions in congressional earmarks, federal pork and other financial excesses typical of spendthrift Washington politicians," said Perry campaign spokesman Ray Sullivan. "Gov. Perry has a plan to overhaul Washington, D.C., and put an end to the congressional earmarks that are part and parcel of the mismanagement and debt Washington has heaped on our citizens."
"Game Show" Script:
Announcer: "It's "Wheel of Washington!' I'm your host, Wink Tax-and-Spend!"
"First question: Which Republican running for president voted for the Bridge to Nowhere earmark?" [1]
"Yes, Susie from Des Moines."
Susie: "Rick Santorum?"
Announcer: "Correct! Santorum voted for the Bridge to Nowhere and a highway bill full of pork."
"Who personally demanded more than one billion dollars of earmarks in his 16 years in Congress?"
"Jay from Ames."
Jay: "Rick Santorum?"
Announcer: "Right! Santorum grabbed for a billion in earmarks — until voters kicked him out of office in a landslide."
"Audio bonus! Name this Congressional porker."
Rick Santorum: "I have had a lot of earmarks. In fact, I'm very proud of all the earmarks I've put in bills." [2]
Announcer: "Jen, from Sioux City."
Jen: "That's Rick Santorum."
Announcer: "In-deedy-duty! Santorum's proud of feeding at the earmark trough in Congress. Soo-ee pig!"
"That's right, Iowa. On taxes and spending, if Rick Santorum wins, you lose." [3]
Gov. Perry: "I'm Rick Perry and I approve this message. Paid for by RickPerry.org, Inc."

Excerpt: "[Santorum's] record is plagued by the big-spending habits that Republicans adopted ... He voted for the 2005 highway bill that included thousands of wasteful earmarks, including the Bridge to Nowhere. In fact, in a separate vote, Santorum had the audacity to vote to continue funding the Bridge to Nowhere rather than send the money to rebuild New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Indeed, Santorum was a prolific supporter of earmarks, having requested billions of dollars for pork projects in Pennsylvania while he was in Congress."

Rick Santorum: "I'm not saying necessarily earmarks are bad. I have had a lot of earmarks. In fact, I'm very proud of all the earmarks I've put in bills. Because I think — I'll defend earmarks."
