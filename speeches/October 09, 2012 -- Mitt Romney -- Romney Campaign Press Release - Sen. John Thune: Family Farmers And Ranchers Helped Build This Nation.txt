    South Dakota Senator John Thune today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's vision for a vibrant rural America:
"Family farmers and ranchers helped build our nation, and their values and work ethic exemplify the America spirit.  They have played an integral role in America's history and economic success. But, like the rest of our great country, America's Heartland is concerned about the future. We are worried about another four years of a president who has chosen to regulate first and ask questions later, who has curtailed American domestic energy production, and whose words do not match his actions. We can turn things around, but it requires taking a new path. Fortunately, the choice is clear: Mitt Romney knows that America's farmers and ranchers — not government — built their businesses from the ground up, and he is the candidate in this race who will fight for them."
