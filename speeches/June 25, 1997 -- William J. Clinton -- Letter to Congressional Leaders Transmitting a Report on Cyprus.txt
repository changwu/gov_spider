    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question. The previous submission covered progress through January 31, 1997. The current submission covers the period February 1, 1997, through March 31, 1997.
The highlight of this reporting period was the start of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks on the island. The United States strongly supported efforts by the United Nations to engage the two Cypriot leaders productively in these talks in preparation for direct negotiations. We have stated our support for the U.N.'s undertaking on several occasions and have urged both leaders to seize the opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to the reconciliation process.
Although his appointment fell outside the current reporting period, I am very pleased that Richard Holbrooke will serve as my Special Presidential Emissary for Cyprus. He assumes his duties at a time when tensions on the island have eased due to the overflight moratorium recently agreed to by the parties, as well as their agreement to begin the U.N.-sponsored direct talks in early July. I have asked Ambassador Holbrooke to use his proven negotiating skills and superb knowledge of the region to support the U.N. efforts.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
