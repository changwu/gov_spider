    Ahead of a three-day trip to Iowa, Jeb picked up the endorsement of three key conservative leaders in the state.
Mayor Steve Gaer of West Des Moines, a former supporter of Governor Scott Walker, threw his endorsement behind Jeb.
Other new members of Team Jeb include State Representative Rob Bacon, who previously supported Governor Rick Perry, and Jeff Lamberti, former President of the Iowa State Senate. As the Des Moines Register recently reported, Lamberti is "one of the most sought-after Iowa Republicans" and will be an invaluable addition to our efforts.
"Like many Iowans, I am upset with Washington, including many of the Republicans in Congress, for their failure to act and lead. While I understand the appeal of 'outsider' candidates to citizens who are upset with Washington, I believe we do have a candidate in Jeb Bush who can change Washington," said Lamberti.
