    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
At my direction, on January 24, 2012, U.S. Special Operations Forces conducted an operation in Somalia to rescue Ms. Jessica Buchanan, a U.S. citizen. The operation was successfully completed. Ms. Buchanan was kidnapped in Galcayo, Somalia on October 25, 2011, by a group linked to Somali pirates and financiers. Also rescued in the course of the operation was a Danish national, Poul Hagen Thisted, who was kidnapped with Ms. Buchanan. The operation was undertaken by a small number of joint combat-equipped U.S. forces, after we received reliable intelligence indicating Ms. Buchanan's location in Somalia along with that of Mr. Thisted. These forces left Somalia on January 25, 2012.
I directed this action consistent with my responsibility to protect U.S. citizens both at home and abroad, and in furtherance of U.S. national security interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive.
I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-148). I appreciate the support of the Congress in this action.
Sincerely,
Barack Obama
