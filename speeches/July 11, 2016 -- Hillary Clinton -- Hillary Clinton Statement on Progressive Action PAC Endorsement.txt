    After receiving the endorsement of the Progressive Action PAC, the political action committee of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement:
"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of the Congressional Progressive Caucus' Progressive Action PAC.
"For 25 years, the CPC has been a champion for working people and on behalf of Americans who have been left out and left behind. And CPC members know, as I do, that we are stronger together.
"We are stronger when we have each others' backs. That's why we will fight to secure universal health care, raise the minimum wage, and protect Americans' fundamental right to vote–not corporations' right to buy elections. It's why we will face up to the reality of systemic racism, and fix it together. And it's why we will say 'no' to trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership that would hurt American workers, and fully enforce our trade laws to protect American jobs.
"We are stronger when all our people can retire with dignity and security after years of hard work. That is why we will stand up to Republican efforts to undermine or privatize the bedrock promise of Social Security—and we'll fight to expand it.
"And we are stronger when we make our economy work for everyone—not just those at the top. That's why we will fight to make college debt-free and make the kinds of investments that will create good-paying jobs, with a bold plan to build 21st century infrastructure, revitalize American manufacturing, and combat climate change and make America a clean energy superpower.
"Progressives know that in America, we don't tear each other down–we lift each other up. We believe in building bridges, not walls. And we know that America is already great—because for 240 years, ours has been the story of hard-fought, hard-won progress."
