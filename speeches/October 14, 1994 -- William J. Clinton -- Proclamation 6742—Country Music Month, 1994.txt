  A Proclamation

Country music is a distinctly American treasure, drawing on the deepest cultural roots of our Nation's people. It reflects a storytelling impulse born of mountain balladry and cowboy songs. It combines an exciting instrumental texture of string bands and jazz orchestras, a heartfelt vocal style of religious and blues singing, and a contagious rhythm that inspires dancing in listeners of all ages.
The emotions of the myriad peaks and valleys of life find a vibrant voice in country music. Relating experiences all of us share, these songs boast a long and proud tradition in our national heritage. For the better part of our history, country music's many talented singers and songwriters from across the land have touched the hearts and minds of our citizens—rural and urban, rich and poor, young and old. Today, this wonderful art form is enjoyed and celebrated around the world as a uniquely American gift.
This month, we pause to commend and to appreciate the efforts of singers, songwriters, musicians, and all those in this thriving industry who work to maintain the vitality of the country music legacy.
The Congress, by Public Law 103–107, has designated October 1994 as "Country Music Month" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this month. I urge all Americans to join me in recognizing the rich contributions that country music has made to our cultural heritage.
Now, Therefore, I, William J. Clinton, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 1994 as Country Music Month.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and nineteenth.

WILLIAM J. CLINTON
