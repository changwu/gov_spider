    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Sponsors: Byrd (D), West Virginia; Leahy (D), Vermont)
This Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views on H.R. 4426, the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill, FY 1995, as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
The Administration is pleased that the Committee bill provides continued support for important foreign policy priorities such as Middle East peace. The Administration also commends the Committee's efforts to meet United States commitments to the multilateral development banks given the 602(b) allocations. With few exceptions, the Committee bill provides resources that are consistent with Administration priorities.
However, the Administration is concerned with both the reduction in assistance to the New Independent States (NIS) and with the related constraining country and activity earmarks. Both the reduction and the earmarks would hamper the Administration's ability to target and/or adjust assistance within the NIS in what continues to be a highly dynamic environment.
The Administration is also concerned about the variety of earmarks in the Committee bill — beyond those related to the NIS — and urges the Senate to minimize such provisions. Other language provisions, especially those restricting U.S. support for Turkey, have a clear potential to damage U.S. interests and the conduct of U.S. foreign policy. We have similar concerns on restrictions relating to Greece and Indonesia. Under the tight budget constraints, the President must retain flexibility in order to manage programs effectively and to respond to foreign policy issues that may arise.
The United States is actively engaged in restoring the democratically elected government of Haiti and will strongly support that government once it is reestablished. The Administration would strongly oppose any amendments to this bill that would limit these efforts.
