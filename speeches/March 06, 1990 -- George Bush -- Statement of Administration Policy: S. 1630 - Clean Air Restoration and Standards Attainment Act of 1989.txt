    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Baucus (D) Montana and 12 others)
The Administration strongly supports the Bi-partisan Senate Clean Air Act Agreement and will join Senators who are supporting the Agreement in opposing any amendments, to provisions covered by the Agreement. Attachment 1 outlines S. 1630, as amended by the Agreement.
The Administration will oppose other amendments to the bill that would result in the legislation not meeting the five minimum tests of balance and reasonableness that the President articulated in his January 19, 1990, letter to the Senate. Included among these tests was a requirement that the cost of the bill not exceed the already considerable cost of the Administration bill by more than ten percent. The President's letter is attached as Attachment 2.
The Administration also expects to oppose all amendments to S. 1630 that are unrelated to clean air.
