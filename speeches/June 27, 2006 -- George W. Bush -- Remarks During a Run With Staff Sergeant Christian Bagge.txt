    The President. So I first met Christian when I went to Walter Reed—Brooke Army, San Antonio, Texas. And he said, "I want to run with you." He was in bed. He had lost both legs. I looked at him, like, you know, there's an optimistic person. But I could tell in his eyes that he meant it. And after a lot of hard work and a lot of compassionate care, this fine man is here on the South Lawn running with the President. And he ran the President into the ground, I might add. [Laughter]
But I'm proud of you. I'm proud of your strength. I'm proud of your character. Thank you for your service.
It's an amazing sight for me to be running with a guy who, last time I saw him, was in bed wondering whether or not— I was wondering whether or not he'd ever get out of bed. There was no doubt in his mind that he would.
Thanks for your service.
S. Sgt. Bagge. Your welcome, Mr. President.
The President. Good man. God bless you.
S. Sgt. Bagge. It's a privilege.
The President. We're not through running yet. Get out of the way. [Laughter]
