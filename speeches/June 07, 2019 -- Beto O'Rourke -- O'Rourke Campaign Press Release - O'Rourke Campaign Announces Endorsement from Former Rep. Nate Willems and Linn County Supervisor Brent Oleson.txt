    Building on the momentum of the campaign's first Weekend of Action, local Iowa leaders throw their support for Beto O'Rourke
DES MOINES, IOWA â€” Today Beto O'Rourke's campaign in Iowa announced the endorsement of former Rep. Nate Willems and Linn County Supervisor Brent Oleson.
"Beto O'Rourke continues to be a leading voice on the most important issues this country faces. What's at stake in 2020 is the dignity of work, the clear threat of climate change, women's reproductive rights, and the future of our democracy, and O'Rourke is exactly the kind of bold leader this country needs right now," said Willems. From Mount Vernon, Nate Willems previously represented Iowa House District 29 and remains a fierce advocate for workers rights and progressive values.
"I'm proud to stand with Beto O'Rourke and his bold, ambitious climate change plan. He's ready to confront the existential crisis that is threatening our farmers, homes and businesses all across Iowa and the United States," said Supervisor Oleson. Oleson was first elected to the Linn County Board of Supervisors in 2008 and has been a leader on environmental and conservation issues in his community.
O'Rourke returns to the Hawkeye state this weekend to continue talking with and listening to Iowans wherever they are. In his first joint trip with Amy O'Rourke, they will be talking with farmers impacted by the trade war, joining activists at Capital City Pride, and attending Hall of Fame.
With 67 town halls and 36 counties visited thus far, O'Rourke has visited the most counties in Iowa of any other presidential candidate this cycle to meet with, listen to, and learn from Iowans in every corner of the state.
