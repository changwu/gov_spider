His last words were, "I can't breathe."
We repeated those words when we marched for justice for my son—justice we're still waiting on.?Along with too many others, Eric's death has forced our country to confront the effects of police brutality. We've got to do something about the violence in our communities—especially gun violence—and the racial and economic injustice that's connected to it.?
Hillary seems to be the only candidate right now who's talking about how we can be strategic in trying to solve this problem. That's why I'm endorsing her for president.
Most people remember my son's death, but I remember his life. I like to look back on Eric as a child at Christmastime—he was a lover of the Christmas season. One year, he and his brother wanted Big Wheels (you remember those cars? they were the thing), and when they saw them Christmas morning, their eyes lit up: "Oh baby! Oh wow!" Eric turned to his brother and said, "Now I know we are rich."
We weren't rich. We lived in public housing. But that day, it felt like we were. Eric was a joy to me, to his wife, and to his own children. It hurt so much to lose him.
I think all of us need to make the time to be involved in this election. With all the violence and injustice that's upon us today, we need a candidate who can move us forward—that's Hillary. We need to elect her, not just for us, but for our children, our grandchildren, and their children. We have to bring forth a legacy that will outlive us.
Stand up today and be a part of that.?
