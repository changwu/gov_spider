Pelosi gives us the most unfair trial in the history of the U.S. Congress and now she is crying for fairness in the Senate and breaking all rules while doing so. She lost Congress once she will do it again!Retweets: 37155Favorites: 171965

Nancy Pelosi who has already lost the House & Speakership once & is about to lose it again is doing everything she can to delay the zero Republican vote Articles of Inpeachment. She is trying to take over the Senate & Cryin' Chuck is trying to take over the trial. No way!....Retweets: 562Favorites: 1772

....What right does Crazy Nancy have to hold up this Senate trial. None! She has a bad case and would rather not have a negative decision. This Witch Hunt must end NOW with a trial in the Senate or let her default & lose. No more time should be wasted on this Impeachment Scam!Retweets: 554Favorites: 1715

Wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that Republicans in the Senate should handle the Impeachment Hoax in the exact same manner as Democrats in the House handled their recent partisan scam? Why would it be different for Republicans than it was for the Radical Left Democrats?Retweets: 24853Favorites: 110244
