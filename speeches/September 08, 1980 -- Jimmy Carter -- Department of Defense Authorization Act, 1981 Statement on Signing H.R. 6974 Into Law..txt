    I have today signed into law H.R. 6974, the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1981. This bill authorizes appropriations of nearly $53 billion for defense procurement, research and development, civil defense, and military pay and benefits. I am pleased that this bill is fundamentally in agreement with my national security policy. I remain committed to a policy of continuing real growth in the defense budget.
I fully support the military pay and benefits authorized by this bill, for I share with the Congress its concern for assuring a level of compensation for our service men and women commensurate with their considerable contribution and sacrifice.
I am seriously concerned, however, over the unrequested additions in procurement and research and development contained in this bill. My 1981 budget proposals carefully balanced the need for a strong national defense against other competing foreign and domestic requirements. As I have previously indicated, the administration will be working with the Appropriations Committees to bring the defense budget more in line with my original request, thus restoring this budget balance.
Finally, in signing H.R. 6974, I must comment upon section 302 (b) which provides that when a determination is made by the Secretary of Defense that certain limitations on enlistments should be waived for national security reasons, it shall be effective only if "the Congress adopts a concurrent resolution stating in substance that it approved the proposed waivers."
I must reiterate my opposition to such provisions which violate the fundamental doctrine of separation of powers. Accordingly, I intend to treat this unconstitutional provision as a "report-and-wait" provision and am directing the Secretary of Defense to notify the Congress of any determination to waive the applicable limitations when reasons of national security so require.
