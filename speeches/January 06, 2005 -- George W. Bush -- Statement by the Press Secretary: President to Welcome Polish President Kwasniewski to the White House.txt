    President Bush will host Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski at the White House for a meeting and lunch on February 9. Poland is a close friend and ally of America, and continues to play a vital role in bringing freedom and democracy to Iraq. President Kwasniewski has demonstrated his commitment to these same ideals through his recent involvement in helping further Ukraine's democratic process. President Bush and President Kwasniewski will discuss a range of issues, including ways to strengthen cooperation between the United States and Europe on the many common challenges we face.
