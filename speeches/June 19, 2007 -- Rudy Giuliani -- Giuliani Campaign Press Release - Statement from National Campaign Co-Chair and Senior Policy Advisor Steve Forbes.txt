    Steve Forbes, National Campaign Co-Chair and Senior Policy Advisor to the Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee, made the following statement today regarding Mayor Giuliani's commitment to fiscal discipline and cutting wasteful Washington spending:
"Mayor Giuliani demonstrated real fiscal discipline as Mayor of New York City. He showed how a commitment to restraining government spending and cutting taxes could spur economic growth and increase revenues.
"Mayor Giuliani will bring the same commitment to our Federal government by cutting irresponsible spending and making government more efficient and accountable. Our country will benefit from his vision as a strong fiscal conservative leader."
