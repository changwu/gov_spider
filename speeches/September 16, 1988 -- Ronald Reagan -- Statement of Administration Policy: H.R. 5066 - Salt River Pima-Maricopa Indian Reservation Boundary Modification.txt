    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Kyi (R) AZ, Udall (D) AZ, and Rhodes (R) AZ)
The Administration has no objection to House enactment of H.R. 5066, but will work with the Senate to ensure that all exchanges are of equal value and consistent with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), and that the land description is accurate.
H.R. 5066 appears inconsistent with S. 2352, a related land exchange bill that includes the land cited in H.R. 5066. The Administration supports the provisions of S. 2352 that specify an equal value exchange under the provisions of FLPMA.
