    It was with sincere regret that I learned of Paul Laxalt's decision to retire from the Senate after 12 years of honorable service. Paul Laxalt has been a dedicated public servant who has given more than 20 years of his life serving the people of Nevada and this nation, first as district attorney of Ormsby County, then as Lieutenant Governor, then as Governor, and now as U.S. Senator from Nevada. His friendship and support have been invaluable to me over the years.
Senator Laxalt has agreed at my request to remain as general chairman of the Republican National Committee through 1988, and I will continue to rely on Paul's advice and counsel in the years ahead.
Nancy and I offer our thanks and best wishes to Paul and Carol as they continue to serve the people of Nevada, and in their future endeavors.
