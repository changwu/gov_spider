    ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, U.S. Representative Heather Wilson (R-NM) held a conference call on Barack Obama's visit to New Mexico saying: 
Reporter: "I was wondering if you could speak a little bit. You said that women are attracted to John McCain. Don't polls show the opposite? Don't polls show Barack Obama leading pretty comfortably among women?" 
Rep. Heather Wilson: "I'm not a pollster, and I don't look at polls, but I can tell you that what Barack Obama said, what he did on Friday, it hit me right in the gut. You know having a candidate for the United States President tell me that I just have to get over it is patronizing, and I expect more from someone who wants to be President of the United States."
