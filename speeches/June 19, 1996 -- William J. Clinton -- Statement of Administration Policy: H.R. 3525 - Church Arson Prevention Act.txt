    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICYThis Statement Has Been Coordinated by OMB with the Appropriate Agencies
(Senate)(Hyde (R) Illinois and 94 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports the Faircloth-Kennedy substitute for H.R. 3525. Religious freedom is one of the founding principles of our democracy, and it is imperative that attacks upon that freedom, including those based on race or ethnicity, do not go unpunished. This bill is a bipartisan effort to remove unduly restrictive statutory requirements in 18 U.S.C. ยง247 that currently inhibit the prosecution of any person who destroys or defaces religious property. The Administration unequivocally supports that effort.
The Administration is pleased that the substitute amendment will include a provision authorizing the use of loan guarantees to help rebuild institutions that have been damaged or destroyed by arson or other acts of terrorism.
