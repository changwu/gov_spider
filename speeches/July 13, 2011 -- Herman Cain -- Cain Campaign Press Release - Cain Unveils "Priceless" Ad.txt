    (Stockbridge, GA)- Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain today unveiled his new online ad, "Priceless."
"President Obama once bragged that his campaign would raise $1 billion," Cain said. "My question is: 'why?' Don't you think it's a bad sign that you think it's going to take $1 billion to convince the American people to re-hire you for the job of President?"
The video also reminds viewers that while opponents might be able to tap their financial networks from their longtime political allies, Herman Cain's most impressive numbers come in the form of people. In fact, more than 15,000 supporters attended his announcement rally in 91 degree temperatures on Saturday, May 21, 2011 at Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta, Ga.
