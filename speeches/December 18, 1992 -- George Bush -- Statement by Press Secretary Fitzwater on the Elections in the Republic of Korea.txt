    Korean voters went to the polls today and elected Kim Young Sam to succeed President Roh Tae Woo. We welcome the success of the Korean people in expressing their preference in a constitutional process which enables all concerned to support the winner through free and fair elections. The President has sent his personal congratulations and those of the American people to President-elect Kim Young Sam.
We would like to take this opportunity to express our respect and admiration for the many accomplishments of President Roh. We wish President Roh well and look forward to working closely with President-elect Kim Young Sam.
