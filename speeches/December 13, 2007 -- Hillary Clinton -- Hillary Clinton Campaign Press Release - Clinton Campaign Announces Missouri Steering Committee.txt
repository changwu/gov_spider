    The Clinton campaign today announced its Missouri Steering Committee, made up of community leaders from across the state who will mobilize grassroots support for Hillary leading up to Missouri's February 5th primary. Earlier this week, State Representative Rachel Storch was named Missouri State Director.
"Now more than ever we need a leader with Hillary Clinton's proven record fighting for change," said Missouri Co-Chair Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, II. "I am convinced that Missouri absolutely needs Hillary. She is the only candidate with the experience it will take to rebuild our faltering and failing Middle Class and expand genuine opportunity for all Missourians."
"This committee represents the strength of Hillary's support from across Missouri," said former Secretary of State Bekki Cook. "We are going to bring her message of change to every corner of this state."
Hillary has a unique combination of strength and experience that we need in our next commander in chief," said national Campaign Co-Chair and former Democratic House Leader Dick Gephardt. "She's ready to lead this nation from her first day in the Oval Office."
