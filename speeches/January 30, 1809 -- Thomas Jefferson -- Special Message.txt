    To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
I transmit to Congress a letter recently received from our minister at the Court of St. James, covering one to him from the British secretary of state, with his reply. These are communicated as forming a sequel to the correspondence which accompanied my message to both Houses of the 17th instant.
TH: JEFFERSON.
