    HOUSTON, Texas – Today, the Cruz for President Campaign released an updated leadership team that reflects the consistent grassroots growth and strength that has been a hallmark of their efforts in Iowa and across the nation.
The team, including 130 Iowa pastors, 12 state legislators, and 260 county chairs and co-chairs, encompasses a broad cross-section of the conservative movement in the state.
"This campaign is about standing for principle and coalescing conservatives to work together to fight for our shared values," said Cruz. "The grassroots army that has come together here in Iowa is being replicated all across the country. The members of this team represent not just the thousands of Iowans who have come together to support our campaign, but also the tens of thousands of people who are engaging to help restore the promise of America."
Additionally the campaign announced 1,573 caucus captains across the state. The announcement marks the final milestone in Cruz's impressive Iowa organization. The campaign is putting its massive Iowa organization to the test this week by mobilizing the grassroots and turning them out to caucus for Cruz.
As of last week, over 12,000 volunteers have signed on and are now working to identify and turn out caucus goers for Cruz. Volunteers, on average, are making up to 20,000 phone calls and knocking on 2,000 doors every day. During the month of January, 836 people will have stayed at Camp Cruz, the former college dorms that are filled beyond capacity with volunteers from all over the country, some tripling up in rooms using air mattresses.
