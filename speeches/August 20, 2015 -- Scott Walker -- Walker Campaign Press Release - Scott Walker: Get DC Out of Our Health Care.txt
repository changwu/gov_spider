Repeal Obamacare, reduce costs, return power to the states and the people.
ObamaCare was forced on the American people by Democrats who think the government knows best, chief among them, Hillary Clinton.
The seeds of this destructive law were first planted by Clinton in the early 90s as part of her failed health care plan, HillaryCare, and in her 2008 campaign's health care proposal.
Although Clinton's health care proposals failed, many of their central provisions — including the individual mandate and harsh penalties for those who don't purchase insurance — succeeded in making their way into ObamaCare.
So let's call Obamacare what it is: the result of a decades-long plan by the most liberal wing of the Democratic Party to seize control of health care choice and freedom from individuals and states and hand total power over to the federal government in Washington.
ObamaCare is a horrible failure based on phony promises and outrageous shell games peddled by the liberal Washington establishment and its special interest politics. Theytold Americans they could keep their health care plans, even though they couldn't. They promised families health care premiums would go down, even though they wouldn't. Millions promised new coverage were simply tossed onto state Medicaidrolls. The full list of broken promises is long.
There is no fixing this disaster. ObamaCare must be repealed lock, stock and barrel. It's time to take back the power Washington robbed from people, families, caregivers and states. I have a plan to do just that.
My plan to topple the status quo and rid us of ObamaCare starts with compelling Congress to actually address the problem.
