    PORTSMOUTH, N.H. â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement today after Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson said a Muslim should not be elected president:
"I am very disappointed that Dr. Carson would suggest that a Muslim should not become president of the United States. It took us too long to overcome the prejudice against electing a Catholic or an African-American president. People should be elected to office based on their ideas, not their religion or the color of their skin."
