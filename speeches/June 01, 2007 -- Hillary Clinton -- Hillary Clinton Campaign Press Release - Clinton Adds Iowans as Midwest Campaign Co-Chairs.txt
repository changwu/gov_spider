    Campbell and Crawford to Lead Clinton's Regional Effort
DES MOINES, IA -- The Clinton campaign announced today that former Iowa Attorney General and Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bonnie Campbell and Des Moines attorney Jerry Crawford have been named Midwest Co-Chairs for Hillary's campaign.
"Bonnie and Jerry bring a wealth of experience and insight to my campaign," said Senator Clinton. "I am honored they'll help lead our efforts in Iowa and throughout the Midwest."
"Senator Clinton is ready to hit the ground running on her first day in the Oval Office," said Campbell. "I have traveled the world with Hillary, and I know firsthand that she has the relationships to help restore America's image across the globe."
Des Moines attorney Jerry Crawford said, "I am supporting Hillary Clinton because her experience makes her the best person to lead us out of the war in Iraq."
Campbell served in the Department of Justice as the Director of the Office of Violence Against Women, and was the first woman to chair the Iowa Democratic Party. In 1997, TIME Magazine named her one of the 25 most influential people in America.
Jerry Crawford has chaired the Iowa campaigns of President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Senator John Kerry and Governor Michael Dukakis. He has also served on the Board of Directors for the Democratic Governors Association and as Chair of the Polk County Democrats.
