    Dear Mr. President: 
Consistent with the conditions set forth in the Senate resolution of advice and consent to ratification of the Protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of the Republic of North Macedonia of October 22, 2019, and based on the recommendation of the Department of State, I hereby certify to the Senate that:
(i) the inclusion of North Macedonia in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will not have the effect of increasing the overall percentage share of the United States in the common budgets of NATO; and
(ii) the inclusion of North Macedonia in NATO does not detract from the ability of the United States to meet or to fund its military requirements outside of the North Atlantic area.
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
