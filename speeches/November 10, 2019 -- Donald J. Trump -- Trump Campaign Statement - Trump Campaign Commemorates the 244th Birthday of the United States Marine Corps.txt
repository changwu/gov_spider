    In celebration of the Marine Corps Birthday, Jessie Jane Duff, Co-Chair of Veterans for Trump and retired Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant issued the following statement:
"244 years ago, today, the finest amphibious fighting force known to the world was established. Since then, United States Marines have fought in every climb and place across the globe â€“ protecting the cause of liberty. Marines embody the finest values of our country. They are a living example of honor, courage and commitment. The President's campaign wishes all Marines, young and old, the very best, and salutes their devotion and dedication to this great nation. Semper Fidelis, Marines."
