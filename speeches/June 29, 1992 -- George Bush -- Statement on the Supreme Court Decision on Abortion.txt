    I am pleased with the Supreme Court's decision upholding most of Pennsylvania's reasonable restrictions on abortion, such as the requirement that a teenager seek her parent's consent before obtaining an abortion. The Pennsylvania law supports family values in what is perhaps the most difficult question a family can confront.
My own position on abortion is well-known and remains unchanged. I oppose abortion in all cases except rape or incest or where the life of the mother is at stake.
