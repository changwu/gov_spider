    I am pleased and gratified by today's action on Alaska lands by the House of Representatives. The full House voted overwhelmingly to pass the Udall-Anderson bill, which I strongly supported.
This bill allows for development of most of Alaska's oil, gas, mineral, and timber resources, while preserving what is essential to Alaska's native cultures, scenic wonders, and abundant wildlife. Members of the House should feel justifiably proud of their historic vote for a truly superior bill.
Now that the House has acted firmly and properly to protect Alaska lands, I hope that the Senate will move promptly to take similar action. I have taken a number of steps to protect Alaska lands in the event acceptable legislation is not finally enacted by the Congress. However, I deeply hope that the Congress as a whole will take the opportunity to act in the interest of the entire Nation and pass an Alaska bill designed to serve future generations.
