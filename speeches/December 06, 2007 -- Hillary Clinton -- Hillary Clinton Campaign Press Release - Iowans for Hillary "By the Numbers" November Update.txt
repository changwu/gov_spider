Re: Iowans for Hillary Campaign "By the Numbers" November Update
Iowans for Hillary demonstrated the growing strength and depth of its organization throughout the month of November. The month began with Senator Clinton "turning up the heat" at the Jefferson Jackson Dinner in Des Moines and continued with two strong debate performances. The "Caucusing is Easy" video showed Iowans how easy it will be to stand up for Hillary, and one of the video's stars, President Clinton, traveled the state to make the case for Hillary. Take a look at Iowans for Hillary's November "numbers":
