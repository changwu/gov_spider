    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Smith (R) Texas and 69 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 4623, which would revise and strengthen the Nation's child pornography laws in light of Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition. Passage of the bill would be an important step in protecting children from abuse by ensuring effective child pornography prosecutions.
