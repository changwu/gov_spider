    Watch The New Romney For President Web Video: "Stories From The Obama Economy"
"Despite President Obama's attempts to make the country forget about his dismal record, the American people remember. There are millions of stories from the Obama economy that reflect his failure to make things better. Too many Americans have lost their jobs, lost their homes, and fallen into poverty under this president. They are tired of being tired. They want good jobs, rising incomes, and hope for a better tomorrow. They want to believe in America again. And that is what this campaign is going to be about." â€“ Gail Gitcho, Romney Communications Director
