    Today, Las Vegas City Councilman Bob Beers announced his decision to support Ohio Gov. John Kasich for president and join the Kasich for America Nevada leadership team leading up to next week's primary election.
Said Beers,"Gov. Kasich is the candidate to beat. His record of balancing budgets, driving job creation forward and advancing President Reagan's national security agenda is unmatched. With our primary right around the corner, I'm excited to work with the team to build momentum around the state."

Beers has represented the 2nd Ward of Las Vegas since 2012. A certified public accountant by profession, he also served as an assemblyman and senator in the Nevada legislature from 1999 to 2008.
Said Kasich, "It's an honor to receive the support of one of Nevada's most trusted public servants. Councilman Beers brings extensive financial experience and political knowledge to our team, which puts us in a stronger position ahead of the primary election."
