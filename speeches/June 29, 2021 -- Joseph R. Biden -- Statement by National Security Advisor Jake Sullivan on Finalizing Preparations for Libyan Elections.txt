    I commend the work of the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF) as its members meet in Geneva this week to finalize preparations for Libya to hold historic national elections on December 24, 2021. As the Berlin II conference affirmed, the United States stands together with our Libyan and international partners in full support for holding presidential and parliamentary elections on time that will enable Libyans to choose their own leaders and re-establish their sovereignty after years of civil conflict and economic upheaval. This builds on recent progress with the establishment of the interim Government of National Unity.
We are encouraged by the positive atmosphere and spirit of compromise in which the LPDF is meeting, with active United Nations facilitation, to adopt the constitutional and legislative arrangements needed for elections. We support the Libyan people as they chart a path toward a more stable, prosperous, and secure future.
