    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House) and Senate(Gekas (R) PA)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 926 if Title II and Section 102 are deleted.
The Administration supports the objective of judicial review of agency determinations under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which currently requires agencies to analyze the effects of their regulations on small businesses.
However, Title II would move beyond the sensible requirements of current law and practice. It would add unnecessarily burdensome bureaucratic steps to the regulatory rulemaking process and encourage excessive litigation. These added requirements would not improve the regulatory process but would instead produce delay and gridlock.
Section 102, which would require agencies to submit proposed rules to the Small Business Administration's Chief Counsel for Advocacy, would unduly delay the regulatory process and overwhelm the Chief Counsel.
