    I am pleased today to announce $8.8 million of new Federal money from the Office of National Drug Control Policy's High Intensity Drug Trafficking Program to fight methamphetamines, a deadly drug. These new funds will bolster joint Federal, State and local law enforcement efforts now underway as part of this Administration's comprehensive National Methamphetamine Strategy. By further strengthening the ability of law enforcement to target those who produce and push methamphetamines, we take this deadly drug and the accompanying crime off our streets and protect our children.
