Wow! @foxandfriends blew away the competition of Morning Joke (which did very poorly) on MSDNC (Another Comcast sleaze production), and @CNN's New Day, in the Morning Television Ratings. A total blowout, but that's what you get when you treat "Trump" fairly!Retweets: 16032Favorites: 73863

Our pathetic, slow moving Federal Reserve, headed by Jay Powell, who raised rates too fast and lowered too late, should get our Fed Rate down to the levels of our competitor nations. They now have as much as a two point advantage, with even bigger currency help. Also, stimulate!Retweets: 17611Favorites: 69804

The Federal Reserve must be a leader, not a very late follower, which it has been!Retweets: 14698Favorites: 73995

There is another Russia, Russia, Russia meeting today. It is headed up by corrupt politician Adam "Shifty" Schiff, so I wouldn't expect too much! @DHS_WolfRetweets: 12948Favorites: 52489

Nancy Pelosi just said, "I don't know if we can be ready this week." In other words, it's off to vacation for the Do Nothing Democrats. That's been the story with them for 1 1/2 years!Retweets: 28626Favorites: 109312

If you like automobils, how can you vote for a Democrat who all want to get rid of cars, as quickly as possible, especially if they are powered by gasoline. Remember also, no more than one car per family. I, on the other hand, have new plants being built all over Michigan, Plus!Retweets: 589Favorites: 2100

Best unemployment numbers in the history of our Country. Best employment number EVER, almost 160 million people working right now. Vote Republican, unless you want to see these numbers obliterated!Retweets: 25817Favorites: 107583
