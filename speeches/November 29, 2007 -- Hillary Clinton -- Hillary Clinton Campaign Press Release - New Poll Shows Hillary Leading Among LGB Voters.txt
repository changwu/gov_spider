    In a new survey released by Hunter College, Hillary Clinton leads all Democratic candidates in support among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) Americans. According to the poll, Hillary leads with 63 percent, 41 points ahead of the next candidate.
"I'm honored to have the support of so many in the LGB community," said Clinton. "Together, we can end the divisiveness of the past seven years and change the direction of this country so that we embrace the full diversity of our nation."
The poll also found that 72 percent of LGB likely voters consider Senator Clinton a supporter of gay rights. As President, Hillary will also work to end discrimination in adoption laws, sign hate crimes legislation and ENDA into law, and put an end to the failed policy of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. She will work to make sure that gay and lesbian couples in committed relationships have the same rights and responsibilities as all Americans.
