SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER: "The President may be checked out to the point that he hasn't been able to meet with his Jobs Council. But the American people are continuing to ask the question: Where are the jobs? And they expect us to work on this no matter where we are in the campaign or what time of the year it is.
