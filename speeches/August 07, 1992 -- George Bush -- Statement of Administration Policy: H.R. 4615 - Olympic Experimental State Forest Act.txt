    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Unsoeld (D) WA and 3 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 4615. The bill provides for certain exemptions to the Endangered Species Act for the preservation of the Northern Spotted Owl in the Olympic Experimental State Forest in Washington. This is a piecemeal approach to an issue that requires an area-wide comprehensive solution, such as the Preservation Plan proposed by the Secretary of the Interior.
