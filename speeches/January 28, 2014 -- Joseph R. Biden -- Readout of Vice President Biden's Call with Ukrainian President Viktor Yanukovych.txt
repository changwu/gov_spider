    President Yanukovych of Ukraine called Vice President Biden today to update him on the current crisis in Ukraine. The Vice President welcomed the progress made today and urged President Yanukovych to sign the parliament's repeal of several of the January 16 laws without delay. He strongly encouraged President Yanukovych to continue to work with the opposition to find compromises critical to a peaceful solution. These include an amnesty law and a new government that can bring political unity, win the confidence of the Ukrainian people, and take Ukraine in the direction of Europe by strengthening democratic institutions and making the reforms necessary to achieve economic prosperity.
