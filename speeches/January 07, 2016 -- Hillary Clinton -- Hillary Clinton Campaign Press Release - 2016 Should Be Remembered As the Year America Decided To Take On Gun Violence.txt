In 2015, there were more days with a mass shooting than without a mass shooting. But even as Americans mourned one heartbreaking shooting after another, Republicans in Congress and on the campaign trail refused to take meaningful action to prevent gun violence.?
It's time for people across the country—including responsible gun owners—to come together and stand up to the gun lobby and anyone who continues to stand in the way of commonsense gun violence prevention measures like background checks.?
Here's why.










  " The vast majority of Americans support common sense steps to reduce and prevent gun violence. ... 92 percent of Americans support these measures, 83 percent of gun owners support them. ... I know there are some who don't believe we should be talking about this issue, or wish to somehow push it into the background. Well I will not be silenced. I will continue to talk about what we as a nation must do to protect ourselves."

—Hillary Clinton
Let's make 2016 be the year we take on gun violence once and for all.?
