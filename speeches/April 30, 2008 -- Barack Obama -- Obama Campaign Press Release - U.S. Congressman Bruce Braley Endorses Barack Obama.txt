    Chicago, IL - Today, United States Congressman Bruce Braley (D-IA) endorsed Barack Obama for president, citing his ability to transcend the politics of fear and division and bring record numbers of people into the process.
Congressman Braley said, "It's hard not to be excited about Barack Obama. On a cold January night, and again during Saturday's First District Convention in Iowa, I saw countless people participating in the political process for the very first time because they were so inspired by Senator Obama's unique ability to transcend the politics of fear and division that have crippled this country for the past eight years.
"In this same spirit, I believe there's one candidate for President who has the ability to unite our country and bring about the change we need. That's why today I'm proud to endorse Barack Obama for President."
Senator Barack Obama said, "I'm grateful to have Congressman Braley's support. >From raising the minimum wage to standing up for fair trade laws, Congressman Braley has been fighting to bring about real change for working Americans. That's what he did as an attorney in Iowa for more than two decades by helping ordinary Americans who'd lost their jobs and pensions. And that's what we'll do together when I'm President - by fixing our economy, strengthening our middle class, and putting the American dream within reach for all Americans."
Today, U.S. Congressman Baron Hill also endorsed Barack Obama. Obama has been endorsed by 246 superdelegates. Senator Obama is now 286 delegates away from winning the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.
