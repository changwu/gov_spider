    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with section 1009 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (Public Law 101 - 189), enclosed is a report on Anti-Satellite (ASAT) Arms Control. The report addresses the desirability of an agreement with the Soviet Union that would impose limitations on ASAT capabilities. The assessment also includes a determination whether a ban or other limitations would be in the national interest of the United States.
The unclassified version of this report will be forwarded at a later date under separate cover.
Sincerely,
George Bush
