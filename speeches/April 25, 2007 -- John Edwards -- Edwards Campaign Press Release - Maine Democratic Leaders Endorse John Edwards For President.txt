    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ The John Edwards for President campaign announced today that 23 leading Maine Democrats endorsed Senator John Edwards for President, including State Senate President Beth Edmonds and numerous state senators, state representatives and community activists.
"I look forward to working with these outstanding leaders to change America," said Edwards. "Real, fundamental change requires every one of us to take action. I am proud to have these leaders on my team."
Edmonds endorsed Edwards saying, "As the son of a mill worker, John Edwards understands the challenges facing Maine's workers and their families. They deserve fair wages, access to health care, and the chance to build a better life. John Edwards has the vision and the talent to provide hope and opportunity for all Americans. I am proud to endorse him and to join with Democratic leaders from every part of Maine in that support."
State Representative Jeremy Fischer from Presque Isle joined Edmonds in her support saying, "Senator Edwards understands the value of hard work, like many Maine families. That's why I'm honored to join him in his fight to make this country better for all of us. His priorities are the same as every Maine family, fair trade deals that keep good jobs in Maine, universal health care for all Americans, increased attention to rural issues, and increases in the minimum wage."
Henry Beck, Waterville City Councilor and President of the Maine College Democrats, also endorsed Edwards saying: "John Edwards' life story and focus on fighting for working people inspired me to public service. The families I grew up with need his leadership on jobs, health care, and trade.
