    I congratulate Macky Sall on his victory in Senegal's Presidential elections. Domestic and international observers report that the election was carried out transparently, freely, and reflects the will of the Senegalese people.
I also recognize President Abdoulaye Wade for his leadership and friendship to the United States during his Presidency. I look forward to building similarly productive ties with President-elect Sall, while deepening the longstanding bonds between the United States and the Senegalese people.
Senegal has, through this election, reaffirmed its tradition as a leading example of good governance and democracy at work in Africa and remains an example for its neighbors. The Government and people of Senegal have once again demonstrated their commitment to political expression through peaceful, democratic elections, making it harder for nondemocratic forces, near and far, to prevail. Today's results deepen hopes across the continent and around the world that the quest for human dignity cannot be denied and that Africa's democratic wave must continue.
The United States looks forward to maintaining its strong partnership and close engagement with the people and Government of Senegal to continue to strengthen democracy, peace, and prosperity in the region.
