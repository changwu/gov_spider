    This morning, the Vice President accompanied his son Beau Biden to Houston, Texas, where Beau is being evaluated to determine the cause of an episode of disorientation and weakness that he experienced while on vacation with his family last week.
Further information about the Vice President's schedule will be forthcoming.
