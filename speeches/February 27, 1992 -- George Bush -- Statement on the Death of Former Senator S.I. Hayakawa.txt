    Barbara and I are saddened to hear about the death of former Senator S. I. Hayakawa. Senator Hayakawa was a leading voice on behalf of the people of California and the Nation. His counsel was always sound and welcome, and his legacy will be well remembered.
Barbara and I extend our sympathy to the family and friends of Senator Hayakawa.
