    Today Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre announced that he will step down from his position at the end of March. I want to express my deep gratitude to John for his outstanding service to America.
Since becoming the Deputy Secretary in July 1997, John Hamre has been a respected, decisive, and forward-leaning leader. He directed implementation of the 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review and the Defense Reform Initiative. He put in place a wide range of innovative defense management initiatives and worked tirelessly on reforms of defense contracting. His impact in these areas will be felt long after his departure.
Dr. Hamre also was a pivotal adviser as we ensured that the readiness challenges of our Armed Services are addressed with necessary resources. He was a driving force behind the increase in the defense budget and the increased benefits for military personnel that I signed into law last year. He also led Department of Defense efforts to ensure that their critical computer systems were not affected by Y2K problems.
Although I will miss his advice as Deputy Secretary, I am pleased that the Nation will continue to benefit from his vast knowledge and experience in defense policy. I wish John Hamre all the best as he moves on to become president and chief executive officer of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
