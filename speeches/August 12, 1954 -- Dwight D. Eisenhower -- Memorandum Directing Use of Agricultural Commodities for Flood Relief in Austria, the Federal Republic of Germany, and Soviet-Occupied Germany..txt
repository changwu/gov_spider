The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Director of the Bureau of the
Budget, the Director, Foreign Operations Administration
In accordance with my statement of July 29, 1954, with regard to the extension of aid throughout the flood areas of Eastern and Central Europe, and in accordance with the recommendation contained in the memorandum of August 12, 1954, submitted by the Director of the Foreign Operations Administration, and pursuant to the authority vested in me by Title II of Public Law 480, 83d Congress, 2d Session, I hereby determine that up to $4,000,000 worth of agricultural commodities from the stocks of the Commodity Credit Corporation may be used for the purpose of providing emergency assistance in meeting flood and other urgent requirements in Austria, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Soviet-occupied Germany. The maximum amount of $4,000,000 is computed on the basis of the Corporation's investment in the commodities made available for export, including processing, packaging, inland transportation within the United States, and handling costs.
The Secretary of State shall conclude any necessary bilateral agreements with the governments concerned in connection with the furnishing of this assistance.
Arrangements for the operations of this relief program, including the specifications of the commodities and the provision of Mutual Security funds to cover the costs of ocean transportation of the commodities, shall be the responsibility of the Director of the Foreign Operations Administration and the transfer of the commodities shall be upon such terms and conditions as the Director determines to be appropriate, after consultation with the Secretary of State.
