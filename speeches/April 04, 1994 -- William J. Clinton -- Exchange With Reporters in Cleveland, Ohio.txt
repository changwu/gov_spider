Q. Do the Serbs have a green light in——
The President. I don't think they have a green light. We're looking at what our options are there. But it really depends upon in part what the U.N. mission wants to do there. We are committed to provide air support to troops if they go in. And whether we can recreate the conditions of Sarajevo anywhere else depends in part on the facts of each specific case.
I would discourage any of them for doing anything just for negotiating purposes. They ought to go ahead and negotiate a peace and get it over with, is what I hope they will. It's not going to change their options——
