    TODAY is the 69th birthday of the competitive civil service in our Nation. We have come a long way since 1883; 93 percent of all Federal workers are now under civil service. They hold their jobs by virtue of having won them in open competition with their fellow citizens. They hold their jobs under the merit system.
This is a fitting time for all of us to reflect upon the great contribution and tremendous importance of the civil service to our national well-being. It is perhaps especially fitting now because some people are indulging in indiscriminate criticism of all public servants, because of the actions of a few. The overwhelming majority of our Federal workers are devoted, hard-working, honest, loyal servants of the people. They deserve our fullest recognition and support. I have said this before. It cannot be said too frequently.
This anniversary of the civil service is a good day for those of us who serve the public to rededicate ourselves to that service to the utmost of our capacities. It is our privilege to work for all the people of this country. It is our responsibility to serve them faithfully and well.
