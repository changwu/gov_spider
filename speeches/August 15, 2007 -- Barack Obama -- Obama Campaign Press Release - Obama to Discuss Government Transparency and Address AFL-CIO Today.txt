    DES MOINES -- Today in Cedar Falls, U.S. Senator Barack Obama will discuss his plan to increase government transparency and accountability in Washington, D.C. Today's remarks will highlight Senator Obama's record of fighting for ethics and lobbying reforms that were unpopular with political insiders while in the U.S. Senate and the Illinois state Senate. Following the Cedar Falls event, Senator Obama will address the AFL-CIO Convention in Waterloo.
Today's events are the start of Senator Obama's "Road to Change" 5-day trip across Iowa. Each day from August 15th through 19th, Obama will highlight a specific policy area where change has been blocked by Washington lobbyists, special interests and conventional Washington thinking. Obama's "Road to Change" will lead to Drake University on Sunday morning where he will participate in a nationally televised presidential debate that will be broadcast on ABC.
