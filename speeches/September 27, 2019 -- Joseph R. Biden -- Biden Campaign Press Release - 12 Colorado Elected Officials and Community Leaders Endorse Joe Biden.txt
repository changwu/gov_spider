As Vice President Biden travels the country laying out his vision for America, he has earned the endorsements of more than 400 distinguished national and local leaders from key states, including Super Tuesday states like Colorado. Biden for President is focused on not only building momentum in the first four early states, but also in key battleground and Super Tuesday states as the campaign expands its broad, diverse coalition.
Last week, the campaign announced four congressional endorsements from Texas, Missouri, North Carolina, and Florida, including two former chairmen of the Congressional Black Caucus. In recent weeks, the campaign also announced endorsements from 59 African American state legislators and elected officials and community leaders from all four early states.
