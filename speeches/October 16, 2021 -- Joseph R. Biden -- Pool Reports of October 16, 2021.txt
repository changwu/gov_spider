WH pool report 5 - return to WH and lunch lid 
Pool returned to White House at 1:10 p.m! We have a lunch (or as this pooler insists, brunch kid) until 5 p.m. See you then!

Pool report 6 - rolling to undisclosed location
Hello again! Your pool is back, with significantly more rain. Pool spotted First Lady Jill Biden enter the motorcade but we did not see the President. Pool began rolling to an undisclosed location at 5:24 pm. But your pool - astute followers of the presidents' weekend schedule - have a few guesses.

Wh Pool report 7 - church arrival
Surprise. The President and the First Lady are attending mass at Holy Trinity Catholic Church. The motorcade arrived at 5:36 pm. Pool briefly spotted POTUS entering the church wearing a blue suit. Pool is now holding in vans.



October 16, 202118:29

Pool report 8 - we're rolling
Pool spotted POTUS leaving church at 6:23 pm, he waved at the pool but did not come over to take questions. We are now rolling, destination unknown.

Pool report 9 - dinner arrival
Motorcade arrived at the Georgetown waterfront at 6:30 p.m and spotted POTUS and FLOTUS entering high end seafood restaurant Fiola Mare for a date night! Pool is holding in vans.

Pool report 10 - leaving dinner
POTUS and FLOTUS left Fiola Mare at 7:59 pm and pool is now rolling en route to the White House.
Another Fiola Mare patron approached the pool prior to POTUS’ departure and said that he was eating "the lobster" but your pooler is skeptical, and that claim remains unverified. If I have an update on his meal, I will send it forward. But my bet is on the bolognese.
