    Newsom Will Join Congresswoman Barbara Lee and Dolores Huerta As California Co-Chairs for Her Campaign
California Governor Gavin Newsom endorsed Senator Kamala Harris for president in an interview Friday with Chris Hayes on MSNBC.
"I'm very enthusiastic about Kamala Harris. I'll be endorsing her candidacy for president," Newsom said. "I know her well, I've known her for decades. Not only as District Attorney, where she did an extraordinary job with a very progressive record, but I watched her up close as a Lieutenant Governor when she served as Attorney General, and I have the privilege of working with her as U.S. Senator. I think the American people could not do better."
"Kamala Harris is a fearless fighter," he added in a tweet. "A voice for the voiceless and vulnerable. From advancing equality to defending immigrant communities to expanding opportunity, she'll do what's right. Proud to endorse her for President."
Newsom will join East Bay Congresswoman Barbara Lee and labor and civil rights leader Dolores Huerta to serve as California Co-Chairs for Harris's campaign.
The governor of America's most populous state, Newsom joins five Members of Congress from California in backing Harris's candidacy: Nanette Barragan, Katie Hill, Ted Lieu, and Barbara Lee. She also has received the endorsements of 21 members of the California State Senate Democratic Caucus, including Senate Pro Tem Toni Atkins. California's early primary will be on March 3, 2020.
