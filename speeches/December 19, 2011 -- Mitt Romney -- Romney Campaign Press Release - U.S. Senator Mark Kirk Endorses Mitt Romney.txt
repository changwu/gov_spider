    Successor to Senator Obama Endorses a Fiscal Conservative for President
Mitt Romney today announced the support of Illinois Senator Mark Kirk. Senator Kirk will be a Special Adviser on Policy.
"In order to revitalize our economy and repair our relationships abroad, I will need to work with leaders like Senator Kirk," said Mitt Romney. "He has provided leadership in the Senate on the issues I am fighting for in my campaign. I am honored to have his support."
Announcing his support, Senator Kirk said, "President Romney will cut spending, repeal the health care law and restore private sector economic growth. He is a foreign policy hawk who will stand up to Iran. As a Massachusetts Governor, he knows how to work with Democrats and Independents. As the head of the Salt Lake City Olympics, he worked with dozens of countries in organizing an international triumph for the United States. America needs his managerial talent, team building spirit and hard-nosed sense of economic common sense."
