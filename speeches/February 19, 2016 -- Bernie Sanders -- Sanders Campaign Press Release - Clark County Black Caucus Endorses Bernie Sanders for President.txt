    LAS VEGAS – U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' Nevada campaign on Friday welcomed the endorsement of the Clark County Black Caucus. Clark County is the biggest county in Nevada with over 2 million people, approximately 12 percent of whom are African-American. The group noted Sen. Sanders' lifelong commitment to civil rights, racial and social justice, ending mass incarceration and addressing economic inequality in the country.
"We are proud to endorse Bernie Sanders for president. He has the audacity to speak truth to power and fight for the needs of our community," said Yvette Williams, Clark County Black Caucus chair. "He understands that when everyone is treated equally, this country thrives."
The Clark County Black Caucus has pioneered several legislative advancements addressing issues that confront the state's African-American community. The organization serves as a vibrant example of an institution that is able to transcend the partisan gridlock of the Silver State's political institutions.
"We know that Sen. Sanders' plans will address the institutional racism that plagues our nation and leaves millions of young African-Americans jobless, incarcerated, and hopeless," said Steve Munford, Clark County Black Caucus executive board member. "Bernie Sanders has stood with our community since the civil rights movement and continues to stand with us today. We will caucus for him and continue working with him to bring about a political revolution."
"We are honored to receive the support of an organization that was created on the heels of one of the most exciting moments in American history—the election of our country's first African-American president, Barack Obama," said Joan Kato, Sanders' Nevada state director. "They are one of Nevada's most influential advocacy organizations, and we are so proud to have their support."
