    All three candidates joined Tommy Tucker on WWL Radio in New Orleans this morning and discussed the topic of erosion in Louisiana affecting the nation's energy supply. Governor Mitt Romney admitted to not being "sufficiently briefed" on the issue. Like Romney, Senator Santorum also admitted to not being familiar with the issue.
Newt, on the other hand, responded to the same question from Tucker by outlining a two point plan for maintaining and revitalizing Louisiana's offshore drilling and energy industry, admitting it is an issue on which he has been "briefed again and again."
Additionally, Newt gave a speech today ?in Port Fourchon, the "Gulf's Energy Connection," on an extensive American energy plan and the need for an increase in offshore drilling, including in Louisiana.
Trip Gabriel from the New York Times tweeted about the huge difference in knowledge.

Peter Hamby from CNN also noticed Romney's struggle to talk about local issues.
