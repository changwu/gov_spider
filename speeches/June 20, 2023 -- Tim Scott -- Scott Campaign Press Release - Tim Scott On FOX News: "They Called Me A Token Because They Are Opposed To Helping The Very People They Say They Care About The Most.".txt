Sean Hannity: We've got a party that is the Democratic party today, in no way resembles the Democratic party of both.
Tim Scott: Without any question, we have to persuade people to join our team. Here's what I can tell you, I've done the surveys, I've run around the country. African Americans, around 81% want the same level of policing, or more policing, not less. That's a lie from the radical left. We have to understand that most of America wants the same thing. How many of y'all here believe in law and order? How many of y'all are thanking God almighty and willing to stand with me and back the blue?
You see, when I wrote a bill to help refund the police because the crazy left defunded the police, they called me a token because they are opposed to helping the very people they say they care about the most. How many of y'all believe that we should secure our southern border? We all believe that. We all know this to be true.
This is what I was taught, if you don't control your back door at your house, it's not your house. If you don't control your southern border, it might not be our country. Every county in America is a border county. 70,000 Americans have lost their lives to fentanyl, 70,000. The precursors come from China, they're made in manufacturing locations in Mexico, and then the Mexican cartels bringing it across our southern borders and our ports of entry. President Scott, not on my watch. We will stop this from happening without any question. We will freeze their assets and unleash the most powerful force on this earth.
