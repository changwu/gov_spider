    Listen, thank you all for coming. So you're wondering what a Republican Presidential candidate is doing in New Jersey 15 days until the election? I'll tell you, what I'm doing here is I'm sending a strong message that with your help, we can carry New Jersey on November the 2d.
I'm so honored you all came out to say hello. Thank you so very much for your friendship, for your support. Make sure your friends go to the polls. Make sure your neighbors go to the polls. And tell them if they want a safer America, a stronger America, and a better America, to put me and Dick Cheney back into office.
God bless you all. I'm headed down to Florida. I'm working. We're going to win. God bless. Thanks for coming.
