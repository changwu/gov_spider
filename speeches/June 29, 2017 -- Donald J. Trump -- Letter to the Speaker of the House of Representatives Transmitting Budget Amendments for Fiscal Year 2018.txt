    Dear Mr. Speaker: 
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 Budget amendments for the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, and Justice, as well as the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, and the National Endowment for the Arts.
These amendments are necessary to correctly reflect the policies assumed in my FY 2018 Budget. The overall FY 2018 budget authority totals would not be affected by this request.
The details of these amendments are set forth in the enclosure from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
