    Domestic Policy Advisor Ambassador Susan Rice and U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy hosted a roundtable at the White House about the joys, hopes, and challenges that transgender children are experiencing. Transgender kids and their parents traveled to the White House from states that have attacked the rights of transgender kids, including Arizona, Texas, and Virginia, and shared the devastating effects these political attacks are having on their mental health and wellbeing. As one round table participant shared, it feels scary when the politicians elected to represent you don't care about your wellbeing. Families participating in today's roundtable also highlighted that transgender kids can thrive when parents love and affirm their transgender children, and when transgender kids have access to the support they need at school and in their communities. Ambassador Rice and Dr. Murthy reiterated the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to standing up for the rights of transgender kids and their parents, and to challenging state laws that harm transgender kids. They also thanked the families for their unwavering advocacy and bravery in challenging these discriminatory laws.
