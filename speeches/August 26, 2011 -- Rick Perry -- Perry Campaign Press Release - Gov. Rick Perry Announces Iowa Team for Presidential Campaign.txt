    AUSTIN â€” Gov. Rick Perry has announced key members of his Iowa leadership for his presidential campaign. Matt Gronewald will serve as state director for Perry's Iowa campaign, Robert Haus will serve as Iowa chairman, and Ruth Haus will serve as a senior consultant to the governor.
Gronewald, who was the deputy executive director for the state party, is considered a rising star in Iowa political circles. Gronewald was a strategist behind the GOP legislative campaigns that led Republicans to win control of the Iowa House in 2010. In 2006, he also managed Republican Bill Dix's bid for Congress.
A lifelong Iowan, Robert Haus has worked on all levels of state and federal races, including leadership roles for Senator Phil Gramm and Steve Forbes during their presidential campaigns. He is currently vice president for public affairs for Des Moines based PolicyWorks LLC, a public affairs company. Prior to joining Policy Works, Robert and his wife Ruth owned and operated Eagle Media Group, a full service media production company.
Before moving to Iowa in 2002, Ruth Haus spent the previous 18 years in Washington, D.C., where she served as vice president of corporate communications for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Her involvement in politics included running Steve Forbes' presidential campaign in 2000 as deputy campaign manager and COO, deputy executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee and deputy political director of the Republican National Committee. The first campaign Ruth worked on was George Bush's successful 1988 presidential campaign, after which she worked in the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs.
