    President Mubarak. I'd like to welcome President Obama to Egypt. This is his first--our first meeting together. We discussed so many issues: the Middle East issues, interests in the region. We also discussed all problems here in the region, the situation and everything related to Iran and to the region.
I repeat welcoming Mr. Obama. We discussed everything candidly and frankly, without any reservation, but there are other meetings that will take place later, either in the United States of America or anywhere else.
Thank you very much.
President Obama. Well, I just want to thank President Mubarak as well as the people of Egypt for their wonderful hospitality. I'm very much looking forward to speaking at the university this afternoon. I wanted to first sit down with President Mubarak, who, obviously, has decades of experience on a whole range of issues.
As the President has indicated, we discussed the situation with Israel and the Palestinians. We discussed how we can move forward in a constructive way that brings about peace and prosperity for all people in the region. And I emphasized to him that America is committed to working in partnership with the countries in the region so that all people can meet their aspirations.
And I'm very much looking forward in the months and years to come to continuing to consult with the President. And I've communicated to him, and I want to communicate to the Egyptian people, our greetings from America.
Thank you.
