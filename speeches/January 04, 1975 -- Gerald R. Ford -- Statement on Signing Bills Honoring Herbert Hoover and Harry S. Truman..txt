    I HAVE signed two bills that honor former Presidents Herbert Hoover and Harry S. Truman.
S. 1418, the Herbert Hoover memorial bill, authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to make available $7 million in matching grants to the Hoover Institution at Stanford University for the construction and equipping of a new memorial building. This memorial building will complete the Hoover Institution's library and research complex. The addition of this building will make the dream of Herbert Hoover in 1919, when the institution was founded, a reality. With expanded facilities, the institution will be strengthened as a national and international center for advanced research on the problems of the 20th century. It will make available to scholars and students from each of our States and every country in the world the research facilities essential to academic scholarship.
S. 3548, the Harry S Truman Memorial Scholarship Act, establishes a $30 million fund in the United States Treasury. These proceeds will be used by the Truman Foundation to provide 4-year college scholarships on a competitive basis to outstanding students interested in public service careers. There is no fixed number of scholarships, but at least one must be awarded in each State where there is a qualified applicant.
The Herbert Hoover memorial bill and the Harry S Truman Memorial Scholarship Act create living memorials to two Presidents and honor their many years of extraordinary and selfless public service. I am privileged to sign the Hoover and Truman memorial legislation.
