DUBUQUE, IA – Hillary Clinton demonstrated her strength in Eastern Iowa when Dubuque Mayor Roy Buol endorsed Hillary Clinton at the Dubuque County '˜Picks a President' event. Mayor Buol's endorsement comes five days before the January 3rd caucuses when Iowans will play an important role in selecting the next President of the United States.
"My wife and I believe Hillary has the intelligence, experience, and strength of character to forge a new beginning and the ability to win in November 2008. We support Senator Clinton as the next president and will be caucusing on her behalf," Mayor Buol said. "Iowans have the responsibility to pick the next President of the United States. I took a good look at all of the candidates and Hillary Clinton is the only one with real solutions to help move our country forward.".
Mayor Buol, a native of Dubuque, was elected in 2006 after serving on the Dubuque City Council from 1996 to 2006. Under Mayor Buol's leadership, Dubuque was selected in June 2007 as one of the ten communities in the nation to be named an "All America City" by the National Civic League.
"I am honored to have Mayor Roy Buol's support. He has been a leader in the Dubuque community for over 12 years," Hillary Clinton said. "Mayor Buol's service and dedication to Dubuque is inspiring and represents the type of leadership America needs. He understands the need for change in America and I look forward to working to bring that change."
