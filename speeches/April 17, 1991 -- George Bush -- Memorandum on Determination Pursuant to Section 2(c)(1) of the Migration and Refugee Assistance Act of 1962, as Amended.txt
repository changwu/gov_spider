GEORGE BUSH
THE WHITE HOUSE,
Washington, April 17, 1991

Justification for Presidential Determination Authorizing the Use of Up to $15,250,000 of Funds from the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund
Under Section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962, as amended (the Act), 22 U.S.C. 2601(c)(1), the President may authorize the furnishing of assistance from the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund (the Fund) to meet "unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs" whenever he determines it is "important to the national interest" to do so. A drawdown from the Fund in the amount of $15,250,000 is required to respond to such unexpected urgent needs in Africa.
South African Repatriation — $4,000,000
On March 21, the South African government agreed to a UNHCR role in the repatriation of exiled members of South African liberation movements. U.S. policy in South African strongly supports the negotiation process; the return of exiles is an essential element of the process.
UNHCR will issue an appeal for funds to repatriate and estimated 40,000 beneficiaries. An immediate U.S. response to this appeal will promote maximum international response to the UNHCR appeal.
Malawi — $1,250,000
Several factors have exacerbated Malawi's monumental refugee problem since the beginning of 1991. Interruption of the transportation food corridor, low donor commodity commitments, poor harvests, and flooding have imperiled some 950,000 refugees in Malawi.
In response, WFP has requested $12,000,000 for the purchase and transport of 35,000 MT of food to keep the pipeline running until new donor shipments arrive. UNICEF has issued a $295,000 appeal for emergency support and health care.
Horn Emergencies — $10,000,000
In late December 1990 serious fighting began in Somalia, ultimately ousting President Siad Barre from power. The fighting has resulted in hundreds of thousands of displaced persons in need of humanitarian assistance — with Ethiopian refugees leaving refugee camps for Kenya and Ethiopia, and Somalis crossing the border into Kenya and Ethiopia.
On March 8, UNHCR Issued an emergency appeal for $42,000,000. UNHCR will provide immediate relief assistance to the 20,000 returnee population and move the 150,000 new Somali refugees, to the extent possible, to the existing refugee camps. WFP has appealed for an additional 150,000 MT of food for Ethiopia. The remoteness of the three separate areas where the returnees/refugees are located adds to the urgency of the situation. UNHCR will also assist up to 50,000 new Ethiopian and Somali refugees in Kenya and is programming $1,900,000 for this purpose.
