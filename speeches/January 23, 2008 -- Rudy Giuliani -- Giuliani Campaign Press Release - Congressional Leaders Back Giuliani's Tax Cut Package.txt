    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that U.S. Senator Kit Bond and Representative David Dreier have introduced the "FAST Act," legislation that mirrors Mayor Giuliani's tax cut package.
Joining Bond and Dreier as co-sponsors for the legislation are other Congressional leaders supporting the Mayor, including Representatives Pete Sessions, Peter King, Candice Miller, Vito Fossella, George Radanovich, Charlie Dent, Mary Bono Mack and Ed Royce. Representatives Roy Blunt, Eric Cantor and Wally Herger are also co-sponsoring.
"This bill, inspired by Mayor Giuliani's bold tax cut proposal, amounts to the largest tax cut in American history and will give a much needed, permanent boost to our economy," said Congressman Dreier. "That Mayor Giuliani is able to form a coalition of conservative leaders in Congress to move his agenda speaks volumes about his leadership, something I'm looking forward to having in Washington."
The proposed "FAST Act" calls for an optional one page tax form with three simple rates and key deductions and credits, eliminating the death tax, indexing the AMT to the rate of inflation, reducing the capital gains tax from 15-10 percent and indexing it to inflation, and reducing the corporate tax rate from 35-25.
