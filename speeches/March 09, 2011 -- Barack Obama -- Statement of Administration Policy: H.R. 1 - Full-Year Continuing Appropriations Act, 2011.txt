(Senate)
(Rep. Rogers, R-Kentucky)
The Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of H.R. 1, making appropriations for the Department of Defense and the other departments and agencies of the Government for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2011, and for other purposes. As stated previously, the Administration is committed to cutting spending and reducing the deficit so that current Government spending does not add to the debt, and has put forward a plan to do just that. However, the Administration does not support deep cuts that will undermine our ability to out-educate, out-build, and out-innovate the rest of the world. The unbalanced bill would undermine the Nation's economic recovery and its ability to succeed in a complex global environment. If the President is presented with a bill that undermines critical priorities or national security through funding levels or restrictions, contains earmarks, or curtails the drivers of long-term economic growth and job creation while continuing to burden future generations with deficits, the President will veto the bill.
The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of the Inouye substitute amendment 149, which responds to the Administration's call to meet the House half-way in achieving the $102 billion in reductions that advocates for H.R. 1 have proposed. The amendment is a fair compromise and, unlike H.R. 1, does not undermine the Nation's economic recovery and long-term growth.
The Administration will continue to work with the Congress to reduce spending and do so in a manner that reflects sound economic policy, protects key investments, and allows critical Government functions to operate without interruption for the remainder of the fiscal year underway.
