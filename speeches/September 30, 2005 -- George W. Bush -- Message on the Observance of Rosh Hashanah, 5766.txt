    I send greetings to all those observing Rosh Hashanah.
On this holy occasion, Jews around the world are called by the sound of the Shofar to gather in celebration of the beginning of the New Year and the creation of all life. For the Jewish people, this marks the beginning of the Days of Awe, a special time to reflect on the past year and welcome the year to come.
It is also a time to reflect on the history of the Jewish people, from the days of Abraham to the present, and remember God's faithfulness to them. This year, we mark the completion of an especially joyous occasion, the 350th year of Jewish life in America. Throughout America's history, Jewish Americans have strengthened and enriched the character of our Nation.
Laura and I send our best wishes for a blessed Rosh Hashanah. L'shanah tovah.
