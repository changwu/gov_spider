    HOUSTON, Texas — For the third year in a row, Presidential Candidate Ted Cruz has won the Values Voter Summit Straw Poll. The Values Voter annual summit is the largest gathering of evangelical voters from across the country. The event is hosted by Family Research Council. This year, the annual summit to discuss issues important to Christians was held at the Omni Shoreham in Washington, DC. Attendees heard from some of America's foremost Christian leaders, including Tony Perkins, the President of Family Research Council, as well as several candidates for president.
"I am humbled and honored to have the support of so many Christian Conservatives," said Ted Cruz. "But in order for our values to truly be represented in the White House, it's going to take millions of Christians encouraging each other to get involved and, most importantly, to vote."
The Values Voter Summit Straw Poll is considered to be a reliable indicator of which candidate for president has the most support from evangelical voters. These voters make up a significant portion of early-state voter turnout in Iowa and South Carolina, as well as the Southern states that make up the so-called "SEC primary" on March 1st.
Cruz's support from attendees at the Values Voter Summit nearly doubled that of the closest contender:
1. Cruz — 35%
2. Carson — 18%
3. Huckabee — 14%
4. Rubio — 13%
5. Trump — 5%
This result comes off Cruz's domination of the FreedomWorks Straw poll earlier in the month — a strong sign of who Tea Party voters support — where he received 41%, better than triple that of his closest competitor.
