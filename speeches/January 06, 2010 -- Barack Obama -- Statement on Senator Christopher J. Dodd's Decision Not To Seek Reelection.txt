    From his time as a young Peace Corps volunteer to his five terms in the United States Senate, Chris Dodd has devoted his life to public service. Over the years, he has worked tirelessly to improve the lives of our children and families, support good jobs for hard-working Americans, and keep our Nation strong and prosperous, building a remarkable record of achievement for the people of Connecticut and our country. While his work in the Senate is not yet finished, his leadership in that institution will be missed.
Michelle and I extend our thanks to Senator Dodd for his service to our Nation and offer our best wishes for the future to him and his family.
