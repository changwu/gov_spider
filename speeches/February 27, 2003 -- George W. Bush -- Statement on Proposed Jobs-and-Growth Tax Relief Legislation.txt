    I commend Senators Nickles and Miller and Chairman Thomas for their leadership in introducing my jobs-and-growth package, which will put money back into the hands of millions of Americans and increase investment and job opportunities.
Today's action demonstrates bipartisan commitment to promoting economic growth and creating jobs. The plan will cut taxes for everyone across the board, eliminate the unfair double taxation of dividends, increase small-business investment incentives, help families with children, and end the penalty paid by working couples.
I look forward to continuing to work with Chairman Thomas, Chairman Grassley, and members of both parties who share my vision for strengthening America's economic recovery and ensuring that every individual who wants a job is able to find one.
