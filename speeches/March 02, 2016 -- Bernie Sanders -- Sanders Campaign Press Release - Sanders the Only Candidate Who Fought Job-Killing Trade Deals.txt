    LANSING, Mich. â€“ Bernie Sanders' campaign released a new 30-second spot in Michigan today, touting his record as the only candidate for president "who has consistently fought trade deals that ship Michigan jobs overseas."
"Sanders opposed the disastrous NAFTA trade deal. Opposed special trade status with China. Now he's opposing the Trans-Pacific trade deal, while others waffle," the narrator says.
Hillary Clinton supported the North American Free Trade Agreement, which led to the loss of 850,000 jobs, including 43,000 jobs in Michigan. She claimed that permanent normal trade relations with China, which led to the loss of 3.2 million American jobs and 80,000 Michigan jobs, would be good for American workers. And the former secretary of state called the Trans-Pacific Partnership the "gold standard in trade agreements." Clinton declined to take a stand against the deal when it mattered most in the summer of 2015.
In Michigan over the past 15 years, 33 percent of manufacturing jobs have disappeared. Half of Detroit's auto workforce lost their jobs between 1998 and 2011. "Bernie is fighting hundreds of thousands of new job losses," the ad concludes.
Sanders will hold a rally tonight in Michigan where voters will head to the polls in a week. Thursday morning he will hold a news conference with workers personally affected by trade agreements to discuss their disastrous impact.
