    Clarence Avant was a legend. He was always focused on who he could bring to the table and who he could lift up. From the music industry to the civil rights movement, he brought people together so we could all move forward.
Often operating behind the scenes, Clarence, affectionately called "the Godfather of Black Music", spent his career sharing advice, making connections, and widening the path for generations of others to follow. He mentored and molded hundreds of legendary Black artists, athletes, and producers, whose signature styles and songs of triumph and tragedy continue to move millions across our nation and throughout the world.
Clarence supported community leaders through some of the toughest moments of the civil rights movement, and helped open doors for elected officials – from those at city hall and in the halls of Congress, to the White House.
He was generous, he was funny, and he was full of heart.
He was my friend.
Today, Doug and my prayers are with Nicole, Alex, Ted, and all those who loved him.
