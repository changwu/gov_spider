Whereas the American people remember with deepest admiration and gratitude the achievements of Thomas Alva Edison and his contributions to the modern way of living; and
Whereas, when we contemplate the birth of Edison on February 11, 1847, in a small community in Erie County, Ohio, we are inspired with the faith that our country will be blessed in every generation with young people of practical minds and breadth of vision, resourceful in utilizing the forces of nature for the benefit of mankind; and
Whereas a joint resolution of July 17, 1941, provides as follows:
"Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the President of the United States is hereby authorized and requested to issue a proclamation designating February 11, 1942, as Thomas Alva Edison Day and calling upon officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on said date and inviting the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches, or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies";
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate February 11, 1942, as Thomas Alva Edison Day, and I call upon the officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that date; I also invite the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches, or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies.
