    I am very pleased to learn that Independent Counsel Ralph Lancaster has concluded his investigation. Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman has for many years served our Nation with selfless dedication and extraordinary talent. She did not deserve what she has had to endure over the past many months. As I said at the start of this inquiry, nearly 2 years ago, Secretary Herman did nothing wrong. But throughout it all, she was never deterred from her mission: making life better for America's working families. I am proud to call her my friend, and I am honored that she has been willing to work in this administration on behalf of working people everywhere.
