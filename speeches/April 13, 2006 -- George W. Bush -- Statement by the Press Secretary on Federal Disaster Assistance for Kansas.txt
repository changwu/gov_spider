    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Kansas and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms, tornadoes, and straight line winds during the period of March 12-13, 2006.
Federal funding is available to State and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms, tornadoes, and straight line winds in the counties of Douglas and Wyandotte.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
R. David Paulison, Acting Director, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Thomas J. Costello as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The Agency said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the State and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
