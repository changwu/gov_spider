    I am pleased to send greetings and best wishes to those across the globe who are celebrating Eid al-Fitr.
For Muslims, the Eid is a festive occasion, celebrating service rendered to God during the holy month of Ramadan. During this special time, it is also a tradition to help those in need. Performing acts of charity remains a tradition common across many faiths, challenging each of us to make a positive difference in the lives of others through generosity, kindness, and compassion.
Today, due to drought and dictatorship, millions of people in Afghanistan are hungry and face the prospect of a harsh winter. Americans are working with many nations to provide food, medicine, and clothing to the people of Afghanistan. We resolve to work in partnership with other nations to assist with rebuilding their nation.
The teachings of many faiths share much in common. And people of many faiths are united in our commitments to love our families, to protect our children, and to build a more peaceful world. In the coming year, let us resolve to seize opportunities to work together in a spirit of friendship and cooperation. Through our combined efforts, we can end terrorism and rid our civilization of the damaging effects of hatred and intolerance, ultimately achieving a brighter future for all.
Laura and I wish Muslims around the world a joyous Eid, and peace, health, and prosperity in the year ahead.
