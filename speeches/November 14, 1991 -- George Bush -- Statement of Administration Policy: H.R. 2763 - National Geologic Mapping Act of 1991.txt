    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 11/15/91)(House)(Rahall (D) West Virginia and 44 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2763. The bill is unnecessary and would duplicate existing authority. Furthermore, the bill would require the development of a costly national archive of standardized geologic maps.
