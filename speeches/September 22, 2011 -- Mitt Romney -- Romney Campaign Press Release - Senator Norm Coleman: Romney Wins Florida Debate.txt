    Former Minnesota Senator Norm Coleman issued the following statement on tonight's Orlando debate:
"Mitt Romney stood out tonight as the only candidate prepared to lead our country at home during a time of economic strife and abroad during a time of great uncertainty. Mitt is clearly head and shoulders above the rest of the field when it comes to understanding the free market and what it will take to get our economy on track again. Whether it is his twenty-five years of experience working in business or his record turning around Massachusetts' economy, Mitt Romney has a lifetime spent creating jobs and working in the real economy. That experience was on display tonight."
