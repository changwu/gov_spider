FLOTUS 5/9 Travel Pool Report #1: FLOTUS arrival at Presidential Palace + comments on Ukraine meeting
Good morning from Slovakia's presidential palace.
FLOTUS arrived in the Great Hall at 11:28 with Slovakia's President Zuzana Caputova, and the two posed for photos.
FLOTUS then sat down at a table and took out a piece of White House stationary from her purse and copied a note into a large guest book.
Here is the text of her note:
"During my time in this beautiful country, I have seen firsthand the shared values that united Slovakia and the United States as friend, partners, and Allies. This includes our common devotion to helping those most in need. We stand with Slovakia as it stands with the people of Ukraine."
The two women then moved into the receiving room for tea.
Pool had a brief spray and asked FLOTUS two questions:
Q: What are you planning to discuss today?
FLOTUS: "We're talking about the support that the United States has for the people of Slovakia and Ukraine and how we stand together in helping the Ukrainian people."
Q: What did you tell POTUS yesterday after you visited Ukraine
FLOTUS: "I said just how much I saw the need to support the people of Ukraine and you know, you know, the horrors and the brutality that the people I had met had experienced."
Pool is now holding downstairs at the palace.
