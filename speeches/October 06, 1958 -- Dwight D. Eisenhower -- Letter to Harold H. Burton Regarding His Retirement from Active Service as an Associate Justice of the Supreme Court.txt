    [ Released October 6, 1958. Dated September 23, 1958 ]
Dear Mr. Justice:
It is with great regret that I have read your notice of retirement on Monday, October 13, 1958, as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
I share, with millions of our citizens, the conviction that, as a member of the Court, you served with high distinction and great dedication to the principles under which we live and the changing conditions of the world today. The decisions of the Court are helping to shape--as they have in the past--the destiny of our country. This realization has imposed upon you vital responsibilities, which I know you have discharged seriously and conscientiously. Your work on the Supreme Court was, of course, but a continuation of your earlier years of devoted and dedicated public service. Our country is indebted to you.
I trust that with the leisure your retirement will bring, your health will greatly improve.
Mrs. Eisenhower joins me in best wishes to you and Mrs. Burton, and in expressions of our feelings of personal friendship for you both.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
