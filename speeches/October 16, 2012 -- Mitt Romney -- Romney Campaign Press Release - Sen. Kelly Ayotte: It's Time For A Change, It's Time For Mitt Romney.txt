    New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte made the following statement on tonight's second presidential debate:
"Mitt Romney left the debate stage with another win tonight because he told voters in clear, straightforward terms how he will create 12 million jobs, deliver a real recovery and make this an American Century. In contrast, President Obama was unable to articulate how the next four years will be any better than the last â€” because he has no record to run on and no plan for the future. Americans across the country know that we can't continue down this path of economic stagnation and weak leadership on the world stage. It's time for a change, and the candidate who will bring it is Mitt Romney."
