    To the Senate of the United States:
I am transmitting, for the Senate's advice and consent to ratification, the Consular Convention between the United States of America and the Republic of Tunisia signed at Tunis on May 12, 1988. I am also transmitting, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the convention.
The signing of this convention is a significant step in the process of enhancing and broadening the relationship between the United States and the Republic of Tunisia. Consular relations between the two countries currently are not addressed by a bilateral agreement. The convention establishes clear obligations with respect to matters such as notification of consular officers of the arrest and detention of the nationals of their countries and protection of the rights and interests of the nationals of their countries.
The people of the United States and Tunisia have a tradition of friendship and cooperation. I welcome the opportunity through this consular convention to promote further the good relations between the two countries. I recommend the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the convention and give its advice and consent to ratification.
