    We welcome the announcement by the government of the Republic of Korea to expand its assistance to the Government of Afghanistan and its people by establishing a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT), in addition to the Medical and Vocational Training Team that South Korea is already operating. This is an important contribution to the international effort in Afghanistan and to fostering reconstruction and stability in the region. The U.S. will continue to work closely in partnership with Korea as we support the people and government of Afghanistan.
