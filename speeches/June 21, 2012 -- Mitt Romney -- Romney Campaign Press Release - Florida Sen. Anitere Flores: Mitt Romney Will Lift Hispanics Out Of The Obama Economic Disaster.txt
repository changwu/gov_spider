    Florida State Senator Anitere Flores made the following statement on Mitt Romney's remarks at NALEO:
"By failing to make the economy and jobs his top priority, President Obama has broken his promise to the Hispanic community. With the threat of Obamacare, higher taxes, and more red tape lingering over an already abysmal climate for small businesses to operate in, it's no wonder Hispanics are among the hardest hit by the President's policies. We need new leadership in Washington who will help give Hispanics the tools needed to start businesses, find jobs, and give our children the chance to live a better life. Mitt Romney will turn the economy around, get jobs growing again, and help lift the Hispanic community out of the depths of President Obama's economic disaster."
