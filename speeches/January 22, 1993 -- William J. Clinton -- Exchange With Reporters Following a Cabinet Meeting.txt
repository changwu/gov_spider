    Withdrawal of Nomination for Attorney General
Q. Mr. President, how difficult was the Zoe Baird decision? How agonizing was it for you?
The President. I'm sad about it. But it wasn't agonizing. I'm sad about it, and I take full responsibility, as I said in my statement, for the way the evaluation was done. I still have a very high regard for her. She is an extraordinary person. And I feel very badly about it, but I'm responsible for it, and I'm going to start this afternoon looking for an Attorney General. And I have the process set up, and we're going to begin as soon as the lunch hour is over, working on the future. And that's what I intend to focus on.
Q. will it be a woman?
The President. I have nothing else to say. I'm going to start this afternoon. Thanks.
