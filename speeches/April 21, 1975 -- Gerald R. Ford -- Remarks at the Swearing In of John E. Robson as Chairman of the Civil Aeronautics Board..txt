    Members of the Cabinet, Members of Congress, distinguished guests:
It is a great privilege and pleasure for me to participate in the swearing in of John Robson as Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board.
It is my judgment that the American commercial airline industry is one of the very best. It has got fine people running it, managing it. It has got outstanding equipment and fine employees. It performs, in my judgment, a very useful function, a very vital part of our transportation system.
It seems to me, however, that as we try to achieve the most efficient commercial airline service in this country at the lowest possible cost, we do have to have an organization such as the CAB to look after such mundane matters as fares, routes, competition, and of course, the CAB must not neglect the environment, energy, and a raft of other important matters that are in the public interest.
In John Robson I think we will have a Chairman who will do an outstanding job. His experience in the field of transportation goes back to the days when the Department of Transportation was first established, first as General Counsel and secondly as Under Secretary, an outstanding lawyer, a person who has had experience in Government as well as in private practice.
John, it is a privilege and a pleasure for me to be here on this occasion to participate in your swearing in, and at this point, may I ask Justice Rehnquist to actually perform the function of making you a member, first, and following that, I will designate you officially as Chairman of the CAB.
[At this point, William H. Rehnquist, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, administered the oath of office. Following remarks by Mr. Robson, the President resumed speaking.]
Thank you all for coming. We are very grateful. I see around here a good many old friends. And it is nice to see you. I am sure this occasion will be one that will be the beginning of a new era as far as the CAB is concerned.
Congratulations again, John.
