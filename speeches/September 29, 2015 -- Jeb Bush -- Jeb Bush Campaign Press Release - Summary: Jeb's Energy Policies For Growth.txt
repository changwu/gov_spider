    Too many families are having trouble making ends meet. Jeb Bush has an energy plan to create millions of jobs, increase wages and lower energy costs:
Let the US Export Oil and Natural Gas
Lift the ban on exporting American crude oil. Remove restrictions on exporting natural gas. Lifting the ban would create a million new manufacturing jobs and rapidly reduce gasoline prices.
Give More Deference to States That Want to Drill
The Obama Administration is preventing willing states, such as Alaska and Virginia, from fully developing energy resources. Hillary Clinton has taken an even more extreme position: She would flatly prohibit drilling off Alaska's north coast. Washington should listen to states and tribes, deferring more often to what they want for their citizens.
Approve the Keystone XL Pipeline
President Obama and Hillary Clinton politicized the government permitting process by opposing the Keystone XL pipeline. Building it would increase economic growth by over $3 billion and support 42,000 jobs while the pipeline is under construction.
Reduce Overregulation
Overregulation discourages domestic energy production and increases gas, heating and electricity costs on families. The Obama Administration's rules often usurp state and tribal authorities and go beyond what is necessary to protect quality of life and the environment. Some, such as President Obama's Carbon Rule, need to be stopped in their tracks.
Affordable Energy Can Help All Americans Rise
Jeb will be announcing other energy policies in the coming months, but taken together, these policies will unleash domestic energy production, creating millions of jobs, higher wages and cheaper gas and electricity. This plan will help us quickly achieve, and sustain, 4% economic growth.
