  A Proclamation

Whereas trade among the nations of the world raises the standards of living of people everywhere and strengthens the bonds of common interest among them; and
Whereas the expansion of export and import trade of the United States adds strength to our domestic economy by helping to maintain production and employment at high levels and by providing diversity of products to American consumers; and
Whereas this Government is striving to expand international trade through the reduction of tariffs and of other barriers to trade and the elimination of discriminatory treatment of goods in international commerce:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 21, 1950, as World Trade Week; and I request the appropriate officials of the Federal Government and of the several States, Territories, possessions, and municipalities of the United States to cooperate in the observance of that week.
I also urge business, labor, agricultural, educational, and civic groups, as well as the people of the United States generally, to observe World Trade Week with gatherings, discussions, exhibits, ceremonies, and other appropriate activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done at the City of Washington this 6th day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fourth.

HARRY S. TRUMAN
