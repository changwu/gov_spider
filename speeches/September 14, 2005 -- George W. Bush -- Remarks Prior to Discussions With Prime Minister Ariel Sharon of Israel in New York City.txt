    President Bush. Mr. Prime Minister, thank you. I'm looking forward to our meeting. I've said several times publicly that I am inspired by your courageous decision to give peace a chance. And I know it was hard, but I admire your courage. And I look forward to talking to you about how we can get on the roadmap.
One thing is essential, and the world must hear, that now is the time for Palestinians to come together and establish a Government that will be peaceful with Israel, and that Gaza is a good chance to start. And I know that the Israeli Government wants to see that happen as well.
The world needs to help the Palestinians; the Arab neighbors need to help the Palestinians develop an economy. Now is the time for people to step up. It's an opportunity that was created by a bold decision, and I want to work together to see the vision of peace come to be.
So, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for being here.
Prime Minister Sharon. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm glad to meet with you again, and I'm glad that we are working together in order to achieve peace in our region.
President Bush. Thank you.
