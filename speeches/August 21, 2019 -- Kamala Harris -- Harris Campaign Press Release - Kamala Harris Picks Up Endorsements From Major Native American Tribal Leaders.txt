    On Heels of LaMere Native American Presidential Forum, Native Leaders Back Harris
On the heels of her participation in Frank LaMere's Native American Presidential Forum and a career-long track record of partnership with Native communities, Senator Kamala Harris earned the endorsements of Chairman Mark Macarro of the Pechanga Band of Luise√±o Indians and Chairman Kenneth Kahn of the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians.
Macarro has served as the southern California tribe's duly elected chairman for nearly 25 years. He also serves in the National Congress of American Indians. Kahn was elected Tribal Chairman in April 2016 after serving on the Business Committee since March 2003. He also serves on the board of the Native American Rights Fund
"I know that under a Harris administration, Indian country will again be valued," said Chairman Macarro. "Senator Harris has engaged California's tribes in many roles, and her door was always open to us on a wide range of issues. We need a president that respects Native traditions and values -- one who gets tribal sovereignty, recognizes our history, and will look forward with us. Kamala Harris is that leader and will be that president."
"Today, I am proud to endorse Kamala Harris for president," said Chairman Kahn. "I have had the honor and pleasure of working with Kamala as DA, Attorney General, and as our home-state Senator. In each role, she has showed a willingness to dig into the meat of the issues and roll up her sleeves to get things done. Indian Country needs more of that tenacity," said Chairman Kenneth Kahn of the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians."
"I'm proud to earn the endorsement of Mark Macarro and Kenneth Kahn," said Senator Harris. "As President, I will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our Native communities to solve the challenges they face and ensure our nation respects the sovereignty of Native tribes."
