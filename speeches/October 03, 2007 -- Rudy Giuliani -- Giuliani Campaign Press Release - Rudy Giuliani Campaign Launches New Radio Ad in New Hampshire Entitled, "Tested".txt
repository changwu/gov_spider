RUDY: "I've been tested in a way in which the American people can look to me. They're not going to find perfection, but they're gonna find somebody who's dealt with crisis almost on a regular basis and has had results, results people thought were impossible."
VO: Listen. That's Rudy Giuliani. A leader with clearly defined goals.
RUDY: "There are two big things at stake for the country… what direction we go in on terrorism and what direction we go in with regard to our domestic economy. If you elect me we're on offense against terrorism. And I want us to be on the offense for a growth economy in which we lower taxes, reduce the size of government… that's how you create growth. "
VO: Principle. Experience. Results. That's Rudy.
RUDY: "We laid out a very, very specific set of goals that we want to achieve because I want people to look at those and say if I agree with most of them, then this is a person who can bring them about. And if they disagree with it, they should vote against me, because I am going to bring it about.
VO: Rudy Giuliani. The Republican that Democrats just don't want to run against.
VO: Paid for by the Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee, Incorporated. joinudy2008.com
RUDY: I'm Rudy Giuliani and I approve this message.
