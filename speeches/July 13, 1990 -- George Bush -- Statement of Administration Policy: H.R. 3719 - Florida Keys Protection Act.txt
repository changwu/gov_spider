    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Fascell (D) Florida and 32 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 3719 but may seek a Senate amendment. The Administration does not oppose the statutory designation of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary because preliminary Commerce Department studies support such a designation. However, the Administration would oppose any future statutory designation of marine sanctuaries. The current designation process ensures that adequate environmental assessments are made and all points of view are considered.
The Administration may seek a Senate amendment to clarify that the President can direct the opening of areas within the Sanctuary for development if national security so requires. H.R. 3719 prohibits mineral, oil, and gas development within the boundaries of the Sanctuary. The President recently decided to limit oil and gas activity in South Florida and begin cancellation of existing leases off Florida. The President, however, stated that, "all decisions regarding OCS [Outer Continental Shelf] development are subject to a national security exemption."
