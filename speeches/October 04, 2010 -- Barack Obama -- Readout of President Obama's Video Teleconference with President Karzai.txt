    President Obama spoke with President Karzai today via video teleconference. The two leaders spoke for thirty minutes and discussed a number of topics, including the strategic vision for long term U.S.-Afghan relations, the recent Afghan parliamentary elections, and regional relations. Secretary Clinton, Secretary Gates, Deputy National Security Advisor Tom Donilon, Chief of Staff Pete Rouse, and Lieutenant General (retired) Doug Lute participated from the White House and Ambassador Karl Eikenberry and General David Petraeus participated from Kabul. The two leaders agreed that they should continue routine engagements to refine a common vision and to align our efforts to support President Karzai’s goal of completing transition to Afghan lead security responsibility by 2014. In doing so, both leaders agreed that they would strive to conclude the U.S.-Afghan Strategic Partnership Declaration by year’s end and would support two Afghanistan-related themes at the NATO Summit in Lisbon in November: transition to Afghan lead and an enduring commitment to the Afghan people.
