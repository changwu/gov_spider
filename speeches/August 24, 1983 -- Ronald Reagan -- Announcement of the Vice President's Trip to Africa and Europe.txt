    At the request of the President, the Vice President, accompanied by Mrs. Bush, will visit Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary, and Austria between September 11 and September 21.
The Vice President's visit to the countries of north Africa will reaffirm our long friendships with Tunisia and Morocco and will strengthen our relations with Algeria, an important nonaligned country. The Vice President's visits to Yugoslavia and Austria underscore the important international role of these countries and U.S. support for Austria's neutrality and respect for Yugoslavia's independence and nonalignment. Finally, the Vice President's visits to two important Eastern European countries underscore the United States continued willingness to maintain dialog with the East and the continuing U.S. policy of differentiation toward the countries of Eastern Europe.
