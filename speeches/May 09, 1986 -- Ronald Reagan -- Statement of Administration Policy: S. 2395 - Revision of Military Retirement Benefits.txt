    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Goldwater (R) AZ)
The Administration continues to oppose any change in military retirement benefits. However, legislative resolution of this issue is necessary to avoid reductions in our military force that otherwise would take effect under current law beginning June 1, 1986.
