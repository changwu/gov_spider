    President Bush will welcome Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende to the White House on June 5, 2008. As a founding member of NATO, the Netherlands stands among America's closest allies and shares a deep-rooted commitment to a strong transatlantic partnership. The President looks forward to discussing with the Prime Minister their shared commitment to the fight against terrorism and their goals of strengthening security and democracy in Afghanistan, increasing international pressure on Iran to prevent Iran from obtaining the ability to build nuclear weapons, consolidating democracy and stability in the Balkans, reducing poverty and disease in Africa, and promoting trade and prosperity between our two countries.
