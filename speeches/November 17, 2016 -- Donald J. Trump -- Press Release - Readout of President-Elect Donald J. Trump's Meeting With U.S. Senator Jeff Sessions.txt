    (New York, NY) â€“ President-elect Donald J. Trump met yesterday with U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions in his office in New York.
While nothing has been finalized and he is still talking with others as he forms his cabinet, the President-elect has been unbelievably impressed with Senator Sessions and his phenomenal record as Alabama's Attorney General and U.S. Attorney. It is no wonder the people of Alabama re-elected him without opposition.
