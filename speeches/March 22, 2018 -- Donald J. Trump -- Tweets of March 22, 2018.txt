Got $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border rest will be forthcoming. Most importantly got $700 Billion to rebuild our Military $716 Billion next year...most ever.

Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually he is weak both mentally and physically and yet he threatens me for the second time with physical assault. He doesn't know me but he would go down fast and hard crying all the way. Don't threaten people Joe!Retweets: 75713Favorites: 258162

Remember when they were saying during the campaign that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary's large and highly sophisticated staff. Well not saying that anymore!Retweets: 20355Favorites: 94790

As a candidate I pledged that if elected I would use every lawful tool to combat unfair trade protect American workers and defend our national security. Today we took another critical step to fulfill that commitment. https://t.co/7NBI0Dibmx https://t.co/nmzqos3BUARetweets: 15736Favorites: 67717
