    I WAS shocked and saddened to learn of the tragic death of Representative Jerry Litton, his wife, and their two children.
During the time that I knew Jerry Litton, I considered him to be a valued colleague and an effective Representative of his constituents.
Mrs. Ford joins me in expressing profound sympathy to lorry Litton's relatives and friends.
