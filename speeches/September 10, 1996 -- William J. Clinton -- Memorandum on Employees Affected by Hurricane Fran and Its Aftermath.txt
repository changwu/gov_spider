    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies 
Subject: Excused Absence for Employees Affected by Hurricane Fran and its Aftermath
I am deeply concerned about the devastating losses caused by Hurricane Fran and the impact on the well-being and livelihood of our fellow Americans who have been affected by this disaster. Elements of the Federal Government have been mobilized to respond to this disaster.
As part of this effort, I request heads of executive departments and agencies who have Federal civilian employees in the areas designated as disaster areas because of the effects of Hurricane Fran and its aftermath to use their discretion to excuse from duty, without charge to leave or loss of pay, any such employee who is faced with a personal emergency because of this storm and who can be spared from his or her usual responsibilities. This policy should also be applied to any employee who is needed for emergency law enforcement, relief, or cleanup efforts authorized by Federal, State, or local officials having jurisdiction.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
