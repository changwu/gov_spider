    I am pleased to sign into law S. 1678, amendments to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. This bill culminates 2 long years of hard work by the chairmen of the Senate and House Agriculture Committees, Senator Talmadge and Representative Foley. The bill's sponsor, Senator Leahy, Senator Lugar, and Representatives de la Garza and Fithian have pursued this effort with dedication and care.
These amendments make numerous, important revisions to the FIFRA, most of which were sought and supported by the Environmental Protection Agency on behalf of the administration. With these amendments, the important task of registering pesticides may move forward in a more streamlined and efficient manner, while providing a sound basis for protection of public health and the environment. I am also pleased that vital health and safety information will once again be made available for public use and scrutiny.
S. 1678 is a fine example of cooperation between the Congress and the executive branch in making regulatory programs meet their underlying purposes without imposing overly bureaucratic, unduly costly, or unnecessary requirements. This act represents a step forward in the twin causes of better protection of the environment and reform of our regulatory processes.
