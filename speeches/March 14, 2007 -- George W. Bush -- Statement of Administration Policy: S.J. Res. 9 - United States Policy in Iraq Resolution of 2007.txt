    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Sen. Reid (D) Nevada and 41 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of S.J. Res. 9. Success in Iraq is critical to our national security and to success in the War on Terror. S.J. Res. 9 threatens that success by placing freedom and democracy in Iraq at grave risk and emboldening our enemies. It infringes upon the constitutional authority of the President as Commander in Chief by imposing an artificial timeline to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq, regardless of the conditions on the ground or the consequences of defeat. The legislation would hobble American commanders in the field and substantially endanger America's strategic objective of a unified federal democratic Iraq that can govern, defend, and sustain itself and be an ally in the war on terror. If S.J. Res. 9 were presented to the President, he would veto the bill.
