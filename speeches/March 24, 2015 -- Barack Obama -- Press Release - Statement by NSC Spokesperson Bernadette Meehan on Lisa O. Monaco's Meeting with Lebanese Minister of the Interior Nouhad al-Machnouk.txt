    This afternoon, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Lisa Monaco met with Lebanese Minister of the Interior Nouhad Al-Machnouk to discuss the U.S.-Lebanon partnership and regional security concerns, including the international effort to degrade and defeat ISIL. Ms. Monaco commended the performance of the Internal Security Forces and the Lebanese Armed Forces in safeguarding Lebanon's security and sovereignty in the midst of ongoing regional challenges and reiterated the need for all Lebanese parties to implement the policy of dissociation, including from the Syrian conflict. Lebanon's security forces alone have the legitimacy and responsibility to defend Lebanon's borders and safeguard its citizens, and are accountable to all Lebanese citizens. Ms. Monaco and Minister Machnouk also agreed on the need for sustained international support to aid Syrian refugees and host communities in Lebanon. Ms. Monaco expressed her hope that Lebanon's parliament will take steps to elect a president of the Lebanese Republic in accordance with the constitution.
