    Today's actions in the House Resources Committee and in the House Energy and Commerce Committee represent important steps toward implementing a comprehensive and balanced energy policy. I am pleased that the committees are acting swiftly to increase energy efficiency, expand use of renewables, and open a small portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for environmentally responsible exploration.
For too long America has lacked a comprehensive national energy policy. My administration has proposed a plan that will reduce America's reliance on foreign oil through increased conservation and efficiency, improved infrastructure, and increased exploration. I commend the House committees for moving forward on these goals.
