    Vice President Joe Biden spoke today with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko about the situation in Ukraine. President Poroshenko noted that Ukrainian humanitarian assistance had already been delivered to the International Committee for the Red Cross, but that safe passage had still not been secured from the separatists for the delivery of Russian aid. The two leaders agreed that Russia's sending military columns across the border into Ukraine and its continued provision of advanced weapons to the separatists was inconsistent with any desire to improve the humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine. Both leaders reaffirmed their support for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis and called on Russia to enter into good faith negotiations.
