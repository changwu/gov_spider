    Years after natural disasters struck the Bay area and south Florida, ghost towns remain and local communities continue to suffer. We are working today to overcome those problems, when they have become far more difficult and expensive to address. In Los Angeles and Santa Monica, we are proposing to begin the restoration of these ghost towns now, before it is too late.
