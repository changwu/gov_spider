    Bennet in Iowa: "We Need to Fix Broken Politics" to Achieve Progress
CEDAR RAPIDS — Michael Bennet spoke tonight at the Iowa Democratic Party's Hall of Fame Celebration, where he made clear that the only way to achieve progress on the pressing issues facing our nation — from healthcare to climate change to economic inequality — is to fix our broken politics in Washington and build a broad constituency for change.
"[There is similarity between] what working people all over America want for our kids and grandkids. But to do any of it, we are going to need to fix the broken politics in Washington, DC," said Bennet. "To overcome this, we need to build a broad-based agenda for America that unifies our country."
Michael announced his candidacy for President of the United States less than six weeks ago and has already qualified for the first Democratic presidential debates and raised more than $2 million. In the past two weeks, he has also announced staff in Iowa and South Carolina, and laid the groundwork for a sustainable, long-term campaign.
Michael is running for president to build opportunity for every American and restore integrity to our government. Following his appointment to the United States Senate in 2009, Michael won two competitive races in 2010 and 2016, winning areas Donald Trump won and receiving the most votes in Colorado history in 2016. Prior to this, Michael spent a lifetime outside of politics. He turned around failing businesses in the private sector and improved outcomes for kids as Superintendent of the Denver Public Schools — a district with 85,000 students and more than a $1 billion budget.
