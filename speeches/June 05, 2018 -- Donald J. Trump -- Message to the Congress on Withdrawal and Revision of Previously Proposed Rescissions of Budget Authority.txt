In accordance with section 1014(c) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 685(c)), I am withdrawing four previously proposed rescissions and reporting revisions to six rescissions previously transmitted to the Congress.
The withdrawals are for the Federal Highway Administration Miscellaneous Appropriations and Miscellaneous Highway Trust Funds accounts of the Department of Transportation, the Environmental Programs and Management account of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the International Disaster Assistance account of the United States Agency for International Development. The six revised rescissions, totaling $896 million, affect the programs of the Departments of Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, and the Treasury, as well as the Corporation for National and Community Service.
The details of the rescission withdrawals and each revised rescission are contained in the attached reports.
