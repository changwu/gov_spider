    This morning, National Security Advisor Tom Donilon met at United Nations Headquarters with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. During their discussion, they stressed the acute urgency of the situation in the Horn of Africa and discussed focused ways to generate sufficient international contributions and ensure that food and other assistance reaches people in need as quickly as possible, particularly in Somalia. Mr. Donilon stressed the critical role of UN agencies like the World Food Program (WFP) and UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) in responding to this crisis, and pledged U.S. support. They also discussed the important work the U.S. and UN are doing in Sudan, Libya, and the broader Middle East. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice also attended the meeting.
