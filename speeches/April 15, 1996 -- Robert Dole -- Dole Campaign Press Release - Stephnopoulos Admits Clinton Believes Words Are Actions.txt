    In a Time magazine article released today, George Stephanopoulos, one of Bill Clinton's closest advisors, admits that Clinton believes that words are actions. (Time Magazine, 4/22/96) In response, Dole National Campaign Manager Scott Reed said:
"I commend George Stephanopoulos for giving the American people such a profoundly accurate and honest evaluation of Bill Clinton's inability to differentiate between words and actions. Stephanopoulos' rare moment of candor is a refreshing change from the normal attempts of the White House to blur the line between Clinton's rhetoric and his big-government policies.
"It is particularly timely that Stephanopoulos' honest assessment of the Clinton agenda should come to light on tax day -- the day Americans feel the personal impact of Clinton's liberal tax-and-spend record. If words really were actions, middle-class American families would be looking forward to a $ 500-per-child tax credit today instead of paying yet another installment on Clinton's $ 260 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in history,"
Time excerpt:
"Since the Republicans control Congress, Clinton has opted for an illusion of control, which suits him just fine. In this almost holographic approach, speeches are as important as substance and rhetoric becomes its own reality. For this President, says senior advisor George Stephanopoulos, 'words are actions.'" (4/22/96)
