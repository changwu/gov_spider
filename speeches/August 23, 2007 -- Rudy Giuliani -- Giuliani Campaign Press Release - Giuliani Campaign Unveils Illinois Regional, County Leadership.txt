    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced regional and county chairs in Illinois. Giuliani Campaign Manager Michael DuHaime officially opened the state campaign headquarters in Lisle earlier this week.
"Mayor Giuliani understands the importance of Illinois and he is clearly committed to winning the Republican primary here," said Illinois State Chairman Tom Cross. "We are excited to have such a strong team of regional and county chairs who will help communicate Rudy's message of strong leadership in Illinois and build on his growing momentum."
The regional and county chairs will work closely with Cross and Illinois Executive Director Kevin Artl. In addition to the regional and county chairs, the Giuliani campaign has six full-time staff working in Illinois.
