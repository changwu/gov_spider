    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Subject: Administrative Dismissal of Employees Affected by Hurricane Andrew
Our hearts go out to the thousands of Americans in South Florida and along the Gulf Coast who have suffered tragic losses at the hands of Hurricane Andrew. Many parts of the Federal Government have been mobilized to respond to this disaster and to begin a massive effort to recover from the ravages of this storm.
As part of this effort, I request heads of executive departments and agencies who have Federal civilian employees in the geographic areas designated as disaster areas because of Hurricane Andrew to use their discretion under OPM and agency regulations and where appropriate excuse from duty, without charge to leave or loss of pay, any such employee who is faced with a personal emergency because of the storm and who can be spared from his or her usual responsibilities. This policy should also be applied to any employee who is needed for emergency law enforcement, relief, or clean-up efforts authorized by Federal, State, or local officials having jurisdiction.
George Bush
