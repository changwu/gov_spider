Marco's first answer in tonight's Fox News debate outlined the stakes of this election. 
Rubio explicitly makes the case that he's a bridge candidate in opening statement: "If I'm our nominee, I will unite this party." #debate

We have to defeat Hillary Clinton.

Marco's right — Hillary cannot win this election. 
The blistering opening from @MarcoRubio against Hillary and Obama hit 90 in my focus group. Excellent start for him tonight. #GOPDebate

At @tedcruz watch party in Des Moines, a couple of heads nodding at @marcorubio, some applause after his answer.

She recently talked about appointing President Obama, who has habitually violated the Constitution, to the Supreme Court. 
Marco Rubio's reminder that Hillary Clinton might appoint President Obama to the Supreme Court is going to ve a powerful issue.

We need a nominee who will defeat her, and Marco is prepared to do it.
