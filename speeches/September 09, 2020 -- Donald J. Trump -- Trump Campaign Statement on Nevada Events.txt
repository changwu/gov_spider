    "Democrats are trying to keep President Trump from speaking to voters because they know the enthusiasm behind his re-election campaign cannot be matched by Joe Biden â€“ a historically weak candidate controlled by the radical left who could hold a campaign event in a broom closet. The President's uplifting message of American greatness resonates with people, while everyone knows that Biden is a tool of the radical left who would raise taxes and tank the incredible comeback that is already underway. President Trump will be traveling to Nevada on the dates planned. Additional details will be announced soon."
- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
