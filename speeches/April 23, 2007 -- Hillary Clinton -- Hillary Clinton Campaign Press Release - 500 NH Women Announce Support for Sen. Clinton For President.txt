    State Sen. DeVries to Co-Chair NH Women for Hillary
CONCORD, NH -- On the day before Equal Pay Day 2007, State Senator Betsi DeVries, who was the first woman firefighter in Manchester, today announced that she and over 500 New Hampshire women have decided to support Senator Hillary Clinton for President. Citing Clinton's leadership and experience, Devries is the first New Hampshire State Senator to endorse Senator Clinton and will serve as a Co-Chair of "Women for Hillary" in New Hampshire.
"Tomorrow is Equal Pay Day, and it is on days like tomorrow that women across this country need to stop and think about what is at stake in this election. Senator Clinton understands the challenges all women face and that's why so many incredible and diverse women are a part of this campaign," said Senator DeVries. "We need an experienced, strong and qualified leader who can get this country back on track. The person best equipped to take this job is absolutely Senator Clinton."
Senator DeVries was joined today by former Massachusetts Lt. Governor Evelyn Murphy, President of the WAGE Project, which is a national organization working to end wage discrimination against working women and women supporting Clinton from across the state. The more than 500 women represent the first women signing on in support of Senator Clinton. They include educators, seniors, healthcare workers, mothers, community activists and business leaders from 118 towns across the state and all 10 New Hampshire counties.
Today, the WAGE Project and the National Committee on Pay Equity announced the results of a nationwide survey of over 700 working women that provided valuable information about how working women of America see themselves treated and paid. In 2005, New Hampshire women made 71.1 cents for every dollar that a man made.

"Senator Clinton is leading the way to ensure there are strengthened laws that will guarantee working women and employers can achieve gender pay equity," said Murphy. "The health of the United States economy and the health of American families will be strengthened when women finally get paid like men. I commend Senator Clinton and her Paycheck Fairness Act that aims to address and correct these inequities."
The WAGE Project's report findings showed that 70 percent of women surveyed reported recent experiences with unfair, inequitable treatment and pay. Two thirds of them said gender bias and discrimination accounted for the inequities. In addition more than half of the women who reported inequitable treatment and pay took no action for fear of retaliation or convinced their chance to improve their situation was hopeless.
Senator Clinton's Paycheck Fairness Act builds on the promise of the Equal Pay Act and helps close the pay gap. The bill will take critical steps to empower women to negotiate for equal pay, to create strong incentives for employers to obey the laws that are in place, and to strengthen federal outreach and enforcement efforts. As a whole, the Paycheck Fairness Act will prevent, regulate and reduce pay discrimination for women across the country.
Senator DeVries' experience includes a 12-year career as the first woman to serve on the Manchester Fire Department. After her retirement in 2001, Betsi served three terms on the Manchester Board of Alderman. In addition to her elected positions, DeVries also serves on the board of directors of the Heritage United Way, and the Manchester YWCA, and is past president of the Manchester Area League of Women Voters. She lives in South Manchester with her husband Walter Becht. She has two step children and one three year old grandchild.
In 1986, Dr. Murphy was elected Lt. Governor and became the first woman in the state's 210 year history to hold constitutional office. Prior to that, despite the state's progressive image, no woman had ever been elected Governor, Lt. Governor, Secretary of State, Attorney General, Treasurer, Auditor, or US Senator in Massachusetts.
