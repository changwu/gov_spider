    Since January 2021, the Biden-Harris Administration has delivered a historic $5.8 billion cumulative investment in and support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).
As the President noted in his remarks during his visit to South Carolina State University in December and the Atlanta University Center Consortium in January, HBCU graduates are leaders in every field and several HBCU graduates serve in senior roles in the Biden-Harris Administration, including Vice President Kamala Harris – the first HBCU graduate ever to serve as Vice President of the United States – as well as Director of the White House Office of Public Engagement Cedric Richmond and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan.
A key part of the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to advancing equity includes supporting HBCUs.
Last week, Secretary Marcia Fudge hosted the third installment of the monthly White House briefing with HBCU students from 34 institutions across the country.
