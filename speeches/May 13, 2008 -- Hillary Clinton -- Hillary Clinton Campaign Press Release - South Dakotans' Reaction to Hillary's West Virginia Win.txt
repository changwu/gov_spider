    South Dakota for Hillary released the following statements from former State Senator and Public Utilities Commissioner Jim Burg and former State Senator and Democratic State Party Chair Judy Duhamel in reaction to Hillary's decisive victory in West Virginia tonight:
Former State Senator Public Utilities Commissioner Jim Burg:
"Throughout this campaign, Hillary has offered real solutions to the challenges we face: a struggling economy, skyrocketing energy prices and too many working Americans falling out of the middle class. West Virginians responded to her message, and I believe South Dakotans are also looking for a candidate with the experience to address the challenges working families are facing. In the past 90 years, no Democrat has won the White House without winning West Virginia, and Hillary's convincing victory there tonight suggests that she is the best candidate to take on the Republicans in November and start turning our country around on day one. Voters here in South Dakota deserve the opportunity to have their voices heard on June 3 just as West Virginia had their say today."
Former State Senator and Democratic State Party Chair Judy Duhamel:
"Tonight's decisive victory in West Virginia proves that voters in one of the nation's most important swing states believe Hillary is the strongest candidate to take on Sen. McCain in the Fall. Despite being outspent, having less staff and fewer offices, Hillary connected with hardworking West Virginians demonstrating that she is the most qualified candidate to jumpstart the economy, tackle spiraling gas prices and restore the middle class. South Dakotans will go to the polls on June 3 with an opportunity to play an important role in the Democratic nominating process and have their voices heard. As president, Hillary will stand up for us, work with us and fight for us everyday to create a better life for our families, now it's time we stand beside her."
