    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Swift (D) Washington and 92 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 4393 but will seek changes in the Senate, if necessary, to ensure that the rights currently afforded absentee voters under the Federal Voting Assistance Act of 1955 and the Overseas Citizens Voting Rights Act of 1975, which would be repealed by this bill, are not diminished in any respect.
