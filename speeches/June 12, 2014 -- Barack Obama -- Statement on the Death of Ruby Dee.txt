    Michelle and I were saddened to hear of the passing of actress, author, and activist Ruby Dee. In roles from Ruth Younger in "A Raisin in the Sun" to Mama Lucas in "American Gangster," Ruby captivated and challenged us. And Michelle and I will never forget seeing her on our first date as Mother Sister in "Do the Right Thing." Through her remarkable performances, Ruby paved the way for generations of Black actors and actresses and inspired African American women across our country. Through her leadership in the civil rights movement, she and her husband Ossie Davis helped open new doors of opportunity for all. Our thoughts and prayers are with Ruby and Ossie's three children, with their friends and family, and with all those who loved them dearly.
