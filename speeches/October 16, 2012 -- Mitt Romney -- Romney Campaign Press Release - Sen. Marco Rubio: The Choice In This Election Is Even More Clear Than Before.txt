    Florida Senator Marco Rubio made the following statement on tonight's second presidential debate:
"After tonight's debate, the choice in this election is even more clear than beforeâ€”as is the fact that Governor Romney is the only candidate who can turn the economy around. The President couldn't explain to the American people how the next four years would be better than the last. With so many still suffering, we can't afford more failed policies. We can't afford a president whose top priority during the recession was Obamacare instead of helping to create good jobs and getting our fiscal house in order. Tonight, Mitt Romney once again showed that he has a plan to restore our economy, one based on principles that have worked before and can work again."
