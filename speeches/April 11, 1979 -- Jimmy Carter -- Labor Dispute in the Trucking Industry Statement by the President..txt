    Last night, all the outstanding issues in the labor dispute between the Teamsters and the trucking industry were settled. I welcome this news for three important reasons. First, normal operations in the trucking industry will be resumed very quickly. Second, the settlement is within the administration's voluntary pay standard. Third, the increase in wages and cost of fringe benefits under the new contract will be substantially less than in the previous contract that was negotiated 3 years ago.
I commend the parties for the responsibility they have shown in making a very important contribution to controlling inflation.
