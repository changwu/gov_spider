    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Subject: Comprehensive Review of Federal Law Enforcement
I have directed my Reorganization Project staff at the Office of Management and Budget to begin a comprehensive review of all Federal law enforcement missions, tasks, and priorities.
Today there is considerable jurisdictional ambiguity, overlap, and possible duplication among Federal organizations performing police or investigative activities. There are at least 75 different Federal agencies and 164,000 Federal employees involved in police or investigative work. Our goal is to make these functions more responsive to both individual rights and Federal law enforcement priorities. This effort will help us determine how best to structure these agencies to do so.
A major objective will be to re-examine the Federal role in law enforcement in light of the responsibilities and capabilities of State and local agencies. The Federal Government ought not to duplicate or overlap State and local law enforcement functions unnecessarily.
The Project will rely heavily on the advice and counsel of the Congress, Federal Departments and Agencies, State and local officials, interested private organizations, and the public.
You may be asked to contribute time, resources, and staff assistance to this effort. If so, I hope you will make your best effort to ensure its successful completion.
My Reorganization Project staff will contact you or an appropriate member of your staff shortly to discuss the appropriate role of your department or agency in the study.
I consider this to be a high priority matter. I know I can count on your cooperation and assistance.
In order to inform all affected parties that this review is underway, I have directed that this memorandum be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER.

Subject: Comprehensive Review of Local Development Programs
I have directed my Reorganization Project staff at the Office of Management and Budget to begin a thorough review of the organization and structure of the major Federal local development programs, including the community economic development programs.
These programs have several problems, including jurisdictional uncertainty, duplication of effort, and lack of coordination.
This review will focus on the programs that comprise the core of the Federal local development assistance package:

Business promotion, where over 100 different programs in more than ten different agencies provide financial and managerial assistance to businesses. 
Public facilities investment, where, for example, there are 46 sewage-related programs alone, dispensing about $6 billion through seven agencies in five departments, two independent agencies and eight regional commissions. 
Housing, where there are at least 77 different programs, administered by 15 different agencies and overseen by three separate government-chartered secondary mortgage agencies. 
Transportation, where 60 grant assistance programs are channelled through six semi-autonomous operating administrations of the Department of Transportation and an additional network of 25 agencies. 
Employment and training, where ten agencies administer 24 programs. 

By examining how these various local development programs actually fit together at the local level, the project will identify ways to improve the Federal Government's contribution to community development, and help sort out the appropriate roles and responsibilities of Federal and non-Federal officials in this area.
The effort will need the active participation of State and local officials, the Congress, Federal Departments and Agencies, and the public.
You may be asked to contribute time, resources, and staff assistance to this effort. If so, I hope you will make your best effort to ensure its successful completion.
My Reorganization Project staff will contact you or an appropriate member of your staff shortly to discuss the appropriate role of your department or agency in the study.
I consider this to be a high priority matter. I know I can count on your support.
In order to inform all affected parties that this review is underway, I have directed that this memorandum be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER.

Subject: Comprehensive Review of Human Services Program
I have directed my Reorganization Project staff to begin a study of the organization and delivery of human services. These services programs, ranging from day care to job 'training, are intended to help people whose special needs are not met by income assistance and health financing programs. This study will be coordinated closely with efforts underway to develop welfare and national health insurance proposals.
The Federal Government spends about $22 billion on more than 100 human services programs administered by ten departments and agencies. The numerous planning, administrative and eligibility requirements of these programs create fragmentation, waste, and confusion.
With your help, this study will lead to a more logical program structure at the Federal level and the delivery of services to families and individuals who need them in a simpler, more comprehensive and efficient way.
The success of this project will depend to a large extent on the cooperation and assistance of Federal departments and agencies, State and local officials , interested groups and individual citizens.
You may be asked to contribute time, resources, and staff assistance to this effort. If so, I hope you will make your best effort to ensure its successful completion.
My Reorganization Project staff will contact you or an appropriate member of your staff shortly to discuss the appropriate role of your department or agency in the study.
I consider this to be a high priority matter. I know I can count on your support.
In order to inform all affected parties that this review is underway, I have directed that this memorandum be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER.

Subject: Comprehensive Review of Administrative Services Delivery
I have directed my Reorganization Project staff at the Office of Management and Budget to begin a comprehensive review of the management of administrative services within the Federal Government. The project will be administered jointly by OMB and the Administrator of the General Services Administration.
A preliminary staff review indicates significant problems with existing services. It has been 30 years since the first Hoover study led to the creation of the General Services Administration; it is time to reexamine the objectives and benefits of our present system in light of those years of operating experience.
A major objective of the study is to improve the delivery of administrative services to Federal agencies. It will assess the roles of the General Services Administration and others in the provision of services related to real and personal property, automated data processing, telecommunications, and records management.
The Project will rely heavily on the advice and counsel of the Congress, Federal Departments and Agencies, State and local officials, interested private organizations, and the public. Your agencies are the principal consumers of Federal administrative services. You have expressed your concerns about their quality. This is your opportunity to help improve them.
You may be asked to contribute time, resources, and staff assistance to this effort. If so, I hope you will make your best effort to ensure its successful completion.
My Reorganization Project staff will contact you or an appropriate member of your staff shortly to discuss the appropriate role of your department or agency in the study.
I consider this to be a high priority matter. I know I can count on your cooperation and assistance.
In order to inform all affected parties that this review is underway, I have directed that this memorandum be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER.
