Judge Brett Kavanaugh is a fine man with an impeccable reputation who is under assault by radical left wing politicians who don't want to know the answers they just want to destroy and delay. Facts don't matter. I go through this with them every single day in D.C.Retweets: 29293Favorites: 113450

I have no doubt that if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents. I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date time and place!Retweets: 26233Favorites: 110748

Also key Allies' called to ask not to release. Therefore the Inspector General.....Retweets: 15322Favorites: 56908

....has been asked to review these documents on an expedited basis. I believe he will move quickly on this (and hopefully other things which he is looking at). In the end I can always declassify if it proves necessary. Speed is very important to me - and everyone!Retweets: 16672Favorites: 67483

Senator Feinstein and the Democrats held the letter for months only to release it with a bang after the hearings were OVER - done very purposefully to Obstruct & Resist & Delay. Let her testify or not and TAKE THE VOTE!Retweets: 453Favorites: 1294
