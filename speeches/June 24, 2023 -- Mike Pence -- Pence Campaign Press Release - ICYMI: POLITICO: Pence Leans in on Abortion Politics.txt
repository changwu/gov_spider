    Saturday marks one year since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, revoking the constitutional right to abortion it had established. And ever since, Republicans have been twisting themselves in knots over how to handle the fallout.
Former President Donald Trump avoids talking about the matter almost entirely. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a six-week abortion ban in the middle of the night in April, and has barely spoken about it since. Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) originally waffled on whether he'd support a nationwide abortion ban. And former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has been vague about how she'd handle the issue as president.

Anthony List call for activists commemorating the end of Roe.

But asked if there should be a litmus test for Republicans to carry the "pro-life" label, Pence suggested they should all be supporting a nationwide abortion ban. "I would expect that pro-life voters around the country would … be looking for men and women willing to stand unambiguously for advancing the cause of the right to life at every level — at the state and federal level."
