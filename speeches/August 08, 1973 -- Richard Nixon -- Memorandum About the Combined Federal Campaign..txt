    Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies:
I am pleased to announce that the Honorable Caspar W. Weinberger, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, has agreed to serve as chairman of the Combined Federal Campaign for the National Capital Area this fall.
This campaign, which begins in September, will combine into a single drive the solicitation efforts of the United Givers Fund, the National Health Agencies and the International Service Agencies. In this one drive we will be seeking to do our share to meet the needs of more than 150 local, national, and international health, welfare, and social service agencies.
These organizations deserve our wholehearted support. Working together through the Combined Federal Campaign we can provide that support and help our neighbors and friends who have special needs. For those in need, the voluntary agencies are a beacon of hope, and oftentimes the only source which can provide the needed assistance.
Through the Combined Federal Campaign, Federal personnel are offered a unique opportunity to help persons in our community, in our Nation, and in overseas lands by one gift once a year, a pledge made particularly easy by the availability of voluntary payroll deductions.
I request that you serve personally as Chairman of the combined campaign in your organization and appoint one of your top assistants as your vice chairman. Please advise Secretary Weinberger of the person you designate as vice chairman.
I know that we will have your full support in this endeavor, and I hope you will commend the campaign with its payroll deduction feature to Federal employees and military personnel in your organization.
RICHARD NIXON
