Here's why: I spent a good deal of time with Mitt Romney and his staff over the last number of weeks going through the kind of problems we have in this country. The fiscal problems, the economic problems. And just what it's going to take to get this country back on track next year with a new president, new Senate and a House. And I'm convinced he's got what it takes to do this." â€” Rep. Paul Ryan

REP. PAUL RYAN: "What I look at in making my vote on Tuesday is basically two things: Who's going to be the best president? Who has the best chance of winning the presidency? I think that's Romney. Here's why: I spent a good deal of time with Mitt Romney and his staff over the last number of weeks going through the kind of problems we have in this country. The fiscal problems, the economic problems. And just what it's going to take to get this country back on track next year with a new president, new Senate and a House. And I'm convinced he's got what it takes to do this. Now here's why: we need to go the country with a real sharp contrast ... from which to choose. We can't just run against Obama and win by default. We need an affirming election so the country tells us 'Fix this mess before it gets out of control' and I'm convinced Mitt Romney is willing to do that. And that he has the courage of his convictions and the tenacity to see it through because I think he understands the moment America is in."
