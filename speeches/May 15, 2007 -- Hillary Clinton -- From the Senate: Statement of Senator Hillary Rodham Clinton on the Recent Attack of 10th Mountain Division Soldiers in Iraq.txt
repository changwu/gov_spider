    Washington, DC -- "Yesterday, I spoke with Major General Michael Oates, the commanding general of the 10th Mountain Division, who informed me that 10th Mountain Division soldiers on patrol Iraq had been attacked. Four soldiers were killed and three soldiers captured. I was assured that every effort is being made to locate and safeguard the missing soldiers. My prayers are with the families that have suffered the death of a loved one, and with the families who await confirmation on the status and safe return of those still unaccounted for. I asked to be kept apprised of the situation and offered my full support for the men and women of the 10th Mountain Division.
"I have visited 10th Mountain Division soldiers here at home and abroad. These service members have always demonstrated resolve, courage under fire, and the conviction to succeed in every mission and every assignment. The soldiers of the 10th Mountain Division will continue to exemplify these traits -- and all Americans are reminded of their service and sacrifice in light of their recent losses and the uncertain status of three brave soldiers."
