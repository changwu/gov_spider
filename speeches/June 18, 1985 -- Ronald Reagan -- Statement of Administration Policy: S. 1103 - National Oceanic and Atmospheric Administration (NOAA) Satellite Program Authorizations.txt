    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Gorton (R) Washington)
The Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of S. 1103 because it would: (1) authorize 1986 appropriations which exceed the 1985-enacted level, as proposed in the Senate First Budget Resolution for 1986, by $76 million, and the 1986 Budget request by $91 million; (2) impose onerous restrictions on the Department of Commerce's ability to manage effectively the National Weather Service through closings or consolidations of offices; and (3) require prior Congressional review of NOAA decisions to contract-out functions. The latter two restrictions would severely impede the effective management of NOAA, and were, therefore, cited by the President as highly objectionable in his veto message accompanying S. 1097, similar legislation, last year.
