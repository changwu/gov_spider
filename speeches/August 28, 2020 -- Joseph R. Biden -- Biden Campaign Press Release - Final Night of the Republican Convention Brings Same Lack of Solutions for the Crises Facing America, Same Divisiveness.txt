    In response to the fourth and final night of the Republican Convention, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield released the following statement:
"Since the beginning of the Republican convention, at least 3,525 Americans have lost their lives to the coronavirus. Over those four days — and for the last eight months — the American people have waited in exasperation for a plan to finally take control of the pandemic that has cost us 180,000 lives, infected almost six million, and thrown working families and our middle class into dire financial straits, but nothing came.
"Instead of a strategy to overcome the pandemic, or any concern for the unbearable suffering in our country right now as a result of his ongoing failures, what we heard was a delusional vision completely divorced from the crushing reality that ordinary Americans face. But the American people know who Donald Trump is. They know the truth about Trump's crisis-plagued presidency because they are living it every single day: shuttered businesses in our neighborhoods, kids kept home from school, and a steady stream of vitriol intended to tear us apart, from the person who is supposed to be uniting our nation.
"In Donald Trump's America, safety is pitted against justice, Americans are pitted against one another, and the violence that Trump warns of plays out on the streets of communities across our country — stoked by his own words and actions. Before tonight's convention, one of Trump's top advisors even expressed hope for more discord and violence in our cities in a cynical ploy to use division as a political strategy. They have shown once again how deeply the Trump Administration has failed to grasp the American values that have made our nation a beacon of light throughout history.
"It has never been more clear than Donald Trump made it tonight: we are in a battle for the soul of our nation."
