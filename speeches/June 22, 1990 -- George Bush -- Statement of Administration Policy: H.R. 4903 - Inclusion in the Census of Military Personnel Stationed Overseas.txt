    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Ridge (R) Pennsylvania and 72 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 4903. The Administration, however, will seek amendments in the Senate to clarify provisions that determine the U.S. residence of overseas personnel for congressional apportionment purposes. The Census Bureau should have sufficient flexibility to include overseas personnel in the apportionment counts in the most accurate, efficient, and timely manner.
