    While President Biden has acted decisively to impose crippling sanctions on Putin, a new New York Times fact check debunks the misleading claims that Congressional GOP leaders have made about gas prices.
President Biden has been clear that our efforts to support the Ukrainian people – including months of saber-rattling by Putin and the import ban of Russian gas, oil, and coal – wouldn't be without cost.
Republican claims about the causes of increasing gas prices are "all incorrect assertions" according to the New York Times analysis. As the Times reports, "the specific policies cited by Republican lawmakers as evidence of Mr. Biden's supposed "war on American energy" have had little impact on rising gas prices."
Studies have shown that the combined impact of the Russian invasion and COVID-related disruptions were the primary driver of gas price increases. The New York Times concurs, writing "the primary reason for rising gas prices over the past year is the coronavirus pandemic and its disruptions to global supply and demand," and adding "Russia's invasion of Ukraine has only compounded the issues."
