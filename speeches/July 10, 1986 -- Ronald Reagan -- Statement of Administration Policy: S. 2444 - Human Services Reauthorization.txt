    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revision)(Senate)(Hawkins (R) FL and 20 others)
The Administration strongly opposes S. 2444 on programmatic and budgetary grounds. The bill would add more than $3.2 billion to the President's Budget over fiscal years 1987-90. The Administration urges that S. 2444 be amended to:
— eliminate reauthorization of the Community Services Block Grant (including Community Food and Nutrition) and Dependent Care Services Program, programs which the Administration has recommended for termination;
— eliminate authority for new duplicative categorical programs authorizing grants to (1) address the "needs of the poor" and (2) establish child development associate scholarships — these new programs are unnecessary and inappropriate;
— reduce the excessive authorization levels for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance program (LIHEAP), which are $650 million above the President's budget estimates for 1987-90, and eliminate the unsound provision requiring States to count utility expenses paid with LIHEAP funds as shelter expenses when calculating the Food Stamp excess shelter deduction, which would add $441 million to the President's budget for the Food Stamp program during 1987-90; and
— reduce the excessive Head Start authorization levels, which are $502 million above the President's budget estimates for 1987-90, and eliminate the proposed earmark of funding for training and technical assistance, which is an unwarranted restriction on the use of funds.
