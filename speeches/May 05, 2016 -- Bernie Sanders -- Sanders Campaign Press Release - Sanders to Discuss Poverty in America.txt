He will meet this morning with West Virginians at the Five Loaves & Two Fishes Food Bank, where Linda and Bob McKinney struggle to keep residents of the rural mountain county from going hungry.
The discussion is expected to focus on the urgent need to lift millions of Americans out of poverty and rebuild the middle class. Sanders will focus on how poverty can be a death sentence. In McDowell County, where deaths by suicide and from drug overdoses are among the highest in the state, men live on average to be only 64 years old. Sanders will contrast that to suburban Washington, D.C., just a six-hour drive away, where men in wealthy Fairfax County, Virginia, live on average until the age of 82. The average life expectancy for women in Fairfax County is 85, compared to just 73 for women in McDowell.
