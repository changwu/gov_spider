Fox News' "Just In"

Laura Ingraham: "Of course Congressman, there [Barack Obama] is talking about Osama Bin Laden and bringing him to justice. We do not want to make him a martyr. Does that mean that if Osama Bin Laden was convicted in an American court, he could not get the death penalty? I'm confused."
Rep. Cantor: "Well, that would sure seem to me the way to interpret that comment as well. I mean look Laura, first of all, let's call it how it is Barack Obama needs to stop trying to apologize for America to the rest of the world. There is no reason that we should have to do that, and the fact is that most Americans understand what the motivations were behind Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks. John McCain has said it once, he's said it again, if he becomes president, he will make sure that Osama Bin Laden is either executed in the courtroom or killed on the battlefield, period. Here we have Barack Obama trying to apologize, trying to say that we ought not make him a martyr. Frankly, I believe the definition of a martyr is someone who dies for his cause or is killed for his cause. So really, what we are hearing, as you suggest, is that Barack Obama says that Osama Bin Laden should not be subjected to death in the dea th penalty. That is not where most Americans are, and obviously it demonstrates again the world view that Barack Obama would approach the awesome task of being commander in chief, not something that the American people would really approve of."
