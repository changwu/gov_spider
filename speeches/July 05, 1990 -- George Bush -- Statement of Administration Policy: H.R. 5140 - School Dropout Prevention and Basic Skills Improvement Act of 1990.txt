    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Serrano (D) NY and Hayes (D) IL)
The Administration opposes H.R. 5140 because it would make unnecessary changes to an unfunded program. Its provisions would complicate the administration of dropout prevention and basic skills improvement programs by the States. It also would inflexibly require each State to set aside 5 percent of each annual appropriation for grants to community-based organizations. At the same time, it would fail to subject those organizations to evaluation, reporting, and program improvement requirements that apply to other grantees.
