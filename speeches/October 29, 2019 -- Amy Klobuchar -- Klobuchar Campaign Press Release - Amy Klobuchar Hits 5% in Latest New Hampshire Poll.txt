    MANCHESTER, NH — All signs point to an Amy Klobuchar surge in New Hampshire after the Minnesota Senator hit 5% in a CNN/UNH poll released earlier today. The poll was the first survey of Granite State voters after Senator Klobuchar's strong October 15th debate performance and whirlwind 10-country New Hampshire tour. It marks her first qualifying poll for the December 19th Democratic debate in California. The poll also shows an increase in Senator Klobuchar's net favorability by +13, the second highest increase in the field and well above the rest of the candidates.
"New Hampshire voters are starting to tune into the primary in a serious way, and they are seeing that Amy Klobuchar is the candidate who will unite Americans behind her message of not only winning, but winning big in November 2020," said New Hampshire State Director Scott Merrick. "Between her strong October debate performance and her 10-county tour, our campaign has produced momentum that will continue to build all the way through the February 11th primary and beyond."
The surge in polling comes following a breakout debate performance — after which Klobuchar raised $2 million in a week and quickly qualified for the November debate. Klobuchar will return to the state on November 6th, with more details to come.
