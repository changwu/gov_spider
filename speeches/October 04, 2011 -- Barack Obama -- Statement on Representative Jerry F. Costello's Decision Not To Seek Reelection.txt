    For over two decades, Jerry Costello has proudly represented the people of southwestern and southern Illinois. Born and raised in the State he now serves, Jerry has distinguished himself as a fierce advocate for improving our Nation's transportation infrastructure to ensure Illinois and the entire country are prepared to lead the way in a 21st-century economy. Michelle and I want to join the people of Illinois in thanking Congressman Costello for his service, and we wish him and his family well in the future.
