The @nytimes story is a Fake, just like the "paper" itself. I was criticized for moving too fast when I issued the China Ban, long before most others wanted to do so. @SecAzar told me nothing until later, and @PeterNavarroUSA memo was same as Ban (see his statements). Fake News!Retweets: 9083Favorites: 33889

I am working hard to expose the corruption and dishonesty in the Lamestream Media. That part is easy, the hard part is WHY?Retweets: 74250Favorites: 398266

Having been involved in the negotiations, to put it mildly, the number that OPEC+ is looking to cut is 20 Million Barrels a day, not the 10 Million that is generally being reported. If anything near this happens, and the World gets back to business from the Covid 19.....Retweets: 23494Favorites: 112859

....disaster, the Energy Industry will be strong again, far faster than currently anticipated. Thank you to all of those who worked with me on getting this very big business back on track, in particular Russia and Saudi Arabia.Retweets: 17132Favorites: 84322

For the purpose of creating conflict and confusion, some in the Fake News Media are saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states, not that of the President of the United States & the Federal Government. Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect....Retweets: 36236Favorites: 159510

....It is the decision of the President, and for many good reasons. With that being said, the Administration and I are working closely with the Governors, and this will continue. A decision by me, in conjunction with the Governors and input from others, will be made shortly!Retweets: 25233Favorites: 113071

First the Fake News Media said that it's not fair for the President of the United States to be giving news conferences, but it is the only way I can reach the American People, as seen in the below poll. https://t.co/xP2rqjqtafRetweets: 28435Favorites: 117337

My deepest sympathies go out to Frieda Chera and the family of the late, great, Stanley Chera, one of Manhattan's most brilliant real estate minds. Stanley was charitable, kind, and a wonderful friend. He will be truly missed!Retweets: 17465Favorites: 117779
