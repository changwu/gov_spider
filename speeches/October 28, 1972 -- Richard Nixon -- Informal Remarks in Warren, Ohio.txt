    Mr. Mayor, and Congressman Stanton, Mrs. Stanton, Senator Taft:
I want you to know that as we complete our motorcade of the State of Ohio that it is a very great privilege for us to be here in Warren again.
I just told the mayor that I remember being in Warren in 1952, 1956, 1960. In all of those years we won. We are here in '72, and we think Warren is our lucky city in Ohio.
Also, I just gave the mayor a pen, one of the White House pens, and the revenue sharing bill that Bill Stanton, your Congressman, worked so hard for in the House, that we just signed, will soon be here in Warren, and he is going to use it to hire back some police and firemen they had to lay off. So Warren is going to be a greater city because of revenue sharing.
Most important of all, we want you to know that as we go through this campaign that we are glad we are here at a time that we have made a very significant breakthrough in bringing peace in Vietnam and building peace in the world.
And so, to all of you, we wish you the best next week. And vote on election day
Thank you.
