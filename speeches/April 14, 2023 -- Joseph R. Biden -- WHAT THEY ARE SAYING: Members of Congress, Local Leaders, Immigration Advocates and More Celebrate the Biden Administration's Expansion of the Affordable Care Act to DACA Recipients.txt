    Yesterday, President Biden announced a plan to expand health coverage for DACA recipients. If finalized, the rule would allow DACA recipients to enroll in Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Programs, and the Affordable Care Act's Health Insurance Marketplaces, where they may qualify for financial assistance based on income, and through their state Medicaid agency.
President Biden believes that DACA recipients strengthen our economy and enrich our workplaces, our schools and communities, and our country as a whole. That's why on his first day in office, he called on Congress to give Dreamers a pathway to citizenship and he has repeated that call in every State of the Union address since.
While Congress has failed to act, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken significant measures to protect Dreamers.
See below for what they are saying:
Congressional Leaders
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer: "Dreamers deserve access to health coverage in the only country they call home. I applaud President Biden for this highly impactful policy change that will improve the lives of so many!" [Tweet, 4/13/23]
Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin: "DACA holders are American in every way but their paperwork and are an important part of our nation & our economy. Extending ACA health insurance options to them is humane and simply common sense. Congress' decades long failure to do the right thing for Dreamers is inexcusable." [Tweet, 4/13/23]
Senator Bob Menendez: "I'm glad to see the Biden Administration taking steps to recognize that DACA recipients have been waiting for over decade for Republicans to come to the table to give them a path to citizenship." [Tweet, 4/13/23]

Congressional Hispanic Caucus: "Today, we applaud President Biden's decision to provide more equitable access to health care to hundreds-of-thousands of Latinos in our communities and throughout the country. This decision also marks a significant accomplishment for the CHC. This change in policy has been a priority for the CHC and we have pushed multiple Administrations to provide access to quality, affordable, health care for DACA recipients. This morning, the hard work of the CHC, our members, and DACA recipients and advocates has paid off. The change CHC fought for is finally underway. As a result of this change, approximately 600,000 DACA recipients and their U.S. citizen children will be able to secure and purchase health insurance through the ACA. Access to ACA and Medicaid benefits will allow a significant number of Latinos to improve their quality of life, obtain affordable, quality health care, and make way for a healthier future for our communities. We thank the Biden-Harris Administration for their commitment to Latino communities who have historically been disadvantaged when it comes to accessing health care. We also ask the Department of Health and Human Services to act with urgency and implement the changes as soon as possible so that DACA recipients can quickly access the benefits that - as taxpayers - they have earned."

I, alongside the American Immigration Council, would like to thank and applaud the Biden Administration today for this expansion of the Affordable Care Act. Immigration status should not be a barrier to healthcare access, and today's announcement fills a void for DACA beneficiaries like myself, who were previously excluded from the ACA. This new expansion let's immigrants who have contributed to our healthcare system, from small business owners, to students, to stay-at-home parents, obtain essential medical care. As I know firsthand, the DACA community has often been left out in the past. Thankfully, this new ACA expansion is a great step toward equitable access to services for immigrants. It will now be easier for the DACA community to receive medical care without having to worry about being able to put food on the table. Dreamers are crucial members of our workforce, and our communities and Congress should act and finally do what is right and pass legislation to provide them with a path to citizenship.
