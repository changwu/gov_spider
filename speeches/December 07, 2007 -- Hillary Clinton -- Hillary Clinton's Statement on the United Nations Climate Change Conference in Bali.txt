    "President Bush's failed unilateral climate policy is a part of his failed unilateral foreign policy. One of the worst messages President Bush sent when he took office was to reject the Kyoto Protocol completely. He could have instead immediately started a process to modify the Protocol if he had a better approach. He chose to do nothing. President Bush's failure to engage with the world community on global warming has destroyed our credibility, and sent a message that has slowed the momentum to solve the climate crisis.
"The world shouldn't be asked to wait on the United States any longer. Congress is taking action to restore U.S. leadership. Yesterday, I joined with Senator Boxer and others on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in moving forward legislation that will cap and reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. It's time for President Bush to work with Congress on a domestic program to set binding emissions targets at home. And it's time for him to engage with the international community as well. I urge President Bush to reverse course and engage his Administration constructively at Bali."
