Travel pool report #1 
Travel pool assembled in the press briefing room at 10:50 and was brought on to a bus heading towards Wilmington, Del., which departed the White House at 11:15.
At around 12:25, when the bus carrying the travel pool was just north of Baltimore, wranglers informed us we would instead be returning to the White House. The bus turned around.
Travel pool returned to the White House at 1:53.
