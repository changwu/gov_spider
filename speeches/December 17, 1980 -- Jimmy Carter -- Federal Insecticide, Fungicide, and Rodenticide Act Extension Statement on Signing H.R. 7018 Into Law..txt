    I have today signed H.R. 7018, a bill to extend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act until September 30, 1981.
In approving this bill, I want to emphasize my view, and that of the Attorney General, that section 4 is unconstitutional. Section 4 purports to allow Congress to disapprove agency regulations issued under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act by a concurrent resolution not submitted to the President for his approval. For that reason, section 4 violates Article I, section 7 of the Constitution. Relatedly, section 4 violates the constitutional separation of powers by purporting to give Congress a role in administering substantive statutory programs. In accordance with my June 21, 1978, message to Congress, the executive branch will treat section 4 as a "report and wait" provision and will not consider a congressional expression of disapproval under section 4 to be legally binding.
