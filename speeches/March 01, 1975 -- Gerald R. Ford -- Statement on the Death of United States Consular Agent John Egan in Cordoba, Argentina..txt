    THE KIDNAPING and murder of U.S. Consular Agent John Patrick Egan by terrorists in Cordoba, Argentina, is a vicious act which will be condemned by men of decency and honor everywhere. There can be no justification for the wanton killing of an innocent and defenseless person. Mr. Egan served his country loyally and well. All Americans will join in honoring the memory of Mr. Egan and expressing deepest sympathy to his widow and family.
