    The President and the congressional Republican leadership jointly announced a proposal to extend the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program from the current expiration date of July 4, 1992, to March 6, 1993. Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, Senator Bob Packwood, and House Republican leader Bob Michel joined the President in announcing the extension.
The proposal would continue the payment of a total of 46 weeks of benefits (which includes 20 weeks of extended benefits in high unemployment States) and 39 weeks of benefits (which includes 13 weeks of extended benefits in all other States) until January 2, 1993. Thereafter, these extended benefits would be paid for 10 weeks and 7 weeks until March 1, 1993. Total costs of the new benefits are estimated to be $2.5 billion. These costs would be fully paid for by offsets contained in the President's 1993 budget.
Further, the proposal directs that Advisory Council on Unemployment Compensation to study and make recommendations on permanent unemployment compensation reforms by February 1, 1993.
As previously announced, workers who are unemployed as a result of the disturbances in Los Angeles and who may not qualify for standard unemployment benefits will be receiving unemployment benefits through the Disaster Unemployment Assistance Program.
The President stated, "I urge the Congress to join us in setting aside partisan politics and moving expeditiously to pass this extension so that unemployed workers will know they can count on these benefits as the economy begins to recover."
