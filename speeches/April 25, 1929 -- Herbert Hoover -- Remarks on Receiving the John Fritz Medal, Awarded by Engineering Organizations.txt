    It is a genuine pleasure to welcome so many distinguished representatives of the leading engineering societies of our country. A man never loses his love for the profession of his choice, no matter whither the opportunities for service may divert his steps in later life or how interesting the activities in those other fields may become.

Of all the honors which have been bestowed, I rate most highly [p.124] the approval of my professional brethren as expressed in the John Fritz Medal. I thank you.
