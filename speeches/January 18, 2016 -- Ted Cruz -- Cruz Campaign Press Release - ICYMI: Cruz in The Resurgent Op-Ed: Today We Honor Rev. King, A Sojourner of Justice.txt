    HOUSTON, Texas â€“ Presidential candidate Ted Cruz penned an op-ed for The Resurgent in remembrance of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. a leader who "illuminated our nation by his courage and dedication to the truth."
Below is an excerpt and the full op-ed may be viewed here.
There are moments in our national history that have called Americans to bend the arc of history towards justice. Each moment has required exceptional leadership.
Today, we commemorate one such leader who illuminated our nation by his courage and dedication to the truth.
Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. understood the American potential more fully than it was actualized at the time. He challenged the distorted conventional acceptance of a "separate but equal" citizenry.
Instead, he drew upon that promise of our founding that every person is "endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights." Reverend King reminded communities across the country that we have a duty to rectify the original sin of our nation and to respect the "dignity and worth of all human personality."
Today, we celebrate this sojourner of justice, and we remember his sacrifice. Because of his persistent struggle on the road towards freedom; because of his vision for an America in which men and women, boys and girls, of every race would learn, work, and pray side-by-side, we now have made great national strides to embrace the inherent dignity of humanity.
