    Biden and his liberal handlers plan to kill millions of energy jobs and spike energy bills. 
Joe Biden is raising campaign cash with former job-killing EPA chief Gina McCarthy, the current head of the radical Natural Resources Defense Council. With Biden as their puppet, these wealthy, liberal activists are plotting to strangle American energy producers, sacrificing millions of good-paying, blue-collar jobs on the altar of their extreme climate agenda.
Biden already promised to "sacrifice" hundreds of thousands of energy jobs in furtherance of his Green New Deal policies. Since then, he's doubled down on plans to wage a taxpayer-funded war on American energy and put AOC in charge of drafting the battle plans to get it done. Biden's plans are bad news for the 609,000 workers in Pennsylvania supported by fracking and the 10 million workers in the United States supported by the energy industry: there is simply no place for them in Biden's vision for America.
But it's not just energy workers who will bear the brunt of Biden's radical agenda: under Biden's watch, radical, left-wing activists will have the green light to wipe out pipeline and other energy infrastructure projects, killing the jobs of tens of thousands of union workers. Meanwhile, millions of middle-class families will have to grapple with higher gasoline prices and energy bills.
And who benefits from America surrendering its energy independence? Adversaries like Russia, China, and Venezuela. These liberal activists fundraising for Biden are just fine with that â€“ they hate the idea of putting America first.
It's clear Democrats are no longer the party that fights for America's workers. President Trump is the only candidate who will protect American energy producers, support affordable American energy, and create good-paying energy jobs.
