    The United States welcomes the signing yesterday by the opposition and other stakeholders of the South Sudan peace agreement. However, we are deeply disappointed that the Government of South Sudan under President Kiir yet again squandered the opportunity to bring peace to their people by refusing to sign the agreement. The U.S. deplores this failure of leadership.
The U.S. greatly appreciates the critical role that Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) leaders are playing in supporting the talks. Their persistence and united approach has brought the parties closer to an agreement that can lead them down the path to peace. The United States will continue to support IGAD as it strives to secure the full and final agreement of the Government of South Sudan within the agreed 15 days. The U.S. calls upon the Government of South Sudan and President Kiir to sign the agreement before IGAD's deadline without reservation or condition.
Finally, given the high cost of South Sudan's conflict to regional stability and the security and livelihoods of South Sudan's people, the United States insists that there must be consequences for those who continue to stand in the way of peace. Today, we have initiated consultations at the United Nations and with our IGAD and other international partners on action in the Security Council to sanction those who undermine the peace process, if an agreement is not signed by the Government within 15 days and a ceasefire is not implemented promptly by all parties.
