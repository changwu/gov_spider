    The United States strongly condemns the DPRK for its test of a long-range ballistic missile. The President has been briefed on the situation and he and his national security team will continue close consultations with Allies and partners â€” building on the President's trilateral meeting on Sunday with Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan and President Yoon Suk Yeol of the ROK, where they resolved to forge still-closer trilateral links in the security realm. The Vice President is coordinating with our allies and partners in the region while at the APEC Conference in Bangkok, Thailand.
This launch is a brazen violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions and needlessly raises tensions and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region. This action demonstrates that the DPRK continues to prioritize its unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs over the well-being of its people. We urge all countries to condemn these violations and call on the DPRK to come to the table for serious negotiations. The door has not closed on diplomacy, but Pyongyang must immediately cease its destabilizing actions and instead choose diplomatic engagement. The United States will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the American homeland and Republic of Korea and Japanese allies.
