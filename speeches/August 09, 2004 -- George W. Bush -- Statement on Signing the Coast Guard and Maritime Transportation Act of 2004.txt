    Today I have signed into law H.R. 2443, the "Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2004." The Act authorizes appropriations for the United States Coast Guard, facilitates navigation and shipping, and strengthens the security of maritime transportation.
To the extent that provisions of the Act, including sections 217, 708(c)(2), and 803(c)(11), call for submission of legislative recommendations to the Congress, the executive branch shall construe such provisions in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch and to recommend for the consideration of the Congress such measures as the President shall judge necessary and expedient. Accordingly, the affected departments and agencies shall ensure that any reports or recommendations submitted to the Congress are subjected to appropriate executive branch review and approval before submission.
To ensure consistency with the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, the executive branch shall construe the phrase "if acceptable to the President and the Senate" as used in section 220 of the Act to require nomination by the President and the advise and consent of the Senate for the appointments addressed by that section.
GEORGE W. BUSH
The White House, August 9, 2004.
