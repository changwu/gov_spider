    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the injunction to prevent the federal government from requiring businesses to cover contraception in health plans:
"Freedom of conscience has won an important victory. Today's injunction preventing the federal government from forcing one family business from having to choose between keeping its doors open and violating its faith is a step in the right direction. But it is only a step, not the end of the struggle. We must ensure that the same freedom to live according to one's faith is available to all Americans. If I am elected president, I will never cease fighting for freedom of conscience as it is guaranteed under the First Amendment."
