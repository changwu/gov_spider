    I welcome the agreement announced today at the six-party talks in Beijing. Today's announcement reflects the common commitment of the participants in the six-party talks to realize a Korean Peninsula that is free of nuclear weapons.
In September 2005, we agreed on a joint statement that charted the way forward toward achieving a nuclear weapons-free peninsula. In February 2007, the participants in the six-party talks announced a set of first steps toward implementing that agreement. Today's announcement maps out additional steps toward our ultimate goal of full and verifiable denuclearization.
Under the agreement reached today, North Korea has committed that by the end of 2007, it will provide a complete and correct declaration of all its nuclear programs, nuclear weapons programs, materials, and any proliferation activity. North Korea will get started on its commitment to disable all its existing nuclear facilities by disabling the core nuclear facilities at Yongbyon by the end of the year. North Korea also committed not to transfer nuclear materials, technology, or know-how beyond its borders.
The other parties—including the United States—are providing economic and energy assistance to North Korea. Such assistance is being provided as North Korea carries out its commitments.
I commend Secretary Rice, Ambassador Hill, and our negotiating team for their hard work and dedication to this important effort, which will help secure the future peace and prosperity of the Northeast Asian region.
