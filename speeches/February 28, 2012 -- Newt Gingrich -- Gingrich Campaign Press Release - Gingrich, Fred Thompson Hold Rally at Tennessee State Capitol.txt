"We need an American energy program that makes America independent," says Gingrich.
Speaking to a modest crowd, the Republican candidate focused his attention on energy.
He wants the U.S. to produce more oil to improve national security, lower gasoline costs, and create jobs.
"We're going to create millions of new jobs, right here at home, and put people to work," says Gingrich.
Supporters believe Newt has what it takes.
"I like the fact that he doesn't take any guff, and I think he can take it to Mr. Obama," says supporter Sharon Blank.
"I think Newt is the man that has an answer for this country and can do it," says supporter Ted Kornblum.

  Gingrich hopes to make up ground in the Volunteer State, and former U.S. Senator Fred Thompson is helping.
"He has been there, he has done that, and he has shown tough leadership, he has ruffled some feathers, and it's gonna take that," says Fred Thompson.
Gingrich says if he's elected, his energy policy will bring gas prices down to $2.50 a gallon.
