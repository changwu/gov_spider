    Wilmington, DE (November 2, 2007) - Sen. Joe Biden today responded to Rudy Giuliani's baseless claim that Sen. Biden had no foreign policy experience:
"Today's comments come from a guy—Rudy Giuliani—who said Dick Cheney, the architect of Bush's failed policy in Iraq, was a great choice for vice president and who recommended the now discredited Bernie Kerik to be Secretary of Homeland Security. Once again, Rudy has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge of U.S. foreign policy."
