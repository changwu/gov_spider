    A new Navigator Research poll found that Biden's Inflation Reduction Act is immensely popular with the American public including – notably – independents. The poll found:

Nearly 2 out of 3 voters support a new economic plan from President Biden and Democrats that includes lower drug prices, lower health insurance premiums, and clean energy.

Independents: +40 (61-21%)
Among Non-College College Educated Voters: +41 (64-23%)
Among College Educated Voters: +43 (69-26%)


And - the poll makes clear that supporters of this plan are viewed as "fighting for working people rather than the rich," something President Biden has championed all along.
