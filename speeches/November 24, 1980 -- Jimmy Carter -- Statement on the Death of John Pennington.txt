    With the death of John Pennington, journalism has lost one of its most dedicated and effective practitioners. He was a resourceful and courageous investigative reporter, yet scrupulously honest and fair. The sensitivity and compassion reflected in his writing were in the highest tradition of southern journalism.
He was my good friend. Rosalynn and I are saddened by his passing and extend our deepest sympathy to his family.
