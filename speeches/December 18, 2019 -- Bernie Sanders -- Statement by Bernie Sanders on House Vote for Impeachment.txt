    WASHINGTON, December 18 â€” Senator Sanders issued the following statement after a majority of the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Donald Trump:
"Today, the House of Representatives rightly carried out its constitutional responsibility by voting to impeach Donald Trump, the most corrupt president in our history. No one, including the president, is above the law.
"I call on Mitch McConnell to conduct a full and fair trial to hold this president accountable, and I am fully prepared to uphold my responsibility as a juror in the United States Senate."
