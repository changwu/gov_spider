    I applaud the Senate's vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Brett Kavanaugh is superbly qualified for the Court of Appeals and will be a brilliant, thoughtful, and fair-minded judge. I appreciate his distinguished service in the executive branch for the last 5 years, as Associate Counsel and then Senior Associate Counsel to the President, and since July 2003 in the vital role of Staff Secretary. I congratulate Brett and his family on today's confirmation and thank him for his continued service to the law and our Nation.
