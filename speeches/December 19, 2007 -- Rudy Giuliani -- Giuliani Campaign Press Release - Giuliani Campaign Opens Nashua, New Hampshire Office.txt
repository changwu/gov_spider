    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that it has opened an office in Nashua, New Hampshire.
The office is staffed by a full-time field representative and will serve as the base of operations for volunteers and supporters in southern New Hampshire.
"Rudy's new Nashua office will be a place for the Mayor's volunteers to mobilize in support of his candidacy," said Wayne Semprini, Giuliani's New Hampshire Chairman.
Giuliani's New Hampshire campaign also has offices in Manchester and Portsmouth.
