    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Castle (R) DE and 14 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3873, which would extend authorizations for Federal programs providing nutritional services to children and families that are soon due to expire. The President's Budget proposes to reauthorize these critical programs and make changes to improve access to benefits by all eligible children, ensure healthy school environments, and ensure the best possible targeting of program benefits to eligible children.
The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to clarify certain provisions in the bill, address technical issues, ensure that provisions that will result in significant increased costs are offset, and otherwise refine and improve this legislation as it moves through the legislative process.
Budget Estimates and Enforcement
This bill would affect direct spending. It is critical to exercise responsible restraint over Federal spending and the Administration looks forward to working with Congress to control the cost of this bill. The Budget Enforcement Act's pay-as-you-go requirements and discretionary spending caps expired on September 30, 2002. The President's FY 2005 Budget includes a proposal to extend the discretionary caps through 2009, a pay-as-you-go rule that would require spending offsets for direct spending increases and a new mechanism to control the expansion of long-term unfunded obligations. OMB's cost estimate of this bill currently is under development.
