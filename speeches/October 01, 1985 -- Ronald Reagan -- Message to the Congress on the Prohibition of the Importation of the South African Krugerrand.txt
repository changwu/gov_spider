    To the Congress of the United States:
On September 9, 1985, I informed the Congress pursuant to Section 204(b) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b), that I had exercised my statutory authority to prohibit certain transactions involving South Africa (Executive Order No. 12532). I also informed the Congress that the Executive Order directed the Secretary of State and the United States Trade Representative to consult with other parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade with a view toward adopting a prohibition on the import of Krugerrands.
In order to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy and economy of the United States referred to in Executive Order No. 12532, and in view of the continuing nature of that emergency, and in view of the successful completion of those consultations, I have issued an Executive order, a copy of which is attached, exercising my statutory authority to prohibit such imports effective October 11, 1985.
All of the measures I have adopted against South Africa are directed at apartheid and the South African Government, and not. against the people of that country or its economy. The Krugerrand measure ordered was taken in recognition of the fact that the Krugerrand is perceived in the Congress as an important symbol of apartheid. This view is widely shared by the U.S. public. I am directing this prohibition in recognition of these public and congressional sentiments.
