    I wanted to take this opportunity to welcome you to this regional meeting of the White House Conference on Environmental Technology. I'm sorry I can't be there with you. But our administration is very well represented by my Science Adviser, Jack Gibbons, and Fred Hansen, Sherri Goodman, and Al Alm, and I thank them all for being there.
I want to say a special word of thanks to Governor Romer for working with Jack to host this event and to thank Ralph Peterson and the other Colorado industry leaders who have worked so hard to put this meeting together.
I know that you're very committed both to promoting economic growth and job creation in Colorado and protecting your priceless environment. And by deploying a new generation of innovative environmental technologies and building a world-leading environmental industry, you know that you can do both. Promoting the development and deployment of new environmental technologies by American industry enables you to do a better job of cleaning up and protecting the environment at lower cost. And by strengthening the United States environmental technology industry, of course, an industry that already has created more than 1.2 million high-wage and high-skill jobs for American workers, you're making America's economy and our environment stronger. And of course, you're especially helping Colorado.
I'm very pleased that there are so many industry, environmental, and State and local government leaders here today working together to make this happen. I look forward to hearing your recommendations. And again, I want to thank Jack Gibbons and the other members of our administration team for being there, and I want to thank all of you for being there.
Thank you very, very much, and have a great meeting.
