    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Mavroules (D) Massachusetts and 130 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2213, because the Telecommunications for the Disabled Act of 1982 adequately addresses the availability of hearing aid compatible "essential" telephones, such as pay telephones and telephones in various public installations. Hearing aid compatible telephones are readily available to consumers, and no adequate justification has been offered to warrant intervention in the marketplace by the Federal Government in this manner.
