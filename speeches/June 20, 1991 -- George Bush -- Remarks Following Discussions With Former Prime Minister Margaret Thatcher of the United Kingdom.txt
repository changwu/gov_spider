    The President. I don't think we're having a press conference, but I want to just take this opportunity to say how much General Scowcroft and I have enjoyed a visit with the former Prime Minister. Over an hour, she shared with us her views on the Soviet Union, having returned from a very interesting and very constructive trip not so long ago. We are anticipating a meeting today of Mr. Yeltsin, and this debrief or my picking her brains, as I did, is extraordinarily helpful in that context, as in many other contexts.
But Margaret, I just want to thank you for popping in, and you are welcome at any time.
Mrs. Thatcher. Thank you very much, Mr. President, I've enjoyed it enormously. They're historic days: democracy has come to the Soviet Union. It now has to be backed up by full economic reform, with everyone pulling together. Thank you very much. Thank you so much.
