Like other focus groups, they picked Marco as the big winner.

Across the board, the Republicans the Plain Dealer kept tabs on praised Marco for his leadership and optimism.
Alan Furey, an educator who formerly served as chairman of Young Republicans of Huron County, applauded the energy of Rubio's opening statement and said "I like him more and more every time I hear him speak. I'd love to see who he aligns with for VP."
The panelists also felt that Marco was honest and straightforward, and effectively highlighted how calculated his opponents can be:
Our local Republicans were particularly impressed by Rubio, and felt he succeeded in portraying Cruz as an opportunist who would say or do anything to win an election.
"Confirms my suspicions that Cruz plays many sides of the fence to achieve his goals," said Joyce Banjac of Broadview Heights, a business school lecturer at Baldwin Wallace University.
Across the country, conservatives are saying Marco won the debate and has what it takes to unite the party.
