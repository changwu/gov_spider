    Today I have signed into law, H.R. 2520, the "Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994."
H.R. 2520 provides funds for various programs of the Department of the Interior and Energy, the Forest Service (Department of Agriculture), and the Indian Health Service (Department of Health and Human Services). Funding for various independent agencies such as the Smithsonian Institution and the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities is also included.
The Act provides funding to further the protection and rehabilitation of America's inventory of natural and cultural assets, including our national parks and forests.
I am pleased that the Act includes funding in support of the Forest Plan for the Pacific Northwest, which will help both to begin implementation of ecosystem management and to offset economic disruptions to forest communities in Washington, Oregon, and Northern California.
The Act provides funding for my proposal to establish a National Biological Survey. This new bureau within the Department of the Interior will facilitate improvement in the quality of biological research. Better science will result in improved decision-making in the management of the Nation's federally managed lands and will enable Federal land managers to avoid future contentious actions under the Endangered Species Act.
The Act provides funding for a number of my investment proposals for energy conservation and fossil energy research and development. These investments are important for our Nation's energy future.
