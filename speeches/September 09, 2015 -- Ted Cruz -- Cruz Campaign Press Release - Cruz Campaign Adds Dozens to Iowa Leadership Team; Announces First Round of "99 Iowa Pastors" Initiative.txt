    HOUSTON, Texas – Today, the Cruz for President Campaign announced dozens of additions to Sen. Cruz's Iowa leadership team and county chairs coalition – comprised of Iowa activists and influencers who are taking an active role in the campaign.  The release also includes the first round of pastors joining the "99 Iowa Pastors" initiative to support Ted Cruz for President.
"The strength of our Iowa team is not just represented by growing numbers, but also by the broad base they represent and reach as they come together," said Sen. Cruz. "As we build our team in Iowa and across the country, we are very well represented in nearly every bracket of Republican caucus goers, specifically evangelicals, libertarians, and Tea Party conservatives. We don't just intend to play in Iowa, we intend to win."
Today's release also includes the first list of Iowa pastors who have joined the "99 Iowa Pastors" initiative that Sen. Cruz announced at the recent Rally for Religious Liberty in Des Moines.
"This effort grew organically out of our work to recruit county chairs," Sen. Cruz said. "Some of the first pastors to join the team have spearheaded an effort to recruit their peers, and I am thrilled to have them both supporting our campaign and lifting us up in prayer."
New additions to the Leadership Team include nationally syndicated talk radio host Steve Deace (Polk County,) and former Hampton Mayor Shawn Dietz (Franklin County).
