    We support Senator Manchin's decision not to press for a floor vote given the misguided Republican decision to put politics over progress by opposing his permitting reform plan. The President supports Senator Manchin's plan because it is necessary for our energy security, and to make more clean energy available to the American people. We will continue to work with him to find a vehicle to bring this bill to the floor and get it passed and to the President's desk.
