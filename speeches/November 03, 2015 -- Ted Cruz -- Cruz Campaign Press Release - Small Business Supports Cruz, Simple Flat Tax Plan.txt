  Ted Cruz for President and His Economic Policies

HOUSTON, TX â€“ Today, Presidential candidate Ted Cruz announced the creation of the Small Business for Cruz Coalition. The coalition will be led by National Co-Chairs J. Keet Lewis, and Joe and Gladys Grimaud, who also expressed support for Cruz's newly announced tax reform plan, the Simple Flat Tax.
"Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy, but in the current environment they are going out of business in record numbers," Cruz said. "We need to empower small business owners and entrepreneurs. Through lower taxes, less onerous regulations, and greater competition, we will unleash their ability to be an engine for growth and innovation. I am pleased to welcome these national and state small business leaders to kick off our Small Business for Cruz coalition."
Lewis is the co-founder of Lewis Group International, a consulting organization for launching innovative products in the health care/wellness, energy, and acoustic sound industries. The Grimauds own 190 Precision Tunes across the country, as well as a number of other businesses.
"Ted Cruz is in a unique position to reach the tens of millions of Small Business Owners in America with a clear, articulate and compelling conservative message," Lewis said. "SBO's represent 99.7 percent of U.S. employer firms and 63 percent of net new private-sector jobs. Ted Cruz grew up in a small business family and can therefore speak from experience to the millions of family-owned business proprietors, many of which are women-owned and/or minority-owned businesses. The Cruz Simple Flat Tax Plan will be a huge benefit to small business owners both in terms of tax rate reduction and reporting simplification."
"Ted Cruz is addressing one of the most important issues to our economy by tackling the tax code," Joe Grimaud said. "As a business man with a number of small corporations in several states, I find that keeping up with tax requirements is one of my biggest obstacles and expenses. With the IRS getting involved with Obamacare enforcement, it has become an even greater nightmare. Ted Cruz knows the Constitution and is not only willing to follow it but insists on doing so. He has shown that he is willing to go where others fear to tread in order to solve problems facing our country. We are in dire need of this kind of leadership."
