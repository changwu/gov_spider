    The administration announced today that it is surveying Members of the House and Senate to identify which Federal programs result in the most day-to-day problems for their constituents. The results of the survey will be used in pinpointing targets for President Carter's Government reorganization program.
The survey is one of several administration efforts to develop information on Government performance. Other sources will include: meetings with affected groups, field interviews with State and local officials, Federal Information Centers, analysis of White House mail, and suggestions solicited from the general public.
The survey, which began earlier this week, asks Congressmen and Senators to list those Federal programs which, based upon their own constituent casework, cause the most public dissatisfaction, frustration, and confusion.
In a June 29 press briefing on reorganization, President Carter said that congressional casework offers a unique source of information on the Federal Government's performance.
"Members of the House and Senate spend a good part of every day helping people cut through Government redtape," he said. "They know firsthand how the Government looks from the receiving end of the services."
