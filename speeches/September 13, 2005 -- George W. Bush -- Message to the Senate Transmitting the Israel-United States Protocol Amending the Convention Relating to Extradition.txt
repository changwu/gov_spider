    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Protocol between the Government of the United States and the Government of the State of Israel, signed at Jerusalem on July 6, 2005.
In addition, I transmit for the information of the Senate the report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol. As the report explains, the Protocol will not require implementing legislation.
The Protocol amends the Convention Relating to Extradition (the "1962 Convention"), signed at Washington on December 10, 1962. The Protocol updates the 1962 Convention in a manner consistent with our modern extradition treaties. The Protocol will, upon entry into force, enhance cooperation between the law enforcement communities of both nations and make a significant contribution to international law enforcement efforts.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.
