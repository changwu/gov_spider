    Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
I have appointed Secretary of Commerce Rogers C. B. Morton as Chairman of the Interdepartmental Savings Bonds Committee. He succeeds Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz, who has served in that capacity with great distinction since 1972.
The Savings Bond Program offers a convenient way for every American to build financial security.
The success of this vital program owes much to the broad acceptance by Federal employees of the Payroll Savings Plan. It is essential for each of us to provide effective leadership by encouraging every employee to buy Savings Bonds regularly.
Secretary Morton has my full support as he undertakes this new responsibility. I know he can count on your fullest personal interest and cooperation in attaining new high levels of participation in the Payroll Savings Plan throughout the Federal establishment.
