    In celebration of Mother's Day, the Clinton campaign today released a new television ad featuring Chelsea Clinton talking about the values passed down by her mother and how those values drive Hillary's commitment to public service.
The 60-second spot, entitled "Mothers Day," will be broadcast in Oregon Sunday.

The script of the ad follows below:
"Mothers Day"
TV: 60
Chelsea Clinton: I'd like to tell you about my mom. Yes, she's running for President, but she's always done a lot of running.
She'd run straight home from work to ensure we had dinner together every night. She'd run from one softball game to one soccer game to every ballet recital.
Like so many loving and devoted mothers I've met across this country, my mom raised me to believe in the values that are most important in life – self confidence, kindness, compassion and most of all, the golden rule. The values, I know, my grandmother passed on to her.
I know it's my mom's greatest wish that as President she can help all our children to feel safe, secure and loved. And give every boy and girl the opportunity that she's given me to fulfill their dreams.
I want to wish every mother out there a happy mothers day and remember your little girls can be anything they want to be in America when they grow up – even if it's to be the second woman President.
Happy Mother's Day
Senator Clinton: I am Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.a
