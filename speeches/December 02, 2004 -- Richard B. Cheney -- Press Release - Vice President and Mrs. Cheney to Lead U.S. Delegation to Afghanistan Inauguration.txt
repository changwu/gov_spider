    Vice President Cheney, accompanied by Mrs. Cheney, will lead the United States delegation to Kabul, Afghanistan for the December 7 inauguration of President Hamid Karzai.
On October 9, the people of Afghanistan went to 22,000 polling stations throughout the country to elect a president - a major step in their steady march toward democracy.
In addition to attending inaugural ceremonies, the Vice President's agenda will include consultations with President Karzai and senior officials on a range of issues, including ongoing cooperation in fighting the global war on terror and the continued progress of the Afghan people in building a free society. The Vice President also will thank U.S. and coalition troops for their service in Afghanistan.
