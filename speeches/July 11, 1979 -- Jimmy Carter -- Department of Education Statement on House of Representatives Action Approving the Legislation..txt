    The department of education legislation approved by the House today will streamline administration of more than 150 Federal education programs, saving tax dollars and cutting redtape. It will also permit better management of the Government's health and human service programs.
The department of education legislation is an important administration priority. It will make a single agency and a single Cabinet official responsible fulltime for Federal education programs. It will ensure that programs costing $14 billion annually receive the high-level management attention and broad public scrutiny they deserve.
I would like to thank Speaker O'Neill and others in the House leadership, Chairman Brooks, and Congressmen Fascell and Horton for their efforts on behalf of this historic legislation. I look forward to early action by the House-Senate conference committee.
