THANK YOU NEBRASKA! Get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors & co-workers & GET OUT AND VOTE! We didn't come this far and fight this hard to surrender our Country back to the Corrupt Washington Swamp. On 11/3 we must finish the job & Drain the Swamp once and for all!  https://t.co/G8Oqvi5YSaRetweets: 22359Favorites: 101358

As a developer long ago, and continuing to this day, the politicians ran Chicago into the ground. I was able to make an appropriately great deal with the numerous lenders on a large and very beautiful tower. Doesn't that make me a smart guy rather than a bad guy?Retweets: 21261Favorites: 141561

Covid, Covid, Covid is the unified chant of the Fake News Lamestream Media. They will talk about nothing else until November 4th., when the Election will be (hopefully!) over. Then the talk will be how low the death rate is, plenty of hospital rooms, & many tests of young people.Retweets: 32115Favorites: 158616

It's amazing. Twitter refuses to allow the any mention of the Biden corruption story which was carried so well on @TuckerCarlson last night. It's the biggest story and Big Tech, together with the Lamestream Media, isn't allowing a word to be said about it.Retweets: 55400Favorites: 183640

The USA doesn't have Freedom of the Press, we have Suppression of the Story, or just plain Fake News. So much has been learned in the last two weeks about how corrupt our Media is, and now Big Tech, maybe even worse. Repeal Section 230!Retweets: 47343Favorites: 183874

Who is Miles Taylor? Said he was anonymous, but I don't know him - never even heard of him. Just another @nytimes SCAM - he worked in conjunction with them. Also worked for Big Tech's @Google. Now works for Fake News @CNN. They should fire, shame, and punish everybody....Retweets: 25128Favorites: 107533

A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for the biggest TAX HIKE in history, crushing regulations, slashing Medicare and Social Security, and abolishing American Energy. A vote for Biden is a vote for open borders, offshoring jobs, shredding the Second Amendment...  https://t.co/lrveykMf4R Retweets: 14463Favorites: 57225
