    Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
I have just learned of the Knesset's favorable vote on the Camp David agreements and I want to extend my warmest personal congratulations to you. This action by the representatives of the Israeli people takes us another step toward the goal we seek of a peaceful Middle East.
I deeply admire the courage and skill with which you presented the agreements we reached at Camp David. You know that I understand the difficult choices that face you and your colleagues if peace is to become a reality. Your firm leadership on these vital issues has provided a new and impressive demonstration of your statesmanship.
With best wishes.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
[His Excellency Menachem Begin, Prime Minister of Israel]
