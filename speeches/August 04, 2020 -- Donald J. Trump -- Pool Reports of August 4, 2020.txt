 In-town pool report no. 12 -- resending 
*Apologies if this is going out twice, but I got a bounce-back when I first tried to send this.*
Standing in a very crowded Oval Office, POTUS joked to General Brown "this is your last chance" to get out, to laughter. He added, "You're a great gentleman, a great man... this is an amazing achievement."
After VPOTUS administered the oath and the defense secretary Mark Esper said a few words, Trump added:
"Greatest country in the world, you have all those brand new F-35s."
POTUS did not take any questions; pool was quickly ushered out of the Oval.
