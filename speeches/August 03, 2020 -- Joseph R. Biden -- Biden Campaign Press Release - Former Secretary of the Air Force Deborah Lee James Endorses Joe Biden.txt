    Today, former Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"As the former Secretary of the Air Force--then only the second female leader of a military department in American history--I saw firsthand Vice President Biden's leadership through his dedication and commitment to the men and women of the U.S. Air Force. Whether it involved a small group Oval Office conversation where we discussed how to ensure the safety of America's nuclear weapons enterprise or watching him share individual, personal moments with nearly 1,000 cadets at the Air Force Academy's commencement, Joe Biden has the moral compass, the intellect, and humanity this country sorely needs in a president right now.
"As Air Force Secretary, I was responsible for the Defense Department's efforts to protect and defend our nation's critical space assets and infrastructure, working closely with the dedicated women and men whose talent and creativity is required as we define this new domain. Owning the skies and winning in space means we'll need to do even more to attract diverse talent from every demographic and region of this country, men and women who can handle ambiguity and make split second decisions with life or death consequences. After three years leading the Air Force in the Obama-Biden administration, I know Joe Biden understands that America is strongest when its armed forces mirror the diversity of our country and when our country sees the best of itself reflected in our military.
I am proud to endorse Joe Biden for president of the United States and, this November, in 92 days I hope all Americans, especially those who understand the value and sacrifice of service, will join me in voting for him."
