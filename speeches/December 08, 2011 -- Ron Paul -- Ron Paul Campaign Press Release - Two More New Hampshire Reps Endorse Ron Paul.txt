    New endorsements include former Cain supporter
CONCORD, N.H. â€” Two additional NH State Representatives have endorsed Texas Congressman and 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul: State Representatives Kevin Reichard (R-Derry), formerly a Herman Cain supporter, and Kathy Souza (R-Manchester).
"Ron Paul is the only fiscal conservative in the race, and he is the only candidate who is talking about the deficits, and that's why I'm joining my other state representative in endorsing him," said Reichard.
"Our country is facing enormous challenges, and we need a candidate who is straightforward and direct with the American people," added Souza. "Ron Paul is that candidate, and he always gives plain, honest answers."
