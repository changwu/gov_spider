Fresh off of her historic victory at the Iowa caucus, Hillary headed to the Granite State for the homestretch before the New Hampshire primary.
Waiting for her there was a team of organizers, volunteers, and voters already hard at work.
First stop: Nashua—with crowds as far as the eye could see.


A group of Hillary and President Clinton's friends came all the way from Arkansas.


Inside, they were packed to the rafters, awaiting the warm-up act: President Bill Clinton.


Then it was Hillary's turn to take the stage.



It wouldn't be a day on the trail without a few selfies.



She made a quick stop for caffeine and conversation between events.



Meanwhile, the team hit the trail to help her fight for every vote.



Clipboards in hand, they're knocking on every door they can.


Day one down. One week left to get out the vote in New Hampshire—and Team Hillary is ready to work until the very end!
