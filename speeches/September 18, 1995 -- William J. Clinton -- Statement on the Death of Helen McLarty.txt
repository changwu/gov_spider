    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of a wonderful woman and good family friend, Helen McLarty.
I have known Helen McLarty my entire life. She was an exemplary citizen and a devoted wife and mother. Like my own mother, she fought a long battle against cancer with courage and perseverance. Throughout her illness, she was a constant source of strength to all of those around her.
In addition to the love and support she gave to her family, Helen McLarty was a remarkable citizen whose contributions to her community— as the first woman to serve on the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission and as a partner with her husband in building the McLarty Companies into one of the region's largest transportation firms—will not be forgotten.
Our thoughts and prayers are with Helen's sons, Mack and Bud McLarty, her grandchildren, and the rest of her family and friends during this difficult time.
