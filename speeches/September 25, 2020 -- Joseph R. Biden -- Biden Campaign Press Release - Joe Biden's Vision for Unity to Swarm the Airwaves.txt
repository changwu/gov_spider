    Campaign to Also Air New Social Security Ad Targeting Older Americans
Today, Biden for President released a new 0:60 ad titled "New Start" that draws a sharp contrast between Donald Trump's anger and division with Joe Biden's compassion and vision for unity. The ad showcases Biden's optimism and how America can tackle the four crises at hand: to control the virus and make health care affordable, reward work to fuel economic prosperity, make our nation safe and just, and deal with the existential threat of climate change.

"I don't pledge allegiance to red states of America or blue states of America — I pledge allegiance to the United States of America," Joe Biden says in the new ad, pulling from his speech earlier this week in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. "I'm going to fight as hard for those who supported me as those who did not support me. We have a chance to put the anger and division that have overtaken this country behind us. And we can."
Additionally, the campaign also released "Wipe Out," another ad targeting older Americans across battleground states to underscore how Donald Trump's proposed plans would wipe out Social Security funds in the next three years. The 0:30 spot features Biden directly emphasizing his commitment to protecting critical programs for American seniors, including Social Security and Medicare.

The ads will air nationally on cable as well as television airwaves and digital platforms in a total of 13 states of where the campaign's paid media program is active — including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.
