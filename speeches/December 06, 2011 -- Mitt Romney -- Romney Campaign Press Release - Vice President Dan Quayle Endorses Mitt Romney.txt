    Mitt Romney today announced the support of former Vice President Dan Quayle.
"I am humbled to have Vice President Quayle's support," said Mitt Romney. "He has served our country with honor and distinction. I hope to work with leaders like Vice President Quayle to reestablish faith in our economy, stop the growth of government, and ensure that the United States remains the strongest country in the world."
Announcing his support, Vice President Quayle said, "Because of President Obama's failed leadership, Washington has become dysfunctional. We need a leader from outside of the Washington establishment to get America back on track.  Mitt Romney has proven over and over that he is a leader.  He is a man of integrity. He understands budgets and financial markets. He is strong on national defense and has a deep love of the conservative philosophy that makes America great. Governor Mitt Romney has what it takes to be a great President of the United States and that is why I enthusiastically endorse him for President."
