    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Anderson (D) California and 33 others)
If H.R. 4844 were presented to the President, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget would recommend that he veto it because Section 10 would: (1) unacceptably interfere with the President's ability to manage the Executive branch, and (2) unjustifiably erode his authority to control reporting and other Federally imposed paperwork burdens under the Paperwork Reduction Act.
The Administration strongly supports the enactment of legislation necessary to combat the problem of drug abuse. In this regard, the Department of Transportation is already in the process of considering or implementing changes to FAA Aircraft Registry and other procedures addressed by the bill. Moreover, Section 10 includes highly objectionable provisions, unrelated to combatting drug abuse, which would (1) require the FAA to transmit to the Congress "any budget estimate, budget request, supplemental budget estimate, or other budget information, legislative recommendation, or comment on legislation at the same time they are submitted to OMB or the President;" and (2) exempt "information collection requests necessary to carry out" the bill's provisions from review or approval pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act.
