    President Bush believes that one of the most effective weapons in the defeat of communism in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and elsewhere has been the power of truth broadcast by America's international broadcasters: Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, and Radio and TV Marti. As democracy's victory is consolidated in the months and years to come, we will continue to need these broadcasts. The President intends to see that they remain active and effective.
These voices of freedom and democracy have a vital role to play in a post-cold-war world where dictatorship and repression continue. Indeed, they are also welcomed as a stimulus and an example in newly emerging democratic states that are developing their own free and independent media. For hundreds of millions in Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and especially in Cuba, these broadcasts are a beacon of hope that must continue to shine. The President is committed to keeping that light shining brightly.
