    As Russia struggles on the battlefield, it is increasingly turning to horrific attacks against the Ukrainian people with punishing strikes damaging energy grid infrastructure, and deliberately doing so as winter approaches. These strikes do not appear aimed at any military purpose and instead further the goal of the Putin regime to increase the suffering and death of Ukrainian men, women and children. It also shows Russia is willing to increase the risk of a nuclear safety incident that could not only further harm Ukraine, but affect the entire region as well. The United States and our allies and partners will continue to provide Ukraine with what it needs to defend itself including air defense. Today, we announced an additional $400 million security assistance package that includes additional munitions for the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) and heavy machine guns to help Ukraine counter these urgent threats. We are in constant touch with Ukraine on its energy infrastructure needs and are working with allies and partners to support Ukraine – including the United States' provision of $1.5 billion in humanitarian assistance since February with more than $250 million for winterization efforts to distribute heating fuel, generators, shelter repair materials, and blankets. Russia continues to underestimate the strength and resolve of the Ukrainian people and its attempt to demoralize them will fail yet again.
