After the South Carolina primary, Hillary Clinton had a message for people across the country: We are in this together—and together, we can break down all the barriers we face.
"When we stand together, there is no barrier too big to break."


"Tomorrow, this campaign goes national. We are going to compete for every vote in every state. We are not taking anything—and we're not taking anyone—for granted."


"This campaign—and this victory tonight—is for the parents and teachers in rural South Carolina. They showed me crumbling classrooms in communities too long neglected."



"This campaign—and our victory—is for the entrepreneur who told me, ?more dreams die in the parking lot of banks than anywhere else.' And that's especially true for women and people of color."


"Let's break down the barriers that keep people on the sidelines of our economy, especially women."


"Let's break down the barriers holding back our young people—especially the student debt that makes it hard to imagine ever living the life you want."



"I want to pay tribute to five extraordinary women who crisscrossed this state with me and for me. Five mothers brought together by tragedy. ... They are reminding us of something deep and powerful in the American spirit."


"Our country was built by people who had each other's backs. Who understood we all have to do our part—and that, at our best, we all rise together."


"Imagine a tomorrow where no child grows up in the shadow of discrimination or under the specter of deportation."




"Imagine a tomorrow where hard work is honored, families are supported, and communities are strong. When we trust and respect each other, despite all that divides us."


"Imagine what we can build together."
