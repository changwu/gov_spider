    It is with deep regret that I have learned of the death of His Excellency Houari Boumediene, President of the Algerian Democratic and Popular Republic and President of the Council of the Revolution. President Boumediene played an outstanding role in Algeria's long struggle for independence. His devotion to duty and his contributions as an international statesman are well known. But it is for his efforts to help create and strengthen an independent, self-sufficient Algerian nation that he will be most remembered.
Rosalynn and I extend our condolences to President Boumediene's family and to the Algerian people, who have lost a leader whom the world will long remember.
