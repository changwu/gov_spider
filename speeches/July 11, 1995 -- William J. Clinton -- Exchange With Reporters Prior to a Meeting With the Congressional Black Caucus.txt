President Boris Yeltsin of Russia
Q. Any further word on Boris Yeltsin and how that might impact on U.S.-Russian relations?
The President. No. I got another report after this morning's meeting with congressional leadership, and our latest report is that he seems to be resting well and feeling pretty good and making some decisions from the hospital. That's the latest report I gotâ€”is about 30 minutes ago.
