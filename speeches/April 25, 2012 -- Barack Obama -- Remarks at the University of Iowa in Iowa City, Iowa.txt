    Hello, everybody. It is great to be back in Iowa City. I'm not going to give a long speech here. I just want to say thank you to all the people who are taking an interest in this important issue. I know we've got a lot of students here. Everybody cares about making sure you guys can pay for college in an affordable way, so that's what I'm going to be talking about.
But I just want to tell all of you I couldn't appreciate you more, taking the time to come out, and I hope that--how many seniors do we have here? [Applause] All right. Seniors, you've got just a few more weeks to go, so make sure to finish strong; don't goof off too much. [Laughter]
And I just want you to know that Iowa always feels like home to me because I spend so much time here. So all right, thank you, everybody. I'm going to shake some hands. Thanks, everybody.
