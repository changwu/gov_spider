"The three things basically agreed to there will be a closing statement and an opening statement, there will be fair time, equal time, and questions to all the candidates — and that's a plus, Pataki, a former governor of New York, said Monday on "Newsmax Prime" with J.D. Hayworth.
"I don't care about the questions, I'm in New York, I've dealt with the New York press forever and they're as bad as you can get. All I want is the opportunity to make the case to the American people."
Pataki said the next debate — set for Nov. 10th on Fox Business Network — will "follow the old rules."
