    Nearly 15,000 grassroots supporters from all 50 states responded to the one-week challenge, surpassing goal
Demonstrating a groundswell of grassroots support, Hillary Clinton's campaign today announced it raised over $1 million from nearly 15,000 grassroots supporters through a one-week online campaign. Last Wednesday, the campaign kicked off the effort to raise $1 million in grassroots donations through an e-mail from President Clinton encouraging Americans to show their support for Hillary's campaign.
In a note to supporters today, Hillary wrote: "I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of support you showed me during our "One Week, One Million" drive. It was an incredible success, and it means so much to me knowing that I have so many friends all over the country who are committed to our campaign."
In addition to raising over $1 million from grassroots supporters – and surpassing its goal – the campaign announced that:
