    The President welcomes the agreement in principle reached Saturday between the U.S. Trade Representative and Canadian officials to resolve longstanding bilateral differences over access for American beer to the Canadian market. The agreement is an indication of the importance of our bilateral trading relationship and the willingness of the U.S. and Canada to work cooperatively to resolve trade differences.
