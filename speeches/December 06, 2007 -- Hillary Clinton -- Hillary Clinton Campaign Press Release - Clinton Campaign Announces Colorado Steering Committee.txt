    The Clinton campaign today announced its Colorado Steering Committee, made up of community leaders from across the state who will mobilize grassroots support for Hillary leading up to Colorado's February 5th caucus.
"Coloradans know that Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to create the real change America needs," said Congresswoman Diana DeGette, Co-Chair of the Campaign's Health Care Policy Task Force.
"We are delighted to see such strong enthusiasm for Hillary from across Colorado," said former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb, a national Campaign co-Chair. "These community leaders will be critical to growing the strong grassroots support Hillary will need to win on February 5th."
