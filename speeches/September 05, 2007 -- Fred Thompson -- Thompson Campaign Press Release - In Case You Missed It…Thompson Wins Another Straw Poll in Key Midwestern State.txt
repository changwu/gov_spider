Two polls in Minnesota have shown surprising strength for Fred Thompson, one all the more so because he wasn't even listed as a candidate. On August 22nd, the state GOP held a straw poll designed to help boost party donations at the River Center in St. Paul, emceed by local radio host Jason Lewis. Campaign activists for most candidates produced video presentations for poll attendees, but none for Thompson...His name did not appear on the ballot. On the strength of write-ins, though Thompson won the poll .
Thompson - 22%
Romney - 19%
Ron Paul - 16%
Giuliani - 13%
McCain - 11%
...
The next week, Thompson made his appearance at the Minnesota State Fair. He must have made an impact, because he followed his surprise at the 8/22 straw poll with another good showing at the state GOP's booth straw poll for the fair. The results look promising for Thompson:


Thompson: 1,989 (32.84%)
Giuliani: 1,272 (21.00%)
Romney: 876 (14.46%)
McCain: 500 (8.26%)
...
That shows remarkable strength for a man who has yet to break out into full campaign mode. Minnesota could be a key state this year, since it has moved its caucuses to February 5th. They're non-binding but mostly definitive. If Fred can keep his popularity in Minnesota through the next four months, he could score an impressive win.
