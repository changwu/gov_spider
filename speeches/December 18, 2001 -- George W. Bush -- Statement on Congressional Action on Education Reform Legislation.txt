    I commend Members of Congress for acting boldly and in an overwhelmingly bipartisan way to help make sure no child in America is left behind. These historic reforms will improve our public schools by creating an environment where every child can learn through real accountability, unprecedented flexibility for States and school districts, greater local control, more options for parents, and more funding for what works.
Many share in the credit for making these reforms a reality. I look forward to standing side by side with the bipartisan leadership, Congressman Boehner, Senator Kennedy, Senator Gregg, and Congressman Miller, early next year and signing these important reforms into law.
By putting aside partisan differences and working to find common ground, we can get things done so that all our children have the opportunity for a better and brighter future.
