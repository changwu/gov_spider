Out of Town Pool Report #4 - Shopping + color + leadership
When POTUS and FLOTUS exited David Chase at 1:09 p.m., the crowd of people waiting in the windy 46-degree afternoon erupted. POTUS raised a hand to acknowledge the people. One person shouted "love you" as the Bidens crossed the street, and POTUS responded "Thank you!"
POTUS and FLOTUS continued shopping. Hunter Biden, his wife Melissa Cohen, Ashley Biden and Baby Beau are with them.
POTUS has been shopping a little more than an hour and stopped in at least nine stores.
POTUS exited a store at 1:58 p.m. The pool asked if he'd spoken with new congressional leadership, and he responded, in part: "You ask the most unusual questions — when I get to Washington."
He's still shopping.

Out of Town Pool Report #10 - Lid
After the pool left, this tweet (https://twitter.com/lukerussert/status/1596642161952542722?s=46&t=ObMtsW...) indicated the president donated to the church — but pool did not witness that.
Lid was called at 6:05 p.m. Pool did not see the president exit his vehicle at the home where he's staying.
A huge thanks to Emily Goodin, Aurelia End and Josh Wingrove and for their help today.
Have a good night,Man From Nantucket
