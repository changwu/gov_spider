    On the eve of the G7 in the United Kingdom, President Biden announced that the United States will donate half a billion Pfizer vaccines to 92 low- and lower middle-income countries and the African Union – a historic action that will help supercharge the global fight against the pandemic. The announcement demonstrates how the U.S. is using the power of our democracy, the ingenuity of American scientists, and the strength of American manufacturing to beat the pandemic globally by helping to vaccinate the world. This is the largest-ever purchase and donation of COVID vaccines by a single country and a commitment by the American people to help protect people around the world from COVID-19.
Here is what they are saying:

The Democratic Congress looks forward to continuing our partnership with the Biden-Harris Administration to crush the virus at home and abroad and finally end this pandemic.
