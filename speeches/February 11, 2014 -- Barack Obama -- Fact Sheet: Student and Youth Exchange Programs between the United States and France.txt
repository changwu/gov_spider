    The United States and France have a long history of cultural exchange, dating back to the connections forged by Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson as two of the United States' earliest envoys to Paris. Our exchange programs strengthen academic partnerships, promote the value of community service, and spark entrepreneurship and innovation. We put special emphasis on building connections between French and American youth from different backgrounds.
Fulbright: In 2013, the Franco-American Commission for Educational Exchange celebrated its 65th anniversary by launching the Fulbright International Educators program, which brings key decision-makers from U.S. academic institutions to France to discuss cooperation and opportunities for student exchange. Since 1948, approximately 20,000 American and French students and scholars have participated in the Fulbright program. Prominent French alumni include philosopher Jacques Derrida; writers Eugene Ionesco, Alain Robbe-Grillet, and Nathalie Sarraute; and Dr. Christian Cabrol, who performed Europe's first heart transplant. Well-known American alumni include composer Philip Glass, writer Ursula LeGuin, poet John Ashbery, and Nobel Prize winning physicist Charles Townes. The France Fulbright Alumni Association is helping to recruit the next generation of Fulbright students and scholars.
