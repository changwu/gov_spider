    Hanover, NH - Newt Gingrich made the following statement today in response to this morning's report of 8.5% unemployment for the month of December 2011:
 
"Three full years into the Obama presidency, and there are still 1.7 million fewer Americans going to work today than there were on Obama's Inauguration day.
"Today's new December unemployment figure doesn't capture the full scale of the tragedy: almost 24 million Americans still unemployed, working part-time for economic reasons, or discouraged from looking for work.
"The Obama experiment has failed, and it is time to look to proven solutions that have successfully empowered job-creators in the past.
"Ronald Reagan enacted historic income tax rate cuts, a stronger and more stable dollar, regulatory reforms, and spending controls. Three years into his recovery, Americans had created about 9.5 million jobs. When we took control of the House in 1995, we moved quickly to balance the budget, reform entitlements, and make the largest capital gains tax cut in history – three years later, 8 million more Americans were going into work every day.
"Now more than ever, America needs a Reagan conservative in the White House."
