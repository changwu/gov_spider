    Today our Nation marks another tragic milestone: 900,000 American lives have been lost to COVID-19. They were beloved mothers and fathers, grandparents, children, brothers and sisters, neighbors, and friends. Each soul is irreplaceable. We pray for the loved ones they have left behind, and together we keep every family enduring this pain in our hearts.
After nearly 2 years, I know that the emotional, physical, and psychological weight of this pandemic has been incredibly difficult to bear. I know what it's like to stare at an empty chair around the kitchen table. But I also know that we carry an incredible capacity within ourselves: not only to come through our grief stronger, but to come together to protect one another.
We now have more tools than ever before to save lives and fight this virus, with vaccines remaining our most important tool. Vaccines and boosters have proven incredibly effective, and offer the highest level of protection. Two hundred and fifty million Americans have stepped up to protect themselves, their families, and their communities by getting at least one shot, and we have saved more than 1 million American lives as a result.
We can save even more lives—and spare countless families from the deepest pain imaginable—if everybody does their part. I urge all Americans: Get vaccinated, get your kids vaccinated, and get your booster shot if you are eligible. It's free, easy, and effective, and it can save your life, and the lives of those you love.
