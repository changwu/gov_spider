    Dear Mr. Chairman:
Pursuant to section 514 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 (Public Law 103-236), and section 205 of the NATO Participation Act of 1994 (title II of Public Law 103-447), I hereby transmit to you a report concerning Partnership for Peace (PFP) developments through July 15, 2000.
The PFP has been an unqualified success since its establishment in 1994. As reviewed in this year's report, through the PFP, Partners have built stronger ties with the Alliance and developed closer cooperative relationships with their neighbors. The PFP, and its political component, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, have also provided a means for incorporating Partners into NATO's operations in Bosnia and Kosovo, and assisting those countries that want to join NATO to implement reforms through the Membership Action Plan process. In addition, enhancements to the PFP have provided an improved mechanism for Partners to use in developing the interoperability with NATO that will be necessary for future NATO-led Allied/ Partner missions.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
