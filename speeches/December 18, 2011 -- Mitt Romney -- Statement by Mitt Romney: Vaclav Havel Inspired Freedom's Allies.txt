    Mitt Romney made the following statement on the passing of Vaclav Havel:
"In the darkest days of tyranny, Vaclav Havel shined a light on the injustices and contradictions of communism. The power of his words and the depth of his courage inspired freedom's allies in his homeland and around the world. The Velvet Revolution he led changed the course of history, and helped bring to an end an empire of oppression. He will be remembered as one of history's great men: the scourge of tyrants and a champion for liberty.
