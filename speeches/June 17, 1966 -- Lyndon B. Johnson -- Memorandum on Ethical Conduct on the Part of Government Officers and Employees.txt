    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
I am pleased to share with you the enclosed report from John Macy concerning ethical conduct of Government officers and employees. Your thoughtful and diligent implementation of the new standards of Executive Order 11222 is commendable.
The traditions of honesty and integrity in the military and civil service of the United States are properly a source of pride for all Americans. We intend in this Administration to ensure that their pride and confidence are maintained and strengthened. We hold a public trust, and we shall hold it high.
I expect you to see to it that officers and employees throughout your agency adhere firmly and without compromise to their responsibility for fair and impartial dealings with all who have business with the Government.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
