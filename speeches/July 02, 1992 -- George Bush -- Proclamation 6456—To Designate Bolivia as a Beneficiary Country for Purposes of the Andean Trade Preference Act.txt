  A Proclamation

1. Sections 202 and 204 of the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) and 3203) confer authority upon the President to proclaim duty-free treatment for all eligible articles, and duty reductions for certain other articles, that are the product of any country designated as a "beneficiary country" in accordance with the provisions of section 203 of the ATPA
2. Pursuant to section 203(b)(2) of the ATPA (b)(2)), I have notified the House of Representatives and the Senate of my intention to designate Bolivia as a beneficiary country for purposes of the ATPA, together with the considerations entering into such decision.
3. In order to make this designation under the ATPA, it is necessary to modify general note 3(c)(ix) to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), thus incorporating the substance of this designation under the ATPA, pursuant to section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 (the Trade Act)
Now, Therefore, I, George Bush, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to the ATPA and section 604 of the Trade Act, do proclaim that:
(1) General note 3(c)(ix)(A) to the HTS is modified by inserting in alphabetical sequence "Bolivia", which is hereby designated as a beneficiary country under the ATPA.
(2) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders inconsistent with the provisions of this proclamation are hereby superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
(3) The modifications may by this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 15 days after the date of publication of this proclamation in the Federal Register.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixteen.

GEORGE BUSH
