    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate Floor) (Sponsors: Livingston (R), Louisiana; Callahan (R), Alabama; Hatfield (R), Oregon; McConnell (R), Kentucky)
This Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views on the item reported in disagreement by the conference on H.R. 1868, the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill, FY 1996. Your consideration of the Administration's views would be appreciated.
The Administration opposes the substitute for section 518, as it passed the House. The substitute language would require that all funding for international population activities, including the U.S. contribution to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), be subject to specific authorization, a requirement to Which no other program in this bill is subjected. The effect of this provision would be to strip the bill of funding for international family planning and risk the end of all U.S. support for these vital programs and services. If the substitute language were included in the final Foreign Operations appropriations conference report, the Secretary of State would recommend that the President veto the bill.
If the bill were passed without the previous House-passed language on population (section 518), without the substitute House language adopted on December 13, 1995, and without alternative language that has the effect of reinstituting restrictions on the privately funded legal activities of foreign non-governmental organizations, the Secretary of State would recommend that the President sign the bill.
