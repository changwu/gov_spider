    President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will welcome their majesties King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain to the White House on June 19, 2018. As their majesties visit the United States to celebrate the 300th anniversaries of the founding of the great American cities of New Orleans, Louisiana, and San Antonio, Texas, we will recognize the historical ties between the United States and Spain that serve as a foundation for our deep partnership and friendship today.
