    MANY AMERICANS who watch the political turmoil and our military progress in the battle against aggression in Vietnam are not always conscious of our effort to win the "other war" in this devastated country. This is a war against misery and want, against insecurity and terrorism, and for better education, health, and welfare for the people of Vietnam.
I regard these programs of pacification and development, to which our own military establishment also contributes heavily, as equal in importance to the magnificent effort of our military men.
The progress reported to me by Ambassador Porter is impressive, even though I will be the first to say that we and our Vietnamese allies still have a long way to go. We will continue to collaborate fully with Vietnam in those social, economic, and health- education-welfare programs designed to provide an embattled people with security and the essentials to which they are entitled.
