    Dear Mr. Secretary:
Pursuant to Section 202(b) of the Trade Act of 1974, I have determined that provision of import relief on U.S. imports of iron or steel lag screws or bolts, bolts (except mine-roof bolts) and bolts and their nuts in the same shipment, nuts, and screws having shanks or threads over 0.24 inch in diameter, provided for in items 646.49, 646.54, 646.56, and 646.63 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) would not be in the national economic interest.
In conjunction with my decision not to provide import relief to the domestic bolt, nut, and large screw industry, I have determined that, in light of a recent Federal Preparedness Agency (FPA) staff study which indicates that domestic fastener production capability is not adequate to satisfy wartime metal fastener requirements, further investigation of U.S. national security interests as they relate to bolts, nuts, and large screws is warranted. Accordingly, I hereby direct that you undertake an expedited national security investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 USC 1862) pertaining to U.S. imports of iron or steel lag screws and bolts, bolts (except mine-roof bolts), nuts, and large screws provided for in TSUS items 646.49, 646.54, 646.56, and 646.63.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
[The Honorable W. Michael Blumenthal, Secretary of the Treasury, Washington, D.C. 20220]
