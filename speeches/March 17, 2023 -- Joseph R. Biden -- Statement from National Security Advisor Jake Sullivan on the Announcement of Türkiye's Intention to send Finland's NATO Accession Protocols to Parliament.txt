    The United States welcomes President Erdogan's announcement that he will send Finland's NATO accession protocols to the Turkish Parliament and looks forward to the prompt conclusion of that process. We encourage Türkiye to quickly ratify Sweden's accession protocols as well. In addition, we urge Hungary to conclude its ratification process for both Finland and Sweden without delay. Sweden and Finland are both strong, capable partners that share NATO's values and will strengthen the Alliance and contribute to European security. The United States believes that both countries should become members of NATO as soon as possible.
