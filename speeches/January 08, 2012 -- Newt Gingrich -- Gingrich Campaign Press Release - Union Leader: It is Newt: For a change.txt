Of the candidates who have legitimate claims on the conservative name, this newspaper has endorsed Newt Gingrich. We were alone for awhile, but others have since taken Gingrich's side. (They include economists Thomas Sowell and Art Laffer, the father of supply side economics, by the way.) The case for Gingrich is not that he is the best debater. Simply put, he is the only candidate in this primary who could both beat President Obama and bring real, conservative change to Washington.
  ...
  Gingrich can win in November. What would happen if he did? He would immediately work to build broad support for cutting federal spending, reforming entitlements, undoing Obamacare, balancing the budget, slashing the regulatory burden, instituting strongly pro-growth tax cuts, and reinvigorating the American military.
A President Romney would competently manage Washington's status quo. A President Gingrich would strive in his first term to upend the status quo and replace it with a government that works for and with the people, not against them.
That's conservative. And it's needed — this year, not in four years. Voters who want to change Washington the right way have only one choice this year: Newt Gingrich.
