Governor Romney's Initiatives To Encourage Cleaner And More Efficient Energy Sources:
Governor Romney Believes That Coal Is An Important Part Of America's Energy Mix But That We Must Become Cleaner And More Efficient In How We Power Our Country. To find these cleaner and more efficient sources of energy, Governor Romney will invest in research and innovation.
Governor Romney Will Foster Innovation And New Technologies Through Funding For Research. Governor Romney's administration will review how government invests our research dollars. The United States must invest more research dollars in power generation, fuel technology and materials science. It is in new technologies that we will find solutions to our environmental and energy needs.
- For Example, New Clean Coal Technologies Are Emerging, And Some Are Already Here. Fluidized-Bed Combustion and Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle are two exciting and promising technologies. American Electric Power has announced plans for IGCC projects in West Virginia. Next, we can expect hybrid concepts such as combining combustion and gasification for even cleaner and more efficient power generation.
