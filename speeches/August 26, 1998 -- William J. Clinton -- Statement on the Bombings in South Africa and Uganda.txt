    Hillary and I join the American people in extending our deepest sympathies to the victims of bomb attacks in South Africa and Uganda on August 25, and to their families and friends. We reaffirm our unshakeable friendship and support for them and for all of the people of South Africa and Uganda.
The United States condemns, in the strongest possible terms, these senseless attacks on innocent civilians that have taken the lives of at least 29 Ugandans and 2 South Africans.
Earlier this month, South Africa provided immediate and invaluable assistance to the United States, Kenya, and Tanzania in the wake of the bombings of the U.S. Embassies in those countries. We are grateful for the generous response and will do what we can to assist South Africa and Uganda in the wake of these senseless acts.
