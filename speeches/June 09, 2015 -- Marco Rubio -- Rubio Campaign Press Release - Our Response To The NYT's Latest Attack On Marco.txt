June 9, 2015Alex Conant
The New York Times today attacked Marco because he could not afford to pay for college, arrogantly describing his student loan debt as 'a deep financial hole of his own making.' The attack from The Times is just the latest in their continued hits against Marco and his family.
First The New York Times attacked Marco over traffic tickets, and now they think he doesn't have enough money. Of course if he was worth millions, The Times would then attack him for being too rich, like they did to Mitt Romney.
What The Times misses is that getting rich is not what has driven Senator Rubio's financial decisions. His goal at this stage in his life is to provide his four children with a good home, a quality education, and a safe and happy upbringing. As he wrote in his book,

"The mark I make in this world will not be decided by how much money I make or how many titles I attain. Rather, the greatest mark I can leave is the one I will make as a father and a husband."
The Truth About Marco's Personal Finances

Marco has a single debt, the mortgage on his home.
Marco has decided to send his four children to private Christian schools in Miami, and has created college savings accounts for each kid.
Over the last several years, Marco has donated close to $150,000 to charity.
Marco's monthly financial obligations do not put his family finances above the 43 percent debt-to-income ratio the federal government suggests is worrisome.
Marco's paid off over $150,000 in student loans from his undergraduate and law degree.
