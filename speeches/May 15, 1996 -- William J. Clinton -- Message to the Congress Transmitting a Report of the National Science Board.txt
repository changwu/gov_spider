    To the Congress of the United States:
As required by 42 U.S.C. 1863(j)(1), I am pleased to submit to the Congress a report of the National Science Board entitled Science and Engineering Indicators—1996. This report represents the twelfth in a series examining key aspects of the status of American science and engineering in a global environment.
The science and technology enterprise is a source of discovery and inspiration and is key to the future of our Nation. The United States must sustain world leadership in science, mathematics, and engineering if we are to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.
I commend Science and Engineering Indicators—1996 to the attention of the Congress and those in the scientific and technology communities.
