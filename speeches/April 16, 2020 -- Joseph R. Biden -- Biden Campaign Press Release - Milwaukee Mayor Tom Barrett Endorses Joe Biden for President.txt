    Today, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"In this time of great crisis, we need a stable leader in the White House that will put the health and safety of Wisconsinites first – and that's Joe Biden.
"In both his personal and professional life, Joe has been tested. And like the Milwaukeeans I serve every day, he's been knocked down – but he always gets back up and lends a helping hand to his neighbors.
"As president, Joe will go to bat for the little guy – working tirelessly to make sure that every Milwaukeean has a shot to succeed, no matter what neighborhood they come from. He'll rebuild America by investing in our cities, our schools, and our infrastructure, and he will be a great partner on important initiatives that I have been fighting for in Milwaukee, such as expanding early childhood education and creating more family-supporting jobs in neighborhoods that need them most. That's the kind of leadership we need in the White House, and that's why I'll work hand in hand with Joe to make sure he wins Wisconsin in November."
In Wisconsin, Biden for President has announced more than 50 endorsements from leaders across the state – including Senator Tammy Baldwin, Congressman Ron Kind, former Governor Jim Doyle, former U.S. Senator Herb Kohl, Senate Democratic Leader Jennifer Shilling, Assembly Democratic Leader Gordon Hintz, and Milwaukee County Democrats Chair Chris Walton.
Biden for President has previously announced more than 2,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
