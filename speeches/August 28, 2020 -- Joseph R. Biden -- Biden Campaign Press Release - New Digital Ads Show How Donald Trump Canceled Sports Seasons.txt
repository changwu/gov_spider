    Campaign Launches Nationwide YouTube Masthead Takeover, Tailored Spots Towards Fans in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin
Today, Biden for President released a new minute-long digital ad casting light on the harsh reality Republicans swept under the rug during their convention: empty stadiums, deserted classrooms, and closed businesses.
The minute-long ad, "Anthem," plays a rendition of the national anthem overlaid with jarring images of the realities Trump's mismanagement of the public health and economic crisis have posed for our country. The ad underscores that even as the ongoing pandemic and economic crisis sweeps the nation, Donald Trump and Republicans pretended that his administration's failed leadership haven't upended the everyday lives of working Americans and their families.
The spot has been cut for a 30-second version that will take over the YouTube Masthead and featured on CBS Sports nationwide on Friday. Additionally, 15-second versions will appear on YouTube, Hulu, Viacom, and other digital platforms, with each version tailored towards specific communities and fanbases in battleground states where team seasons have been canceled â€” including in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.
 Watch "Anthem" HERE.
These ads are all part of Biden for President's ongoing paid media program across broadcast and digital, which amounts for $26 million in spending this week.
