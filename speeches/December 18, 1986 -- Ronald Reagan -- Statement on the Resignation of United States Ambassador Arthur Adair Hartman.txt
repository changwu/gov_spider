    Ambassador Arthur Hartman will relinquish his post in our Moscow Embassy early next year. I will miss his wise counsel, most recently exemplified by his presence with me in Reykjavik, and his expertise on East-West relations. He has had a distinguished Foreign Service career and was a major player in the important arena of United States-Soviet relations. He is regarded with great respect and admiration by all of us who know him. I wish him the very best, expressing my personal gratitude for his outstanding service for over 5 years in this most challenging assignment.
