    Michelle and I extend our greetings for a happy Eid al-Adha to Muslims worldwide and wish safe travels to those performing Hajj. This year, nearly 3 million pilgrims from more than 160 countries, including the United States, have gathered in Mecca and neighboring sites to perform the Hajj rituals and stand together in prayer.
On Eid, Muslims around the world will commemorate Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son and distribute food to those less fortunate, a reminder of the shared values and the common roots of three of the world's major religions.
On behalf of the American people, we extend our best wishes during this Hajj season. Eid Mubarak and Hajj Mabroor.
