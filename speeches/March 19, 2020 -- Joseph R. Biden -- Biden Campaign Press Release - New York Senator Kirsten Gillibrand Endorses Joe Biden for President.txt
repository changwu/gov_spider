    Today, New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for the President of the United States:
"It is clear that our country desperately needs a president with experience, honesty and integrity -- that person is Vice President Joe Biden. Not only does Joe have the experience to lead our country, but he has the empathy and character to go with it. Joe will fight for policies that reward work, such as the FAMILY Act, and will be a champion for women and families, workers, and young people. I am proud to endorse Joe and I look forward to working with him to take back the White House, and to elect Democrats up and down the ballot."
Biden leads the field in congressional endorsements with support from more than 100 U.S. Representatives and 15 U.S. Senators, including the most endorsements from members of both the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Gillibrand is the thirteenth former Democratic presidential candidate to endorse Biden.
Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 2,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
