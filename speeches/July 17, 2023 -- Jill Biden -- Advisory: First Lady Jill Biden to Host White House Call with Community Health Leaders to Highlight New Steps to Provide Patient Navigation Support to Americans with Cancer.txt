    On Wednesday, July 17, at 11:30 AM ET, as part of the Biden Cancer Moonshot, the White House will convene a call with First Lady Jill Biden, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), community health leaders, and patient advocates to highlight a new proposed rule from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) that would ensure Medicare patients can benefit from services and support that help them navigate their cancer journey. As part of the President's State of the Union earlier this year, the Biden Cancer Moonshot announced it was taking steps to expand access to patient navigation services for Americans who are facing cancer. Dr. Biden will be joined by Deputy Assistant to the President for the Cancer Moonshot and OSTP Deputy Director Dr. Danielle Carnival, who will share progress on the Administration's whole-of-government approach to better support patients and caregivers as part of ending cancer as we know it.
