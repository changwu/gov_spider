"I live in New York. Even the most Liberal friends that I have are thinking twice about voting Democrat this time because they've seen what's happened to the City under @NYCMayor de Blasio and the State under @NYGovCuomo - They're getting eaten up by taxes." @DavidAsmanfoxRetweets: 27594Favorites: 112700

Sarah is correct. McCain was a lousy candidate with lots of bad policy, but the "deadheads" sabotaged his campaign from the inside, and never gave him a chance to win. Hope they were happy with OBiden, who gave you me! https://t.co/rynLuGRKHARetweets: 13187Favorites: 47478

The Democrats are demanding Mail-In Ballots because the enthusiasm meter for Slow Joe Biden is the lowest in recorded history, and they are concerned that very few people will turn out to vote. Instead, they will search & find people, then "harvest" & return Ballots. Not fair!Retweets: 29232Favorites: 107095
