    We are saddened by the loss of Alan Woods, a personal and professional friend who served his country with compassion and distinction.
Alan was committed to focusing AID's [Agency for International Development] work on promoting growth in developing countries. He was convinced that without basic economic growth permanent improvements could not be made in the quality of life and the elimination of poverty in those nations. He cared deeply for those people around the world who needed our help.
He served his country loyally and diligently under two Presidents. On a personal level, Alan was a good friend and family man. While he continued his battle against cancer, he also continued to promote the ideas and programs in which he believed.
Barbara and I send our sympathies to Cameron, Alexandra, and Caroline.
