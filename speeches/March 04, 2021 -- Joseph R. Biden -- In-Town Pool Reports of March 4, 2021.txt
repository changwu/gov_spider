Pool report #7 - infrastructure meeting has ended and DeFazio quotes 
White House advises the Oval Office meeting with the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure ended at 3:25 p.m.
Your pooler ran into the committee chairman Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., walking out of the White House after the meeting and got a few quick quotes for those interested.
DeFazio said the meeting "went very well" and that the president is set on doing infrastructure.
"He wants to move as quickly as possible. He wants it to be very big and he feels that this is the key to the recovery package."
Did you guys make any progress on how to pay for it?
"We talked about it."
You talked about it, but did you get anywhere on it?
"I was encouraged by the discussion. I don't want to go into the specifics, but I raised it specifically."
Any other thoughts about the meeting?
"It's refreshing. Having sat with Donald Trump to discuss infrastructure and the difference between talking to Joe Biden about infrastructure and what goes into it and how we're going to get it done and Donald Trump is like, it's just a whole different world. It's way better."

In town pool report #11 - Fuller NASA call quotes and lid 
Pool was at the edge of the room so please check quotes against transcript.
POTUS started off the call talking with Michael Watkins, Jet Propulsion Laboratory director.
"I tell you what, you did an incredible job," POTUS said.
POTUS asked if he was supposed to speak first or follow Swati (assuming this is Swati Mohan, guidance and controls operations lead, Mars 2020).
Sounded like Mohan then thanked POTUS for taking the time to talk to them.
"Are you kidding me? What an honor this is. This is an incredible honor. And it's amazing. Indian-of-descent Americans are taking over the country. You, my Vice President, my speech writer . . ."
Over the course of about ten minutes, Biden poured on the kudos and cast the landing as an important bright spot that's come at a rough time for the nation. More quotes:
"What you did, you restored a dose of confidence in the American people. They were beginning to wonder about us. They were beginning to wonder are we still the country we always believed we were. You guys did it."
"It's astounding what you did."
"One of the reasons why we're such an incredible country is we're such a diverse country."
"It's about the American spirit. You brought it back."
"We can land a rover on Mars, we can beat a pandemic and with science, hope and vision, there's not a damn thing we can't do as a country."
Pool was ushered out at 5:14 p.m. and a travel photo lid was declared moments after.
