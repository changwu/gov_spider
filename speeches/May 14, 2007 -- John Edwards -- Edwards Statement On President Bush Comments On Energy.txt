    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement in response to President Bush's remarks asking Congress to pass his energy plan.
"America will never break its dependence on foreign oil without bold leadership. After years of catering to the oil industry, President Bush now says he is ready to curb our dependence on foreign oil. But his actions don't match his words.
"There is no time to waste in ending global warming and creating the new energy economy. The United States needs a major investment in energy innovation on a scale this president isn't talking about. We need to ask Americans to be patriotic about something other than war and involve everyone - government, industry, and individuals - in the solution."
