    As 2015 comes to a close, we pulled together our top social moments of the year. We hope you enjoy, and look forward to sharing more in the New Year.
1. At one of the GOP debates, Jeb apologized to his mom for, um, something he did 40 years ago that for some reason Rand Paul brought up. It was one of the most retweeted tweets this year among the 2016 presidential candidates.


  

    Sorry Mom

3. At the final GOP debate of 2015, Jeb told Donald Trump what the rest of America was thinking and needed to be said: You're not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency.
You can't insult your way to the presidency, Donald J. Trump #GOPDebate
