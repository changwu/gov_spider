    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Thomas (R) Wyoming and 100 others)
The Administration supports H.R. 2135.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2135 would affect direct spending and receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate is that the net pay-as-you-go effect of the bill is zero.
