    Alexandria, VA — February 17, 2016 — Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and Republican candidate for President, announced today that former Congressman Kerry Bentivolio (MI-11) has endorsed him in his campaign for the presidency. An Army combat veteran with more than 20 years of service, Congressman Bentivolio is an outspoken advocate for America's military personnel and veterans, and staunch fighter for conservative values. His status as a political outsider has also given him a keen understanding of the political games which pervade our government.
"As a veteran of two wars and conservative member of Congress, I know what it means to fight," said Congressman Bentivolio. "When I look at what we need in our next president, I look for someone who will fight against the political class that has mired our country in higher debts and less accountability. I know Dr. Carson will fight for our veterans, fight for integrity and fight for our country. I have learned in politics that words mean far less than actions. Dr. Carson is a man of action, with a history of service to God, to family and to our country. In my heart of hearts he is the right choice for what ails America."
"I'm humbled to count Congressman Bentivolio among my many supporters," said Dr. Carson. "His endorsement is yet another example of how citizen statesmen can come together to bring real change to the Washington establishment. He has fought to make this country the strongest, most prosperous nation on Earth. Today he has entered the fight again, joining me to rebuild a government that is 'of the people, by the people, and for the people.'"
