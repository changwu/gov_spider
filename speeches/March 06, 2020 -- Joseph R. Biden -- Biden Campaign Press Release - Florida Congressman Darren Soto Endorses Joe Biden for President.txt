    Soto Becomes 10th Florida Member of Congress to Endorse Biden
Today, Florida Congressman Darren Soto of Orlando released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"Vice President Joe Biden is the unity candidate that can rally the American people to victory in November and finally address the major issues affecting our nation. I trust Joe to heal our nation's hurtful division and tackle issues like addressing climate change, protecting our healthcare, raising wages, preserving Florida's environment, passing a major infrastructure package, and supporting Puerto Rico disaster recovery."
Soto joins more than 50 leaders across Florida that have endorsed Joe Biden for President, including former Senators Bill Nelson and Bob Graham, and current Members of Congress Kathy Castor, Charlie Crist, Val Demmings, Ted Deutch, Lois Frankel, Alcee Hastings, Al Lawson, Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Frederica Wilson. Biden also has the most support from more Members of Congress of any candidate in the race, with 58 members backing him. Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
Biden's endorsements showcase the diversity of support for Vice President Biden in Florida and across the country, as well as the trust that these leaders have in his ability to beat Donald Trump, restore the soul of this nation, rebuild the middle class, and bring the country together.
