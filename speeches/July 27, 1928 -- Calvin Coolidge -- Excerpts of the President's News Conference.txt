    I don't know just what the plans of the State Department are, either, as to the early conclusion of the peace treaties. I haven't any idea whether there will be any opposition to the treaties in the Senate. There is usually some opposition there to everything, but I understood that the responsible leadership of both parties in the Senate had been participating in these treaty matters and that the action of the State Department had their approval.

I don't know just what the State Department is planning as to a recognition of the Chinese Nationalist Government. Those details are in their hands and they haven't sent me any information about it. I suppose that making the treaty with a government usually, if not necessarily, constitutes a recognition of that government. It might not, but generally does.
