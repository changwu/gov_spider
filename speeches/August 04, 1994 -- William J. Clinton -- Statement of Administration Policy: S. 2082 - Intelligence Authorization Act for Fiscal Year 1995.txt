    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 8/12/94)(Senate)(DeConcini (D) AZ)
The Administration supports S. 2082, but opposes the provision requiring the President to nominate and the Senate to confirm the General Counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). All General Counsels serving in the Administration, whether or not the Senate confirms them, are held to the highest standards of professional responsibility. The Administration, while deeply committed to the principles of accountability embodied in the congressional oversight process and to the rule of law, does not believe Senate confirmation of the CIA General Counsel is required at this time.
In addition, the Administration would oppose amendments that would mandate the manner in which counterintelligence activities are coordinated within the Executive branch. The Administration is implementing a Presidential Directive that provides for the reorganization of U.S. counterintelligence policy management and coordination. This Directive makes the necessary improvements to U.S. counterintelligence efforts.
The Administration is committed to conducting a review of intelligence roles and missions through the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB). This review will be undertaken in full consultation with the Congress. The Administration would oppose amendments that would mandate the establishment of a new Commission for this purpose.
