    IN THE passing of Admiral William D. Leahy the nation has lost an outstanding American and I have lost a close personal friend. As a Naval Officer and a diplomat, Admiral Leahy dedicated his life to the service of his country in war and in peace. Mrs. Eisenhower and I join with the people of America in mourning his death.
