    Today, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield released the following statement on Vice President Mike Pence's trip to Iowa:
"Iowans are facing enormous challenges â€” 50,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, crops and homes destroyed, hundreds of thousands without power, and a record number of unemployed Iowans this summer. Yet Mike Pence is coming to the Hawkeye State to change the narrative on the Trump Administration's disastrous coronavirus response, and to distract from their record of double-crossing the ethanol industry and pursuing an erratic, costly trade policy that puts American workers on the losing side of the equation. Iowans don't need more excuses or distractions from this Administration. They need a President and Vice President who will actually lead us out of this pandemic, stand up and fight for working people, and help Iowa and our country build back better."
