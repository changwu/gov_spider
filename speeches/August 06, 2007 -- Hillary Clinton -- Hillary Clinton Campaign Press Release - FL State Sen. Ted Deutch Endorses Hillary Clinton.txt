    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Florida State Senator Ted Deutch.
Hillary Clinton knows that we can both defend our country and the rights of our citizens to live lives of dignity with affordable health care for men and women and quality public education for our children. Together with her longstanding and vocal support of the State of Israel, Senator Clinton is the best candidate to hit the ground running on her first day in the White House and tackle those issues that matter so deeply to me and my constituents.
First elected to the Senate in 2006, Deutch authored legislation mandating that Florida divest its pension funds from companies investing in Iran and Sudan, and has helped other state and local governments exercise their economic leverage to pressure rogue nations.
A longtime community and philanthropic leader, Deutch serves as the vice chairman of the Senate Banking and Insurance Committee and the vice chairman of the Finance and Tax Committee.
Noting his effective work as a legislator, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel named Deutch the "Freshman Most Likely to Succeed," while the Miami Herald said he "is being eyed as a future Senate minority leader."
"Ted is a talented young legislator who's already proven himself a leader in the Senate," Clinton said. "I'm honored to have his support as we work to bring our message of change across Florida and the nation.
