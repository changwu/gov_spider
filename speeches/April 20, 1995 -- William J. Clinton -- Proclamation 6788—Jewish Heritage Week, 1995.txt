  A Proclamation

Throughout history and through times of profound adversity, the Jewish people have built their lives on the strength of family and the spirit of community. Millions have made a home in America—a Nation filled with opportunity and blessed with the miracle of freedom. And here, with hard work and dedication, the Jewish-American community has flourished.
Jewish citizens have made vital contributions to every sector of our society. From academia to the arts, from business to government, from the smallest towns to the largest cities, Jewish Americans have infused our Nation with a powerful faith, a commitment to family and community, and a devotion to scholarship and self-improvement.
Judaism is a unique gift to this land that people of myriad faiths and cultures call home. The ancient commandment of tzedakah—charity—challenges us to embrace the duty of service to others. The Talmudic teachings of mercy and justice, and those who have sought to uphold these ideals, grace the pages of American history. We can draw strength and inspiration from the enduring lessons of Judaism, and it is entirely fitting that we honor the great traditions of its followers.
Now, Therefore, I, William J. Clinton, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 30 through May 7, 1995, as "Jewish Heritage Week." I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and nineteenth.

WILLIAM J. CLINTON
