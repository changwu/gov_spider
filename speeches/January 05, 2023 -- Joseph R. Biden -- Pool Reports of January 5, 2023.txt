In town pool report #9 - Cabinet meeting part 2, economy comments
Hello all -
This is the second and final part of the Cabinet meeting pool report
POTUS comments on the economy:"The big laws we passed were consequential, but they're basically promises," POTUS said. "They're now the law, they're going to happen, but they didn't take effect."
"Details matter and being responsive to the American public obviously matters a great deal," Biden said.
He touted legislation that caps the monthly cost of insulin for some seniors, new rules aimed at discouraging price hikes to medicine and incentives for Americans to make homes more energy efficient.
"Folks need to know how to take advantage of these benefits that we've passed," Biden said.
The president also said his administration has been mindful of finding ways to pay for new initiatives. "This idea that we're big spenders and just blew the deficit is wrong," Biden said.
Biden also noted major investments by chip companies in various facilities around the country.
ON THE FTC
"The Federal Trade Commission is going to take a huge step forward in banning non compete agreements that are designed simply to lower people's wages," Biden said.
Biden said there should be a distinction between non-compete contracts for high skilled laborers and those who have less specialized knowledge. He said, for example, he didn't understand what should prevent a worker from one fast food chain to go work for a different one that offered more money.
"What the hell is that all about other than keeping wages down?" Biden said.
ON JOBS
Biden said "we're exporting products instead of exporting jobs."
ON INFLATION
"We're seeing signs inflation is easing," Biden said. "It doesn't mean it's all over, it means we're off to a pretty good darn start."
