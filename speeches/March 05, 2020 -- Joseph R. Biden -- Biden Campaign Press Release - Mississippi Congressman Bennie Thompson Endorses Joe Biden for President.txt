    Today, Mississippi Congressman Bennie Thompson released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"Our nation is aching for the kind of moral leadership that can end today's division and hate and bring our country together. Joe Biden has spent his whole life serving something bigger than himself, fighting beside us in every fight that matters. Time and again, Joe has shown he has the deep character and unmatched skills to both heal and lead – and get things done. And, as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, I know how badly our nation needs a president with the kind of deep national security experience that Joe has – someone who has played a key role in countless high-stakes efforts to keep this country safe; who has deep expertise and ties to leaders around the world; and who, when a crisis like the coronavirus hits, would immediately know how to organize government and rally the nation to solve the problem. I know in my bones: Joe is the steady leader we need to move us beyond these uncertain times."
Congressman Thompson joins scores of Members of Congress in endorsing Biden this week with more than 60 U.S. Representatives and seven U.S. Senators, including the most endorsements from members of both the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Thompson also joins a strong list of Mississippi leaders backing Biden, including 10 state legislators. Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
