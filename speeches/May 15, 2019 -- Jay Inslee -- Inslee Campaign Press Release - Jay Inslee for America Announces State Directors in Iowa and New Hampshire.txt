    Seattle â€“ Today, Inslee for America announced it has hired on-the-ground staff in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to vote in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.
Jennifer Keeler will serve as Inslee's New Hampshire State Director. Keeler is an experienced campaign manager and field organizer, who most recently served as state field director for Open Progress in North Carolina. She also recently worked as Senate Caucus Director for the Delaware Democratic Party. A Rutgers graduate, Jennifer has years of experience in Northeast races.
Fresh off serving as a senior advisor to the 2018 Florida Coordinated Campaign and recount effort, Keith Presley will serve as Inslee's Iowa State Director. Presley has a long history of leading winning campaigns in rural, suburban, and urban areas. He previously served as Deputy Campaign Manager for Senator Ben Cardin (D - MD) and organized successful field efforts in Iowa, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, and New York. Presley joins the campaign with a degree in Environmental Science and Policy from the University of Maryland.
"Jenn and Keith are excellent additions to the Inslee for America campaign team," said Aisling Kerins, Inslee for America Campaign Manager. "These new hires are a sign of the growing momentum behind Governor Inslee's campaign, as voters are calling for a leader who will put climate change first. We're excited to have these two incredible organizers on the frontlines in Iowa and New Hampshire."
Inslee, who is the only presidential candidate who has made defeating climate change and building a clean energy economy the cornerstone of his campaign, has been making stops to speak with voters across the country as part of his "Climate Mission Tour." Since launching his campaign in March, he has visited Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada, Texas, California, New York, and Oregon.
