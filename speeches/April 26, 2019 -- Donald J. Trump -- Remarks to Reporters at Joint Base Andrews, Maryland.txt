    The President. The GDP numbers were just announced and they were far higher than even the high expectation. There were many people who thought it would less than 2, and they were at 3.2.
Inflation numbers are very low. The gasoline prices are coming down. I called up OPEC. I said: "You've got to bring them down. You've got to bring them down." And gasoline is coming down. We're doing great.
GDP is an incredible number. But remember this: Not only that, we have a great growthâ€”which is growth. We have great growth and also very, very low inflation. Our economy is doing great, number one in the world. We're number-one economy right now in the world and it's not even close.
So thank you very much.
