    I commend the House for acting quickly on bipartisan welfare reform legislation that builds upon our successful efforts that have moved millions of Americans from welfare to work. This compassionate approach will help many more Americans realize a better life of independence, hope, and dignity that comes with having a job. It will also promote strong families and healthy marriages, while freeing States to seek innovative ways to improve services to those who are transitioning from the welfare rolls to the workforce.
I now urge the Senate to act without delay to strengthen our efforts to help our fellow Americans on welfare achieve independence through work.
