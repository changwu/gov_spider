    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report twenty-six deferrals of fiscal year 1982 funds totaling $737.2 million. The deferrals are primarily routine in nature and do not, in most eases, affect program levels.
The deferrals are for programs in the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation, and Treasury, the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, and the Motor Carrier Ratemaking Study Commission, as well as for Appalachian regional development programs.
The details of each deferral are contained in the attached reports.
RONALD REAGAN
The White House,
