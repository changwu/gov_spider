    In his meeting with Acting Secretary [of State] Eagleburger this morning the Iraqi Ambassador stated that the President's taped message to the Iraqi people would be broadcast in its entirety in prime time. We are disappointed, however, that he declined to take personal possession of the tape for transmittal to Baghdad. The State Department will be transmitting the tape to our Embassy in Baghdad for delivery to the Iraqi Government. We expect that this will take place within the next day or two.
