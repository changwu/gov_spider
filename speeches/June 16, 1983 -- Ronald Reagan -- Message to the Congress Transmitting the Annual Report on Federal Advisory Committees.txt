    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, I am pleased to transmit the Eleventh Annual Report on Federal Advisory Committees.
In 1982, advisory committees afforded a unique opportunity for over 19,000 private citizens of all backgrounds to provide valued and needed counsel to Federal officials in establishing policies and improving operations of the government.
In keeping with the strong commitment of this / Administration to promote voluntary citizen participation in government, by year end the number of chartered advisory committees increased by three percent over the previous year, reaching the highest level since 1976. At the same time, government agencies utilizing these committees achieved a further overall reduction in committee operating costs. In 1982, committee operating costs totaled $74 million, 7.5 percent lower than in 1981, and 15.2 percent below comparable 1980 levels.
In 1983, the opportunity exists for additional improvements in the management and cost-effectiveness of advisory committees. New guidance and information prepared by the General Services Administration and contained in this report will provide agency management with the ability to realize this opportunity.
Consistent with my belief that the strength of this Nation flows from the talent and resourcefulness of its people, we shall foster and support the continued active use of advisory committees in the government decision-making process.
