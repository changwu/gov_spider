    To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting today the fourth and final annual report of each executive department and agency on its activities during Fiscal Year 1974 in the administration of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970.
Federal agencies report that the effects of implementation of the Uniform Act have generally been extremely beneficial for displaced families and individuals. The replacement housing payment available to displaced homeowners and tenants in addition to a payment for moving expenses, have greatly enhanced the rehousing options of displaced persons. The relocation assistance program of the agencies has been instrumental in assisting those displaced to improve the quality of their housing and standard of living and in assisting many tenants to become homeowners. The Uniform Act's program and policies are being favorably received by those persons displaced and communities affected by Federal and federally assisted projects.
The Administrator of General Services, who has responsibility for executive branch leadership in the implementation of the Uniform Act, has recently reported to me concerning accomplishments under this program and plans to further improve the administration of the Act. I endorse these efforts and include his report as an enclosure to this transmittal.
