    Ted Cruz, candidate for U.S. Senate in Texas, today made the following statement on the selection of Congressman Paul Ryan as Mitt Romney's Vice Presidential running mate:
"In Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney has chosen a champion of fiscal sanity and a formidable advocate for policies that will get our country back on the right path. When it comes to the federal budget, we can't afford four more years of reckless, runaway spending. As the next President and Vice President of the United States, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will lead an administration that finally brings fiscal responsibility back to Washington."
