    NEW YORK â€” Bernie Sanders supporters from 207 colleges and universities across the nation have organized campus town meetings in gymnasiums, dormitories, classrooms and cafeterias as part of a national organizing effort that will feature a live telecast from George Mason University with the senator and student activists from the greater Washington, D.C. area on Wednesday at 7 p.m.
The senator will speak to thousands of students across the country and in front of an audience of more than 1,500 at George Mason about issues important to young people including the high cost of college, climate change, campaign finance reform and the need for racial justice.
"The volunteers we have mobilized all over this country, especially the young people, are really taking this campaign to the next level," Sanders said. "College students are at the very center of the kind of grassroots movement we are building that will fundamentally change politics in America."
Already more than 36,000 students have signed up to volunteer with the Sanders campaign, many of whom are hosting on-campus flyering events, debate watch parties and voter registration drives.
Dartmouth student Felicia Teter will be holding an event in Hanover, New Hampshire, on campus Wednesday. Her nearly 300-member group Dartmouth Students and Staff for Bernie hosts weekly meetings on campus to spread the senator's message and get students involved.
The campus group Morningside for Bernie from Sioux City, Iowa, will be holding an event on the Morningside College campus. Organizer Nathan Mann has invited students and faculty from Briar College and Western Iowa Tech to join the meeting.
