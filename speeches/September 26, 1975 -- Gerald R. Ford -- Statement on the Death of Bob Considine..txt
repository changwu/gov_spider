    BOB CONSIDINE was a great reporter, whose beat was literally the world. His perceptive reporting and the quality of his writing made him a great newsman. His personal integrity and courage, his gentle good humor, and his outstanding character made him a great person. He will be missed.
Mrs. Ford joins in this expression of sympathy to Bob's wife, Millie, and to his family. In words Bob was fond of quoting: "May 'the angels lead thee into paradise and may the martyrs receive thee at thy coming."
