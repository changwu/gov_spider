Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney released the following statement regarding new job numbers:
"The news out of the Labor Department today that job losses are spreading and wage growth is slowing underscores the importance of the economy in this year's election. Knowledge of the economy is my strong suit. It's where I spent my career. We can get our economy moving again by cutting taxes on individuals and businesses and by making it easier for people facing foreclosure to refinance into more stable mortgages. I will fight for every job and to make America prosperous again."
