    Joe is the right person to beat Donald Trump, because he is everything Trump is not--Joe is a good, decent person, who cares about others and understands the struggles that so many Americans face every day. He has spent years as a public servant gaining the expertise necessary to lead our nation and reestablish the United States as a global leader, reversing course on the isolationism, nationalism, and global retreat of the Trump Administration. Joe understands that we make progress through pragmatism and reaching across the aisle when possible and that yelling the loudest or having the most extreme opinions doesn't actually accomplish any goals. Joe is the person to unite our party and our nation to tackle the challenges we face and seize the opportunities that our great nation has. April and I look forward to doing everything in our power to help him secure the nomination and win the general election in November.
