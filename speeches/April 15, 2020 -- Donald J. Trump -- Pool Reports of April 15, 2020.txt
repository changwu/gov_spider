In-town pool report #6 -- Briefing ends
Briefing finished at 6.46 p.m., just under the hour mark and perhaps prompted by the sudden drop in temperature.

Tomorrow POTUS will have a call with governors and is expected to unveil his plan to reopen some states before a deadline of May 1.
"We think some of the states can actually open up before the deadline of May 1. And I think that will be a very exciting time, indeed," he said.
Also confirming the reports on Twitter that a giant rat scurried behind POTUS on the steps outside the Oval Office. He didn't notice as reporters stifled laughs.
