    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Matsunaga (D) Hawaii and 73 others)
The Administration would support S. 1009 if it were amended to:

—    exclude restitutionary payments to (l) persons who relocated or sought reldcation during World War II to a country at war with the United States, (2) persons who are not domiciled in the United States on the date of enactment of this bill, or (3) the estates of "eligible individuals" (i.e., require that payments be made only to living persons);
—    provide that any payment received pursuant to S. 1009 is in full settlement of any claim of the individual against the United States based on internment;
—    extend the authorization period from five years ($500 million in 1989, $400 million in 1990, $200 million in 1991, and $100 million in 1992 and 1993) to ten years at $125 million per year;
—    delete title III, concerning reparations to persons from the Alaskan Aleutian Islands who were relocated during World War II, because providing benefits for wartime hardships which resulted from proper actions (i.e., removal from a war zone) is not warranted.
