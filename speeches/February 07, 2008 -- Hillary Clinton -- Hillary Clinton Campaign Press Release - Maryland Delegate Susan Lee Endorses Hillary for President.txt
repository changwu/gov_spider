    The Clinton campaign today announced that Maryland Delegate Susan Lee endorsed Hillary Clinton for President.
Delegate Lee, who has been in office since 2002, endorsed Hillary just days before the February 12th Maryland primary. The news of Delegate Lee's endorsement continues to demonstrate the campaign's strong momentum heading into the primary. She is the first Asian woman to be elected to the Maryland General Assembly.
Hillary Clinton is the only candidate in this race who has a universal health care plan. This is an issue I care about deeply and have worked on throughout my time in office," said Delegate Lee. "With people worried about their loved ones in Iraq and their health care in America, it is essential that Democrats nominate someone who has been tested and is ready to deliver real solutions on day one. Hillary is that person and will be a great President.
Delegate Lee represents Montgomery County and has been a leader on preventing Internet crimes and exploitation. She has also worked hard to sponsor and support legislation to ensure a quality education for all children, affordable and quality health care, clean environment, gun control, increased procurement opportunities for women and minority owned small businesses, and to fight domestic violence, senior and child abuse, hate crimes and drunk driving.
"I am honored to have Delegate Lee's support. She has been a barrier breaker and a great role model and representative for the people of Maryland," said Hillary Clinton. "I look forward to working with her to solve our nation's challenges and bring about the change this country needs."
