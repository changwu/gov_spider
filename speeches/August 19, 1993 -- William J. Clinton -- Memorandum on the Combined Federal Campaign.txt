    Memorandum for Heads of Departments and Agencies 
The Combined Federal Campaign is an avenue through which thousands of Federal employees voluntarily express their concern for others each year. Public servants working in nearly every corner of the globe not only contribute to the campaign but assume leadership roles to assure that the campaign is a huge success.
I am delighted to inform you that Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown has agreed to serve as the chair of the 1993 Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area. I ask you to support Secretary Brown by personally chairing the campaign in your agency and appointing a top official as your vice chairman.
Your commitment and visible support will help to guarantee another successful campaign this year. Together, we must do everything we can to encourage Federal employees everywhere to do their part by participating in the 1993 Combined Federal Campaign.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
