On Background from a White House Official:
Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver remarks at the 2023 national convention of the National Action Network (NAN) in New York City, New York. In her remarks, the Vice President will address the attacks on freedom and basic rights that Americans are experiencing throughout the country, including attacks on voting rights, reproductive rights, and the right to be safe from gun violence. She will also reflect on her visit to Nashville, Tennessee where she met Representatives Justin Jones and Justin Pearson and delivered remarks making clear that the bedrock of democracy is the people's ability to make their voices heard.

VP Supplemental Pool #5
Greetings from Los Angeles. AF2 touched down at 4:10p PDT and Congresswoman Nannette Barragan of CA-44 is on hand to greet the VP. From here the VP is to be ferried to her home in Brentwood, where your pooler does not anticipate being invited and/or permitted inside for a chat about the current state of our Union.
This to say your pooler is signing off for the evening, and is grateful to have been of service to the American public.
