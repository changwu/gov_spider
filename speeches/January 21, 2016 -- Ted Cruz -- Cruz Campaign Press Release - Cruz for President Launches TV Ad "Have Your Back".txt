    HOUSTON, Texas – The Cruz for President campaign today announced a new TV ad, "Have Your Back", highlighting Cruz's promise that if elected President, America will once again lead from a position of strength.
The ad makes the connection between the weakness of the Obama/Clinton foreign policy and the recent illegal capture of our sailors by Iran. In a Cruz administration, we will have a Commander-in-Chief who will stand strong in defense of our nation and our brave men and women in uniform. Our allies will once again have confidence that we have their backs and our enemies will know the consequences of their actions.
The ad will run statewide in Iowa beginning January 22. The ad may be viewed here:

:30 TV
ANNOUNCER: Ten American sailors, captured by Iran and humiliated on video.
When our sailors were released, the White House said thank you – to Iran.
President Obama, how about our troops?
CRUZ: "If I'm elected president, no serviceman or servicewoman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men and women will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America."
"I will have your back."
CRUZ: I'm Ted Cruz and I approved this message.
