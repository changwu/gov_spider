    Congressman Patrick Murphy to Join Senator Obama on the Trail
Des Moines, IA -- Today, U.S. Senator Barack Obama continues his "Stand for Change" Tour throughout Iowa. Obama will ask Iowans across the state to "Stand for Change" by caucusing for him on January 3rd and taking the first step towards bringing to Washington, D.C. the kind of change we can believe in. Obama will be joined on the campaign trail by the only Iraq War veteran in Congress, Representative Patrick Murphy.
Congressman Patrick Murphy is in his first term representing the Pennsylvania's 8th Congressional District. He joined the U.S. Army in 1993, eventually rising to the rank of Captain. After 9/11 Mr. Murphy deployed twice for the United States - first to Bosnia in 2002 and then to Baghdad, Iraq with the 82nd Airborne Division in 2003 and 2004. He is the first and only Iraq war veteran in Congress. Mr. Murphy serves on the House Armed Services Committee and House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
