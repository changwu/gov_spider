    The Treasury Department recently rejected an application of the Central States Pension Fund, which if approved would have reduced benefits for roughly 270,000 people nationally, including pension cuts as large as 50-70 percent. Hillary Clinton released the following statement on the application:
"Americans in the Central States Pension Fund spent their lives working hard, playing by the rules, and paying into their pensions so they could retire with dignity. They deserve better than a plan that would take away as much as three-quarters of some retirees' pension income—money they were told for years they could count on. The Treasury Department has done the right thing by rejecting this proposal. Congress must now come together around an alternative solution that maintains the financial health of the our pension system and ensures workers and retirees can enjoy the secure retirement they've earned."
