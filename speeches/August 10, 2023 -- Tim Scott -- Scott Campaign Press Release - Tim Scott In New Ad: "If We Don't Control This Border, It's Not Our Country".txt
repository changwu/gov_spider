TRANSCRIPT:
SCOTT: If you don't control your back door, it's not your house.
And if we don't control this border, it's not our country.
Last year we lost 70,000 Americans to fentanyl because Joe Biden surrendered our southern border to the Mexican drug cartels.
As commander in chief, I'll unleash our military to crush the cartels and stop these terrorists from killing our kids.
I'm Tim Scott and I approve this message because border security is national security.
