    HOUSTON, Texas - On the heels of an overwhelming victory in the Wisconsin primary, the Cruz campaign announced today raising more than $12.5 million in the month of March, making it the highest amount raised in one month during the entirety of the campaign. The campaign had almost 240,000 donations with an average donation of $52. To date the total number of dollars raised is more than $78 million with more than 450,00 donors.
"This is yet another sign that conservatives are coalescing behind our campaign," said Cruz. "The path to victory in the nomination and winning the general election is by standing up for hardworking men and women of America who have been left behind by Washington. I am confident in this campaign's ability to bring together all factions of the Republican Party, as we continue to unite Republicans, Independents, Libertarians, and Americans who care about our future."
