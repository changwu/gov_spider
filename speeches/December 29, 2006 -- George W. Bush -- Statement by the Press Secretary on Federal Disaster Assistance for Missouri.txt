    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Missouri and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe winter storms during the period of November 30 to December 2, 2006.
Federal funding is available to State and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe winter storms in the counties of Boone, Cole, Greene, Iron, Reynolds, St. Francois, Ste. Genevieve, St. Louis, and Washington, and the independent City of St. Louis.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
R. David Paulison, Director, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Thomas J. Costello as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The Agency said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the State and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
