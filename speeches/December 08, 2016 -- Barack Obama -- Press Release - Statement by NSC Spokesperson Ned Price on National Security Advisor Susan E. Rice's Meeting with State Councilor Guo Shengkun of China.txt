    National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice met today with State Councilor Guo Shengkun of China to emphasize the importance of fully adhering to the U.S.-China cyber commitments from President Xi's September 2015 State Visit. The meeting occurred following the conclusion of the third U.S.-China High-Level Joint Dialogue on Cybercrime and Related Issues, which State Councilor Guo co-chaired along with Attorney General Lynch and Secretary of Homeland Security Johnson on December 7.
Ambassador Rice raised U.S. concerns about the potential impacts of China's cybersecurity law and Foreign Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) management law on commercial and people-to-people links between the United States and China. She underscored the United States' enduring concern about human rights conditions in China. She also encouraged further promoting bilateral risk reduction measures, including between both sides' Coast Guards. Ambassador Rice and State Councilor Guo agreed that the United States - China relationship is the most consequential relationship in the world, and both expressed support for continued efforts to develop more durable and constructive bilateral ties.
