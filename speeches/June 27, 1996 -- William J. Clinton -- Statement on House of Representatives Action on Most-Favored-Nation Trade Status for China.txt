    I applaud the action of the House of Representatives to approve my decision to renew most-favored-nation trade status for China. The strong bipartisan show of support today is clear evidence that the American people agree that engagement, not isolation, is the best way to advance America's interests with China as elsewhere.
This positive vote helps us continue to engage China on a broad range of issues, including human rights, nonproliferation, trade, regional security, and relations with Taiwan. It enables us to continue to strengthen cooperation while firmly addressing our differences. It is a strong vote in favor of America's interests.
As I meet with the G-7 leaders, this vote is also a strong reaffirmation of America's continued leadership and engagement in the world.
I thank the House of Representatives for its overwhelming support and look forward to continuing our work with the Congress on a bipartisan China policy that advances America's interests.
