    I commend the Senate for rejecting the resolution put forward by Senator Murkowski, which would have increased our dependence on oil by blocking efforts to cut the harmful pollution that contributes to climate change. Today's vote is yet another reminder of the urgent need to pass legislation that would help America transition to a 21st-century clean energy economy that would create jobs, strengthen our national security, and protect our environment for our children. Today the Senate chose to move America forward towards that clean energy economy, not backward to the same failed policies that have left our Nation increasingly dependent on foreign oil.
