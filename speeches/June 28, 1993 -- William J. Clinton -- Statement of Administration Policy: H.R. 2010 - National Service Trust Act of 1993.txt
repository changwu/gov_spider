    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 6/29/93)(House Rules)(Martinez (D) CA and 215 others)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 2010. The bill establishes an innovative Corporation for National Service to offer Americans educational awards in return for service to their country. In addition, the bill provides for a variety of other programs to develop citizenship among Americans of all ages, ranging from elementary school "service learning" projects to the National Senior Volunteer Corps. Enactment of this legislation will encourage service by all citizens and reaffirm an American community that transcends race, region, or religion.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2010 would affect direct spending and receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). The bill does not contain provisions to offset the increased direct spending. Therefore, if this bill were enacted, its deficit effects could contribute to a sequester of mandatory programs.
OMB's preliminary scoring estimates for this bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If H.R. 2010 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within five days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending and receipts will be reported to Congress at the end of the congressional session, as required by OBRA.
