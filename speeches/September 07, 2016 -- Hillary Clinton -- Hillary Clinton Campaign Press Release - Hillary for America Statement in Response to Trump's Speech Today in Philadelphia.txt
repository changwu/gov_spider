    In response to Trump's childish insults during his speech today in Philadelphia, HFA Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri offered the following statement:
"Like a schoolyard bully who can't rely on facts or issues, Trump has only one way of responding to legitimate criticism of his own vulnerabilities: 'I know you are, but what am I?'
Hillary Clinton's well-founded criticisms of Trump, laid out in meticulous detail, become taunts and insults from Trump with no basis in reality. When she lays out a thoughtful speech outlining why he is unfit to be Commander in Chief, he calls her unhinged. She gives a speech on his disturbing history of racial discrimination and ties to white supremacists and the alt-right movement, he calls her a bigot. You could dismiss these actions as insecure schoolyard behavior but this man is running to be President of the United States. As Hillary Clinton has said, anyone you can bait this easily is not someone you can trust be Commander in Chief."
