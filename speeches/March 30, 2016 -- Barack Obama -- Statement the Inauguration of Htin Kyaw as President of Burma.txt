    I congratulate U Htin Kyaw on his Inauguration today as President of Burma and look forward to working with him and the new Government. U Htin Kyaw's Inauguration represents a historic milestone in the country's transition to a democratically elected, civilian-led Government. This extraordinary moment in Burma's history is a testament to its people, institutions, and leaders who have worked together to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, and it speaks to the significance of the reforms the country has undertaken since 2011.
Burma will face significant challenges going forward, including achieving broad-based economic development, advancing national reconciliation, and promoting the rights and freedoms of all its people. The United States looks forward to being a friend and partner of the new Government and the people of Burma as they make progress toward building a more inclusive, peaceful, and prosperous future.
