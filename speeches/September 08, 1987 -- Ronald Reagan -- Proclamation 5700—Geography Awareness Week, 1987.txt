  A Proclamation

Fascination with the Earth and a desire to learn and record information about it inspired the early explorers of our land and today remain part of our national heritage. This legacy is carried on for us in the science of geography, the study of the surface of the globe and the people, environments, resources, political boundaries, and characteristics of every area.
For generations, comprehension of world and national geography has been considered essential to the education of Americans. Yet today, in an interdependent world where knowledge of other lands and cultures is increasingly important, studies show that Americans need more geographical knowledge. Citizens, especially young people, should be fully acquainted with our country and our neighbors around the globe and aware of geography's expanding study of the oceans and the universe; the increasing wealth of knowledge provided by research in the disciplines that support geography; and geography's physiographic, historical, social, economic, and political aspects.
The Congress, by Public Law 100-78, has designated the week of November 15 through November 21, 1987, as "Geography Awareness Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in its observance.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of November 15 through November 21, 1987, as Geography Awareness Week, and I call upon all Americans to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twelfth.

RONALD REAGAN
