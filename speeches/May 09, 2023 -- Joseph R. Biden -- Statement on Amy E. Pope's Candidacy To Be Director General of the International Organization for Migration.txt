    Amy Pope is an innovative, strategic leader with impeccable qualifications, and I strongly support her candidacy to serve as the next Director General of the International Organization for Migration (IOM). As we grapple with record levels of displacement worldwide, IOM needs a forward-looking leader who will position the organization to address the challenges we face. I have worked firsthand with Amy over her 20-year career in migration and disaster relief. Amy has the necessary experience to effectively mobilize IOM and its members to respond to rising migration challenges, including the impacts of a changing climate, with innovative and inclusive solutions. She is the right person for the job. I ask IOM member states to join the United States in voting for Amy Pope at the upcoming IOM elections in Geneva, Switzerland.
