    Dear Gene:
It is with deep regret that I accept today your resignation as Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. For more than a generation you have served your country and my predecessors with distinction, providing wise counsel and sound judgment on some of the most difficult foreign policy issues of our time. Your contributions to the launching of our comprehensive proposals now under negotiation in Europe have been critical and I want you to know of my deep personal appreciation.
It is my hope that you will continue to provide us with advice and assistance in the months and years ahead. As you leave, you have my best regards and warmest wishes for the future.
Sincerely,
RON
[The Honorable Eugene V. Rostow, Director, United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, Washington, D.C. 20451]
Dear Mr. President,
For reasons which Secretary Shultz has so kindly discussed with me, I submit herewith my resignation as Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, effective at once. It has been a privilege to have had this opportunity to serve, and I extend to you my thanks for an extraordinary experience, and my deepest hopes for you and for Mrs. Reagan, and for the people and government of the United States which you lead.
I appreciate your suggestion that I serve in some other capacity. I shall be glad to consider such a proposal in due course.
With respect and regard,
Yours sincerely,
EUGENE V. ROSTOW
