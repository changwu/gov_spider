    On June 28, 2002, the U.S. Navy decommissioned the USS Wadsworth in San Diego, and transferred it to Poland on a grant basis, under the Excess Defense Article (EDA) program. The ship has been re-christened as the Polish Destroyer (ORP) Tadeusz Kosciuszko.
The USS Wadsworth is the second Perry Class Frigate transferred to Poland. On March 15, 2000, the U.S. Navy transferred the USS Clark, which was re-named as the Polish Destroyer ORP General Pulaski.
As part of this support for Poland, four EDA SH-2G Sea Sprite helicopters have also been transferred on a grant basis to Poland and are currently undergoing reactivation. Two of the helicopters will be placed on the Kosciuszko when it sails to Poland in September; two others will be delivered to Poland separately.
To support the ship and helicopters, Poland is purchasing training, repairs, spare parts, technical support, fuel services, and armaments through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) system.
The Oliver Hazard Perry Class Guided Missile Frigate is a multi-purpose platform primarily used by the United States Navy for anti-submarine warfare operations and protection of the carrier battle group. SH-2G helicopters are force multipliers that are anti-submarine warfare-capable, with the ability to search and detect enemy submarines at great distances from the launching ship. The frigates and helicopters represent the most significant security assistance transfers to date to new NATO members, and they will provide an essential level of U.S. and NATO interoperability for the Polish Navy.
