    Letter to the Editor: John Kasich, you have my vote

Jan. 10 â€” To the Editor:
I'd like to thank John Kasich for taking the time to meet with commercial and recreational small business owners at Yankee Coop in Seabrook, N.H. It was interesting listening to John ask questions in order to ascertain where the problems lie. There was a point where John readily understood the problem, it isn't lack of fish, weather or climate change. It is Washington politics and the fact that no one at NOAA or the NMFS can be held accountable for the damages they have caused what is left of the NH fishing fleet. I want to urge everyone to get out and vote on primary day, Feb 9.
John Kasich, you have my vote.
