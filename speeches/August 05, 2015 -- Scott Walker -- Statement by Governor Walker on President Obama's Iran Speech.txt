    Madison, Wis. â€“ Ahead of President Obama's speech regarding Iran, Gov. Scott Walker released the below statement:
"President Obama could give 100 speeches attempting to justify his appeasement of the rogue Iranian regime, and it wouldn't change a thing. The truth is, the Obama-Clinton bad deal with Iran jeopardizes American safety and that of our allies, especially Israel. That's why, as president, I would terminate this disastrous agreement on day one."
