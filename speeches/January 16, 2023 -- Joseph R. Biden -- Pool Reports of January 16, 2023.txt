In town pool report 7
Motorcade back at White House at 1:15 and travel/photo lid declared.
Check the transcript, but here are snippets from the president's remarks to NAN:
He made his familiar comments on the reduction in the deficit on his watch, contrasting that to the first bill of the Republican House which he said would add to the deficit. Speaking of the critics of his spending and deficit approach, he said, "These guys are fiscally demented, Ithink. They don't quite get it."
AT several points, he was warmly applauded, including when he talked about appointing Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, his support HBCUs, his efforts to address student loan debt, and his executive order when Congress did not pass the George Floyd Act. He also was applauded when he spoke of reductions in black unemployment, capping Insulin at $35 a month for Medicare, and work under the Infrastructure Law to "replacie every poisonous lead pipe in America. Every single one."
He talked about the need to make the rich pay their fair share in taxes and the importance of small businesses in minority communities. He also mocked those who talk of refreshing the tree of liberty with the blood of patriots and want to take on the federal government. To do so, he suggested, would require F-15s, not AR 15s. He also said that it is important to talk about abuses in the past. "That's not being woke. That's being honest," he said.
After his discussion of the first bills moved in the GOP House, he said again that he wants to work with Republicans. But, he added, "Let me be clear: if any of these bills happen to reach my desk, I will veto them."
AFter being introduced warmly by Al Sharpton saying that the president has had their back, Biden returned to that point in closing. "I have your back," he said, "We've got to stand together." He added, "I need your help."
