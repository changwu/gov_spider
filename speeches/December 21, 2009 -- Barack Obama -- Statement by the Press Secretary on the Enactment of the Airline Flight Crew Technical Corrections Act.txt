    "Today the President was pleased to sign into law S. 1422, the Airline Flight Crew Technical Corrections Act and appreciates the leadership of Senator Patty Murray, Senator Chris Dodd, Congressman Tim Bishop and others in Congress on this issue. This new law amends the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to make sure that flight attendants and pilots are able to qualify for FMLA benefits, just like other American workers.
The Family and Medical Leave Act, which provides access to up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for events such as the birth or adoption of a child or to care for a family member with a serious health condition, has been a bulwark of our nation's employment laws for more than a decade.
The bipartisan legislation that the President signed today will help ensure that flight attendants, more than four-fifths of whom are women, and other flight crew members are able to take care of their families when the need arises. FMLA has been a tremendous success story, and the President is gratified that flight attendants and pilots will be able to participate in the years to come. While more work remains to support workers and their families, this bill is an important step in the right direction."
