    President Obama. Let me just say how much I appreciate the opportunity to meet again with President Aquino. He has been an outstanding partner in a whole range of multilateral issues. We just had an excellent meeting of APEC in Honolulu that I was happy to host.
Obviously, the bilateral relationship between the United States and the Philippines is one that goes back for decades. We have a 60-year alliance that assures that we are looking out for each other when it comes to security. But more importantly, we have incredible person-to-person relations between our two countries. Obviously, the contribution of Filipino Americans to the growth and prosperity of the United States has been incredibly important. And I think the Philippines obviously has benefited from their interactions with Americans on a whole range of issues.
This is an opportunity for us to discuss how we can further deepen that relationship; also, to discuss the topics of the East Asia Summit, issues like maritime security, nonproliferation, disaster and humanitarian relief.
And so I just want to commend President Aquino for his leadership, for his reform efforts. And I think that a relationship that's already very strong can only become stronger as a consequence of our continued interaction.
So it's wonderful to see you again, Mr. President.
President Aquino. Thank you, Mr. President. I am glad to have this opportunity to really share our viewpoints and our thoughts on a wide range of topics that you already covered.
It's true, we have one of the longest running relationships, strong based on our shared values and history. And we look forward, in these turbulent times of ours, to really further strengthen the relationships.
So thank you so much.
President Obama. Thank you.
Thank you, everybody.
