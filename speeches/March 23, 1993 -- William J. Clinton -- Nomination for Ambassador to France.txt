    The President announced today his intention to nominate Pamela Harriman to be Ambassador to France.
"Anyone who has been involved with the Democratic Party for any length of time is certainly familiar with Mrs. Harriman's talent for diplomacy," said the President. "Her many years of dedicated service to the United States and her unceasing devotion to the cause of world peace are only two of the many qualifications that she will bring with her to Paris."
