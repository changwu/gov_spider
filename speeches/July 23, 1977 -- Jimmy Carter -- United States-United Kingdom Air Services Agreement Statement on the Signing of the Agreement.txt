    The agreement governing civil air services between the United States and the United Kingdom was negotiated over a period of several months and signed in Bermuda on July 23, 1977. It replaces and updates the predecessor agreement reached in 1946 and last amended in 1966.
The new agreement provides for continuing the basic principle of a fair and equal opportunity for the airlines of both countries to compete and dedicates both Governments to the provision of safe, adequate, and efficient international air transportation responsive to the present and future needs of the public and to the continued development of international air commerce. It emphasizes that both scheduled and charter air transportation are important to the consumer interest and are essential elements of a healthy international air transport system.
The United States seeks an international economic environment and air transportation structure founded on healthy economic competition among all air carriers. The new agreement is consistent with this objective. We shall continue to rely on competitive market forces as much as possible in our international air transportation agreements so that the public may receive the improved service at costs that reflect efficient operations.
The agreement is one that reflects well on our two great nations. Its quality, its fairness, and its benefits to the consumer and to airlines should make it last as long as the original 1946 Bermuda Agreement. It continues our long and historic relationship with the United Kingdom.
