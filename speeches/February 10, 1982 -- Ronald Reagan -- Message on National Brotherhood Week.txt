    During Brotherhood Week we are especially reminded of the need for a national commitment to brotherhood and to the elimination of all forms of prejudice and discrimination in American society.
Surely one of this nation's greatest resources is the diversity of a people whose ancestry can be traced to an extraordinary variety of national origins and cultures. Though we differ in many respects, we share a love of this country and the freedom for which it stands. Even more fundamentally, as the Bible teaches, "Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us?"
Throughout the year, let us join together as brothers in the family of man and reach across the religious and racial boundaries which unnecessarily divide neighbor against neighbor. Through friendship and understanding, we all stand to gain. Let us work and grow together as one great nation.
