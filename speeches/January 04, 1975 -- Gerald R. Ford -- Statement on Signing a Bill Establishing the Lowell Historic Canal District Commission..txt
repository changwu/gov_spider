    I HAVE approved H.R. 14689, a bill "to provide for a plan for the preservation, interpretation, development, and use of the historic, cultural, and architectural resources of the Lowell Historic Canal District in Lowell, Massachusetts, and for other purposes."
This legislation establishes a nine-member commission for the purposes outlined with an authorization of $150,000 to support the work of the commission.
In signing this bill into law, I associate myself fully with the view of the House Interior Committee that "Congress would be required to take additional affirmative action before any federal commitment to the implementation of the plan would be made."
This view makes it clear that none of the provisions of this bill, or its authorization of Federal funds to support the work of the commission, constitutes any commitment to future Federal funding or participation in the Canal District project. Enactment of the bill does not alter the criteria determining whether Federal support will be provided areas such as the Lowell Historic Canal District.
In my judgment, the foregoing considerations should guide the commission in the preparation of its plan, and I have approved the measure on that basis.
