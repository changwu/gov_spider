  A Proclamation

For over 50 years, this Nation has observed Child Health Day. By setting aside this special day each year, we reaffirm our commitment to the improvement of the health of our children. Excellence is the only standard that is acceptable in our efforts to promote good health, prevent disease and disability, and improve conditions that interfere with the ability of each child to reach his or her potential.
In this International Year of the Child, we have accelerated our assault on infant mortality, childhood accidents, acute and chronic diseases and handicapping conditions. I am determined to assure that children receive the expert care they need and to which they are entitled. My goal continues to be excellence in providing for the health needs of our children.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 1, 1979, as Child Health Day.
I ask that you join me as we pledge our continuing attainment in the pursuit of excellence of health care for our Nation's children.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.

JIMMY CARTER
