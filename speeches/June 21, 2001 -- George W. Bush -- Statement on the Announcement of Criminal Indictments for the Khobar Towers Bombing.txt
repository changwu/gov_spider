    On June 25, 1996, a massive truck bomb exploded outside the Khobar Towers apartment complex in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 19 American servicemen and injuring 372 other Americans and Saudis. For the last 5 years, the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have conducted an intensive investigation of this deplorable act of terrorism.
Today the Department of Justice announced criminal indictments of 14 people, 13 Saudis and one Lebanese, for conspiring and carrying out the bombing of Khobar Towers. The Department's investigation into this matter will continue and additional charges are possible.
I applaud the work of the Department of Justice and the FBI who have spent countless hours pursuing this case. And I want to thank the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for their assistance in this investigation. Finally, and most important, to the families of those who were killed and to those who were injured, I want to extend my personal sympathy and to assure you that your Government will not forget your loss and will continue working, based on the evidence, to make sure that justice is done.
