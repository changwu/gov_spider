    Dr. Paul's friend to inspire liberty event attendees
LAKE JACKSON, Texas — The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential Campaign announced today that actor Vince Vaughn will introduce Dr. Paul at the Liberty Political Action Conference (LPAC).
The exchange will take place tonight, Friday, September 16th at 7:00 p.m. Pacific Time in Reno, Nevada.
"Ron and Vince are friends, with Vince not merely interested in Dr. Paul's philosophy but he also graciously invited Dr. and Mrs. Paul to the premier of his film 'Couples Retreat,'" said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton, referring to the October 6, 2009 film premier in California.
Mr. Vaughn, for his part, endorsed Dr. Paul's 2009 book End the Fed with the following enthusiastic quote: "Everyone must read this book—Congressmen and college students, Democrats and Republicans—all Americans."
End the Fed was published in hardcover on September 16, 2009, exactly two years ago today, and debuted at number six on The New York Times Best Seller list.
Details of the Paul-Vaughn exchange are as follows. Time is Pacific.
