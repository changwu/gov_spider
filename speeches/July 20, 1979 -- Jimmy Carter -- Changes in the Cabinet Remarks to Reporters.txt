    I have a brief statement to make, consisting of five parts.
First, after a long and very careful assessment, I have made some major changes in my Cabinet.
Secondly, these changes are all constructive, and the transition from one leader to another in each case will be orderly and properly conducted.
Third, I do not expect any further resignations from the Cabinet, other than those that have already been made. There are a few vacancies which I will fill without delay.
Fourth, I want to express my thanks to those who have served and who will now be leaving.
And fifth, I need the full support of the American people in the future.
I am well pleased with all the changes that have been made. Every single change has been a positive change. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that I and my administration will now be better able to serve this country and to resolve those problems and to meet those challenges which I described to the American people in my television address Sunday evening.
Thank you very much.
