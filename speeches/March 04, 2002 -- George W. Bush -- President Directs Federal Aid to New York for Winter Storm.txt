    The President declared a major disaster exists in the State of New York and ordered Federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the area struck by a severe winter storm on December 24-29, 2001.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to local governments in Erie County.
Federal funding is available to eligible local governments on a cost-sharing basis for the repair or replacement of public facilities damaged by the severe winter storm. Federal funding is also available on a cost share basis for hazard mitigation measures.
Joe M. Allbaugh, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), named Peter J. Martinasco as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
