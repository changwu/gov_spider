HONOLULU, Hawaii â€” 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul made history in Hawaii's first-ever Republican caucus last week, winning neighbor islands Maui and "Big Island."
The Aloha State held its first-ever Republican presidential caucus last Tuesday. In anticipation of what turnout might be, the Republican Party of Hawaii was buzzing with curiosity and excitement leading up to caucus day. Turnout predictions under discussion ranged from 4,000 to 6,000 voters. An air of success and celebration was palpable last Tuesday, when it was learned more than 10,000 Hawaiians participated.
On election night, the Ron Paul campaign was celebrating its victory of winning "The Big Island" as votes were reported via telephone from the neighbor islands. At this point in Maui, Ron Paul was a mere nine votes behind rival Mitt Romney. The final outcome was yet to be determined, as Paul campaign organizers awaited close to 200 provisional ballots being flown in from the neighbor islands.
For three full consecutive days, representatives and volunteers from each campaign locked themselves in a room together, counting ballots and receiving express mail packages arrive from the neighbor islands. When it came down to Maui, Ron Paul ended up receiving 47 provisional ballots cast for him, taking the lead over Mitt Romney by 18 votes.
"We were all sitting together with our calculators, and as soon I pushed 'equals' and wrote down the number 47, I knew that we had won Maui too," stated Ron Paul 2012 Hawaii State Director Meghann Walker. "I turned to look at the other Ron Paul supporters in the room and we all had a confident grin of excitement on our faces. It was a great moment we already count as a memorable one."
