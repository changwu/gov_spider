    Dear Mr. Speaker:
In accordance with provisions of Public Law 107-38, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States, FY 2001, today I have authorized transfers from the Emergency Response Fund totaling $9.3 billion for emergency recovery and response and national security activities listed in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. As provided in Public Law 107-38, $1.7 billion will be made available immediately and $7.5 billion of these funds will be made available 15 days from the date of this transmittal.
These funds are in addition to the $9.7 billion that I previously authorized for transfer and will allow our Government to continue to address the consequences arising from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
With this action, I have transferred all but $1 billion of the funds that were made available to me. It is now time for the Congress to act without delay on the final $20 billion in critical defense and domestic needs that I requested on October 17. My Administration does not intend to seek additional supplemental funding for either domestic or defense needs for the remainder of this session of Congress.
The details of these actions are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and observations.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
