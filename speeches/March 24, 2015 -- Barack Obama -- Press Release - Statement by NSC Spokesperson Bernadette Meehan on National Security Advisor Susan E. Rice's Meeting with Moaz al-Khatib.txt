    National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice met yesterday with Moaz al-Khatib, former President of the Syrian Opposition Coalition. Mr. Khatib offered his perspective on the path to a political solution to resolve Syria's civil war. Ambassador Rice stressed that Bashar al-Asad has lost all legitimacy to govern and must go, expressed concern for the humanitarian situation in Syria, and reaffirmed the United States' commitment to a negotiated political transition that would preserve the institutions of the Syrian state, protect minorities, and lay the foundations for a more inclusive government.
