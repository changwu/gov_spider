    Former Senator Cory Booker Endorser To Support Senator Klobuchar For President
Amy Klobuchar Continues To Lead Field With Twelve Current Legislator Endorsements
DES MOINES, IA â€” Iowa State Representative Charlie McConkey today endorsed Senator Amy Klobuchar for President. McConkey, who represents House District 15 in Council Bluffs, previously endorsed Senator Cory Booker.
"Like Senator Booker, Senator Klobuchar has run a campaign with a positive, unifying message that will bring this country together -- not divide us," said State Rep. Charlie McConkey. "Senator Klobuchar is committed to championing economic policies that give all Iowans and Americans an opportunity to succeed. For Senator Klobuchar and for myself, respecting the dignity of work means raising the minimum wage, making sure people have a secure retirement, and supporting universal health care for all Americans. Amy is someone who tells the truth, doesn't make promises she can't keep, and has people's backs -- which is why I am proud to support her to be our next President."
McConkey is currently serving his third term in the Iowa House. He serves on the Commerce, Economic Growth, Labor, and Ways and Means committees, as well as the Education Appropriations Subcommittee and the Flood Mitigation Board. A former steelworker and small business owner, McConkey is a member of United Steelworkers Local 3141 and has served on the Board of Steelworkers Credit Union.
Klobuchar, who has been widely praised for her legislative record in the U.S. Senate, has the support of more than 20 current and former members of the Iowa Legislature -- the most of any candidate. Each time she has led the ticket as a Senate candidate in Minnesota, Democrats have flipped the State House of Representatives from Republican to Democratic control.
Other sitting Iowa legislators supporting Klobuchar include:Iowa Senator Kevin KinneyIowa Senator Liz MathisIowa Senator Rich TaylorIowa Senator Todd TaylorIowa Representative Marti AndersonIowa Representative Bruce BearingerIowa Representative Molly DonahueIowa Representative Ruth Ann GainesIowa Representative Andy McKeanIowa Representative Sharon SteckmanIowa Representative Cindy Winckler
