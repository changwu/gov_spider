On Tuesday's Fox News Radio's Kilmeade & Friends, Ohio Gov. John Kasich commented on Donald Trump's foreign policy as outlined in the New York Times:
"I think that's the most ridiculous outline of foreign policy I've ever heard ... this is just somebody that doesn't understand foreign policy â€” just doesn't know it."



John Kasich's national security advisory group consists of 37 well-respected and experienced experts from all corners of the national security community.
