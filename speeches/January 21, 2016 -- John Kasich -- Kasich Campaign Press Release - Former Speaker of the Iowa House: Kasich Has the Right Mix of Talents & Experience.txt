When I look at all of the Republican hopefuls, I see only one candidate who has the right mix of talents and experience and could actually successfully perform the job of President of the United States. That candidate is John Kasich. Kasich is the only one who knows the importance of the job of President and the responsibility that comes with it. He has decades of experience as a reformer who gets results. He realizes that toughness, character and conviction, as well as cooperation, is necessary to impart change. While other candidates seem interested only in controversy and inflammatory statements which will drive the wedge between parties deeper than ever; making gridlock even worse and making progress impossible, Kasich has proven that he can reach across the aisle to actually pass conservative legislation. And he does this without compromising his core beliefs.
Kasich has won election and reelection to become and remain the Governor of Ohio, a notorious swing state. In 2014, he beat the Democrat opponent by over 30 points. If anyone can beat the Democratic nominee and unite this country in the pursuit of national safety, financial stability, and American values, it is John Kasich. On matters of values, Kasich recognizes the importance of family and education in this country and has never been afraid to stand by his beliefs.
