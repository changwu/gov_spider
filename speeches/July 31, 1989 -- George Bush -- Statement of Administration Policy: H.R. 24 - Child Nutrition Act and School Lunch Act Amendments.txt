    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Hawkins (D) CA and Goodling (R) PA)
The Administration supports reauthorization of the programs extended by H.R. 24 and has transmitted legislation to the Congress to extend and amend the programs.
The Administration does not object to House passage of H.R. 24, but will seek deletion or modification of certain objectionable provisions of the bill in the Senate. Among the objectionable provisions are th'e following:

allowing certain private sponsors to resume participation in the Summer Food Service Program. These types of sponsors were barred from participation by Congress because of widespread fraud in their activities under the program.
severely limiting the ability of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to continue its review of schools' meal claiming practices under the school lunch program by making the States responsible for evaluating program compliance. In FY 1989, USDA's Federal review initiative identified significant overclaims that were not. detected by State reviews.

The Administration strongly supports the provision of H.R. 24 added by the full House Education and Labor Committee that would expand participation in the Supplemental Feeding Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) by directing States to use competitive bidding â€” or a system producing similar savings when purchasing infant formula.
