All Polls and some brand new Polls show very little support for impeachment. Such a waste of time especially with sooo much good that could be done including prescription drug price reduction healthcare infrastructure etc.Retweets: 20075Favorites: 93498

Another Fake News story out there - It never ends! Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem!Retweets: 21362Favorites: 96763

....Knowing all of this is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially 'heavily populated' call. I would only do what is right anyway and only do good for the USA!Retweets: 18423Favorites: 88439

Because of my Administration drug prices are down for the first time in almost 50 years ' but the American people need Congress to help. I like Sen. Grassley's drug pricing bill very much and it's great to see Speaker Pelosi's bill today. Let's get it done in a bipartisan way!Retweets: 20346Favorites: 93457
