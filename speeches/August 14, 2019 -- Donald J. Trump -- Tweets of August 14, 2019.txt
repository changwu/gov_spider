No debate on Election Security should go forward without first agreeing that Voter ID (Identification) must play a very strong part in any final agreement. Without Voter ID it is all so meaningless!Retweets: 38730Favorites: 141621

'The Fed has got to do something! The Fed is the Central Bank of the United States not the Central Bank of the World.' Mark Grant @Varneyco Correct! The Federal Reserve acted far too quickly and now is very very late. Too bad so much to gain on the upside!Retweets: 13930Favorites: 52011

'So far you've had Tariffs imposed on 300 Billion Dollars worth of Chinese products but you can't tell me that it has hurt our economy...& it really hasn't led to any kind of serious rise in prices at the consumer level.' @Varneyco @FoxBusiness And we are taking in $Billions!Retweets: 14141Favorites: 57647

The Great Charles Payne @cvpayne correctly stated that Fed Chair Jay Powell made TWO enormous mistakes. 1. When he said 'mid cycle adjustment.' 2. We're data dependent. 'He did not do the right thing.' I agree (to put it mildly!). @VarneycoRetweets: 13689Favorites: 50921

We are winning big time against China. Companies & jobs are fleeing. Prices to us have not gone up and in some cases have come down. China is not our problem though Hong Kong is not helping. Our problem is with the Fed. Raised too much & too fast. Now too slow to cut....Retweets: 18897Favorites: 85916

..Spread is way too much as other countries say THANK YOU to clueless Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve. Germany and many others are playing the game! CRAZY INVERTED YIELD CURVE! We should easily be reaping big Rewards & Gains but the Fed is holding us back. We will Win!Retweets: 15727Favorites: 70688

Good things were stated on the call with China the other day. They are eating the Tariffs with the devaluation of their currency and 'pouring' money into their system.

..deferral to December. It actually helps China more than us but will be reciprocated. Millions of jobs are being lost in China to other non-Tariffed countries. Thousands of companies are leaving. Of course China wants to make a deal. Let them work humanely with Hong Kong first!Retweets: 17069Favorites: 86076

I know President Xi of China very well. He is a great leader who very much has the respect of his people. He is also a good man in a 'tough business.' I have ZERO doubt that if President Xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem he can do it. Personal meeting?Retweets: 23461Favorites: 105814
