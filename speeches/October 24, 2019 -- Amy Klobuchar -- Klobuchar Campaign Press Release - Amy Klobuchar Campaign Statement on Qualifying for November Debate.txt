    MINNEAPOLIS, MN â€” Today, Amy Klobuchar qualified for the fifth Democratic presidential primary debate in November with her fourth poll -- three of which came in the last four days -- as she continues to build her post-debate momentum. The campaign met the 165,000 donor threshold last month. In response to today's news, Amy For America campaign manager Justin Buoen released the following statement:
"Since Amy's stand-out performance in the October debate we've raised more than $2 million and seen a surge in interest and engagement across the country. Today we're proud to announce Senator Klobuchar qualified for the November debate after receiving three more qualifying polls in four days. We will use this momentum to continue building on our strong grassroots operation as we head into Iowa and New Hampshire."
