    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Dingell (D) Michigan and 68 others)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1934 because the fairness doctrine: (1) is unnecessary, especially in light of the dramatic increase in the number of broadcast information sources in recent years; (2) does not promote, but actually inhibits, the free and open discussion of important and controversial issues; and (3) may violate important First Amendment principles by inappropriately restricting the journalistic freedoms of broadcasters.
