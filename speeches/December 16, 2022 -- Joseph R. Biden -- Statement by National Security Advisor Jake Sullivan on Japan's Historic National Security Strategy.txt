    Today, Japan has taken a bold and historic step to strengthen and defend the free and open Indo-Pacific with the adoption of its new National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy and Defense Buildup Program. The strategy sets forth the vision of Prime Minister Kishida and the Japanese people for a broad and strong community of partners and allies in support of peace and stability in the region. Japan's goal to significantly increase defense investments will also strengthen and modernize the U.S.-Japan Alliance. The new strategy reinforces Prime Minister Kishida's deep commitment to international peace and nuclear nonproliferation and sets the stage for Japan's leadership in 2023, as Japan takes a seat on the United Nations Security Council and hosts the G7. We are grateful for Prime Minister Kishida's and Japan's leadership around the world, including their support for Ukraine as Russia wages its brutal war. We congratulate Prime Minister Kishida and the people of Japan on their historic new National Security Strategy which will help us and our partners achieve lasting peace, stability and prosperity.
