    Senate Judiciary Committee To Pursue Contempt Citations Instead Of Getting Work Done On Nominations
"Tomorrow, the Senate will move forward with contempt citations against two of the President's senior advisors. Congressional Democrats have ensured that they will be remembered for pointless investigations instead of much needed legislation. The Senate Judiciary Committee could make better use of its time by making progress on these important nominations."
