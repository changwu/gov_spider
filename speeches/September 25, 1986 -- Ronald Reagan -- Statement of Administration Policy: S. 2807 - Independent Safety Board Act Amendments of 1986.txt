    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Danforth (R) Missouri)
The Administration opposes Senate passage of S. 2807 unless it is amended to:
— Delete section 8, which would permit airports to use a portion of their grants under the Airport Improvement Program (designed to fund airport capital improvements) for liability insurance payments (an airport operating cost);
— Credit National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) receipts to the General Fund rather than the Board's appropriations account, consistent with sound principles of budgetary control; and
— Authorize appropriations for the NTSB of $21.4 million, $21.7 million, and $22 million for fiscal years 1987 - 1989, respectively, instead of the $24 million, $25.4 million, and $27 million levels currently in the bill.
