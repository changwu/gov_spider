    I commend the House for taking an important step toward ensuring the continued availability of insurance for terrorist-related acts and for ensuring that victims of terrorism don't also become subjects of unfair lawsuits. Access to affordable insurance is necessary for a stable and productive economy where builders continue to build and investors continue to invest. It is time for the Senate to focus on this important issue.
