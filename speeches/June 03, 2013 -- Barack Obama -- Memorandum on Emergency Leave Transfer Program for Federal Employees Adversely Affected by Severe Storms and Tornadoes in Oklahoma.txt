Subject: Emergency Leave Transfer Program for Federal Employees Adversely Affected by the Severe Storms and Tornadoes in Oklahoma
I am deeply saddened by the devastating losses caused by the severe storms and tornadoes in Oklahoma and their aftermath. The Federal Government has mobilized to respond to this major disaster, and many Federal employees are dealing with overwhelming personal losses.
To further assist Federal employees and their family members adversely affected by the storms and tornadoes in Oklahoma, I hereby direct the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to establish an emergency leave transfer program, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 6391. The program will permit employees in the executive and judicial branches, or an agency leave bank established under 5 U.S.C. 6363, to donate unused annual leave for transfer to employees of the same or other agencies (or the judicial branch) who were adversely affected by the storms and tornadoes in Oklahoma and who need additional time off for recovery. I further direct OPM to provide additional guidance to agencies on the program's administration.
