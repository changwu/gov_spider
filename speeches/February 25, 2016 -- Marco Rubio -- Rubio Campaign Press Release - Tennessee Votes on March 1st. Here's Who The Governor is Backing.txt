Conservative leaders across the country know Marco is the right choice to be the next commander-in-chief.
Haslam says that we need to inspire Americans:
To win in November, conservatives need a candidate who inspires Americans from all backgrounds. With Marco standing next to Hillary Clinton on a debate stage, the choice between the future and the past will be clear to every American. Marco has the innovative policy agenda to reclaim the American Dream for all our people, and his conservative ideas will bring the Republican Party — and America — into the future.
Governor Haslam was elected Governor in 2010, and has been a leader in turning conservative principles into action.
Under Governor Haslam's results-driven, common sense leadership, Tennessee is recognized as a national leader in education, job creation and fiscal responsibility.
Before being elected Governor, Haslam was the Mayor of Knoxville from 2003 to 2011. He also has a long and successful career as a business executive.
Governor Haslam, welcome to Team Marco!
