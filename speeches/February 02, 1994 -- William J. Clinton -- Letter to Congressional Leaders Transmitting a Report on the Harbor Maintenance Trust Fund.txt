    Dear Mr. Chairman:
I transmit herewith the first annual report on the status of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund as required by section 330 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-580). This report covers the history of the Trust Fund from its inception in 1987 through fiscal year 1992.
The Harbor Maintenance Fee and Trust Fund program now provides 100 percent of the operations and maintenance expenditures for those activities of the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation and the Army Corps of Engineers, which benefit commercial navigation. In fiscal year 1992, nearly $500 million was appropriated from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for such purposes. This report provides an evaluation of the Trust Fund, including its administration, use, and prospects for the future.
I have delegated responsibility for transmittal of this report in future years to the Secretary of Defense.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
