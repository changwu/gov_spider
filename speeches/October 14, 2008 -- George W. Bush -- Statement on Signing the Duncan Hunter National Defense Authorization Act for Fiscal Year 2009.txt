    Today I have signed into law S. 3001, the "Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009." The Act authorizes funding for the defense of the United States and its interests abroad, for military construction, and for national security-related energy programs.
Provisions of the Act, including sections 851, 902, 1211(2), and 1508(b), purport to impose requirements that could inhibit the President's ability to carry out his constitutional obligations to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, to protect national security, to conduct diplomatic negotiations, to supervise the executive branch, to appoint officers of the United States, and to execute his authority as Commander in Chief. The executive branch shall continue to construe such provisions in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority and obligations of the President.
GEORGE W. BUSH
The White House, October 14, 2008.
