    Chapel Hill, North Carolina – Senator John Edwards released the following statement today regarding the New York Times report that Senate Democratic leadership will push for Iraq troop withdrawal:
"Today's New York Times report that Democrats in the Senate will begin a new push to change President Bush's disastrous Iraq policy is encouraging news. I was disappointed when Congress backed down to the president's veto of the supplemental appropriations bill and believed then—as I do now—that they should stand firm and strong with the American people and against this president.
"For months, I have been calling for Congress to use its constitutional funding power to stop the president's 'surge,' implement a timetable for withdrawal, and bring this conflict to an end. Under my plan, Congress should use its funding authority immediately to withdraw 40,000 to 50,000 troops, and should require withdrawal of all troops within about a year. They should take these steps quickly.
"I urge all Americans to ask their Congressional representatives to take action to end this war and bring our troops home to the heroes' welcome they deserve."
