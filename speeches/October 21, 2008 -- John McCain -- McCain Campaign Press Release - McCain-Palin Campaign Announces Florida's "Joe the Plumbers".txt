    TALLAHASSEE, FL -- The McCain-Palin presidential campaign today announced its own group of Florida "Joe the Plumbers."
The original "Joe the Plumber" is Joe Wurzelbacker, a plumber from Ohio. When Joe expressed his frustrations with Senator Obama's plans to tax the "wealthy," Senator Obama replied by saying it's important to "spread the wealth around." In the final presidential debate, Joe the Plumber became a symbol of the economic troubles crippling the United States.
These Florida "Joes" are outraged that Senator Obama wants to raise their taxes so he can pay for his government-mandated health care system and other big government programs. Each of these small business owners has expressed support for John McCain's pro-growth plan to keep taxes low, which will benefit all Americans by stimulating new job growth, keeping good jobs here at home and getting our economy back on the right track.
Anyone interested in joining the Florida "Joes" can contact the campaign via e-mail at FLJoethePlumber@JohnMcCain.com or through the "Joe the Plumber" Hotline at 850-391-3304.
