    Dear Mr. Twomey: 
Pursuant to section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, I established by Executive order an Emergency Board to investigate a dispute between the Soo Line Railroad Company and certain of its employees represented by the United Transportation Union. The functions and the duties of the Emergency Board are set forth in the Railway Labor Act, as amended, and in the Executive order creating the Board.
I am pleased to learn that you are willing to serve on this Emergency Board, and I hereby appoint you as Chair. This letter will constitute your appointment and your authority to act in that capacity. Each Member of the Board is to receive compensation at the rate of $429.00 per day for each day that you are actually engaged in the performance of your duties or in travel in connection therewith. In addition, each Member of the Board will be allowed per diem in lieu of subsistence while so engaged away from your home or your regular place of business.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
