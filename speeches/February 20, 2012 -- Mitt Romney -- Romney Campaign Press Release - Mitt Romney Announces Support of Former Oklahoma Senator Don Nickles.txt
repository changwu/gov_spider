    Mitt Romney today announced the support of former Oklahoma Senator Don Nickles.
"My campaign is gaining the support of conservative leaders like Senator Nickles because my message of cutting spending and reducing burdensome regulations is what our economy needs at this critical moment," said Mitt Romney. "Senator Nickles fought for conservative principles when serving Oklahoma — I hope to continue this fight as president."
"Conservatives looking to change Washington and reverse the policies of the last three years should look no further than Mitt Romney," said Senator Nickles. "Our country can't afford to continue borrowing trillions of dollars from China to pay for President Obama's big-government, job-killing policies. Mitt Romney spent his life in the private sector and knows you can't keep spending more than you take in — your business will fail if you don't balance your books. Unless we elect a proven budget-cutter like Mitt Romney, our country could face a situation like Greece is facing today. I urge all Oklahomans to come out and vote for Mitt Romney on March 6th — Oklahoma deserves a proven leader like Mitt Romney."
Background on Senator Nickles:
Senator Nickles served in The United States Senate from 1981 to 2005. Senator Nickles fought for reduced government spending, lower taxes, and a strengthened national defense.
