    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Biaggi (D) New York and Kildee (D) Michigan)
The Administration opposes H.R. 2453, because it: (1) unnecessarily increases the entitlement level for reimbursements for meals served (or commodities in lieu of cash) under the Older Americans Act and (2) eliminates the statutory requirement for reducing the per meal reimbursement level when necessary to stay within the amount authorized by Congress. The number of meals served has grown more than 30% since fiscal year 1981, largely because of monetary donations for meals from the nonâ€”needy elderly. Because these donations are expected to grow in the future, the increased authorizations in H.R. 2453 are unnecessary.
