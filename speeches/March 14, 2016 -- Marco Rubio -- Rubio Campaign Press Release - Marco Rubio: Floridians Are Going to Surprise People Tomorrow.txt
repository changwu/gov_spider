    Marco in Jacksonville: Tomorrow 'We're Going to Shock the Country'
 
March 14, 2016
Speaking to a raucous group of supports in Jacksonville this morning, Marco promised that tomorrow's primary results in Florida will "shock the country."

Tomorrow's the day where we're going to shock the country, and we're going to do what needs to be done. We're going to win the 99 delegates here in Florida, and it's going to give us the momentum we need to go into Arizona and Utah, and beyond. What's at stake is too important — all these elections are important — but what's at stake in this election is the definition and identity of our country and our party.
Long story short, Team Marco's incredible ground game is working in Florida: Every day, the call centers are packed, and supporters swamped the polls over the weekend to vote early for Marco.It's not too late to help out. Join our call from home team to reach more Floridians and help Marco complete this historic upset.
And if you're in Florida, vote tomorrow. The future of our country and our party depend on it.
