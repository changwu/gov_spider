    Presidential candidate and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich issued the following statement reacting to the Obama administration's decision to delay approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline indefinitely:
Once again, President Obama has demonstrated that he cares more about appeasing radical constituencies than making energy more affordable for American families and businesses, creating more American jobs, and lowering our dependence on oil from unfriendly nations.
Only days after we learned that at least 9% of Americans were unemployed for the 30th straight month, the President has made a decision that will only prolong this suffering by delaying a project that could have created 20,000 new American jobs next year. The Keystone XL pipeline would have sent 700,000 barrels of oil a day from Texas, Oklahoma, Montana, the Dakotas, and Alberta to Gulf Coast refineries, which would lower staggering gas and diesel prices for Americans and replace oil imports from overseas.
The Keystone XL pipeline creates critical infrastructure for American energy and the American economy without a single penny of taxpayer money. As part of my Day One Plan in the 21st Century Contract with America, I will approve this project on the first day of my administration in 2013.
