    Newark, NJ – Cory 2020 Campaign Manager Addisu Demissie issued the following statement after the conclusion of the first Democratic primary debate tonight:
"Viewers tuning in for the first time tonight saw exactly why Cory Booker is at the top of the list of candidates Democratic voters across the country are considering. Cory clearly won this debate, standing out on answer after answer — from gun violence prevention to immigration to criminal justice reform to how he would deal with the toughest foreign policy challenges as commander-in-chief. Cory successfully introduced himself, articulated why he's best prepared to beat Donald Trump, and provided a clear vision for creating a more just and fair nation for all.
"Cory was poised, passionate, and delivered concise, well-reasoned answers that show he is ready to take on Donald Trump in a general election and ready to serve as president.
"In a word, Cory was presidential."
