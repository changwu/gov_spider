    WOODBRIDGE, NJ -- At the National Sheriffs' Association's 68th Annual Conference today in Indianapolis, Indiana, John McCain outlined his plan for keeping our communities safe from crime. Closer to home, two of New Jersey's most prominent sheriffs offered strong support for John McCain's comprehensive crime fighting strategy.
Morris County Sheriff Ed Rochford who attended the conference, said, "John McCain understands that protecting our communities begins with supporting state and local law enforcement. The hard working families in the State of New Jersey will be safe with John McCain as president."
In his speech, Senator McCain outlined his vision for how the federal government will work with local communities to ensure law enforcement has the tools they need to do their jobs effectively. John McCain fought in the U.S. Senate to provide first responders with a national, interoperable communications system by proposing the SAVE LIVES Act. Senator McCain also highlighted his work to strengthen laws against predators.
Monmouth County Sherriff Kim Guadagno added, "I am confident that John McCain will be an effective leader who will keep our children safe. John McCain has made the protection of our children a priority throughout his more than 20 years in Congress. His efforts in this area, including his work on the Adam Walsh Act and the National Sex Offender Registry, enable local law enforcement to pursue aggressively those predators who seek to harm our children."
