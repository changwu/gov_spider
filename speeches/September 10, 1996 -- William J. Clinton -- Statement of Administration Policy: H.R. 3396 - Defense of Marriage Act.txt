The President strongly opposes discrimination against any group of Americans, including gay and lesbian individuals, and he supports legislation to outlaw such discrimination in the workplace.
The President, however, has long opposed same sex marriage. Therefore, if H.R. 3396 were presented to the President as passed by the House of Representatives, the President would sign the legislation.
