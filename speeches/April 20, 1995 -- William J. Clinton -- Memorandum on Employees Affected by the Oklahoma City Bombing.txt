    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies 
Subject: Excused Absence for Employees Affected by the Bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City
I am deeply saddened by the loss of life and suffering caused by the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.
I convey my deepest sympathy and heartfelt sorrow to our fellow Americans and their families who have been affected by this senseless act of violence. Many parts of the Federal Government have been mobilized to respond to this tragedy.
As part of this effort, I ask the heads of executive departments and agencies having Federal civilian employees in the Oklahoma City area to excuse from duty, without charge to leave or loss of pay, any such employee who is prevented from reporting to work or faced with a personal emergency because of the bombing and who can be spared from his or her usual responsibilities. This policy should also be applied to any employee who is needed for emergency law enforcement, relief, or recovery efforts authorized by Federal, State, or local officials having jurisdiction.
Workers' compensation benefits are available in the case of Federal employees who were injured or killed in the bombing. The Department of Labor has sent a team of workers' compensation specialists to Oklahoma City to provide direct assistance to affected employees and their families.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
