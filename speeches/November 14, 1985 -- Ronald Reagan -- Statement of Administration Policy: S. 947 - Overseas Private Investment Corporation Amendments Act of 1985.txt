    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Senator Lugar (R) Indiana)
The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 947 but is concerned about the provision restricting the Overseas Private Investment Corporation's operations in countries which have not taken steps to adopt and implement laws that extend internationally recognized worker rights. This restriction would hinder OPIC's ability to operate in the least developed countries rather than accomplishing its intended purpose of advancing international worker rights.
