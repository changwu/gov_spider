    The President. Happy Halloween, everybody!
Audience members. Happy Halloween!
The President. Trick or treat.
Audience members. Trick or treat.
The President. The—well, it is great to see all of you guys. Your costumes are outstanding. Young man, no selfies in the middle of me talking. [Laughter] The—and, Darth Vader, back up a little bit. I'm getting spooked. [Laughter]
The—so we just want to say to all the families, all the kids, it is great to see you guys. We hope you have a great time today. You guys all look scary or cool or whatever you're trying to be. [Laughter] Awesome. Many of you look awesome. And we hope you have a great time. We hope, parents, that on this day, at least, you don't have to pay attention to Michelle and healthy eating. [Laughter]
The First Lady. Candy for everybody.
Audience members. Yay!
The President. And in fact, the more candy, the later you eat the candy, the better. [Laughter] Because I think that you being up all night with a sugar rush is exactly what your parents are looking for. [Laughter]
All right? So we hope you guys have a great time. And to the staff who are here, thank you, guys. I'm glad you guys took a little break from all the outstanding work.
And now, my understanding is, is that we've been working on a little dance. We don't know how it's going to go, but we think we should all just try it anyway. What do you think?
Audience members. Yes!
The President. Yes, don't you think?
The First Lady. I want to see what you guys have done.
The President. All right. So who's got the music? Let's cue it up. Everybody, get ready.
[At this point, the children danced to Michael Jackson's "Thriller" as the President and Mrs. Obama watched from the stage.]
