    SANTA FE, NM -- Governor Bill Richardson will be in Washington, DC on Wednesday to deliver a major foreign policy speech regarding Iran. The Governor will be speaking to the Center for National Policy.
The speech will focus on US relations with Iran going forward, specifically how the US can and must lead the world in preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Here is an excerpt from the prepared text of the speech:
"As we know from the Cold War, deterrence is above all a matter of clarity and credibility. We need to be absolutely clear that a nuclear Iran is unacceptable, and we need to be absolutely credible when we say what we will do about it if the Iranians continue to disregard the will of the international community. The clear message must be this: develop nukes and you will face devastating global sanctions. Desist from developing nukes and you will receive meaningful rewards, including robust security guarantees and guaranteed supplies of nuclear fuel from abroad."

WHEN: Wednesday, June 27, 2007, 12:30 p.m.
