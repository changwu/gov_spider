    Presidential Determination No. 81-9
Memorandum for the United States Trade Representative
Subject: Renewal of Trade Agreements with Romania and Hungary - Findings and Determinations under Subsection 405(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974
Pursuant to my authority under the Trade Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-618, January 3, 1975; 88 Stat. 1978), I find, pursuant to subsection 405(b)(1) of that Act, that a satisfactory balance of concessions in trade and services has been maintained during the lives of the Agreements on Trade Relations between the United States and the Socialist Republic of Romania and the Hungarian People's Republic. I further determine that actual or foreseeable reductions in United States tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade resulting from multilateral negotiations have been satisfactorily reciprocated by the Socialist Republic of Romania and by the Hungarian People's Republic.
These findings and determinations shall be published in the Federal Register.
