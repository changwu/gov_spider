    The Senate trade bill, similar to the House version, contains numerous provisions that are unacceptable. If either bill came to me in present form, I would have no choice except to veto it.
I remain willing to work with the Congress on a more acceptable bill and will reserve final judgment until action is completed on the trade legislation. But any bill that raises the cost of living for American families and reduces the ability of American business to compete in the world economy goes in exactly the wrong direction.
