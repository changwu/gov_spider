    The United States congratulates the people of Burkina Faso for participating in peaceful and orderly elections on November 29, marking a major milestone in the country's democratic progress. In recent years, Burkinabe citizens have stood up to repeated attempts to infringe on their right to choose leaders in a legitimate process, turning back an effort by the previous president to extend his stay in office illegitimately and then successfully resisting efforts by an isolated few to derail democratic elections. The United States commends the Burkinabe people for their commitment to defending the principles of democracy and congratulates President-elect Roch Mark Christian Kabore on his victory in the presidential election. The United States looks forward to continuing to partner with the people and government of Burkina Faso as they seize this opportunity to unify the country and advance the vital work of strengthening Burkinabe institutions.
