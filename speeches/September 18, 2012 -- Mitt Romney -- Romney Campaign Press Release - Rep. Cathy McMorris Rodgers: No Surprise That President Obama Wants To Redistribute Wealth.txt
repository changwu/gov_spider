    Washington Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers today made the following statement on President Obama's comments about redistributing wealth: Â 
"In looking at President Obama's record of growing government over the last three and a half years, it's really no surprise that he has previously declared his belief in redistribution of wealth. But Americans don't need a president who attacks success, as President Obama has done; they want a leader like Mitt Romney in the White House who will empower Americans to be successful by creating 12 million jobs, stimulating economic growth in our communities, and championing innovation."
