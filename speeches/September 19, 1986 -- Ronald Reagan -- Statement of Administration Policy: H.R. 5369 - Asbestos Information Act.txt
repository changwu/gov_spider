    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Lent (R) New York and 9 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5369 because the development of protocols and laboratory accreditation cannot be established within the time required, and the cost of establishing the protocols and developing the accreditation program is uncertain and may be large.
