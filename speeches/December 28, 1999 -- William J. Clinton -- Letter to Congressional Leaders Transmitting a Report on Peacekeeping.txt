    Dear Mr. Chairman:
I am pleased to transmit herewith the 1998 Annual Report to the Congress on Peacekeeping. The report is required by section 4(d) of the United Nations Participation Act (Public Law 79-264), as amended, and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 (Public Law 103-236).
The report provides an account of how the United States used peacekeeping last year to promote regional stability and to advance U.S. interests.
United Nations and other peacekeeping operations also helped us protect our interests before they were directly threatened, and ensured that other nations shared with us the risks and costs of maintaining international stability.
We continued to promote greater discipline in decision-making regarding multilateral peace operations in national capitals and at the United Nations. This includes increased focus on key questions about the mandate, size, costs, duration, and exit strategy for peacekeeping operations before they are approved.
I look forward to working with you to ensure that peacekeeping remains a viable option for dealing with international conflicts.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
