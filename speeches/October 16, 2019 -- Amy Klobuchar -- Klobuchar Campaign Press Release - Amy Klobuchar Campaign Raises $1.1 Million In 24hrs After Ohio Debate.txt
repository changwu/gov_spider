    Online Donations Surge Following Commanding Debate Performance
MINNEAPOLIS, MN â€” Following "her strongest performance yet" at the Democratic presidential debate in Ohio, the Amy for America campaign has surged in grassroots fundraising and online support. Today was the campaign's best day of online fundraising, surpassing even the announcement in February, and tonight the campaign reached $1.1 million in contributions in 24 hours since the debate. The campaign also collected more supporter signups today than on any other day during the campaign.
"In last night's debate, Amy Klobuchar took the fight to Donald Trump and outlined a clear optimistic agenda," said Amy For America Campaign Manager Justin Buoen. "Clearly her message is resonating with Americans who are fed up with the noise and nonsense coming out of Washington. In the 24 hours following the debate, the campaign raised $1.1 million and saw a massive spike in organic signups to join our team heading into a critical stretch of this primary. We look forward to building on this momentum as we continue to make investments in our early state infrastructure and work to build a grassroots operation that can win big in 2020."
