    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Today, I have proclaimed a State of Emergency due to the extended drought in the Southwest, and other natural disasters in feed grainproducing areas of the United States. The proclamation of a State of Emergency will permit the Secretary of Agriculture ("Secretary") to release feed grain supplies from the Disaster Reserve to assist livestock producers that have been greatly harmed by the drought. The Secretary has prepared a plan that would implement the disposition of the feed grain supplies from the Disaster Reserve.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
