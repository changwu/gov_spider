    Dear Mr. Speaker:
In accordance with provisions of Public Law 107-116, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002, I hereby request and make available appropriations of $100 million for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program of the Department of Health and Human Services. These funds will enable the Department to address the needs of low-income households in 33 States and the District of Columbia experiencing hotter than normal weather conditions.
I designate the $100 million made available today as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended. The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and observations.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
