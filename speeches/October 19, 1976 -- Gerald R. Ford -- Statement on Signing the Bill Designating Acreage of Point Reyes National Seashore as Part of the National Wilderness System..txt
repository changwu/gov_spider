    FOR MILLIONS of Americans in California and stretching far beyond, Point Reyes represents a wonderful haven where one can rest at peace with the land and the sea. I take great pleasure in signing special legislation that designates over 25,000 acres of Point Reyes National Seashore as part of the Nation's Wilderness System. By officially becoming part of the Wilderness System, Point Reyes will be preserved in its natural beauty not only for this generation but for many generations to come.
