    IOWA CITY, IA â€” Today, March for Our Lives organizer and political activist Cameron Kasky endorsed Andrew Yang for president. In addition, Kasky will visit the University of Iowa on Saturday, Jan. 11, where he will participate in a Political Activism Town Hall.
"I support Andrew because Andrew is the candidate who makes me feel like I'm investing in future generations and laying out the foundation for long-lasting change. I am very tired of compromising and trying the same nonsense that's been failing the American people for generations. Yang is offering up solutions that change the game," said Kasky.
In the wake of the horrific 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas (MSD) High School in Parkland, Fla., Kasky and his classmates co-founded Never Again MSD and organized the March for Our Lives to appeal to lawmakers to enact common-sense gun control measures. Kasky currently attends Columbia University in New York City.
Kasky's endorsement is the latest example of Andrew Yang's growing momentum and it comes on the heels of the campaign's $16.5 million fundraising quarter, the campaign's highest of the cycle.
