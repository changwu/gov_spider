    Earlier today, Vice President Biden met with a broad group of Haitian-American leaders to discuss the United States' lasting commitment to Haiti. The Vice President underscored the important work the United States and our international partners have engaged upon in partnership with the Haitian people since last year's devastating earthquake.
The Vice President and the Haitian-American leaders were joined by a team of senior U.S. government officials who discussed the whole-of-government U.S. effort relating to Haiti and the unprecedented challenges that remain for recovery and reconstruction efforts.
