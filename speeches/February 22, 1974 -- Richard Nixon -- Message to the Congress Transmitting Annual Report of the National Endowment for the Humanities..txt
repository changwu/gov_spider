    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit the Eighth Annual Report of the National Endowment for the Humanities for fiscal year 1973. Training in the humanities, history, literature, and philosophy, among other disciplines, guided those who shaped the American nation and its basic documents two hundred years ago. Now, as at the beginning of our history, the ongoing enrichment of the humanities is central to the solution of those problems which challenge a nation, young or old--problems which affect the quest for a life of quality by all its citizens.
The Federal Government recognized and affirmed the importance of the humanities nine years ago with the establishment of the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities. It reaffirmed that importance last year with legislation extending the Foundation for another three years.
As the National Endowment for the Humanities has grown it has increasingly attracted gifts from individuals, corporations, and foundations. I am happy to note that these, for the fourth year in a row, have more than matched Federal funds appropriated for that purpose. Such public confidence in the Humanities Endowment and its work more than justifies the strong support the Endowment has received from both the legislative and executive branches and augurs well for the future development of the humanities in this country.
