    Mayor Bottoms understands that democracy is about making government work for working families, for the people who are the backbone of this country. She led the city of Atlanta with strength through the pandemic, through a summer of protests and pain, and through the mass shooting that left Atlanta's Asian American community in fear. Keisha is bright, honorable, tough and has the integrity required to represent our administration to the American public. Jill and I have known Keisha for a long time and look forward to working with her more closely.
