    I have long supported legislation to prevent companies from permanently replacing their striking workers. Unfortunately, last year a minority of Senators prevented the full Senate from voting on the bill.
Now Bridgestone-Firestone's use of permanent replacements shows exactly why this protection is necessary. By bringing in permanent replacements for their workers who are on strike, while refusing to come to the bargaining table, the management of Bridgestone-Firestone is flagrantly turning its back on our tradition of peaceful collective bargaining to solve labor disputes. When companies replace their workers under these circumstances, they sow seeds of distrust and resentment which can extend far beyond their company, undermining labor-management relations across the land. Bridgestone-Firestone should get back to the bargaining table with the United Rubber Workers to reach a fair settlement. Secretary Reich and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service stand ready to help. Let's get on with it.
