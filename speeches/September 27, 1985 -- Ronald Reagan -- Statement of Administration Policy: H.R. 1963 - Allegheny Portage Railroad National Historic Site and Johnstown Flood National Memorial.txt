    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revision)(House)(Rep. Murtha (D) Pennsylvania)
The Administration opposes H.R. 1963. Increasing the appropriations authorizations for development of these two units of the National Park System from $6,079,600 to almost $16,000,000 is unnecessary because (1) development of these two units is of low priority compared to other park projects and (2) over $4 million more can be appropriated under current law if and when such projects gain high enough priority in the budget process. Furthermore, the Administration opposes authorizing appropriations for technical assistance to the Johnstown Flood Museum Association, believing that such funding should come from private sources.
