    MSNBC's "Morning Joe"
November 13, 2007
MSNBC's Joe Scarborough: "Let's bring in Mitt Romney, Governor Mitt Romney who's, of course, a front-runner in a lot of the early states and caucuses. He joins us now. Governor thanks for being us with."
Governor Mitt Romney: "Thank you Joe, good to be with you."
Scarborough: "Hey, we just had Bill Bennett on earlier, and he was talking about how illegal immigration remains one of the key issues for people that call into his show, and he believes it's going to be a huge issue this year. If that's the case, how do you separate yourself from the rest of the pack on the Republican side on this issue?"
Governor Romney: "Well that's pretty straight forward. And that is, Mayor Giuliani, of course, was the mayor of a sanctuary city, and he said if you're illegal you're welcome in New York, we'll protect you here. And that, I think is exactly the wrong attitude. And, of course, Senator McCain proposed and backed a bill, the last Senate version, which gave a form of amnesty to every illegal alien already in the country. So they've taken a very, if you will, sanctuary state of mind approach. And my view is, instead, that we should enforce our borders, secure them, that we should have an employment verification system to determine who's here legally and not, and we should not provide amnesty to those that are here illegally. So it's a very different course. And I think that's in part why in the states I spend the most time, I'm getting the best support."
