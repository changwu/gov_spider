    Let me first welcome you, Mr. Stewart, and all of you representing different faiths and creeds and beliefs. I thank you very, very much for this collection, which will be a significant part of the White House memorabilia.
I didn't realize until I talked to you and read some material on it, but there have been proclamations issued either by a congress or the Congress and by the President since June 12, 1775. I was delighted, of course, to issue the proclamation for July 24, 1975. The point that I think significant is the following: Our forefathers for almost 200 years have prayed, regardless of their beliefs or their faith, and this has helped them, and they are doing it today as they have in the past.
But equally significant, it has been the prayers of our forefathers, as it is the prayers of our fellow countrymen today, that have made America strong. And I am convinced, as we move ahead, individual prayer will help not only the person but the country, and prayer today means as much to Americans as it did on June 12, 1775.
And I thank you very, very much for this beautiful collection. This is a beautiful collection, and I thank you on behalf of the Presidency and thank you again, all the people who are here representing the various faiths in America.
