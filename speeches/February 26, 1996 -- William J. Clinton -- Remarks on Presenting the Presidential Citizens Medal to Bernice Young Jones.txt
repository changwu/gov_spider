    The President. I want to begin, Bernice, by welcoming members of your family and your friends here, and we're especially glad to have Senator Bumpers and Congressman Hutchinson come.
I learned this morning something I did not know, that this is your first trip to Washington. Well, to have managed to live as many years as you have——
Ms. Jones. Ninety. [Laughter]
The President. ——without ever coming to Washington, that alone is justification for this award. [Laughter]
Ms. Jones. And that's my sister, and it's her first trip, and she's 92.
Hillary Clinton. Is that right?
The President. Well, neither one of you look it, and we're glad to have you.
Hillary Clinton. That's probably why they look so good. [Laughter]
The President. Let me say that for me, personally, this is a great pleasure because I know very well of the extraordinary work you have done for health care in Arkansas, for education, and of course, the center you established in your name and your late husband's name for families in Springdale. The things that you have done and stood for and tried to help are the things that all of us in America should be trying to advance. And you are a shining example for philanthropy in our country.
I can only hope that every State will find someone like you to help do what needs to be done. And it is for that reason that I wanted to give you this President's Citizens Medal. And I'm very glad you decided to take leave of your very good policy and at least one time come to Washington, DC. [Laughter]
Ms. Jones. Thank you so much. I appreciate it for myself, my family, my friends, my wonderful Springdale, and Arkansas.
The President. I'd like to ask my military aide now to read the citation.
