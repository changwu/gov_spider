    This weekend Newt spoke to an overflow crowd of 400 people at a Chick-fil-A in Greenville, South Carolina. He talked about the 21st Century Contract With America and repeated his challenge to President Obama of seven Lincoln-Douglas debates. While at the Chick-fil-A Newt also filled out the paperwork to become an official candidate in South Carolina. Patch.com reported on the townhall:
Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich stumped in Greenville on Friday, stopping at the Chick-fil-A on Pelham Road.
He used the stop not only to turnover a filing check to SC GOP Chairman Chad Connelly, but also to take multiple shots at President Barack Obama.
One of the jabs included a direct challenge to the president.
"We've heard some talk about debates the last day or two. Let me just say the Lincoln-Douglas debates were amazingly important," Gingrich said. "Maybe the most-important collective dialogue since the Federalist Papers. They debated seven times, three hours each, with a timekeeper and no moderator."
It was in that same spirit, Gingrich said, that he would ask Obama to take part in a similar series of debates.
"I will challenge President Obama to seven three-hour debates in the tradition of Lincoln -- he (Obama) announced in Springfield, he announced quoting Lincoln -- and I will give him a chance to participate seven times, three hours, with a timekeeper, but no moderator," Gingrich said.
