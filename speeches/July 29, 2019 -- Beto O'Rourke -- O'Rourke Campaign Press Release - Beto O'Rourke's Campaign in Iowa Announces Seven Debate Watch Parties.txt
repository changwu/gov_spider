    DES MOINES, IA â€” Today Beto O'Rourke's campaign in Iowa announced seven debate watch parties around the state for tomorrow night's Democratic debate in Detroit, Michigan. The seven watch parties continue the campaign's momentum in Iowa, including the recent opening of 11 field offices across the state. In addition to hosting watch parties across the state, Beto For America is providing resources to those hosting watch parties on their own or on the map, including a host guide and support webinar.
Beto just finished up his seventh trip in the state where he held a town hall with Iowans from four of the most Republican counties in the state. Beto began his interview on the nationally-televised ABC show "The View" last week by referencing his recent visit to Sioux City, Sioux Center and Council Bluffs. Last month, Beto visited Williams, a town with a population of less than 350 people, to meet with and listen to the concerns of the community. According to the Des Moines Register, "many residents said they couldn't remember the last time in recent years a candidate had stopped there."
