    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith amendments to the Convention of November 22, 1928, concerning International Expositions, as amended (Treaties and other International Acts Series 6548, 6549, 9948, and Treaty Doc. No. 98 - 1), with a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to their acceptance. I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Secretary of State on the amendments.
The main purposes of these amendments are: to halt the proliferation of world fairs by requiring 5-year intervals between such expositions, beginning in 1995; to establish a single category of "registered" international expositions (world fairs); and to create a new category of "recognized" international expositions.
I strongly support these amendments to the Convention concerning International Expositions, as amended, and recommend that the Senate give prompt consideration to the amendments and advise and consent to their acceptance.
