    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to the Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970, I hereby transmit the first report of the Advisory Council on Intergovernmental Personnel Policy.
The members of the Advisory Council include elected public officials, career administrators, labor union leaders, and public administration scholars--people from local, State and Federal governments and from private life. I am sure you will share my pride in the Council and my appreciation for their dedicated effort toward improving the ability of government at all levels to respond to the people's needs.
It is noteworthy that this first report of the Council is submitted in the 90th anniversary year of both the Federal and the New York State merit systems, for in many ways the Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970 reaffirms as public policy those merit concepts framed in the Civil Service Act of 1883.
In this report, the Advisory Council has recommended new ways to simplify the grant-in-aid process and other aspects of intergovernmental relations. It has also suggested means for strengthening the Federal system through improved personnel management at the State and local level. The Council's recommendations, which would place new emphasis on the rights, powers, and responsibilities of State and local governments for the management of their own affairs, are receiving careful consideration. Since the Council's recommendations could be carried out by the executive branch under its current authority, no draft legislation accompanies the report.
