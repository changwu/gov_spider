    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, the Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the Kingdom of Morocco for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, signed at Rabat on August 1, 1977.
There is no convention on this subject presently in force between the United States and Morocco.
The Convention follows generally the form and context of most conventions of this type recently concluded by the United States. However, it contains some modifications of the standard provisions to accommodate the special need of Morocco as a developing country to minimize any revenue loss. Its primary purpose is to identify clearly each country's interest in avoiding double taxation and preventing the illegal evasion of taxation.
For the information of the Senate, I also transmit the report of the Department of State on to the Convention.
This Convention would promote closer economic cooperation and more active trade between the United States and Morocco by assuring investors about their tax liability, reducing the foreign tax in many cases and providing for cooperation between the two countries to avoid double taxation.
I urge the Senate to act quickly on this Convention and to give its advice and consent to ratification.
