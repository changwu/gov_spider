    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Cannon (R) Utah)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3468 if it includes the manager's amendment that the Administration understands will be offered on the floor. The substitute amendment comports with an agreement between the Department of the Interior and the City of Duchesne, Utah, regarding the transfer of two water rights certificates from the Department to the City. Absent the manager's amendment, the Administration has concerns with H.R. 3468 as reported by the Resources Committee.
