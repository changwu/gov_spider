    The President. Thank you. One of the first lessons that I was told to learn about becoming President is that the President could not fix all the problems in America. [Laughter] But this is pretty close to fixing the float breaking down, don't you think?
I want to make sure that I have properly acknowledged all the groups that are here, so I want to call your names, and you raise your hand if you're in one of these groups. Who's here from the Sounds of Silence in Canton, Ohio? [Applause] Thank you. I'd also like to say I'm glad to see Senators Glenn and Metzenbaum here. Give them a hand. [Applause] Who's here from the Boy Singers of Maine? [Applause] From my alma mater, the Georgetown Chimes? [Applause] And the Georgetown Grace Notes? [Applause] And from Hillary's alma mater, the Wellesley Widows? [Applause]
Hillary Clinton. Just two left. They all had to go back to school.
The President. Two hung in there to be represented tonight. [Laughter] I'm very sorry about what happened yesterday, but I'm glad you're all here today.
Anybody want to sing me a quick song?
Hillary Clinton. Let's start in order.
The President. All right, we'll start in order. The Sounds of Silence go first.
