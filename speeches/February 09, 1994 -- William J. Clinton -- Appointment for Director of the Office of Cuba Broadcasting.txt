    The President today announced the appointment of Richard M. Lobo to be Director of the U.S. Information Agency's Office of Cuba Broadcasting, which manages Radio and TV Marti. The two services provide a mix of Spanish-language news, feature, cultural, and entertainment programming to the people of Cuba.
"Richard Lobo's 35 years of experience in journalism, broadcast management, and community affairs make him very well suited for this job," said the President. "Our administration honors the memory of Jose Marti, whose birthday we marked last week, and will continue our efforts in support of freedom and democracy for the Cuban people. Radio and TV Marti are an integral part of those efforts."
