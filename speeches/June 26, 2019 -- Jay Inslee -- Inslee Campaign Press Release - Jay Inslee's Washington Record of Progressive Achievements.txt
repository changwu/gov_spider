    Inslee brings the most impressive record of progressive victories to the Democratic primary field
Miami, FL â€“ In tonight's debate, Jay Inslee brings the most extensive record of passing and implementing bold, progressive initiatives of any 2020 candidate. As governor of Washington state, Inslee delivered on his progressive promises, from creating the best paid family leave program in the country, to the country's only 100% clean energy plan, to the nation's first public healthcare option.
Governor Inslee understands that we can't wait any longer to fight climate change, make healthcare affordable, or get the economy working for everyday Americans again. The next president must be able to achieve results immediately, and Jay Inslee is the only candidate who has proven he can deliver.
