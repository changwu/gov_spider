    HOUSTON, Texas â€” U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R- Texas, today named Kaye T. Goolsby the National Grassroots Chair of Cruz for President. Sen. Cruz and Goolsby have had a long-standing relationship and Kaye has been an instrumental player in Sen. Cruz's political success to-date.
During the 2012 U.S. Senate race, she served as the Statewide Grassroots Chairman for Sen. Cruz. In that capacity, she helped take the Senator from 2% in the polls, to the Republican primary runoff election, to a primary victory, and then on to an overwhelming general election victory.
"I am honored that Kaye has agreed to serve as my campaign's National Grassroots Chair. I have had the privilege of knowing Kaye for over decade. In addition to her 30 years of experience, expertise, and unrivaled grassroots network, no one works harder than Kaye or is more passionately committed to our mission of reigniting the promise of America."
Kaye has served on many statewide leadership teams over the years, is a former officer of the Texas Federation of Republican Women, and has served on the National Federal of Republican Women's Board of Directors for many years. She has served nearly 100 campaigns both in Texas and across the country, predominantly serving on leadership teams.
"The reason I support Ted Cruz is that he continues to stand up for our principles and always tells the truth which shows his character and faith," said Goolsby. "I believe he is the only person that can lead this country."
Kaye is a founding member of Katy Christian Ministries which provides social and financial services for families in crisis, particularly victims of domestic and sexual violence. Kaye T. Goolsby and her husband Gary, a prominent businessman, reside in Katy, Texas.
