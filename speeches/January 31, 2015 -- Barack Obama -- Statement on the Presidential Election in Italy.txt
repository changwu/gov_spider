    I congratulate President Sergio Mattarella on his election as President of Italy and applaud his distinguished record of public service. Drawing on the enduring bond between the United States and Italy, I look forward to working with President Mattarella to address transatlantic and global challenges and seize new opportunities for close cooperation.
