    Rudy Giuliani's National Political Director Mark Campbell made the following statement today regarding the New Hampshire Secretary of State's announcement on the primary date:
"Preserving New Hampshire as the First in the Nation primary maintains a great American political tradition. We're working hard to win the Granite State in the primary and are confident Rudy Giuliani is the only Republican candidate who can win New Hampshire in the general. It's clear Rudy Giuliani is the only experienced candidate who can keep Americans safe in the Terrorists' War on Us and the only proven fiscal conservative who can restore fiscal discipline to Washington."
