    Today, "more than 75 organizations representing patients, consumers, seniors, unions, small businesses, employers, physicians, nurses, and disease advocacy and human rights organizations," wrote a letter to Congress "urging the Senate to immediately pass the Inflation Reduction Act."
In this letter, these organizations point out that "rising prices are a top concern for American families and employers. Undeterred by the financial hardship and health challenges facing Americans today as a result of the pandemic, drug companies have already raised the prices of their products almost 1,200 times in the first seven months of the year — more than in the same period in 2020 and 2021." To address this concern, among others, the Inflation Reduction Act would require Medicare to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical corporations for lower drug prices, discourage drug companies from increasing their prices faster than the rate of inflation, and cap annual out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries at $2,000.

Dear Members of Congress,
Congress can make history in the next week by passing the most expansive and powerful reforms to help Americans afford prescription drugs since enactment of the Medicare Part D benefit in 2003. On behalf of more than 75 organizations representing patients, consumers, seniors, unions, small businesses, employers, physicians, nurses, and disease advocacy and human rights organizations, we urge the Senate to immediately pass the Inflation Reduction Act.
The legislation is truly historic because for the first time ever it will:

Require Medicare to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical corporations for lower drug prices — a reform that has been sought for almost 20 years;
Discourage drug companies from increasing their prices faster than the rate of inflation, a reform that has special importance right now as we seek to curb the rising cost of everyday expenses;
Cap annual out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries at $2,000 when they are currently unlimited and can run to more than $15,000 and expand the Part D low-income subsidies by expanding the income threshold for eligibility from 135 percent to 150 percent of the federal poverty level.

In a time of great division in our nation this legislation has overwhelmingly bipartisan support. More than 70 percent of Republicans, Democrats, and independents back each of these reforms, which have consistently been the most popular element under discussion for reconciliation.
Congress can pass these drug pricing reforms before the August recess and move the nation in anew direction, providing savings to patients, taxpayers, workers, and employers. CBO estimates savings of almost $300 billion to the Federal government alone.
Rising prices are a top concern for American families and employers. Undeterred by the financial hardship and health challenges facing Americans today as a result of the pandemic, drug companies have already raised the prices of their products almost 1,200 times in the first seven months of the year — more than in the same period in 2020 and 2021.
Congress must seize this opportunity to stop the pharmaceutical industry from overcharging Americans with astronomical prices for brand-name drugs. Patients, workers, employers, and taxpayers should not continue to shoulder the burden of prices in this country that are nearly three times what people in other comparable nations pay.
Congress can make history in the next week. Pass the Inflation Reduction Act and send it to the President for his signature. Not only will it break the pharmaceutical industry's unilateral power to dictate prices to the American people, it will save lives, improve health, curb the impact of inflation, and put more money back into the pockets of American seniors, workers, and businesses.
Congress has repeatedly promised to address this problem, and the American people need the help now more than ever.
