    Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff met with the co-chairs of the House Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Antisemitism. The Second Gentleman heard directly from members about their efforts to combat growing antisemitism and hate nationwide. During the meeting, both the Second Gentleman and co-chairs raised the issue of fighting misinformation and enhancing security in cities and communities. They also discussedÂ the need to continue educating individuals about the history of antisemitism. Mr. Emhoff emphasized that this is a nonpartisan issue and shared how he will further his work to combat antisemitism domestically and globally. The meeting follows today's announcement that the Second Gentleman will visit Krakow, Poland, and Berlin, Germany, later this month to advance the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to combat antisemitism around the world and support Holocaust remembrance.
