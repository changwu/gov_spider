    LAS VEGAS â€“ Bernie Sanders on Saturday congratulated Hillary Clinton on her victory in Nevada's closely-contested caucuses and looked ahead to carrying his campaign for the White House to primaries and caucuses across the country.
"I just spoke to Secretary Clinton and congratulated her on her victory here in Nevada. I am very proud of the campaign we ran. Five weeks ago we were 25 points behind and we ended up in a very close election. And we probably will leave Nevada with a solid share of the delegates," Sanders said.
"I am also proud of the fact that we have brought many working people and young people into the political process and believe that we have the wind at our back as we head toward Super Tuesday. I want to thank the people of Nevada for their support that they have given us and the boost that their support will give us as we go forward," Sanders added. 
The contest moves next to South Carolina, where Democrats vote on Feb. 27, and then to states across the country.
