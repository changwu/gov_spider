    (New York, NY) - President-elect Donald J. Trump today announced his intent to appoint Gary D. Cohn as Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council. A renowned business leader, Mr. Cohn will help to both design and coordinate the President-elect's America First economic agenda and make sure increasing wages for American workers will be a top priority. He will also work closely with the President-elect's economic team at the Treasury and Commerce Departments.
"As my top economic advisor, Gary Cohn is going to put his talents as a highly successful businessman to work for the American people," said President-elect Donald J. Trump. "He will help craft economic policies that will grow wages for our workers, stop the exodus of jobs overseas and create many great new opportunities for Americans who have been struggling. He fully understands the economy and will use all of his vast knowledge and experience to make sure the American people start winning again."
"Being chosen to serve in the President-elect's administration is a great honor," said Gary Cohn. "I share President-elect Trump's vision of making sure every American worker has a secure place in a thriving economy, and we will be completely committed to building a nation of strength, growth and prosperity."
In addition to his incredible business history, Mr. Cohn has an inspiring personal story. Growing up in Shaker Heights, Ohio, he was diagnosed at age seven with dyslexia, which made it difficult for him to read and spell. After receiving his bachelor's degree at American University in Washington, D.C., Mr. Cohn worked for U.S. Steel and at the New York Mercantile Exchange. Since 1990, Mr. Cohn has worked at Goldman Sachs. His legendary toughness and tenacity, which helped him rise over a quarter century at Goldman Sachs to ultimately become the company's president, will now be put to work on behalf of the American people.
