    Today the President sent to Congress the certification required to begin final assembly of the 155mm binary chemical artillery projectiles. This is an important element of the long-needed modernization of the United States chemical weapon deterrent.
The President was pleased to make this certification on a program so vital to our national security. We seek a global, effectively verifiable ban on chemical weapons. Until we achieve that goal, however, it is essential that we maintain a safe, modern chemical weapon stockpile to deter use of chemical weapons by potential adversaries.
