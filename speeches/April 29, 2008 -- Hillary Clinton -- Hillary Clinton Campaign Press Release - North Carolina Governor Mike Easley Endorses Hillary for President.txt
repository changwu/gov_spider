    North Carolina Governor Mike Easley today announced his endorsement of Hillary for President.
"I am supporting Hillary Clinton because she has a passion for improving the lives of all Americans. She will be a president who stands up for people across North Carolina – and this country – every day in the White House," said Governor Easley. "I know she will get to work immediately making education and the economy her top priorities for our nation. She is ready to lead our country and has the ability to deliver."
Easley was elected governor in November 2000 and re-elected in 2004. He has restored fiscal discipline to North Carolina's finances while also increasing investments in education and infrastructure, key components to recruiting and retaining high quality jobs and industry for the state.
"I am honored to have the support of Governor Easley, whose vision and persistence have made higher education affordable and accessible for North Carolinians," said Senator Clinton. "I look forward to working with him in our efforts to turn around the economy and rebuild the middle class."
