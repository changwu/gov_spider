Out of town pool report #1 / Marine One arrival
Your out of town pool, stationed here after a rush hour van ride, was in place as Marine One landed at Fort McHenry in Baltimore at 6:04pm.
Pool was at a distance of about 50 yards away, with your pooler's vision blocked by motorcade cars that had moved into place â€” so didn't see POTUS enter the Beast.
The temperature is 50 degrees, the sun is setting, and the wind is blowing.
As of 6:10pm we are now rolling toward the Hyatt Regency Baltimore Inner Harbor, where POTUS is scheduled to speak at the House Democratic Caucus Retreat. 


March 1, 2023 18:23

Out of town pool report #2 / arrival at Hyatt
After an uneventful ride, motorcade arrived at the Hyatt Regency Baltimore Inner Harbor at 6:20pm.
As motorcade left Fort McHenry, a street was lined with people taking photos and waving flags.
As we turned toward the event site, one man was holding a sign over his head that read: STOP ARMING UKRAINE

Out of town pool report #3 / attendees
The event is in a ballroom that has numbers for some 32 tables, with seating for 10 people per table (although not every table is completely full).
Two big screens at the front of the room had text that reads: "House Democrats / 2023 Issues Conference." Those screens are now showing thee speakers, who are on a stage with nine large American flags.
The lights have gone off and on a few times and at 6:33pm, the program got started. It's livestreamed but will try to flag any key moments in forthcoming pool reports. We have a 2 min warning for POTUS as of 6:37pm.

Out-of-town pool report #4 / POTUS remarks
POTUS took the stage at 6:41pm, and seemed in a joking mood.
"It's good to be almost home," he said, an apparent reference to being closer to Wilmington. He called out Nancy Pelosi, "the greatest speaker of all time." And he joked that she was helpful to him "all the years I was a senator â€“ which was 270."
He started with a message of unity among Democrats, saying, "it's been one of the most successful, united caucuses we've ever seen." He talked about their electoral wins, including a recent special election in Virginia. "We stuck together," he said. "We really did."
He largely focused on some of the accomplishments over the past two years. He hailed a new tunnel that would be built in Baltimore, bringing along a new sign that he said would be put up: Frederick Douglass Tunnel. He talked about policies like pharma, CHIPs, and attempts to lower inflation â€“ and he said there would be new efforts to remind voters of polices they have passed. "We're going so far as to print signs to indicate who is bringing in this project, and why it's happening," he said of infrastructure.
He went through a list of things he wanted to do:
"We're going to ban assault weapons again, come hell or high water," he said at one point.
"We've got to reinstate Roe v Wade and pass it nationally," he said at another.
He then turned toward Republicans.
"I know as well as you the MAGA Republicans are not going to get on board with some of this. But that leaves a lot of republicans who are still left," he said. "I predict -- watch, watch what happens. Republicans can help make a significant majority in some of these things."
"A little more of Marjorie Taylor Greene and you're going to have a lot more Republicans coming our way," he added and then paused. "Isn't she amazing?"
"Look folks, I don't want to get started," he continued.
He kept suggesting he shouldn't digress. The crowd seemed to be interested in his digressions, but he returned to some of the prepared text.
"So what we did in the past two years -- whenever possible, we should work on both sides of the aisle, get as much done as we can," he said.
Normal caveats to check all of the above against transcript.
At 7:09pm, POTUS remarks wrapped up. Lights went on, and pool is being ushered out of the room. 


March 1, 2023 19:37

Out of town pool #5 / POTUS takes questions, pool holds
After pool was escorted out of the banquet hall (called the Constellation Ballroom), POTUS stayed and took questions from the members in the room.
From the hallway, POTUS could be seen seated on the stage with a microphone, answering questions. But the doors to the room then closed and pool headed for the vans.
Pool is holding outside the hotel as we await the Q and A conclusion.


March 1, 2023 20:22

Out of town pool report #6 / rolling
Motorcade started rolling at 8:20pm, heading back toward Fort McHenry where POTUS is schedule to lift off for the trip back to the White House.


March 1, 2023 20:38

Out of town pool report #7 / Marine One liftoff
The short motorcade ride back to Fort McHenry was uneventful â€” although we passed M&T Bank Stadium, home of the Baltimore Ravens and nicely lit up in red, white, and blue.
We arrived at 8:30pm, and POTUS walked over and boarded Marine One. We were at a distance and engines loud, so no shouted questions. Marine One lifted at 8:36pm.
Traveling with the President aboard Marine One en route to the White House:
Steve Ricchetti, Assistant to the President & Counselor to the President Bruce Reed, Assistant to the President & Deputy Chief of Staff Louisa Terrell, Assistant to the President & Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs Emmy Ruiz, Assistant to the President & Director of Political Strategy & Outreach Ben LaBolt, Assistant to the President & Director of Communications
It's been a pooling pleasure here in Baltimore.
