    This afternoon, the President telephoned Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates from the Oval Office to tell him that his and Michelle's thoughts and prayers are with the community of Aurora, particularly the local first responders who have performed well under difficult and stressful circumstances. The President also told Chief Oates that he should expect the full support of the FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies moving forward, including any resources they need to handle the ongoing situation at the suspect's apartment.
