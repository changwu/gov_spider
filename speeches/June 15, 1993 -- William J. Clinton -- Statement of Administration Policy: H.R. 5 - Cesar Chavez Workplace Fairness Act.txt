    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Clay (D) MO and 195 others)
The Administration supports H.R. 5, as reported, which would protect employees who exercise their legal right to strike from being permanently replaced by their employers. H.R. 5 would restore balance in collective bargaining by allowing businesses to operate during a strike through alternate means, while preserving fundamental union rights. This balance, which will foster stability in industrial relations, will stimulate productivity and international competitiveness that are critical to our long-term economic strength.
The Administration opposes amendments that were made in order under the Rule because they would weaken the bill's protection for striking workers.
