    I am pleased that the Senate has confirmed Antony Blinken as our next Deputy Secretary of State. Over decades of dedicated public service, Tony has displayed extraordinary integrity, judgment, and inclusiveness as he has implemented America's foreign policy priorities. Under the leadership of Secretary Kerry and now Deputy Secretary Blinken, and thanks to the talented professionals at the State Department, I am confident in America's ability to continue to succeed abroad. I thank Tony for his friendship and sound counsel during his time at the White House, and I look forward to continuing to work with him as he represents the country he loves.
