    Volunteers founded this nation. They did it at risk to their fortunes and their very lives. Even if we are not called on to take such risks, we are summoned by our history and our proudest traditions to give ourselves to the service of our neighbors and our nation. That is the summons of voluntarism.
I am proud to say that Americans are responding to this summons with great generosity and in great numbers. Every year almost a hundred million citizens lend that helping hand without seeking any reward save that pearl of great price, a good conscience. These wonderful citizens build up the economy of love, which is every bit as important to our national life as the economy of money. Voluntarism, the economy of love, and caring is the necessary complement of our free enterprise system. Both depend on the same kind of initiative and imagination.
Throughout my presidency I have encouraged the spirit of voluntarism, and fostered our sense of the stake we all have in the great enterprise called society. I have striven to give to individuals, families, and private organizations broader scope for their voluntary contributions to the common wealth. The American people have responded with the generosity for which they are famous. Every day we receive new reports of highly successful Private Sector Initiatives which creatively use the resources we have as a nation and make America a still better place to live.
National Volunteer Week is a time when we recognize the generosity of our volunteers, and the incalculable contribution they make to American life. It is a time to urge volunteers to keep up their work, and to urge all Americans to become an active part of American tradition.
I say again what can never be said too often: volunteers make a difference. God bless you.
