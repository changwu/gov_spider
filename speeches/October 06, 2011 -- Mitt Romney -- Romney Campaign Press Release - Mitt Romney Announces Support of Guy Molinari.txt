    Mitt Romney today announced the support of former New York Congressman and Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari.
"I am honored to have Guy Molinari's support," said Mitt Romney. "He is a committed public servant who understands that President Obama's regulations are not working for voters in New York and across the country. With Guy's help, I am dedicated to turning around our economy."
Announcing his support, Guy Molinari said, "Mitt Romney is our best chance to defeat President Obama and take back the White House in 2012. With millions of Americans unemployed, we need a president who will not only make job creation a priority, but has the experience to be successful. Mitt's record in the private sector and as Governor of Massachusetts is characterized by results. I am proud to get behind his campaign."
