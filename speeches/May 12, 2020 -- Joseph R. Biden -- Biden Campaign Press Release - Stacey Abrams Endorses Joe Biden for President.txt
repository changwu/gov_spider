    Today, Stacey Abrams, founder of Fair Fight and voting rights advocate, endorsed Joe Biden for President of the United States. Abrams released the following statement:
"Vice President Biden is the leader America needs â€” a leader who will restore dignity, competence and compassion to the Oval Office while restoring America's moral leadership around the world. His commitment to fighting climate change, leading an economic recovery for all, and protecting every eligible American's right to vote are among the many reasons why he must be the next President of the United States. While marginalized communities struggle under Donald Trump's failed leadership and people of color face disproportionate consequences of COVID-19, Joe Biden will take no one for granted. I look forward to continuing my strong support for his candidacy and doing all I can to make sure he is elected this November."
Stacey Abrams is the former Democratic leader of the Georgia House of Representatives. In 2018, she was Georgia's Democratic nominee for governor and the first African American woman to become the gubernatorial nominee for a major party in the United States. After witnessing the threat to voting rights in her home state of Georgia, Abrams founded Fair Fight, an organization dedicated to fair elections in Georgia and nationwide. Abrams joins many other Georgia leaders in endorsing Biden, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, Congressman John Lewis, Congressman Sanford Bishop, Congressman Hank Johnson, Congresswoman Lucy McBath, State Representative Calvin Smyre, State Representative Billy Mitchell, State Representative Pedro Marin, and more.
Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 2,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
