    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 9/25/92)(Senate)(Sasser (D) Tennessee and 11 others)
The Administration strongly supports enactment of the substitute for S. 2970 proposed to be offered by Chairman Glenn. The substitute includes a provision improving procedures for the collection of delinquent tax debt from Federal employees. These procedures provide additional revenue Tor purposes of the pay-as- you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA).
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
S. 2970 would affect outlays and receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of OBRA. OMB's preliminary scoring estimates of this bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If S. 2970 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within five days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to the Congress.
