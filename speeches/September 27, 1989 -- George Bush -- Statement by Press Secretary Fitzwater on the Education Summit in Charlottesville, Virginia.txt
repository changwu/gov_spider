    The President said today's sessions with the Governors were very constructive. He said he felt a consensus could be reached on a number of issues. The key to success will be followup that occurs in the weeks ahead. The Governors indicated the most prominent issue before them is a question of flexibility in their spending of Federal funds. They asked the President to work with them in getting Congress to provide more flexibility in spending programs.
The Governors also indicated that early child programs, including Head Start, are the most valuable in terms of ultimate educational success. The Governors also spoke at length of the need to increase accessibility to the teaching profession by people now in other careers. This issue, teacher certification, is important to bringing new ideas into the teaching area.
The President found the give-and-take with the Governors quite useful and looks forward to tomorrow's meeting.
