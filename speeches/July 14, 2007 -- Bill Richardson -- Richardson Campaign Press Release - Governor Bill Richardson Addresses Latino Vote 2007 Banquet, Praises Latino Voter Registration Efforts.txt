    Lays Out Vision for First Six Days in the White House
SANTA FE, NM -- Democratic Presidential candidate New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson addressed the Southwest Voter Project's Latino Vote 2007 Banquet tonight in Los Angeles. In his remarks, Governor Richardson praised the efforts of the Southwest Voter Project and recalled his work registering over 150,000 Latino and Native American voters with the Moving America Forward organization he founded.
"I know firsthand about the work that you do -- not because I'm reminded every four years about the importance of the Latino vote. I know because I have been in the trenches -- training and organizing Latinos across the country to participate in the political process that has been so good to me over the years," said Governor Richardson.
"The time is ripe for a massive effort to register eager, young Latino voters who are just now opening their eyes to the opportunities they have to effect change in their government."
Governor Richardson also advanced his bold vision for the future of America, laying out day by day how he would make this country stronger.
"I have a plan for the first week of my Presidency that addresses our greatest problems," said Governor Richardson. "On the first day I'd get us out of Iraq, the second day I'd put my plan for energy independence into motion, the 3rd day would be the beginning of my education reform, the 4th day I'd introduce my plan for universal health care coverage; the 5th day I'd focus on jobs and the economy, and the 6th day will be devoted to Civil Rights."
"On every one of these issues -- I have a real record of accomplishment, and a real agenda for our country."
