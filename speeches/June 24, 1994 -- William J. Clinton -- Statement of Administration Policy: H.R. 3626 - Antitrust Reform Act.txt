    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 6/27/94)(House)(Brooks (D) TX and Dingell (D) MI)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 3626.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 3626 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary PAYGO estimate is zero.
