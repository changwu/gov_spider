    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Stump (R) AZ and 96 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 4864, which would clarify the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) duty to assist claimants in developing evidence pertinent to their claims. H.R. 4864 is a significant step towards achieving the proper allocation of responsibilities between VA and claimants.
However, the Administration will work with the Senate to address concerns with the bill. These include concerns about certain provisions in H.R. 4864 that are ambiguous and could pose problems in drafting implementing regulations and provisions that are unduly burdensome and would prolong the processing of veterans' claims.
