    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revised LA)
(House)(Rep. Nichols (D) Alabama)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3869, because the property exchange authorized by the bill would result in a net loss to the Federal Government of over $500,000. The Administration would not object to an exchange with the University if it were required to equalize the values of the properties involved.
The Administration recommends that the House defer action on H.R. 3869. The property exchange authorized by the bill would result in a net loss to the Federal Government of over $500,000. Deferral of H.R. 3869 will give the Administration an opportunity to negotiate a modified arrangement with the University that is both fair to the taxpayer and meets the University's needs.
