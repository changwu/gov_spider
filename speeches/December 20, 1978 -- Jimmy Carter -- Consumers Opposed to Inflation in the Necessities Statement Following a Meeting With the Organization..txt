    Following our very constructive meeting with COIN, I have asked Alfred E. Kahn, my adviser on inflation, to have the working groups he has assembled cooperate with COIN and other consumer groups to plan additional specific steps to hold down inflation in the sectors of the economy that provide the basic necessities of life. I expect their recommendations soon.
Consumers always seem to be the last to be consulted about the policies that determine what they pay for products and services in the marketplace. COIN has spoken up for consumers throughout this Nation effectively, and I want to hear their views before decisions are made. I want COIN to be a partner in our common effort to control inflation.
