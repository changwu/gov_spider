    This Sunday, Department of Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas participated in five interviews and discussed the Biden Administration's ongoing efforts to rebuild an immigration system that was decimated by the prior Administration and ensure it reflects our nation's values.
Secretary Mayorkas also addressed the rise in hate crimes and domestic violent extremism. He expressed deep sympathy for the victims of the tragic killings in Atlanta and emphasized that DHS remains focused on addressing violence against the AAPI community and other communities of color.
