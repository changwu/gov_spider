HOUSTON, Texas — Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today named 47 people to his Virginia Leadership Team compromised of elected officials, Republican Party leaders, Tea Party leaders, small business owners, students, veterans, and faith leaders. Cruz launched his presidential campaign in the Commonwealth of Virginia on March 23, at Liberty University in Lynchburg. He also has also qualified to be on the ballot in Virginia, submitting more than 10,000 signatures to the Republican Party of Virginia, double the amount required.
The Virginia Leadership Team is chaired by Senator William M. "Bill" Stanley, Majority Whip of the Virginia Senate Republican Caucus. Senator Richard "Dick" Black joins Co-Chairs Shak Hill, former candidate for U.S. Senate and United States Air Force veteran combat pilot, and Cynthia Dunbar, a board member of the Virginia First Foundation and former Assistant Professor of Law and Advisor to the Provost of Liberty University.
"We continue to grow our team everyday as more and more people learn about Ted. He is the consistent conservative that our country needs," said State Senator Bill Stanley. "We have an exceptionally committed and experienced leadership team and grassroots organization that will make Ted very competitive on Election Day."
"Our team far exceeded the needed number of signatures to get on the ballot in Virginia, more than doubling the 5,000 signatures required," said State Senator Dick Black. "Ted Cruz's ground game distinguishes his campaign from all the others. It is a formidable accomplishment by our team and I could not be more proud to be part of the organization supporting Ted."
"We have an exceptional team in the Commonwealth, and the success we've had getting more than 10,000 signatures on the ballot, as well as the more than three dozen additional team members, shows we are committed to competing in Virginia and fighting for every delegate," said Cruz. "I look forward to working with each and every one of them as we continue to coalesce conservatives around our campaign."
