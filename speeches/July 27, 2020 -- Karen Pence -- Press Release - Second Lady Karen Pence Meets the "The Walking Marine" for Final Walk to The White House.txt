    Today, Second Lady Karen Pence joined Vietnam Marine Veteran, Terry Sharpe, known as "The Walking Marine," for the last leg of his eighth and final walk from Stokesdale, North Carolina to Washington D.C. Mrs. Pence joined Terry at the Washington Monument and walked with him to the White House. On the walk, Mrs. Pence was able to hear more of Terry's story and his passion to bring awareness to veteran suicide prevention.
Upon arrival to the White House, President Trump and Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie surprised Terry by greeting him on the South Lawn. Terry was welcomed by guests and supporters as he and Mrs. Pence crossed the finish line.
"Every day we lose an average of 20 veterans to suicide and today it was an honor to walk alongside Terry in his mission to end this tragedy," said Second Lady Karen Pence. "More than ever before it is important to bring attention to this issue and do all that we can to help those who served this Nation."
On July 1st of this year, 69-year old Terry started his annual 300 mile walk to Washington D.C. to raise awareness of the current veteran suicide rate, which stands at 22 per day. In addition, Terry also brings attention to Veteran hunger and Veteran homelessness, both of which have a direct correlation to the Veteran suicide rate.
