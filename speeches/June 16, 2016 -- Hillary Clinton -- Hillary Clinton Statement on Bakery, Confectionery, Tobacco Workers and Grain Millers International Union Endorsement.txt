    Today, following the endorsement of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union (BCTGM), Hillary Clinton issued the following statement:
"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union.
"Members of the BCTGM don't just help feed America—they helped build the greatest middle class in history.
"Members of the BCTGM know, as I do, that we are stronger together, when we are investing in our people and in the future. That's why I have a comprehensive manufacturing agenda to create good-paying jobs and spur new industries—because we can and we will "make it in America." I was honored to meet with BCTGM members in Chicago earlier this year who had been trying to work with Nabisco to keep good-paying jobs in America. For years, Nabisco had received tax breaks and investments from the people of Chicago and the people of Illinois to expand production—only to turn their backs on their workers and on the community by announcing plans to lay off 600 workers and move their production line to Mexico. That's wrong. And that's why I have called for creating a "clawback"—if a company turns its back on America, they should have to pay back every penny of the tax breaks they have received, and we'll use that money to reinvest in affected workers and communities.
"As President, I will always have workers' backs. I will stand with the BCTGM to fight for workers' rights to organize, to bargain collectively, to be safe on the job, and to retire with dignity and security after years of hard work. Workers will always have a seat at the table and a champion in the White House—because when workers are strong, America is strong."
