    I am happy to send greetings to Jews everywhere as they celebrate the festival of Hanukkah. At this special time there is great joy in commemorating both the victory of the Maccabees and the miracle of the lights in ancient Israel.
There has been more than enough tragedy in Jewish history, but Jews have always believed in their own future. This faith brought victory to the Maccabees, accounts for the founding of the modern State of Israel, and explains the equally inspiring birth of the Soviet Jewry movement and the responsive chord it has struck among Jews throughout the world. These examples show that the message of Hanukkah is timeless. Its lessons inspire the struggles of today and the victories of tomorrow.
As you share the Hanukkah story with your families and friends, Nancy and I join you in rededication to a world truly blessed by peace and by freedom.
