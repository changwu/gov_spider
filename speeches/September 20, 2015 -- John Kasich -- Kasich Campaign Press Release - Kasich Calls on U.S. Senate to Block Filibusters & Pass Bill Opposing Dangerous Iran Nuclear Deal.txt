KASICH CALLS ON U.S. SENATE TO BLOCK FILIBUSTERS & PASS BILL OPPOSING DANGEROUS IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL
Senate "Nuclear Option" is Merited Given Deal's Threat to Americans, AlliesToday Ohio Governor John Kasich called on the U.S. Senate to pass legislation blocking the Obama Administration's Iran nuclear deal and to take the extraordinary step of preventing filibusters in order to do it."Frankly I think they ought to go to the â€˜nuclear option' in the United States Senate...I think the Republicans in the Senate should say we are not going to permit this to be blocked by a filibuster. There ought to be a vote and there ought to be extreme measures taken in the United States Senate to achieve it," said Kasich this morning on CNN's "State of the Union with Jake Tapper."Kasich, who served for 18 years on the U.S. House Armed Services Committee, has been a strong opponent of the Iran nuclear deal and repeatedly called for Congress to pass legislation blocking it.
