PAUL RYAN: "Did you guys watch that Packer game last night? I mean -- give me a break. It is time to get the real refs. And do you know what, it reminds me of President Obama and the economy. If you can't get it right, it's time to get out. I half think that these refs work part-time for the Obama Administration in the budget office. They see the national debt clock staring them in the face. They see a debt crisis, and they just ignore and pretend it didn't even happen. They're trying to pick the winners and losers, and they don't even do that very well."
