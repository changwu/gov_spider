    We respect the Japanese political process and Prime Minister Hatoyama’s decision to step down. The selection of Japan’s next Prime Minister is a matter for the Japanese people and political process.
The U.S.-Japan bilateral relationship is very strong and deeply rooted in our common interests and values. Our Alliance has flourished under each Japanese Prime Minister and U.S. President for the past half century and will continue to strengthen in the years to come.
We will continue to work closely with the Government of Japan, and the next Prime Minister, across the broad range of issues facing our two nations.
