    I HAVE read with great interest the communiqu√© issued by the leaders of the nine countries of the enlarged European Community, demonstrating once again their commitment to greater European unity. At this important meeting, the members of the Community have set an objective of "transforming the whole complex of their relations into a European Union by the end of the present decade." The United States strongly supports that objective. It is, and has always been, my own deeply held view that progress toward a unified Europe enhances world peace, security, and prosperity.
It is also of the highest importance that the United States and Europe work close!y together. For this reason I particularly welcome the Community's declared intent to maintain a constructive, forthcoming dialogue with us and its commitment to a progressive liberalization of tariff and nontariff barriers to trade on a comprehensive basis during the major multilateral negotiations to begin next year.
On behalf of the United States, I wish to reaffirm our commitment to work with the members of the European Community for reform of the international economic system in a way which will bring about a new freedom of world trade, new equity in international economic conduct, and effective solutions to the problems of the developing world.
These are the objectives with which the United States will approach forthcoming negotiations on monetary and trade reform. We will be prepared to take bold action with our European partners for a more equitable and open world economic order. The October 21 Summit declaration is evidence that our European partners are equally dedicated to the success of these efforts. In the meantime, we look to them for continued help in fostering a climate of mutual cooperation and confidence, and for a demonstration-through positive action on pressing and immediate problems--that these efforts will be crowned with success.
