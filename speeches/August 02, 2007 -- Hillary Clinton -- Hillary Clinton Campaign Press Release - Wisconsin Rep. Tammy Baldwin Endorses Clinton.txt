    Baldwin Will Co-Chair Wisconsin Campaign and Advise on Health Care
The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Wisconsin Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin and named her a Co-Chair of Hillary's Wisconsin campaign and a member of the campaign's Health Care Policy Task Force. Baldwin will also co-chair the campaign's LGBT steering committee.
"I am proud to endorse Senator Hillary Clinton's candidacy for President of the United States," Baldwin said. "Senator Clinton is supremely prepared and the candidate best able to ensure health care for all, reaffirm our commitment to the Constitution and rule of law, and re-establish our position of leadership in the world. She will be firm in protecting our national security and fair in addressing the aspirations and needs of all Americans. Hillary Clinton has been my friend and ally in the battle for health care for many years and I look forward to working with her to achieve our common goals when she becomes our next President," Baldwin said.
Baldwin was elected to the House of Representatives in 1998, becoming the first woman to represent Wisconsin in Congress. She is a forceful advocate for creating a universal healthcare system for all Americans, and has worked to expand stem cell research and prescription drug benefits for seniors. Because of her expertise, the Clinton Campaign has asked Baldwin to serve on its Health Care Policy Task Force.
"Tammy is such a strong voice on behalf of those who are too often left out of the political process. I'm honored she'll play a leading role in our national campaign and in Wisconsin," Clinton said.
