    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Lancaster (D) NC and 20 others)
The Administration supports H.R. 2961.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2961 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is zero. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
