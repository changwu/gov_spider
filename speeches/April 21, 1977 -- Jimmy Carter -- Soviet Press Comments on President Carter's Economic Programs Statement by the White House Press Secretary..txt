    We have long maintained that the Soviet Union has the perfect right to say whatever it pleases. Neither this administration nor this country has any fear of a free discussion of ideas, no matter how misinformed or ridiculous they might be.
It is worth pointing out that any American can say the same thing or worse about the President, without fear of arrest, intimidation, or harassment from the White House.
We certainly have no objections to the exercise of the right of free speech by the Soviet Government. We look forward to the day when the right of citizens to criticize his or her government is guaranteed everywhere in the world.
