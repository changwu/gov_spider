    To Secretary Brock Adams
I accept your resignation with friendship, respect and appreciation for the accomplishments of our nation during your service as Secretary of Transportation. I share your belief that our country's system of transportation can and must be greatly improved in the future. Your continuing advice and support as we make this progress will be very valuable.
You and Betty have my best wishes, and my thanks on behalf of a nation which has benefited from your service.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
My dear Mr. President:
I hereby tender my resignation as United States Secretary of Transportation.
I have appreciated your courtesy and the personal kindness you and your wife have extended to Betty and me during the period I have served as a member of your Cabinet.
I particularly appreciated the position you stated in your Sunday night speech regarding public transportation and the need for a more fuel-efficient automobile. I hope these programs will be fully implemented soon. As you know, during the last two years I have repeatedly urged that more attention be focused on these areas because maintaining American mobility through alternatives to and more efficient use of the motor vehicle are essential to maintaining the American economy and a quality standard of living as we go through the difficult period of the future. I believe the American public shares this view and will support using the resources and technological development necessary to achieve it. The many fine people serving in the Department of Transportation stand ready to help you in this effort.
I hope you find happiness in your job, and I join with the whole Nation in hoping that the remainder of your administration will be successful.
Respectfully submitted,
BROCK ADAMS
[The President, The White House, Washington, D.C.]
