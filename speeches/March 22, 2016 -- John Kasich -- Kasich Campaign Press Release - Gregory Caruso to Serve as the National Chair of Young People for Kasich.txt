    Today, Kasich for America announced that Gregory Caruso will serve as the National Chair of Young People for Kasich.
"Now more than ever, we need a president who is ready to tackle today's biggest challenges to ensure a better tomorrow for my generation and generations to come," Caruso said. "Governor Kasich has a proven record, he is forward thinking and he is ready to bring real change to Washington. I am both honored and thankful for this opportunity to serve as his National Chair for Young People to help organize his growing efforts to inspire young voters like myself."

Caruso, 24, is from Los Angeles, California. He is a graduate of the University of Southern California.
Said Kasich, "I welcome Gregory to the team. I hear all the time from young voters like him that they are frustrated that Washington has taken its eye off the economy, and as a result, way too many young Americans cannot find a job. As president, I will focus on American job creation just as I focused on an Ohio economy that has created more than 400,000 jobs since I was elected governor. I thank Gregory for rolling up his sleeves to help share that message with younger voters across this country."
