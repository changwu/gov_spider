VP travel pool report #4 - meeting
The pool was brought into a room where Harris and Duterte-Carpio were seated, but your pooler could not see much because local press was brought in before us and given more space at the front of the staging area than the pool. A conversation about local cuisine was already underway between the two when press was ushered in, so we did not hear the the start of the discussion. Duterte-Carpio told Harris that she had heard that she enjoyed to cook, and Harris responded that her husband loved to eat so it was a great marriage. Duterte-Carpio said she heard Harris would visit Palawan and asked if she would have time to see the beaches. Harris said she would not but added "I'm really looking forward to that" of her Palawan visit. Press was then told to leave the room. Your pooler took an Otter but the quality was low.

VP travel pool report #6 - Harris/Marcos
The pool was brought into a palace room decorated by two Christmas trees before the Vice President walked in. They then shook hands and President Marcos asked if she had visited before. She said she had not but the Second Gentleman had, referring to the president's inauguration. They then walked into the room where they would hold the bilat together. Press was then ushered in, as the leaders greeted those in attendance listed below. Both gave their remarks, starting with President Marcos. He told her visit showed their strong relationship. "I do not see a future for the Philippines that does not include the United States. That really does come from the very long relationship." Harris also said the two nations have a "long and enduring" relationship, mentioning the "thriving Filipino-American community" in California. She joked that the Philippines celebrates Christmas three months a year and he responded that they celebrate the holiday "like we invented it." "Certainly, we own it now," he said. Harris called their relationship "multi-faceted" she said, referring to how the nations share a "mutual commitment to the economic prosperity of the region and the respective nations," as well as a "mutual concern about the climate crisis" and mutual defense agreement. "We stand with you in defense of you of international rules and norms as it relates to the South China Sea. An armed attack on the Philippines Armed Forces, public vessels or aircraft would invoke U.S. mutual defense," she said. She concluded her remarks by saying that the relationship between the countries grows stronger under his leadership. Press was then told to leave, and held outside until the motorcade departed. We are now rolling to the Sofitel Manila.
