    Prime Minister Miki distinguished Japanese guests, ladies and gentlemen:
Let me express to you, Mr. Prime Minister, the deep gratitude of the American people for this very, very generous gift. It is yet another expression of the good relations that the American people have with the Japanese people, the excellent relations that your Government has with our Government.
This is a generous gift in money, but it is also a deeper expression of our relationship between our two peoples. As Mr. Stevens has said, this gift will permit the completion of the Kennedy Center. The Kennedy Center is the focal point in the United States for cultural development, cultural performances. And we, of course, are most anxious, as Mr. Stevens said, that when the studio center is completed that it will be possible to have the whole center display the tremendous cultural background and the terrific artistry that comes from the people of Japan.
Again, I thank you and I thank the people of Japan on behalf of the American people.
