    Today's failure by the Senate to permanently repeal the death tax is a disappointment to the American people. It is wrong that, as a result of a quirk in the law, millions of Americans will be subject to the death tax beginning at the end of the decade. The Congress must fix this unfair tax and provide families with certainty so they can plan for the future.
