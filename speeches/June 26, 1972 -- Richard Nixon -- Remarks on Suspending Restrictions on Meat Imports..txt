    TO COUNTER recent rises in the cost of meat, I have today directed removal of all restrictions on meat imports for the balance of 1972.
Prices of meat have been rising because increased demands have not been matched by increased supplies. This action is designed to increase the supply of meat.
Increased supplies from abroad will not have an immediate effect in reducing prices in the supermarkets, but this action will definitely help in the future.
In the meantime, I intend to take whatever further measures are necessary to prevent increases in the cost of food.
