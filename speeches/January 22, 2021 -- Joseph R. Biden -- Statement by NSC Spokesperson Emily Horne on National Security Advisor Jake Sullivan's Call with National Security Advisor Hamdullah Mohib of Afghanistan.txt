    National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke this morning with Afghan National Security Advisor Hamdullah Mohib regarding the U.S. commitment to the U.S.-Afghan partnership and to peace for all the people of Afghanistan. Mr. Sullivan underscored that the U.S. will support the peace process with a robust and regional diplomatic effort, which will aim to help the two sides achieve a durable and just political settlement and permanent ceasefire. Mr. Sullivan also made clear the United States' intention to review the February 2020 U.S.-Taliban agreement, including to assess whether the Taliban was living up to its commitments to cut ties with terrorist groups, to reduce violence in Afghanistan, and to engage in meaningful negotiations with the Afghan government and other stakeholders. He expressed America's desire that all Afghan leaders embrace this historic opportunity for peace and stability. The National Security Advisors discussed the United States' support for protecting the extraordinary gains made by Afghan women, girls, and minority groups as part of the peace process. Mr. Sullivan committed to consulting closely with the Government of Afghanistan, NATO allies, and regional partners regarding a collective strategy to support a stable, sovereign, and secure future for Afghanistan.
