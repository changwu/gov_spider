    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today issued the following statement from Ben Porritt, McCain spokesman:
"Barack Obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor, when he introduced Joe Biden as the next president. The reality is that nothing has changed since Joe Biden first made his assessment that Barack Obama is not ready to lead. He wasn't ready then and he isn't ready now."
