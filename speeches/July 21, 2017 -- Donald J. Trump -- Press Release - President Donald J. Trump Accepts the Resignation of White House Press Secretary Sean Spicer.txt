    President Donald J. Trump has accepted the resignation of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. Spicer, who has been Press Secretary since the inauguration and at times also filled the role of White House Communications Director, will continue to serve the Administration through August.
"I am grateful for Sean's work on behalf of my Administration and the American people," said President Trump. "I wish him continued success as he moves on to pursue new opportunities: Just look at his great television ratings."
"It has been a tremendous honor to serve as the Trump Administration's first Press Secretary," said Spicer. "In just 6 months, President Trump and his staff have done great work to advance the interests of the American people, both at home and abroad. President Trump's unwavering commitment to making America great again will no doubt ensure that these successes continue in the coming months and years."
