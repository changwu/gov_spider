    On behalf of the American people, I express my deep condolences to the family of Prince Saud bin Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, to King Salman and to the people of Saudi Arabia on the loss of such a committed and accomplished diplomat.
As the world's longest serving Foreign Minister, Prince Saud witnessed some of the most challenging periods in the region. At each turn, he advanced the goals of peace, whether negotiating the end to Lebanon's civil war or helping to launch the Arab Peace Initiative.
Generations of American leaders and diplomats benefited from Prince Saud's thoughtful perspective, charisma and poise, and diplomatic skill. He was committed to the importance of the U.S.-Saudi relationship and the pursuit of stability and security in the Middle East and beyond, and his legacy will be remembered around the world. May God grant him peace.
