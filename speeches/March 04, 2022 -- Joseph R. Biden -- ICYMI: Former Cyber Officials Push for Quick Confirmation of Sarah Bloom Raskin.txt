WaPo: Former cyber officials push quick confirmation for Fed nominee[Joseph Marks, 3/4/22]
It's critical to quickly confirm Federal Reserve vice chair nominee Sarah Bloom Raskin because "the potential for significant cyber impacts is ever more apparent and urgent," former cyber officials write in a letter to Senate leaders shared with the Cybersecurity 202.
Senate Republicans have boycotted Raskin's nomination as they scrutinize her role on a financial technology firm's board. Raskin led an initiative as deputy secretary of the Treasury Department during the Obama administration to standardize approaches to cybersecurity in the financial sector among G-7 nations.
The letter was signed by former White House cybersecurity coordinator Michael Daniel, former DHS deputy secretary Jane Holl Lute, former DHS undersecretary Suzanne Spaulding and former State Department cyber coordinator Chris Painter. It was addressed to the Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), as well as top lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee, where her nomination has stalled.
