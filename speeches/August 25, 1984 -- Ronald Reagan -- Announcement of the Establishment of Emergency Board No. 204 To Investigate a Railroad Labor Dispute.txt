    The President announced the creation of Presidential Emergency Board No. 204 to investigate and make recommendations for settlement of a current dispute between Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation and employees represented by the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen. The President, by Executive order, created the emergency board pursuant to an appropriate request as mandated by the Railway Labor Act.
The emergency board procedures of the Railway Labor Act applicable to commuter railroads provide that the board will report its findings and recommendations for settlement to the President within 30 days. The parties must then consider the recommendations of the emergency board and endeavor to resolve their differences without engaging in self-help during a subsequent 90-day period.
