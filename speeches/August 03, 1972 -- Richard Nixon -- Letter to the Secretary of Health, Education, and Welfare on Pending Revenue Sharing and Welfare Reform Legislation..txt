    Dear Elliot:
As you know, George Shultz is leading the Administration's effort to obtain a clean general revenue sharing bill.
I have been advised that the revenue sharing proposal will probably be considered by the Senate prior to consideration of H.R. 1. There is speculation that some selected elements of H.R. 1 might be amended to the revenue sharing bill. I would strongly oppose such a move, because it could doom the possibility of real welfare reform in this Congress and could seriously jeopardize the revenue sharing bill. As we proceed on general revenue sharing, I would like you to make known to the Senate leadership my reasons for this position.
The H.R. 1 bill is likely to follow revenue sharing to the Senate floor. After a three year struggle, during which welfare reform has twice been passed by the House of Representatives, I am certain that the Senate will carry out its public obligation to consider and vote upon H.R.1.
I remain firmly committed to welfare reform and to revenue sharing, but they should be passed and signed as separate bills. The House-passed version of welfare reform contains the major elements of our original proposal:
--Strong work incentives and requirements;
--National eligibility standards and minimum benefit standards;
--Coverage of the working poor;
--Fiscal relief for the States.
This legislation, by eventually bringing under control the exploding costs of our current wasteful welfare programs, is a strong step forward toward the fiscal integrity we are determined to achieve.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[Honorable Elliot L. Richardson, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, Washington, D.C. 20201]
