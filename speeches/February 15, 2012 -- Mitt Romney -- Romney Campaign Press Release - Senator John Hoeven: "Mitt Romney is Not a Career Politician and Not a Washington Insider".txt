    North Dakota Senator John Hoeven made the following statement on Mitt Romney's record as a Washington outsider:
"North Dakota may be in the heartland of America, but we've led the nation in growth of exports to the rest of the world. We've done well, but we would do even better if we had a president in the White House who understands business. Mitt Romney is not a career politician and not a Washington insider. He's spent his adult life in the private sector, starting new businesses and turning around failing ones. He understands the need to open new markets for America's goods. And he's committed to developing our natural resources with good stewardship to move our nation toward energy security. Mikey and I appreciate Mitt's dedication to our country and encourage North Dakotans to support him in his bid for the White House."
