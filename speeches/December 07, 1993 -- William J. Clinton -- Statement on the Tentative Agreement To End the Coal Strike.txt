    I would like to commend the United Mine Workers of America and the Bituminous Coal Operations Association for coming together and producing a tentative agreement in this contentious strike.
This agreement represents good news for the coal industry, good news for its workers, and more good news for the economy as we approach the holiday season.
I applaud Mine Workers President Rich Trumka and BCOA Chief Bobby Brown for their dedication and commitment to an outcome that will support a strong and productive mining industry in America.
And I extend special thanks to former Secretary of Labor Bill Usery who was brought into this challenging mediation process at the request of Secretary of Labor Bob Reich. Bob assured me that Bill's history of stepping into and resolving tough disputes would prove to be invaluable to the negotiations. He was right.
