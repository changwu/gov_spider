    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Morella (R) Maryland and 239 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 1248, which would reauthorize the critically important programs created by the original Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and by subsequent legislation. VAWA has been an important tool in the Nation's effort to combat domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault and has made a crucial difference in the lives of countless women and children. The Administration is pleased that the bill would make important improvements to VAWA, including reauthorizing critical grant programs at higher funding levels, expanding the Act to include dating violence, and creating a set-aside of five percent of grant funds for tribes under the STOP (Services, Training, Officers, Prosecutors) Formula Grant Program and three other discretionary grant programs.
Congress and the Administration have the opportunity to build on the strong record made possible by the original VAWA of helping States, tribes, and communities to prevent and fight violence against women and to improve community responses to domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. The Administration is deeply committed to continuing the progress that has been made under VAWA. The Administration would like to work with Congress to address issues such as providing protections to battered immigrant women and reauthorizing the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. The Administration is pleased that the House has decided to consider this important bill and urges the Senate to immediately pass its version of VAWA, S. 2787. The two versions must be quickly reconciled to ensure that VAWA authorization does not lapse on September 30th.
