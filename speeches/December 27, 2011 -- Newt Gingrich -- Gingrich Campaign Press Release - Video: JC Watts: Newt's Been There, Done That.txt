    Former Oklahoma Congressman JC Watts last night on Hannity with guest host Mark Steyn:
I am long past looking for my president or my presidential nominee to be my Savior or to be my Pastor. I am looking for someone that's prepared to do the heavy lifting to get us where we all want to be; and, I think, where we need to be.
And when you consider in Washington and around the country, today we're talking about balanced budgets, paying down the National Debt, getting the economy going, defending ourselves, activists judges.   Newt Gingrich did all those things when he was Speaker.  We got tax relief.  We got balanced budgets.  We got job creation.  We paid down our National Debt.  And if you think about it Mark, we haven't done that since he left.  So, he's been there, done that.
