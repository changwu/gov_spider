    Presidential Determination No. 91-23
Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Based on your advice, pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 614(a)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2364(a)(2)), I hereby determine that it is vital to the national security interests of the United States to finance the sale of up to an aggregate of $3.023 million of defense articles and defense services for Niger and Senegal, notwithstanding any provision of law that earmarked funds appropriated for fiscal year 1982 for the Sudan, and notwithstanding section 515(b) of Public Law 101-513 insofar as that provision would require deobligation to occur in accordance with amendments of applicable grant or loan agreements. Accordingly, I hereby authorize the extension of such financing.
You are hereby authorized and directed to transmit this determination to the Congress and to publish it in the Federal Register.
