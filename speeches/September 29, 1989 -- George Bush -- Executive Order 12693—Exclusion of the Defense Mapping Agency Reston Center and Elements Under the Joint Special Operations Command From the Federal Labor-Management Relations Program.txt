    By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including section 7103(b)(1) of title 5 of the United States Code, and having determined that the Defense Mapping Agency Reston Center and the elements under the operational control of the Joint Special Operations Command have as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work and that the provisions of Chapter 71 of title 5 of the United States Code cannot be applied to those organizations in a manner consistent with national security requirements and considerations, Executive Order No. 12171 of November 19, 1979, as amended, is further amended as follows:
Section 1. Section 1-212(v) is amended by deleting the period and inserting in lieu thereof "and all elements under its operational control."
Sec. 2. A new section is inserted after section 1-214 as follows:
"1-215. The Defense Mapping Agency Reston Center, Department of Defense."
