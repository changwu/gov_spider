    THE newspaper route is one of the best training grounds for millions of young Americans. In communities across the nation Countless illustrious and prominent citizens share the common bond of having traveled the newspaper route on the way to their successful careers.
It is most appropriate that we set aside a special day to honor the boys and girls who serve as newspaper carriers across our country, and that we give deserving recognition to a tradition that continue so greatly to enrich our way of life.
