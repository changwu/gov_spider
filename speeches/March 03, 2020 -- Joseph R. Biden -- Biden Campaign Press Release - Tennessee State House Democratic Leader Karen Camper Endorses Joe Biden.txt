    Today, Tennessee State House Democratic Leader Karen Camper released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"Right now, we need a leader in the White House who can unite all Americans, defeat Donald Trump, and fight for families in Tennessee and across the nation. That leader is Joe Biden. America watched as Vice President Joe Biden stood alongside Barack Obama and advanced policies that improved the lives of Americans. As President of the National Organization of Black Elected Legislative Women, I am confident that as the next President of the United States, Joe Biden will continue to support and represent all people."
Camper's endorsement adds to the growing momentum Joe Biden has established in Tennessee, a critical Super Tuesday state. She joins 30 current and former elected officials, including state senators and representatives, mayors, city council members, and community leaders in supporting Joe Biden. Yesterday, the Mayor of Chattanooga Andy Berke also announced his support, citing Biden's ability to unite the nation and bring dignity back to the Oval Office.
Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
