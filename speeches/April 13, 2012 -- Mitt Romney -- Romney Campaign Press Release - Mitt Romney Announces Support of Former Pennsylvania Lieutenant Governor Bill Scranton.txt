    Mitt Romney today announced the support of former Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor Bill Scranton.
"I'm proud to have the support of such a distinguished leader as Bill," said Mitt Romney. "Pennsylvania voters are looking for a candidate to defeat Barack Obama and put in place economic policies that will spur growth and empower small businesses. I know he shares those values and will be a valued advocate for me in the Keystone State in the months to come."
"I have known and admired Mitt for many years," said Lieutenant Governor Bill Scranton. "Like me, Mitt has experience in both government and the real economy. As a conservative businessman, Mitt has created thousands of middle class jobs and actually balanced budgets. As the Governor of Massachusetts, he turned a $3 billion budget shortfall into a $2 billion rainy day fund. At a time when America's legendary economic engine is sputtering under inexperienced and misguided leadership, when jobs are hard to come by and economic security is scarce, Pennsylvania and America need what Mitt Romney will bring to Washington. I am proud to stand with him."
