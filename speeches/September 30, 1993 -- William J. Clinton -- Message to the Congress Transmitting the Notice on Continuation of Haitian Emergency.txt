    To the Congress of the United States:
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the enclosed notice, stating that the Haitian emergency is to continue in effect beyond October 4, 1993, to the Federal Register for publication.
The crisis between the United States and Haiti that led to the declaration on October 4, 1991, of a national emergency has not been resolved. While substantial progress has been made toward restoring democracy pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 861, all necessary conditions to that restoration have not yet been met. Multilateral sanctions have been suspended but not terminated. Political conditions in Haiti continue, therefore, to be of considerable concern to the United States. For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to retain the authority to apply economic sanctions to ensure the restoration and security of the democratically elected Government of Haiti.
