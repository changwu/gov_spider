    Today, Romney for President released a new web video, "Jolt." Last Friday, the unemployment rate rose to 8.2 percent and 300,000 more people joined the long-term unemployed. One week later, President Obama said the private sector is doing fine. Only a president that presides over forty months of unemployment over 8 percent would think that the last jobs report is "doing fine." These comments show that President Obama is completely out of touch with the middle class.
