Big win for Republicans as Democrats cave on Shutdown. Now I want a big win for everyone including Republicans Democrats and DACA but especially for our Great Military and Border Security. Should be able to get there. See you at the negotiating table!Retweets: 28224Favorites: 133812

Even Crazy Jim Acosta of Fake News CNN agrees: 'Trump World and WH sources dancing in end zone: Trump wins again...Schumer and Dems caved...gambled and lost.' Thank you for your honesty Jim!Retweets: 27462Favorites: 129596

Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans & Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA by February 8 but everyone will be trying....with a big additional focus put on Military Strength and Border Security. The Dems have just learned that a Shutdown is not the answer!Retweets: 24229Favorites: 112958

Thank you to General John Kelly who is doing a fantastic job and all of the Staff and others in the White House for a job well done. Long hours and Fake reporting makes your job more difficult but it is always great to WIN and few have won more than us!Retweets: 21698Favorites: 97892
