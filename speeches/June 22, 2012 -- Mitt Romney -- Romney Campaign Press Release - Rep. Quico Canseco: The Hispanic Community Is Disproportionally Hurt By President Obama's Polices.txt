    Texas Congressman Quico Canseco made the following statement on President Obama's remarks at NALEO:
"From double-digit unemployment to a staggering child poverty rate, the Hispanic community has been disproportionally struck by President Obama's failed economic policies. Raising taxes, increasing regulations, and implementing Obamacare are clearly bigger priorities for President Obama than getting people back to work and creating an environment where small businesses can grow. The Hispanic community cannot stand for four more years under the current administration in Washington. By electing Mitt Romney in November, we can instead choose a different path and begin the work of turning the economy around for all Americans, especially Hispanics."
