One attendee in particular made up his mind after the event: the mayor of Easley, Larry Bagwell.
From the Greenville News:
Easley Mayor Larry Bagwell, who welcomed the crowd to the event, said he had been undecided, but after Rubio's performance in the debate, and after hearing him Sunday, he has decided to give Rubio his vote. 'I think his enthusiasm, he's been very vocal that he believes in this country, he believes in the Constitution as it is written,' Bagwell said.
That makes three South Carolina mayors in four days endorsing Marco: Bagwell joins Greenville Mayor Knox White and Myrtle Beach Mayor John Rhodes.
