Des Moines Register's David Yepsen: "[Gov. Romney] turned in his usual polished, executive-like debate performance." (David Yepsen, Op-Ed, "Romney Finds A Foothold To Continue Upward Climb," Des Moines Register, 8/6/07)
- Yepsen: "He also got off one of the best one-liners of the day when he attacked Democratic presidential contender Barack Obama. Romney said: 'In one week, he went from saying he's going to sit down, you know, for tea, with our enemies, but then he's going to bomb our allies. I mean, he's gone from Jane Fonda to Dr. Strangelove in one week.'" (David Yepsen, Op-Ed, "Romney Finds A Foothold To Continue Upward Climb," Des Moines Register, 8/6/07)
Republican Pollster Frank Luntz: "Romney is winning in both Iowa and New Hampshire. And his lead seems to be growing with every survey. One of the reasons is his debate performances. They've been categorically successful. People listen to him and they like what they hear." (Fox News' "Fox & Friends," 8/6/07)
- Luntz: "And we're going to show you a clip of Romney right now with our exclusive Fox overlay. ... The higher that the lines climb the more favorable the response. Here is Mitt Romney talking about budgets, taxes, and expanding the economy. Watch how high those lines climb. That's a very favorable reaction. ... You've got middle income Americans sitting in our groups and they're listening to Mitt Romney and saying that's what I want to hear from and that's what I want see from the next president." (Fox News' "Fox & Friends," 8/6/07)
