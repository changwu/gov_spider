    WASHINGTON — Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, the first female combat veteran ever to run for President, made an announcement through her campaign recognizing the 3rd "qualifying" poll for the October debate.
The latest Washington Post / ABC News poll has Tulsi Gabbbard at 2%. This is the campaign's third out of the four required "qualifying" polls needed to be on the debate stage in October.
However, Rep. Gabbard emphasized her campaign is not focused on the debates, and is instead spending her time on the ground campaigning, talking to the American people directly — without the ridiculous 60-second time constraints of the debate stage.
