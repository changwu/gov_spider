    In the face of a constantly mounting number of congratulatory messages, I feel that I must, in this statement, extend my hearty thanks to all who have thus remembered me.
I am heartened and encouraged by all these messages of good will from thousands of well-wishers.
Not less appreciated than the others are the pledges of loyalty and support received from sincere men and women who did not cast their votes for the Administration. These messages, in particular, reflect a spirit of national unity in essential things which is most welcome. In union we shall find our true strength.
To all who have sent their greetings I give this assurance of gratitude and heartfelt appreciation. In acknowledging these pledges of loyal support and full cooperation in forwarding the interests of the Nation, I pledge anew my determination to work shoulder to shoulder with all who place true Americanism above all other considerations.
