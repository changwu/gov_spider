    I am very pleased that labor and management have reached an agreement concerning the West Coast ports. This agreement is good for workers, good for employers, and it's good for America's economy. I congratulate labor and management for working together to successfully resolve their disagreements, and I also commend the efforts of Labor Secretary Elaine Chao and the Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, Peter Hurtgen, for their tireless efforts in bringing this matter to a successful conclusion.
