Marco's newest early state ad makes the contrast between him and President Obama crystal clear.
While Obama has used the presidency to pursue political goals, Marco will remember that priority number one is keeping Americans safe.

Barack Obama released terrorists from Guantanamo, and now they are plotting to attack us.
Instead of fighting to fund our troops, he fights to fund Planned Parenthood.
He spies on Israel, and cut a deal with Iran.
His plan after the attack in San Bernardino: take away our guns.
While ISIS is beheading people, burning them in cages, he says climate change is our greatest threat.
I'm Marco Rubio. I approve this message because America needs a real commander-in-chief and a president that will keep us safe.

Marco has outlined a concrete plan for real national security in the 21st Century.
