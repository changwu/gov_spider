    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Sen. Hatch (R) UT and 6 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports S. 249. The bill would authorize appropriations and amend the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act to help States and localities provide assistance to runaway and homeless children. In addition, the bill would authorize appropriations for the Justice Department to make grants to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which provides important services to missing and runaway children and their families as well as Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies. The Administration remains strongly committed to protecting our Nation's children and families from violence and its terrible effects.
