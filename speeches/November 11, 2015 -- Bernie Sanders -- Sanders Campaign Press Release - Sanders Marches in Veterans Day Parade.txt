    LEBANON, N.H. – As Americans say "thank you to all who served our country," U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday marched behind a color guard in a Veterans Day parade through this western New Hampshire community.

Former chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Sanders spoke after the parade at a gathering in Colburn Park, where he was introduced by Robert St. Pierre, the commander of the American Legion post.
"Today here in Lebanon and all across the country in big cities and small towns people are saying a profound thank you to the millions of men and women who put their lives on the line to defend our country. Today also is a day to remember the great sacrifices made by the families of those who served," Sanders said.
"If patriotism means anything, it means that we do not turn our backs on those who defended us, on those who were prepared to give their all. It means that we keep our promises. It means that we make certain that veterans in this country get all of the benefits and health care they need and were promised – and that they get them in a timely manner. It means that we say no to those who want to cut benefits for disabled veterans and no to those who would underfund the Department of Veterans Affairs.
"Today we say thank you to all who served."
