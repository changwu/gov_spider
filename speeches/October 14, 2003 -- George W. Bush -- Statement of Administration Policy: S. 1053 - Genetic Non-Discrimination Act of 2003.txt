    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Sen. Snowe (R) ME and seven cosponsors)
The Administration is committed to enactment of legislation to prohibit genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment. The Administration supports S. 1053, which would bar health insurers from denying coverage to a healthy individual or charging the person higher premiums based solely on a genetic predisposition to developing a disease in the future. The bill also would prohibit employers from using individuals' genetic information when making hiring, firing, job placement, or promotion decisions.
The Administration wants to work with the Congress to ensure that individuals can be certain that they are protected against the improper use of genetic information. Unwarranted use of genetic information, and the fear of potential discrimination, threatens both society's ability to use new genetic technologies to improve human health and the ability to conduct the very research needed to understand, treat, and prevent diseases. Enactment of Federal legislation will help guarantee that the Nation fully realizes the potential of ongoing advances in genetic sciences.
