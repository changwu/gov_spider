    I am pleased to announce that today the President submitted the START II treaty to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification. This treaty marks an achievement of fundamental importance not only to the United States and Russia but to the whole world. START II is the capstone of a process over the past 2 years that has set back the hands on the nuclear doomsday clock.
The President urges the Senate to act promptly and approve the START II treaty. He also looks forward to prompt ratification of this treaty by Russia, as well as the ratification of START I and accession to the Non-Proliferation Treaty by Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. Once these actions are completed the historic reductions can begin without delay.
