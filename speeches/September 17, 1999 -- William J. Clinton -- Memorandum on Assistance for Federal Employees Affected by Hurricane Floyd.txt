    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Subject: Assistance for Federal Employees Affected by Hurricane Floyd
I am deeply concerned about the devastating losses suffered by many as a result of Hurricane Floyd. Many parts of the Federal Government have been mobilized to respond to this disaster.
As part of this effort, I ask the heads of executive departments and agencies to excuse from duty without charge to leave or loss of pay those Federal civilian employees who are affected by Hurricane Floyd and its aftermath and who can be spared from their usual responsibilities. Specifically, I request that excused absence be granted to employees who are needed for emergency law enforcement, relief, or clean-up efforts authorized by Federal, State, or other officials having jurisdiction and employees who are prevented from reporting for work or faced with a personal emergency because of Hurricane Floyd and its aftermath.
I am also authorizing the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to determine whether there is a need to establish an emergency leave transfer program to assist employees affected by this major disaster. An emergency leave transfer program would permit employees in an executive agency to donate their unused annual leave for transfer to employees of the same or other agencies who were adversely affected by Hurricane Floyd and who need additional time off for recovery. If the need for donated annual leave becomes evident, I direct OPM to establish the emergency leave transfer program and provide additional information to agencies on the program's administration.
