    Well, thank you, Henry Hyde. Thank you for the introduction, and thank you, as well, for your commitment to life. Incidentally, this magnificent rally looks very, very good on television. How do I know? Because I've seen some of it.
I want to pay my respects to our able Vice President, Dan Quayle -- thank him for his commitment -- to other Members of Congress that are there, to Dr. Willke, to Dr. Dobson, and a special greeting to my friend -- Your Eminences Cardinal O'Connor and Cardinal Hickey and others that might be in attendance.
I am very pleased to have this opportunity to express to you my deeply held views about abortion on demand. In January of this year, I addressed the March for Life on this very issue, and I said then and reaffirm now that your presence on The Mall today reminds all of us in government that Americans from all walks of life are committed to preserving the sanctity and dignity of human life. Like you, I realize that the widespread prevalence of abortion in America is a tragedy not only in terms of lives destroyed but because it so fundamentally contradicts the values that we as a nation hold dear. When I look at adopted children, I give thanks that their parents chose life.
Today, as a nation of faith and compassion, our mission must be to help more and more Americans make the right choice -- the choice for life. One day your lifesaving message will have reached and influenced every American. Until then, continue to work for the day when respect for human life is sacrosanct and beyond question. I know from your devotion and selflessness that this day cannot be far away.
God bless you, and God bless life. Thank you very, very much.
