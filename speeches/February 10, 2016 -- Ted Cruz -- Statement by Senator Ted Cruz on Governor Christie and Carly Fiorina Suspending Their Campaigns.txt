    HOUSTON, Texas â€” Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today released the following statement in response to the announcement that Governor Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina have suspended their campaigns for President:
"Carly Fiorina and Chris Christie are strong, principled individuals. They ran impressive campaigns and energized a great many people.
"Christie's background in law enforcement resonated with voters looking for someone who will vigorously combat radical Islamic terrorism and keep this country safe. And Carly did a terrific job standing up to Hillary Clinton, making the clear case for how a return to the free market principles that built this country can bring back jobs and economic growth for our nation.
"I congratulate both of them on their hard-fought and well-run campaigns. I'm grateful they ran and wish them both the very best moving forward."
