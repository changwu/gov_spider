    On September 26, 1993, by Executive Order 12865, I declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ("UNITA"), prohibiting the sale or supply by United States persons or from the United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft, of arms and related material of all types, and petroleum and petroleum products to the territory of Angola, other than through designated points of entry. The order also prohibits the sale or supply of such commodities to UNITA. Because of our continuing international obligations and because of the prejudicial effect that discontinuation of the sanctions would have on the Angolan peace process, the national emergency declared on September 26, 1993, and the measures adopted pursuant thereto to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond September 26, 1996. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to UNITA.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.
