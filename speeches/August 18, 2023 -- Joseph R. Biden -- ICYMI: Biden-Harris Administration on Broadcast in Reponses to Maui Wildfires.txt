    On Wednesday, the White House announced that President Biden will travel to Maui, Hawaii to meet with first responders, survivors, as well as federal, state, and local officials, in the wake of deadly wildfires on the island. President Biden has mobilized a robust whole-government response to support immediate and long-term needs, including a speedy major disaster declaration allowing the deployment of Federal aid to supplement Hawaii's state and local recovery efforts.
Administration officials including FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell and FEMA spokesperson John Mills have blanketed airwave, speaking directly the people Maui.
See coverage below:
Deanna Criswell on MSNBC – August 17th 
CRISWELL: Our search teams have been on the ground in the primary area, conducting search and recovery missions. Once they opened up that access road, it also allowed us to deploy teams into the community, going door to door to identify who needs assistance and who hasn't registered yet. I want to note that we received the disaster declaration about a week ago. It was last Thursday when the President declared this a major disaster. Since then, we have already disbursed over $3 million in financial assistance to families who have registered with FEMA. I appreciate the opportunity to share this information because we want to ensure that everyone registers. As we go door to door, our aim is to reach those we haven't reached yet and bring our services to them.
HOST: Is there anything FEMA can do to assist with temporary housing? […]
CRISWELL: The long-term housing mission falls within our area of coordination and responsibility. The governor had already conducted an assessment to understand the housing needs and explore how they can expand affordable housing on the island. This provides a solid starting point for us to collaborate with the governor's team to find solutions for transitional housing, and in some instances, even new permanent housing for residents. We're bringing in the entire federal network. We met yesterday to discuss creative solutions, and we'll continue these discussions. The temporary housing units you mentioned are one of the tools in our toolbox, and all options are on the table. We need to understand what's available to facilitate the transition into longer-term housing.
HOST: We know the President and First Lady will be visiting on Monday. Obviously, care and comfort are crucial, but is there something the President needs to grasp by witnessing it firsthand?
CRISWELL: Absolutely. I will also be traveling on Monday. What the President will witness is what I saw when I visited Lahaina. He'll see the devastating impact this fire has had on the community. He'll have an opportunity to converse with affected families and provide the reassurance that he has directed the entire federal government to offer every available resource for the community's recovery. I believe this level of reassurance will be well received within the community.
Criswell on GMA3 – August 17th 
HOST:  What is the latest on the search and recovery going on in the town of Lahaina?
CRISWELL: The update I received last night […] indicates that we're about 40% complete in the search and recovery mission. We have deployed additional teams and K-9 units to facilitate this effort. We're moving as swiftly as possible, but it's important to remember the complexity of this operation and the challenges it poses for our K-9 teams. We need to approach it methodically and deliberately to ensure that we account for everyone. This is a mass casualty event, and as much as we aim to cover ground, we must also proceed with respect and accuracy.
HOST: We've witnessed the images and heard from many who were displaced by the wildfires. What is FEMA currently doing to assist these individuals?
CRISWELL: We are collaborating closely not only with our state partners but also with the American Red Cross. Each of us has different programs aimed at relocating people from congregate shelters around the island into temporary accommodations such as hotels, motels, and Airbnbs. We've established a joint task force to eliminate any confusion for those in need of shelter. If someone is displaced and requires a place to stay, they won't have to navigate different programs. We're making it seamless for them. Through our program, we have hotel rooms available, while the state has its own program, and the Red Cross is aiding in managing the state's program. This ensures that wraparound services like food, water, and mental health counseling are provided — essential needs at this time. As we continue to transition people out of shelters, we're simultaneously working on the long-term housing plan. A federal disaster recovery coordinator is collaborating and integrating with the state's long-term recovery coordinator. Together, they're formulating plans for a smooth transition towards long-term solutions.
HOST: What does the long-term housing plan look like? What kind of strategy are you considering?
CRISWELL: We're exploring all potential options. We're keeping every tool in our toolbox available for consideration. Some solutions might be more challenging, but we're not ruling anything out. We convened a meeting at the White House with deputy secretaries from various cabinet-level agencies to discuss the resources we can bring to the table. We're leveraging every resource and employing creative solutions to assist both Maui and the government of Hawaii. When I spoke with the governor, he had already initiated a housing assessment based on the limited housing available. This assessment serves as a valuable starting point for us to help implement his vision and address long-term housing issues through strategic planning.
Karine Jean Pierre on CNN – August 17th 
SIDNER: […]  I'm wondering, as President Biden is about to travel to Hawaii on Monday, what will he do during his visit to genuinely assist the people who are still grappling with these catastrophic disasters, including the first responders?
JEAN-PIERRE: Well, Sara, thank you so much for that report. I think it's really important for the entire nation to see what the people of Maui, what the people of Hawaii are experiencing. As you just mentioned, on Monday, the President and First Lady are going to be visiting Maui. They will witness firsthand the impact of the wildfires, the devastating loss of land, and the erosion of culture. Let's not forget that aspect as well. They will directly hear from local and state officials, as well as survivors, about the path to recovery.
Look, the President's and the First Lady's message will be crystal clear: 'We are here for you—today, tomorrow, for as long as it takes.' To those who have lost loved ones, to those who are anxiously waiting for news, remember you are not alone. The entire nation mourns with you and stands by you as you rebuild and recover. We won't leave your side until that process is complete. The President will continue to coordinate a comprehensive government effort, just as he has been doing since day one. Multiple federal agencies and departments are on-site, working closely with local and state partners to provide the necessary federal assistance that these survivors require. This is of utmost importance. The President is fully committed to this cause.
As the FEMA Administrator mentioned, there are currently more than 600 staff members on the ground. They have already disbursed $2.3 million in family assistance. For those in Maui, in Hawaii, who are still seeking federal aid, please call 800-621-FEMA or visit disasterassistance.gov. We are here to assist and ensure they receive all the support they need to rebuild and recover.
Administrator Criswell On KHNL (NBC Hawaii) - August 17
HOST: The White House says the President and First Lady will meet with first responders, survivors, as well as federal, state, and local officials in Hawaii on Monday
CRISWELL: So, he can meet with the governor and see firsthand just really the tragic impact that this this fire has had on these communities.
Deanne Criswell on MSNBC – August 16th 
HOST: […] How quickly can you deploy resources so that nobody goes hungry or thirsty, and people have shelter?
CRISWELL: Yes, all of those resources are already in place. I had the opportunity to visit two shelters with an overwhelming amount of donations. There's a distribution center on Oahu with meals and water that we've already sent into the area. So, the resources are there. Perhaps what would help is getting the message out about where to access these resources. I spoke with a shelter manager who said they're packing up food, water, and supplies. As families who are housing displaced individuals come by, they provide them with bags of essentials. The resources exist; we just need help spreading the word within the community.
HOST: [..] What communication efforts are underway to ensure people are aware of the available help?
CRISWELL: That's a crucial question. We have teams embedded in the shelters, and now that Hawaii has opened up the bypass road in Maui, we can send our personnel into the communities to knock on doors and better understand people's needs. We'll continue sending teams because we want to bring services to the community rather than have them find us. With improved access, we'll be able to reach deeper into the community and disseminate the message effectively.
HOST: FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, I understand the extraordinary and challenging work that the people in these disaster
zones are doing. Our thanks go out to them…
Deanne Criswell on CNN – August 16th
BORIS: FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. Administrator, thank you so much for being with us. You have witnessed many natural disasters, and you were recently in Maui. You shared with reporters that you could not have been prepared for what you encountered. I'm wondering, what is the biggest challenge you're facing right now in trying to get resources where they need to be?
CRISWELL: Hi, Boris. I think you're right. I've attended numerous events, and I don't believe anything can truly prepare you for what I witnessed when I was on the ground there. This town, this tightly-knit community, experienced utter devastation. Right now, our priority is to continue locating everybody who remains unaccounted for. This involves searching through the burned areas and reconnecting individuals who may be staying with friends and family elsewhere. It's crucial that we maintain this effort, which is why we're sending in additional teams and more dogs to assist in this process as we continue working through the town of Lahaina. Additionally, we're collaborating with the governor's team to discuss the long-term rebuilding process and how we can do so in a manner that enhances the community's resilience. These are the beginning and end points of the recovery, and there are many phases in between. We have significant work to accomplish during the interim, and we'll keep dispatching resources to provide the support the governor requires throughout this process.
BORIS: […] However, there is frustration among community members who feel they have been left behind. What would you say in response?
CRISWELL: I was present, and I had the opportunity to visit several shelters. I must say, the overwhelming response in terms of donations, assistance, and volunteers that have arrived to help is truly remarkable and incredible. There is a wealth of resources available on the island. However, we recognize the importance of reaching out to the community and spreading this message. During my time at one of the shelters, I observed the shelter manager and their team assembling care packages. As host families visit the shelter to collect supplies, they are provided with comprehensive care packages. Now that the bypass road has been reopened, our teams will be able to enter the community, going door-to-door to locate individuals who may not have registered for assistance or require additional support. We're continuing to collaborate closely with the county and the state of Hawaii to ensure all available resources reach the community. The resources are indeed there, and our ongoing effort is directed towards ensuring that we reach every individual in need.
John Mills on MSNBC - August 16th 
MILLS: Katy, it's good to be with you. FEMA's number one priority is helping survivors who are directly affected by these historic fires. We have full-time staff in Honolulu, and they were in action immediately. FEMA's role is not to lead the response, but to support the state and Maui County. We are working on multiple lines of effort: emergency services, mass care, critical infrastructure, and housing among others. We have more than 600 federal personnel on the ground right now in Maui, and another 100 deployed. This includes FEMA Urban Search and Rescue teams who are actively working in the hardest hit areas with search dogs, trying to locate the remains of survivors. I was with Miguel Almaguer's crew yesterday in Lahaina; it's a devastating scene there. People had to run for their lives and seek shelter anywhere they could.
CRISWELL: FEMA is working directly with survivors, and we have been doing that for the last few days. We have already approved assistance for about 1,300 households and provided around $2.3 million to help these survivors jump-start their recovery. That's just a temporary solution for now. So, we're working in the shelters with our Disaster Survivor Assistance crews one-on-one. We're opening a Disaster Recovery Center where people can meet with FEMA and the Small Business Administration. We're providing money not only for critical needs but also directly to survivors to help them repair or rebuild their homes, providing rental assistance so they can temporarily rent a place to live, or relocate if necessary. We're also providing money for lodging reimbursement if they had to relocate and money to replace essential personal property.
We have activated our Transitional Sheltering Program, which helps people move from shelters to hotels. Additionally, the state has also activated a similar program to get people out of shelters and into hotels. We're going to be here for the long term, Katy."
John Mills on News Nation – August 16th 
MILLS: I want to get back to the recovery effort. As I understand it, you're planning to bring even more cadaver dogs onto the island to assist in this effort. So, FEMA provides support based on requests we receive from the state. That's why we initially had 20 cadaver dogs with our Urban Search and Rescue teams. Now, we're doubling that number. The reason for this increase is that it's not just about searching in houses, but also in other locations like buildings and places where people took shelter. The search needs to cover all of these different areas, not just destroyed homes and buildings, but anywhere where remains might be found. That's why it presents a significant challenge. We also have very well-trained and dedicated canines that are engaged in this task. However, the conditions are difficult; it's hot, and the dogs are working 12-hour days.
FEMA Spokesperson John Mills on KGMB (CBS Hawaii) – August 16th ANCHOR: FEMA officials toured Lahaina on Tuesday while its search and rescue teams continued to help local firefighters search for victims. John Mills, a FEMA official, gave a briefing after that tour.
MILLS: FEMA's number one priority right now is helping people who have been directly affected by these historic fires. People who have lost their homes and frankly don't know where they are going to go next. Right now we do have our disaster survivor assistance crews going to the local shelters working one-on one- with survivors helping them register for disaster assistance.
Administrator Criswell Briefing On KITV (ABC Hawaii) – August 16th  ANCHOR: The nation's president recommitting his help and aid to Hawaii. In a briefing today at the White House officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency spoke on fire response efforts. President Joe Biden has been in communication with Governor Josh Green and said today Hawaii will be completely reimbursed for the emergency work that's being done. Now the President and First Lady Jill Biden are now planning to be on Maui on Monday. Joining them will be FEMA's Administrator Deanne Criswell who saw the distress of countless Lahaina residents firsthand.
CRISWELL: The periling stories of survival. The heroic accounts of response and the sense of community that i saw across the island. While I was in one of the shelters, I met with 1 young boy who was getting ready to go back to school but have lost everything, and we worked with him to find clothes and a backpack, school supplies to be able to be ready to go to school in his new facility. It's stories like these that let you know that this is more than just the visual impact of what we're seeing on television.
Administrator Criswell and FEMA Spokesperson John Mills on KHNL (NBC Hawaii) – August 16thANCHOR: President Biden has approved Governor Green's request for 100 percent reimbursement for 30 days. FEMA is providing an initial $700 dollar payment for affected families for immediate needs like food and medicine. FEMA is also opening a joint disaster recovery center where survivors can speak to FEMA specialists and other federal agencies for access to resources.
MILLS: The $700 one- time payment for critical needs is only a fraction of the FEMA assistance that may be available.
CRISWELL: We are still working with the government of Hawaii to understand what all of their resource needs are going to be for the future, and we really right now need to stay focused on what we're doing to help the people that have been displaced, find them interim housing and then work on their longterm solutions for recovery.
Administrator Criswell on KHNL (NBC Hawaii) This is Now – August 16, 2023HOST: FEMA's Administrator Deanne Criswell gave an update on the emergency response so far. She says millions of pounds of food have been mobilizes. They've also sent 700 personnel to the disaster and that 600 workers are on island. Criswell says $2.3 million has been allotted to help families with critical needs at this time. A joint task force has also been created for housing assistance. Now those affected are encouraged to apply for FEMA assistance in person, on their website, or by calling 1-800-621-3362.
CRISWELL: We are still working with the government of Hawaii to understand what all of their resource needs are going to be for the future, but today our focus is really still on finding all those people that are unaccounted for. Therefore we're sending additional search and rescue teams as well as additional canines to be able to go through the rubble piles and see how many people we can continue to find to help account for everybody that's still missing.
