Getting Emotional on the Campaign Trail:
TYRA: Senator Clinton got a lot of attention recently when she showed her vulnerable side in New Hampshire. That has been everywhere. Everybody is talking about it and when I was watching you I was like I have been there. How many women here have been there when it is just like, the pressure gets so much and you just break? I'm curious to know when you went home, what did you think about that? Did you feel weak?
HILLARY: No, because what happened, was so touching to me. This woman said, "Well, how do you get up in the morning?" It just struck me, how do any of us get up in the morning? How do we keep it together, how do we do what we have to do, and there was such a moment where it wasn't sort of me on one side of the table running for office and everybody else out there. It was us together. It really did make me emotional because that is when I think we are at our best as a country; when we really are honest and real...I'm running for President because it really means a lot to me that we give kids the same chance that we had.
I think so many people are feeling really kind of under the gun -- I'm just not making the progress; the health care is so expensive, the energy costs are so expensive, the jobs are not there, the income is not there. That is not the way we work the best so I want to try and make the difference for people. "
"I have a lot of moments like that where somebody says something to me that is so touching where one day in New Hampshire a woman grabbed my hand and said, "you have got to help me, my son needs an operation and the insurance company won't pay for it."...Those moments really keep me going and they make it real as opposed to being on the big stage and making speeches, that is part of it and those aren't the really motivating reasons why I do this. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Bill Clinton's Role When She is Elected President:
TYRA: Now if you win, you are going to be Madam President or Madame?
...He [Bill Clinton] has to have another name because...it would be your time.
SENATOR CLINTON: Well, that is true. He will always be Mr. President but now we need to do a nationwide contest for a name.
QUESTION: Like a reality show.
SENATOR CLINTON: Like a reality show. This is good, because think about it; here are some of the things that have been suggested like First Mate. His Scottish friends say "First Laddie," but we need ideas. I'll just keep calling him Bill. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Reality TV Show Appearance:
TYRA:...If you were a contestant on a reality show, would you rather be on Dancing with the Stars, American Idol, or America's Next Top Model?
SENATOR CLINTON: In my dreams I would be on America's Next Top Model but in reality I would have to choose my limited talents and of them dancing is better than singing. You do not want me to sing.
