    Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin today made the following statement on President Obama's comments about not being able to change Washington: 
"In admitting that he 'can't change Washington from the inside,' President Obama has undermined his very rationale for re-election. In 2008, he campaigned on the promise of bringing hope and change to America — and the fact that even he acknowledges he's failed gives voters no reason to give him a second term in office. Whether it's failing to cut the deficit, keep unemployment under 8%, reduce health care costs, or reform our broken immigration system, President Obama has not fulfilled the promises he made to voters just four years ago. It's time to elect a president who has proven he can bring people together to effect change; it's time to elect Mitt Romney."
