    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the provisions of Section 6(c) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, I am transmitting the sixth annual report on the status of Advisory Committees.
This report reflects the results of the 1977 government-wide, zero-base review that I directed be conducted of all advisory committees:
—The total number of committees was reduced to 875 from 1,159 at the end of 1976.
—While some new committees were established during the year, some 333 committees were terminated, and the number was reduced further by 81 as the result of the consolidation of existing committees.
While we recognize the contributions that advisory committees can make, we will continue our efforts to assure, through careful management and review, that such committees are terminated when they no longer are necessary, and that new committees are established only when they are essential to meet the responsibilities of the Government.
