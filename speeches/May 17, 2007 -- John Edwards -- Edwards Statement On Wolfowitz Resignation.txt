    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the followng statement today following the announcement that World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz is resigning. Edwards first called for Wolfowitz' resignation on April 13th, 2007.
"It's about time. I called for Paul Wolfowitz's resignation a month ago when it became clear that his leadership was undermining America's ability to lead the fight against global poverty. Wolfowitz's tenure at the World Bank was marked by serious questions of financial integrity that alarmed our allies.
"Now, President Bush must choose a successor who will help restore America's credibility and moral leadership in the world. We need a leader who can convincingly make the case for global anti-poverty investments that can lift up billions of lives and make the world safer and more secure."
