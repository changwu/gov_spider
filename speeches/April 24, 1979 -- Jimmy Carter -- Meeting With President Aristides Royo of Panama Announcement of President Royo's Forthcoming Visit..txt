    President Carter will meet with the President of the Republic of Panama, Dr. Aristides Royo, in Washington on May 10.
The President extended an invitation to President Royo on April 9 to meet in an informal working session to discuss the progress both countries have made in planning for implementation of the Panama Canal treaties, which go into effect October 1, 1979, as well as other bilateral and multilateral issues. President Royo will arrive in Washington after completing state visits to the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Italy.
Dr. Royo, who was Panama's chief treaty negotiator, will be in the United States for the first time since his inauguration last October 11. The two heads of state are expected to talk about measures designed to assure a smooth transition period when the treaties take effect and will discuss generally the efforts of both countries to assure the fulfillment of both the letter and the spirit of the accords.
With less than 6 months to go before treaty day, cooperation between the representatives of the United States and Panama has been excellent, although much work remains to be done, including passage of implementing legislation by the United States Congress.
