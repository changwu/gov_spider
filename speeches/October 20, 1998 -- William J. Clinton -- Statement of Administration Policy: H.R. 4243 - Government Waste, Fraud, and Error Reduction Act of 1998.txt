    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Horn (R) CA and 4 cosponsors)
The Administration has no objection to Senate passage of the substitute amendment for H.R. 4243. H.R. 4243, as amended, would reduce waste, fraud, and error in Government programs by making improvements with respect to Federal management and debt collection practices and Federal payment systems.
