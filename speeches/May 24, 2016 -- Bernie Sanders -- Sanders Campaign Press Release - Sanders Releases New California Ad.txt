    SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. - Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign on Tuesday released a new television spot that will run in California ahead of the state's June 7 primary election.
"What choice do Californians have in this election?" Sanders asks in the ad. "The biggest one of all. You have the power to choose a new direction for the Democratic Party. To break the back of a corrupt system of campaign finance that keeps a rigged economy in place. To stand up to Wall Street and make the wealthy pay their fair share. To fight for tuition-free public colleges and universities."
Sanders on Monday called on Hillary Clinton to join him for a debate in the country's most populous state, but the former secretary of state declined to participate. Sanders said it was "insulting to the people of California - our largest state - that she is not prepared to have a discussion with me about how we address the major crises we face."
"California, it's a long way to Washington, but you can send them a message they can't ignore," Sanders says as the ad concludes.
Sanders ran a spot in California in April during one of Clinton's high dollar fundraisers in the state. The ad, called "$27," focused on the average contribution to the senator's grassroots campaign. Clinton asked donors to raise $353,400 to get a seat next to her at the head table during two California fundraisers. George Clooney, the actor who hosted both events, called that an "obscene amount of money."
