    Dear Cardinal Spellman:
I am deeply appreciative of your telegram concerning the Cuban refugees and of your very generous contribution toward the efforts which America is making to deal adequately with the plight of these thousands of Cubans who have fled to our shores to escape oppression.
Mr. Tracy Voorhees, who is acting in this matter for me, has already told me of the inspiring work of the Diocese of Miami under Bishop Carroll and of the instant response of the National Catholic Welfare Conference under Bishop Swanstrom to his requests for action. May I ask that you express to them my gratitude for their important part in the traditional response of the United States and its citizens to such tragic situations.
With warm personal regard, in which Mrs. Eisenhower joins,
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
