    Dick Blum believed we could build a world that respected the rights and essential dignity of all people. As a businessman, a Regent of the University of California, a philanthropist, and an advocate for human rights, Dick dedicated his life to furthering that vision. Our nation and our world are better for his work.
Over the years, I always appreciated Dick's compassion and boundless energy.
Today, the Second Gentleman and I are holding Senator Feinstein and her family in our hearts and prayers.
