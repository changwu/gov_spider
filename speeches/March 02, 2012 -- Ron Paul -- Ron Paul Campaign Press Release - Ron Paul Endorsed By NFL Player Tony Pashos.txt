LAKE JACKSON, Texas — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul was endorsed today by Tony Pashos, a current Cleveland Browns offensive tackle and former First-Team All-Big Ten at the University of Illinois.
In making his public endorsement, Mr. Pashos issued the following statement:
"There is no doubt in my mind who I want for President. Ron Paul has displayed the kind of honesty, integrity, and character that nobody else can rival. I will no longer fall for a candidate's empty promises around election time nor take the excuses I am given as to why a candidate has changed his view or voted differently than originally stated.
"Ron Paul has shown me that you can still stand by the U.S. Constitution and deliver true wealth and economic freedom, safety, and the ability to live life without asking the government for permission. No matter what the punditry and lobbyists say, Paul has stood by our nation and the Constitution time and time again, even in times when it wasn't popular to do so.
"I endorse Ron Paul for President because he understands being a true leader isn't a popularity contest but about being held accountable. As a nation we have had enough, and it is time to give the people their government and country back. Ron Paul is a true inspiration for us all, and he is my candidate for president."
Mr. Pashos, the son of Greek immigrants, was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the fifth round of the 2003 NFL Draft and played college football at the University of Illinois.
Providing a strong boost to Ron Paul's Ohio organization, such endorsements present Ron Paul as the conservative alternative to Mitt Romney. They also demonstrate that the 12-term Congressman from Texas has the only campaign organization capable of maintaining a 50-state competition with the moderate-establishment Romney.
