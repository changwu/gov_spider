    Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale today issued the following statement:
"The arena in Minneapolis has been fully approved. The Target Center has backed off cancelling the contract, which means President Trump's Keep America Great rally will go on as scheduled. Consistent with our original agreement with the venue, the Trump campaign has not agreed to pay any additional funds. We look forward to seeing everyone Thursday night."
