    Former Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci issued the following statement today regarding Massachusetts' decision to set February 5th as its primary date:
"Mayor Giuliani's strong record fighting crime, cutting taxes and slashing spending is why Rudy has a great shot at winning Massachusetts on February 5th and in the general. Bay State Republicans know Rudy is the only experienced candidate in the race who doesn't just talk about getting results, but has actually achieved them."
Mayor Giuliani has the backing of key Massachusetts Republicans, including former Governor Paul Cellucci, former State Treasurer Joe Malone, former state GOP Chair Jim Rappaport, and three of Massachusetts' five Republican State Senators â€“ Senator Richard Tisei, the Republican Leader; Senator Michael Knapik; and Senator Bruce Tarr.
