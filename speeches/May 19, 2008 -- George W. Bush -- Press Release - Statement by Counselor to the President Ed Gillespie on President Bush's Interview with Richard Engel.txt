    NBC News responded to our objection to their editorial decision to misleadingly edit the President's interview with Richard Engel as aired on NBC Nightly News and The Today Show by noting it was available in its entirety on the MSNBC website. This misses the point.
While we appreciate that viewers can visit the MSNBC website to see how NBC News edited the interview to completely alter the nature of the President's answer, we know that most will not - it's simply absurd for people to have to log onto the internet and stream video to get accurate information from NBC News.
We also look forward to hearing their response to our additional concerns about their labeling Iraq as a "civil war", and if they have reason not to believe official economic data.
