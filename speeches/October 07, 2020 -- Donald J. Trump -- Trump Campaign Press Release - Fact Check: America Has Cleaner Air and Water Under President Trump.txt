    The Trump Administration is taking action to clean up America's environment.
Under President Trump, emissions of all key air pollutants have dropped since 2016, some by double digits. Since 2017:


Carbon Monoxide (CO) levels have fallen by 10% 

Average lead levels have fallen 28 

Ozone levels have fallen by 4% 

Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) has fallen by 4% 

Large particulates (24-hour) fell 22% 

Fine particulates (24-hour) fell 12% 

Under President Trump, the EPA has cleaned up 109 bodies of water through the Clean Water Act.


Since 2017, the EPA and its state partners have awarded nearly $20 billion for more than 4,500 clean water projects. 

In 2019, the EPA eliminated all or part of 27 sites from the "Superfund" list of serious hazardous waste sites, the largest number in fifteen years.


In four years, the EPA has deleted 82 superfund sites from the National Priorities List (NPL), more than double the number between 2008 and 2016
