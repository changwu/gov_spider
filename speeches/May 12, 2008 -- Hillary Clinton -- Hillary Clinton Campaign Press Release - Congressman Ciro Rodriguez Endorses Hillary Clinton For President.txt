    Congressman Ciro Rodriguez of Texas today announced his endorsement of Hillary Clinton for President. Congressman Rodriguez, who represents the 23rd Congressional District of Texas, is the second Democrat representing a highly competitive district to back Hillary today. Earlier, Congressman Chris Carney of Pennsylvania also endorsed Hillary.
"The voters of Texas' 23rd congressional district voted overwhelmingly for Senator Clinton in the Texas primary and I will respect their decision. I believe Hillary Clinton has the experience, vision, and toughness to win a general election and can help expand our Democratic majority in Congress. Not only can she win, I am convinced that she will be a truly great President," Congressman Rodriguez said. "In two areas of special importance to me, caring for our veterans and improving our schools, Hillary has been a real leader. I am happy to follow the clear choice of my constituents and support Hillary for President."
"Congressman Rodriguez knows what it takes to win in a competitive Congressional district and then make real changes in Washington that touch the lives of his constituents," Hillary Clinton said. "I am honored to have his support."
Congressman Rodriguez has been a passionate advocate for education since his years on the Harlandale school board and the Texas House of Representatives. He was first elected to Congress in 1997 and served with distinction on the House Veterans Affairs and Armed Services Committees, becoming a leading voice for servicemembers, veterans, and their families. He also served as Chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus of the House of Representatives during the 108th Congress. The 23rd Congressional District is the largest district in Texas, covering most of West Texas from San Antonio to El Paso.
