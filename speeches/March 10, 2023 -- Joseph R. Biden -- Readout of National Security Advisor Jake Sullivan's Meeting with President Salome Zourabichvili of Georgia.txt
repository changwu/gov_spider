    National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with President Salome Zourabichvili of Georgia. They discussed recent developments in Georgia, underscoring their countries' shared interest in Georgia's Euro-Atlantic integration. They talked about President Zourabichvili's advocacy for a unified and inclusive approach to achieving the reforms necessary to advance Georgia's candidacy for European Union membership. They also discussed their shared concern about draft legislation to register and stigmatize civil society organizations for receiving external funding, which could impede the important work of hundreds of Georgian NGOs working to improve their communities. They welcomed the government's recent decision to withdraw the two draft laws. Finally, they discussed the need to ensure Russia continues to feel the full economic costs of the sanctions, export controls, and other economic restrictions imposed by the United States and a coalition of over 30 allies and partners on Russia to hold Putin accountable for his war in Ukraine. Mr. Sullivan underscored the need for Georgia to avoid becoming an avenue for evasion or backfill.
