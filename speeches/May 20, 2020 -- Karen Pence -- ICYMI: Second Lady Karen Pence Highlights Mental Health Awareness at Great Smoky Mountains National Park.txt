    On Tuesday, May 19, Second Lady Karen Pence visited the Great Smoky Mountains National Park with Deputy Secretary of Interior, Katharine MacGregor, for the safe second phase reopening of the park to the public and ceremonial Clingmans Dome road reopening.
In recognition of Mental Health Awareness Month, Mrs. Pence talked about the benefits of the outdoors for people's mental health and emotional well-being, such as reduced stress, lessened anxiety, and lowered risk of depression. Additionally, Mrs. Pence thanked the park employees for their work to maintain the Smokies and applauded their efforts for reopening the park in a safe and responsible way.

 "The COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need to address our emotional well-being. Our new normal has caused stress and anxiety, but right now it's an opportunity to take this stigma away because everybody is feeling anxiety, everybody is feeling the stresses of being cooped up and inside. So, it's a perfect opportunity for people to feel comfortable coming forward." - Second Lady Karen Pence
