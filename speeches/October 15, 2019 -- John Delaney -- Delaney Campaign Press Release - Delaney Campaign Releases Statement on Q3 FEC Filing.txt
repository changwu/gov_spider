    FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD - Since there has been confusion in reading our FEC report in the past, related to loans Delaney made to the campaign, the Delaney campaign releases the following statement on its Q3 filing:
Since inception, the campaign has raised $2.4M from donors, self-funded $9.4M and has spent $11.5M.
The campaign will continue to have the resources available to run a robust campaign.
