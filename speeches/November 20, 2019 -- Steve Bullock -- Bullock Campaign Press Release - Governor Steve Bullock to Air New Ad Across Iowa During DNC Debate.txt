    Helena, MT – The Bullock for President campaign will air its newest ad across Iowa markets during tonight's DNC Debate. The ad, "Justice," centers on Governor Bullock's pledge to empower prosecutors to look into Donald Trump's actions after he leaves office.
Governor Bullock's background as Montana Attorney General will be on full display as voters across Iowa tune in to tonight's debate. Bullock knows that no one is above the law — that's why, as President, he'll empower prosecutors to follow the evidence all the way to the top.
Watch: "Justice"
"Justice"
World Series crowd chant: "Lock him up, lock him up."
Bullock: As a sitting president, Donald Trump can't be prosecuted. And the truth is, if he's re-elected, he never will be — because the statute of limitations will run out.
I'm Steve Bullock, and I won't promise to lock up my opponent. But as the only Democrat running who won a state Trump won, I will promise this: after I beat Trump, I'll empower prosecutors to follow the evidence all the way to the top.
I approve this message because no one's above the law.
