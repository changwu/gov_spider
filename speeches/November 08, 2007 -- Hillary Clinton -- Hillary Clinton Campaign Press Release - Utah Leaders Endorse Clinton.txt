"Hillary has the ability to begin rebuilding our image around the world and tackling our challenges at home from her first day in the White House," said former Utah Democratic Party Chair Donald K. Dunn.
"Hillary Clinton's strength and experience make her uniquely qualified to be President and create the change this country needs," said former State Senator Karen Hale.
"I'm honored to have the support of these respected community leaders," Clinton said. "With their help, we'll bring our message of change across Utah," Clinton said.
