    HOUSTON, Texas – Conservative leader and Christian college president Len Munsil today announced his support for Ted Cruz for President.
"At this point in the process, conservatives should unite around the most conservative candidate who can win, and that candidate is Ted Cruz," Munsil said. "Polls show Cruz would defeat Hillary Clinton, and Trump would lose badly. Polls also show Cruz would defeat Trump in a head-to-head matchup. Cruz has won multiple states, is closest to Trump in the delegate count, and is gaining after Super Saturday. The time is now for conservative Christians to rally around Ted, who gives us the best chance in decades of returning a Reagan conservative to the White House."
"Ted has a consistent 20-year record of fighting for life, marriage, religious liberty, the second amendment, border security and interior enforcement, and the Constitution," Munsil concluded. "Trump has recently been on the wrong side of all of these issues, and seemingly discovered conservative ideas only when he decided to run for president. Evangelicals should not be fooled, nor should we be on the sidelines in this pivotal election."
"I am honored to have the endorsement of such a respected conservative leader like Len and thrilled to have him on our team," said Cruz. "He has been one of Arizona's leading conservative voices for decades."
Len Munsil is the 6th president of Arizona Christian University, a regionally accredited liberal arts college in Phoenix, and was the Republican nominee for Governor of Arizona in 2006.
