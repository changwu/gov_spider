(Senate)
(Sen. Boxer, D-California, and 4 cosponsors)
The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 782. The bill provides the Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration (EDA) with important tools to help America's communities meet the challenges of innovation-led economic growth. However, the bill would authorize spending levels higher than those requested by the President's Budget, and the Administration believes that the need for smart investments that help America win the future must be balanced with the need to control spending and reduce the deficit. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact legislation that helps EDA enhance its mission of assisting America's distressed communities in forging partnerships with the private sector to create jobs.
