    Pursuant to the provisions of the Presidential Libraries Act of 1955, the President has accepted a proposal that a library to house the official records of his Administration be constructed at Texas A&M University. This decision follows an extensive review of the various library proposals by the Archivist of the United States, Don W. Wilson.
The library will be constructed on the campus of Texas A&M University at College Station, Texas. It will be financed through non-Federal funds, and will be administered upon completion by the National Archives and Records Administration.
