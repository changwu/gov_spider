    Earlier today, Vice President Biden hosted a conference call with Governors from across the country to discuss implementation of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The call came as the administration kicked off "Recovery Summer," a focus on the surge in Recovery Act infrastructure projects that will be underway across the country this summer. With thousands of road, bridge, rail, and other Recovery Act infrastructure projects breaking ground in the months ahead, the Recovery Act is on track to create or save 3.5 million jobs by the end of the year.
The following Governors participated on the call:

Governor Jennifer Granholm (D-MI)
Governor Sonny Perdue (R-GA)
Governor Pat Quinn (D-IL)
Governor Brian Schweitzer (D-MT)
Lt. Governor Jack Dalrymple (R-ND)
