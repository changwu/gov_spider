    "If President Obama is eager to talk about policies that are not working for women, he should examine his own failed economic record. After presiding over an economy where more women have struggled to find work than at any time in recorded history, the last thing President Obama is qualified to lecture on is how to get the economy moving again for America's women." —Gail Gitcho, Romney Communications Director
