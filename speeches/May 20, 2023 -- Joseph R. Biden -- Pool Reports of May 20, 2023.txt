Travel pool #6 - POTUS got debt negotiations update
From the White House:
At 10 AM local time this morning, President Biden received an update on the budget negotiations on Capitol Hill from his negotiating team.
Following that meeting, White House Communications Director Ben LaBolt released the statement below:
President Biden has made clear for weeks that Congress must act to prevent default. Earlier this week, the President met with the four Congressional leaders at the White House, where they agreed to move forward on a bipartisan budget framework. Following that meeting, the President assigned an experienced negotiating team and directed them to act in good faith to reach an agreement. But now, Republicans are taking the economy hostage and pushing us to the brink of default, which could cost millions of jobs and tip the country into recession after two years of steady job and wage growth.
Republicans are recycling a barely watered down version of their extreme budget proposal that would eliminate 100,000 jobs for teachers and support staff, cut 2,000 law enforcement positions and could put the health care coverage for millions of Americans at risk at the same time as Republicans would extend tax breaks for the wealthiest and corporations. The Republican position is especially galling given that the debt increased by 40%under President Trump and those same tax breaks cost taxpayers $2 trillion. And Republicans are even trying once again to reward tax cheats by gutting funding for the IRS.
Any serious budget negotiation must include discussion both of spending and of revenues, but Republicans have refused to discuss revenue. President Biden has lowered the deficit by $1.7 trillion in his first two years in office with this balanced approach and proposed a budget that would cut the deficit by an additional $3 trillion. Republicans, however, are focused on pulling the rug out from under hardworking Americans instead of considering the President's proposal to cut wasteful spending and cut the deficit by eliminating subsidies for oil and gas companies and pharma and asking the wealthiest to pay their fair share.
There remains a path forward to arrive at a reasonable bipartisan agreement if Republicans come back to the table to negotiate in good faith. But President Biden will not accept a wishlist of extreme MAGA priorities that would punish the middle class and neediest Americans and set our economic progress back.

Travel pool #8 - POTUS on debt talks
Pool returned to room at 2:26 pm.
POTUS and Albanese now in chairs before a backdrop with a G7 logo and American and Aussie flags.
POTUS took a few questions on the debt talks.
"Not at all," POTUS said when asked if he was worried about the debt talks.
More: "It's a negotiation. It goes in stages. And what happened is the first meetings weren't all that progressive, the second ones were, third one was and then what happens is carriers go back to principles and say this is what we're thinking about."
More: "I still believe we can avoid a default."
It was hard to hear POTUS. Pooler working on getting full quotes.
Biden also hushed an Australian reporter who was shouting questions at him while POTUS was talking about the debt negotiations.
"Shush up," POTUS said.
Ahead of the questions Biden and Albanese made opening statements. Quotes from those tk...

Travel pool #9 - more bilat details and POTUS quotes
President Biden, in his opening statement, apologized to Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for canceling his visit.
Biden: "I look forward to our conversation today and hosting you for an official state visit later this year in Washington DC."
Morw Biden: "I truly apologize to you for having to meet here instead of coming to Australia but we have a little thing going on at home."
Albanese: "I understand the circumstances that you're dealing with. I would have done exactly the same thing. All politics is really local."
Biden: "All politics may be local but our friendship is permanent."
And here is a transcript of the POTUS Q&A (massive thanks to rest of pool for their help with quotes):
A: Mr. President, how concerned are you, are you about the debt talks back home?
POTUS: Not at all.
Q: Are Republicans negotiating in good faith?
POTUS: This goes in stages,
Q: Mr. President --
POTUS: I've been in these negotiations before (Reporter talks) Shush up, okay. Thank you.
More POTUS: Um -- the uh it goes in stages. And what happens is the first meetings weren't all that progressive, the second ones were, the third one was and then what happens is the carriers go back to the principals and say this is what we're thinking about. And then people put down new claims. I still believe we'll be able to avoid a default and we'll get something decent done.

Travel pool #11 - Photo of G7 leaders and leaders of invited countries
The leaders started lining up at 5:07 pm for a photo spray. They came out a side door and held right off the spot where the family photo took place.
The leaders were called to line up by county so they could file in to take their proper spot on the riser.
POTUS was chatting with the president of the EU Council and didn't hear them call "United States." It was yelled a couple of times.
Then Canadian PM Trudeau shouted "Joe" and walked over to get him. POTUS moved to join the leaders on the riser.
Biden stood between Trudeau and French President Macron in the photo of G7 leaders and leaders of invited countries.
After the photos were taken, POTUS stayed to chat with Macron for a bit. They walked off the riser with their arms around one another.
Pool held while leaders made their exit, which took about 10 minutes as leaders lingered outside chatting to one another. It's a beautiful evening of 76 degrees with a slight breeze and the sun is starting to go down over rhe water.
POTUS was one of the last to leave - chatting with Macron and the president of the EU.
Photo spray took place at the same outdoor spot as this morning's family photo. The gun boats in the Hiroshima Bay are much bigger than the ones out this morning.
