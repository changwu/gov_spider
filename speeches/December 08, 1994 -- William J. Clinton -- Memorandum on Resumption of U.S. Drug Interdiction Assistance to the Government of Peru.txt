    Presidential Determination No. 95-9
Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of Defense
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 1012 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, Public Law 103-337, I hereby determine with respect to Peru that: (a) interdiction of aircraft reasonably suspected to be primarily engaged in illicit drug trafficking in that country's airspace is necessary because of the extraordinary threat posed by illicit drug trafficking to the national security of that country; and (b) that country has appropriate procedures in place to protect against innocent loss of life in the air and on the ground in connection with such interdiction, which shall at a minimum include effective means to identify and warn an aircraft before the use of force is directed against the aircraft.
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
