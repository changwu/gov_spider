    We need your help to fight Medicare fraud. Most health care providers are honest, but a few bad apples threaten the system. You can help us spot those bad apples by checking your Medicare records carefully. If you see questionable charges or services, call your doctor's office first, then call your Medicare representative. If you still have questions, call us at 1-800-HHS- TIPS. Fighting Medicare fraud is everybody's responsibility.
