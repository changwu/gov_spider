    Nancy and I are both saddened by the news of Benny Goodman's death, and we send our heartfelt condolences to his family.
Benny's swing music came to symbolize the new energy of 20th-century America, and it helped us all through the Great Depression. It was a new and uniquely American sound that was as fresh as the land that inspired it. We all miss Benny but will forever remember his contributions to American life and music.
