    The President today personally welcomed home Sarah Shourd, the American hiker who was detained for over a year by Iran. We share in the joy of Sarah’s family, friends and all Americans who have lent their support, prayers and hope throughout this horrific ordeal. In a meeting with Sarah and the mothers of the three hikers who were detained by the Iranian government, the President noted that this occasion remains bittersweet. Sarah’s fiance Shane Bauer and their friend Josh Fattal are still in detention in Iran. We remain hopeful that Iran will demonstrate renewed compassion and do the right thing by ensuring the safe return of Shane, Josh and all the other missing or detained Americans in Iran. We continue to salute the courage and strength of the Shourd, Bauer, and Fattal families, who have endured the unimaginable absence of their loved ones. We have gained strength from their resolve, and the President underscored that we will continue to do everything we can to secure the release of Shane and Josh.
