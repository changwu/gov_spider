    Gov. Rick Perry today released the following statement regarding President Barack Obama's speech to Congress:
"President Obama's call for nearly a half-trillion dollars in more government stimulus when America has more than $14 trillion in debt is guided by his mistaken belief that we can spend our way to prosperity.
"Like the president's earlier $800 billion stimulus program, this proposal offers little hope for millions of Americans who have lost jobs on his watch, and taxpayers who are rightly concerned that their children will inherit a mountain of debt.
"America needs jobs, smaller government, less spending and a president with the courage to offer more than yet another speech."
