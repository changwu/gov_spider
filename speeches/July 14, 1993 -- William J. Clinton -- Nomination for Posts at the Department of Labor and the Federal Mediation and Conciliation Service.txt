    The President announced his intention today to nominate Martin Manley to be the Assistant Secretary of Labor for the Office of the New American Workplace and John Calhoun Wells to be Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
"Martin Manley and John Calhoun Wells have both spent much of their lives trying to bring labor and management together in partnerships for growth," said the President. "That is exactly the kind of person that we need in these important positions. I am confident that they will bring that same spirit of cooperation to their work in my administration."
