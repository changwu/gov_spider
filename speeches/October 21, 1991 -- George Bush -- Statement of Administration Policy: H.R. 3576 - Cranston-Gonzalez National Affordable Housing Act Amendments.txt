    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Gonzalez (D) Texas)
The Administration has no objection to the intent of H.R. 3576 but has concerns regarding the formula that determines the set aside for insular areas under the HOME Investment Partnership Act. Based on the FY 1992 HOME appropriation, insular areas would receive $7.5 million under the bill as drafted.
Insular areas have been unable to spend smaller funding set- asides for other programs administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Therefore, the Administration would prefer that the set-aside in H.R. 3576 be the greater of (1) $750,000 or (2) 0.2 percent of the amount appropriated for each fiscal year.
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 3576 and will work to address its concerns in the Senate.
