Paul Krugman of the Fake News New York Times has lost all credibility as has the Times itself with his false and highly inaccurate writings on me. He is obsessed with hatred just as others are obsessed with how stupid he is. He said Market would crash Only Record Highs!Retweets: 20046Favorites: 82841

I wonder if the New York Times will apologize to me a second time as they did after the 2016 Election. But this one will have to be a far bigger & better apology. On this one they will have to get down on their knees & beg for forgiveness-they are truly the Enemy of the People!Retweets: 21611Favorites: 95066

In the 'old days' if you were President and you had a good economy you were basically immune from criticism. Remember 'It's the economy stupid.'

....Dumb and Sick. A really bad show with low ratings - and will only get worse. CNN has been a proven and long term ratings and beyond disaster. In fact it rewarded Chris Cuomo with a now unsuccessful prime time slot despite his massive failure in the morning. Only on CNN!Retweets: 17175Favorites: 78592
