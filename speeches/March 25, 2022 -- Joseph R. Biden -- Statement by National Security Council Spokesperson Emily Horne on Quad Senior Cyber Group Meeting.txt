    Australia, India, Japan and the United States recognize the need for improving cybersecurity in an increasingly digital world with sophisticated cyber threats. Improvements are particularly important in delivering the essential services of life, health and livelihood that are provided by critical infrastructure.
To deliver on the Prime Ministers' of Australia, India and Japan and the President of the United States' vision for a free, open and resilient Indo-Pacific, this week the Quad Senior Cyber Group met in Sydney for two productive days of discussions on opportunities to extend our cybersecurity cooperation and uplift cyber resilience and critical infrastructure protection in our region. This meeting resulted in a work plan to further collaboration between the members, and with partners and industry in the region to address our common challenges. The group will report back to Leaders through the established Quad processes.
