    President Biden's economic plan is working. New data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis shows that GDP rose in all 50 states and DC in Q1, as real GDP for the nation increased at an annual rate of 6.4% â€“ thanks largely to relief provided in the American Rescue Plan. This comes on the heels of data released earlier this week which showed personal incomes are also up in all 50 states and DC, and data released yesterday that showed initial unemployment claims continue to fall.
For example, in Arizona, GDP increased by 7.4 percent in the first quarter. And, in Wisconsin, personal income surged 67 percent at an annual rate in the first three months of the year.
GDP is up, personal income is up, unemployment insurance claims are down, and America is getting back on track. Thanks to President Biden's American Rescue Plan millions of Americans are getting back to work, the coronavirus is getting under control, and the economy is booming.
