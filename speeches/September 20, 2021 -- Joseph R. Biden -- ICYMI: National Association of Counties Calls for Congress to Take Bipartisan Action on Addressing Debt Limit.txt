    Today, the National Association of Counties (NACo) joined a growing list of state and local officials and private sector leaders to call on Congress to address the debt limit.
In a press release, NACo Executive Director Matthew Chase writes: "We urge bipartisan support for fiscal policies that strengthen the federal-state-local partnership and help us achieve our shared goals of keeping communities healthy, safe and vibrant."
The release highlights the importance of ensuring counties have uninterrupted access to fiscal resources. For example: "America's 3,069 counties support over 1,900 local public health departments, nearly 1,000 hospitals and critical access clinics, more than 800 long-term care facilities and 750 behavioral health centers."
"Additionally, counties own 44 percent of America's roads, nearly 40 percent of bridges, a third of the nation's airports and 78 percent of public transit systems."
