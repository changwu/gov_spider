    Vienna, Austria â€“ Today, Gil Kerlikowske, U.S. Director of National Drug Control Policy, issued the following statement regarding the appointment of Christopher Kennedy Lawford as United Nations' Goodwill Ambassador for Drug Treatment and Recovery:
"I am extremely pleased the United Nations has appointed Chris as Goodwill Ambassador for Drug Treatment and Recovery. For years, Chris has worked tirelessly to reduce the stigma associated with the disease of addiction, and to give a voice to the millions of Americans who struggle with drug and alcohol dependence. As someone in successful recovery from addiction, Chris will serve as a powerful advocate for the hope and strength drug treatment can provide to people across the globe who are suffering from this disease. I congratulate Chris and the United Nations' Office on Drugs and Crime for this appointment, and look forward to continuing our collaborative work to ensure we do everything possible to expand access to evidence-based drug treatment services and to provide dignity and support for those who are actively maintaining their recovery from addiction."
The Obama Administration is coordinating an unprecedented government-wide public health approach to reduce drug use and its consequences in the United States. This effort includes increasing funding for drug treatment programs by $99 million, increasing funding for drug prevention by $123 million, expanding access to substance abuse treatment, placing a heavier emphasis on early intervention programs and supporting the development of new medications to treat addiction and implementation of medication-assisted treatment protocols.
