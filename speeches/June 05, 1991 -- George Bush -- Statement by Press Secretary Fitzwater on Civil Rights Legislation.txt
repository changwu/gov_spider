    Although the President has indicated that the Democratic leadership's civil rights bill passed by the House of Representatives today is a quota bill that he intends to veto, we are gratified by the number of votes in opposition to the legislation. The 273 - 158 vote indicates strong support for sustaining a Presidential veto.
We are disappointed that the President's civil rights legislation was not approved Tuesday evening. It is a comprehensive bill that fights discrimination and offers the Nation the best chance to ensure equal opportunity in the workplace. The President remains hopeful that antidiscrimination legislation which does not produce quotas is enacted by Congress this year. We hope that the President's proposed legislation will receive more comprehensive consideration as this issue moves to the Senate.
