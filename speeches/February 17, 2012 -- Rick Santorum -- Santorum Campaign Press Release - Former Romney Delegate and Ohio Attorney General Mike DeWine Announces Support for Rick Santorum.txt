    Verona, PA - Republican Presidential Candidate Rick Santorum announced today the endorsement of former Romney delegate and Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine. Santorum made the announcement today on the steps of the Ohio Statehouse while campaigning in the Buckeye State.
In October, DeWine endorsed Governor Mitt Romney, but after closer scrutiny of Romney's record and campaign style, he decided to switch his support to Rick Santorum. DeWine said,
"To be elected President, you have to do more than tear down your opponents," DeWine said. "You have to give the American people a reason to vote for you -- a reason to hope -- a reason to believe that under your leadership, America will be better. Rick Santorum has done that. Sadly, Governor Romney has not."

"For some time now, it has been clear to me that Rick Santorum should be the Republican nominee for President," DeWine said. "To be frank, I've had some sleepless nights. I could not, in good conscience, be on record endorsing Governor Romney when I knew in my heart that Rick Santorum was the better candidate."

Rick Santorum said, "I'm proud and honored to have the endorsement of my friend and former Senate colleague," Santorum said. "Mike and I have a long history of fighting together for limited government and the sanctity of life - and I can think of no one who I'd rather be in this fight with than Mike."
Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine started his career as a County Prosecutor. He has held numerous offices on the state and federal level, including Ohio State Senator, four terms as a U.S. Congressman, the 59th Lieutenant Governor of Ohio, and was a two-term U.S. Senator, serving from 1995 to 2007. While in the U.S. Senate, he sat on both the Senate Judiciary and Select Intelligence committees. Mike and his wife, Francis, live in Cedarville Township and are the parents of eight children and grandparents of 17 grandchildren.
