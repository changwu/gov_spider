Every day members of the law enforcement community come to work prepared for anything. They understand that they are the thin blue line between a safe public and criminal activity — and each moment presents a new challenge.
...
Over the past few years' law enforcement has been missing a key component to succeed in their jobs — federal government support.
While law enforcement is asked to do more and more with the ever-changing world of terrorism and public safety, the current administration has rolled-back much of the progress achieved through decades of effective policing through qualitative and quantitative resourcing. In return the nation's crime rates have risen faster than at any time in our modern history.
...
While this administration's support is lacking, public support for law enforcement remains very high.
...
Law enforcement is gratified by the support and with a new executive branch administration comes new promise.
...
The Senate must confirm Sen. Sessions because law enforcement and the citizens they protect need his expertise, dedication and honor at the Justice Department.
The nation's sheriffs and deputies know Sen. Sessions will support them because throughout his career he has been a crime fighter who seeks justice fairly. As a U.S. attorney and Alabama attorney general, he successfully pursued and prosecuted violent criminals, corrupt politicians and white collar criminals.
...
He worked with Democrats and Republicans to pass important legislation like the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 that rectified disparities in sentencing for drug crimes and the Fugitive Sex Offenders Act in 2012 which helps law enforcement track down fugitive sex offenders.
He likewise worked in a bipartisan fashion to reauthorize the Victims of Child Abuse Act.
...
He understands that the immigration system is broken and law enforcement is stuck in the middle without a plan. Sen. Sessions agrees that jails should not be the home for Americas mentally ill and wants to work with law enforcement to reform the mental health system.
Sheriffs and deputies wake up each day knowing their lives may be in danger to keep our communities safe and protect the rule of law. They look forward to having an active ally in Attorney General Sessions to support them and do whatever necessary to make America safe.
