    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the G8 statement on global oil markets:
"The G8 is right. An increased supply of oil would help to promote economic growth, reduce prices, and strengthen our hand in confronting Iran. Unfortunately, President Obama has taken precisely the opposite approach and continues to stifle our domestic production and our access to Canada's resources, while looking to our strategic petroleum reserve each summer to make up the difference. But that reserve is for national emergencies, and his flagging campaign does not count as one. If he agrees that increased supply is good for America, he should take immediate action to approve the Keystone pipeline, accelerate production in the Gulf, and open new federal lands and waters for development."
