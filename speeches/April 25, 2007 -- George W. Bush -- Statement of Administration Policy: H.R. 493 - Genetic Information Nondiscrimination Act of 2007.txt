    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Slaughter (D) NY and 224 cosponsors)
The Administration favors enactment of legislation to prohibit the improper use of genetic information in health insurance and employment. The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 493, which would prohibit group health plans and health insurers from denying coverage to a healthy individual or charging that person higher premiums based solely on a genetic predisposition to developing a disease in the future. The legislation also would bar employers from using individuals' genetic information when making hiring, firing, job placement, or promotion decisions. The Administration appreciates that the House bill clarifies that the bill's protections cover unborn children.
The mapping of the human genome has led to more information about diseases and a better understanding of our genetic code. Scientists are pursuing new diagnostics, treatments, and cures based on this information, but the potential misuse of this information raises serious moral and legal issues. Concern about unwarranted use of genetic information threatens the utilization of existing genetic tests as well as the ability to conduct further research. The Administration wants to work with Congress to further perfect this legislation and to make genetic discrimination illegal and provide individuals with fair, reasonable protections against improper use of their genetic information.
