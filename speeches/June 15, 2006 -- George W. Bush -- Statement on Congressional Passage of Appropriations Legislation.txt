    I applaud those Members of Congress who came together in a fiscally responsible way to provide much-needed funds for the war on terror and continued Hurricane Katrina recovery, as well as for securing our border and protecting against a possible avian flu pandemic. Responding to these critical needs in a timely way is not easy, but it must be done if we are to fight terrorism, defend our homeland, enforce our borders, and fulfill our moral obligation to help our fellow Americans in need. I am pleased that Congress has addressed these urgent national priorities within the spending limits I set. House and Senate leadership and Chairmen Cochran and Lewis deserve great credit for working together to pass a fiscally responsible bill. The statement referred to H.R. 4939.
