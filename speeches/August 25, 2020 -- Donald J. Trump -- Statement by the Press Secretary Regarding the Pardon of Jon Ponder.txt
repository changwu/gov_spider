    Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Grant of Clemency (Full Pardon) for Jon Ponder. Mr. Ponder is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Hope for Prisoners, Inc., an organization he established after serving a 63-month sentence for several robberies. In prison, Mr. Ponder became a Christian and dedicated his life to helping other prisoners. Hope for Prisoners was born of Mr. Ponder's own journey to transform his life.
Hope for Prisoners is a re-entry program that assists former inmates as they work to reunite with their families, reenter the workforce, and rejoin the community. It is an intensive program designed to provide former inmates with the skills they need to succeed outside of prison. In addition to providing formerly incarcerated persons with professional development, character education, leadership skills, financial literacy, technology training, and other life skills, the organization also pairs them with mentors from law enforcement, the judicial system, the business community, and the faith community to aid their transition. Through an extraordinary partnership with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, Hope for Prisoners enlists police officers to help former inmates rebuild their lives. Since its founding, Hope for Prisoners has served thousands of formerly incarcerated persons in the Las Vegas area.
Numerous civic leaders from the Las Vegas area have expressed support for Jon Ponder. In addition, the State of Nevada granted a pardon to Mr. Ponder earlier this year.
Today, Jon Ponder is a source of inspiration for former inmates who desire to rebuild their lives when they leave prison. In light of these facts and in recognition of his contributions to improve the Las Vegas community, including his exemplary commitment to provide others with a better second chance, the President has concluded that Jon Ponder is deserving of this pardon.
