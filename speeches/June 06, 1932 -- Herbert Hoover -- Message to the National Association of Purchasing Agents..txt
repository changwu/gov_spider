    I WILL BE OBLIGED if you will express my cordial greetings and good wishes to your association as it gathers for its Seventeenth Annual Convention at Detroit. The increased need in recent years for sound judgment in all purchases of equipment and material has greatly enhanced the value and significance of the labors of American purchasing agents. Thus the purchasing agent today, whether employed by an industrial concern or by a governmental unit, is contributing to the advancement of our general economic well-being.
