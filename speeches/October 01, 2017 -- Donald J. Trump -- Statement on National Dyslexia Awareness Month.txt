    During National Dyslexia Awareness Month, we renew our efforts to support people with dyslexia and commit to gaining a deeper understanding of the disability. Dyslexia is one of the most prevalent language-based learning disabilities, affecting as many as one in five Americans.
Dyslexia is a brain-based learning disability that affects an individual's ability to read and process language. Undiagnosed cases of dyslexia can be detrimental to a young person's self-confidence, learning, and development. The failure to identify dyslexia early on can begin to create an achievement gap between dyslexic readers and their peers as early as the first grade. Too many young Americans with dyslexia do not receive the resources they need, resulting in lower rates of literacy and higher rates of dropping out of school, unemployment, and incarceration.
To help all Americans reach their full potential, my Administration is dedicated to working with schools and families to improve early identification of dyslexia and to deliver evidence-based solutions to children affected by the condition. Through continued research and work, our Nation will break down the barriers created by dyslexia and support these valued members of our society who are working to overcome this disability.
Melania joins me in encouraging Americans to learn more about dyslexia and to raise awareness of this disorder. Together, we will ensure that every person suffering from dyslexia reaches his or her full potential and has the opportunity to pursue the American Dream.
