    I am pleased today to sign into law H.R. 3, the "Veterans' Compensation Amendments of 1991."
Our Nation provides compensation and other monetary benefits to service-disabled veterans and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) benefits to the survivors of those who died as a result of military service to our country. My Administration is committed to ensuring that these payments keep pace with changes in the cost of living.
H.R. 3 provides a 5.4 percent increase in compensation and DIC benefits effective January 1, 1991. Nearly 2.2 million Armed Forces veterans and their dependents will benefit from this increase. In addition, the same increase will be provided for some 275,000 surviving spouses and 38,000 children who receive DIC benefits. These are survivors of some 300,000 veterans who either died in service to our country or as a result of service-connected disabilities. This bipartisan legislation bears witness that Americans now and always will keep faith with those who have given the full measure of devotion in defense of our freedoms.
Now more than ever, Americans are reminded that we owe a special debt to our veterans who have unselfishly placed their lives on the line and sacrificed so much in service to the Nation. Our existence as a Nation and the freedoms and liberties we enjoy, which are too often taken for granted, depend on the men and women in our Armed Forces. The measure I sign today demonstrates our gratitude and continuing commitment to those who have served our country.
