    SOUTH BEND, IN â€” Today, U.S. Rep. Kathleen Rice (NY-04), announced her endorsement of Pete Buttigieg for President, citing his ability to unify Americans behind the bold solutions we need to move our country forward:
"2020 is the most consequential election in our lifetime, and I want to fight for a candidate who represents me and my constituents, who can unite our country, and who has what it takes to defeat Donald Trump," said Rice. "For me, that candidate is Pete Buttigieg. Pete has demonstrated an unmatched ability and willingness to reach voters from across the political spectrum. He has introduced bold, yet commonsense policies that will address both our nation's long- and short-term challenges, and has avoided the divisive rhetoric that too often derails these important conversations. Pete represents the new voice and fresh perspective that our party and our country needs right now, and I'm proud to endorse him."
Rep. Kathleen Rice represents New York's 4th Congressional District, which covers parts of Nassau County, NY. She was first elected to Congress in 2014 and currently serves as the Chair as the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border Security, Facilitation, and Operations and as a member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. Rice began her career in public service as an Assistant District Attorney in Brooklyn, NY. In 2005, Kathleen ran for District Attorney of Nassau County, NY, where she defeated a 31-year incumbent and became the first woman elected District Attorney in Long Island history.
Rep. Rice's endorsement directly follows U.S. Rep. Pete Visclosky (D-Merrillville) announcing his support for Pete Buttigieg yesterday.
