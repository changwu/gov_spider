Senator Chuck Schumer has finally gone to the Southern Border with some Democrat Senators. This is a GREAT thing! Nearby he missed a large group of Illegal Immigrants trying to enter the USA illegally. They wildly rushed Border Patrol. Some Agents were badly injured....Retweets: 21570Favorites: 92370

....Based on the comments made by Senator Schumer he must have seen how dangerous & bad for our Country the Border is. It is not a 'manufactured crisis' as the Fake News Media & their Democrat partners tried to portray. He said he wants to meet. I will set up a meeting ASAP!Retweets: 19773Favorites: 96564

With almost no inflation our Country is needlessly being forced to pay a MUCH higher interest rate than other countries only because of a very misguided Federal Reserve. In addition Quantitative Tightening is continuing making it harder for our Country to compete. As good.....Retweets: 16949Favorites: 81109

....as we have done it could have been soooo much better. Interest rate costs should have been much lower & GDP & our Country's wealth accumulation much higher. Such a waste of time & money. Also very unfair that other countries manipulate their currencies and pump money in!Retweets: 13933Favorites: 69635

It is far more costly for the Federal Reserve to cut deeper if the economy actually does in the future turn down! Very inexpensive in fact productive to move now. The Fed raised & tightened far too much & too fast. In other words they missed it (Big!). Don't miss it again!Retweets: 13383Favorites: 56692

The Amazon Washington Post front page story yesterday was total Fake News. They said 'Advisors wrote new talking points and handed him reams of opposition research on the four Congresswomen.' Now really does that sound like me? What advisors there were no talking points....Retweets: 15717Favorites: 71971

....except for those stated by me & 'reams of paper' were never given to me. It is a made up story meant to demean & belittle. The Post had no sources. The facts remain the same that we have 4 Radical Left Congresswomen who have said very bad things about Israel & our Country!Retweets: 14384Favorites: 67133

The Mainstream Media is out of control. They constantly lie and cheat in order to get their Radical Left Democrat views out their for all to see. It has never been this bad. They have gone bonkers & no longer care what is right or wrong. This large scale false reporting is sick!Retweets: 25819Favorites: 99786

Highly conflicted Robert Mueller should not be given another bite at the apple. In the end it will be bad for him and the phony Democrats in Congress who have done nothing but waste time on this ridiculous Witch Hunt. Result of the Mueller Report NO COLLUSION NO OBSTRUCTION!...Retweets: 21725Favorites: 102300


 July 22, 2019 12:53:40
....But the questions should be asked why were all of Clinton's people given immunity and why were the text messages of Peter S and his lover Lisa Page deleted and destroyed right after they left Mueller and after we requested them(this is Illegal)?Retweets: 21711Favorites: 95541

The Report of Iran capturing CIA spies is totally false. Zero truth. Just more lies and propaganda (like their shot down drone) put out by a Religious Regime that is Badly Failing and has no idea what to do. Their Economy is dead and will get much worse. Iran is a total mess!Retweets: 21610Favorites: 82196

The 'Squad' is a very Racist group of troublemakers who are young inexperienced and not very smart. They are pulling the once great Democrat Party far left and were against humanitarian aid at the Border...And are now against ICE and Homeland Security. So bad for our Country!Retweets: 34598Favorites: 133213
