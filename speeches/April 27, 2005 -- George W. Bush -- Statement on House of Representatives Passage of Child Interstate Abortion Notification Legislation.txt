    I commend the House for its bipartisan vote to protect the health and safety of minors by ensuring that State parental involvement laws are not circumvented. The parents of pregnant minors can provide counsel, guidance, and support to their children and should be involved in these decisions. I urge the Senate to pass this important legislation and help continue to build a culture of life in America.
