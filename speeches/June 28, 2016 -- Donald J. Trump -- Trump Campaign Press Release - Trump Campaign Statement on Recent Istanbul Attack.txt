    Our prayers are with the families of those killed and injured in Istanbul. The whole world is stunned and horrified.
The terrorist threat has never been greater. Our enemies are brutal and ruthless and will do anything to murder those who do not bend to their will. We must take steps now to protect America from terrorists, and do everything in our power to improve our security to keep America safe.
