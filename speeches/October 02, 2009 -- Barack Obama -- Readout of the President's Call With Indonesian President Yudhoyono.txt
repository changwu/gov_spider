    After trying several times, without success, to reach him on Thursday, President Obama spoke this morning with Indonesian President Yudhoyono. The call lasted five minutes. The President expressed condolences for the loss of life and devastation caused by the earthquake in West Sumatra. He received an update from President Yudhoyono on the situation on the ground and reiterated his offer, on behalf of the United States, to do everything we can to help alleviate the suffering and provide assistance to the relief operation.
The two presidents plan to see one another again at the APEC Summit in Singapore in November.
