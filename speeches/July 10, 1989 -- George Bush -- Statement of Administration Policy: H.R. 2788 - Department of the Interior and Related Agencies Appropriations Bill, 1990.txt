    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Sponsors: Whitten (D); Mississippi; Yates (D), Illinois)
The Administration opposes H.R. 2788 as reported by the House Appropriations Committee.
While under CBO scoring H.R. 2788 would fall within the 302(b) allocation, we do not believe that CBO scoring reflects accurately the domestic discretionary spending levels in the bill. If CBO changed its scoring in ways we believe are appropriate under the Bipartisan Budget Agreement, the bill would provide domestic discretionary budget authority of $11,256 million, or $356 million more than the Interior Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation. It would also provide outlays of $10,547 million, or $197 million more than the 302(b) allocation. By this scoring, H.R. 2788 would cause a violation of the limits established for domestic discretionary spending as set forth by the Bipartisan Budget Agreement, unless other subcommittees report bills that provide domestic discretionary appropriations below their House 302(b) allocation.
The Administration is opposed to the provisions extending moratoria on Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) pre-leasing, leasing and exploration. The President has established an inter-agency task force to address congressional and public environmental concerns regarding three controversial lease sales scheduled for FY 1990. It would be inappropriate at this time, for the Congress to impose more OCS moratoria, or to prohibit activities designed explicitly to provide the kind of information that is needed to make environmentally sound decisons on drilling.
The Administration also opposes a number of other provisions, as outlined in the attachment.
The Administration urges the House to pass a responsible bill that (1) continues to fund essential programs, and (2) addresses satisfactorily the provisions opposed by the Administration.
