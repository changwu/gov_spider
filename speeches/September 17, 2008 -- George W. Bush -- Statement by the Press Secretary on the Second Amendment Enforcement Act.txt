    The President strongly supports the Second Amendment Enforcement Act, which the House today passed with broad bipartisan support. Congress's proposal guarantees the Constitutional rights of law-abiding individual Americans living in the District of Columbia to keep and bear arms. The President wants to sign the bill this year and urges the Senate to take action on the House-passed bill as quickly as possible to ensure that the residents of the District are able to exercise their Second Amendment rights in a robust and meaningful way.
