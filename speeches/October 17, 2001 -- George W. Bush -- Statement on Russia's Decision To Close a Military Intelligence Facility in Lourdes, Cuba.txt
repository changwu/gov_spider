    I welcome President Putin's announcement today that Russia will close its military intelligence-gathering facility in Lourdes, Cuba. This decision is another indication that the cold war is over. President Putin understands that Russia and America are no longer adversaries; we do not judge our successes by how much it complicates life for the other country. Instead, both nations are taking down relics of the cold war and building a new, cooperative, and transparent relationship for the 21st century.
I look forward to meeting with President Putin in Shanghai on Sunday, where we will work to deepen the Russian-American partnership.
