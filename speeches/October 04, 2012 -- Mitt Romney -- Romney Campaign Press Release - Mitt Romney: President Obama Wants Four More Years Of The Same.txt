MITT ROMNEY: "Look, it was a chance for each of us to describe our vision for the country. And the President talked about his vision, which was basically a continuation of the policies of the last four years. He wants another stimulus. He wants to have government investing for us. He wants to hire more government workers. He wants to raise taxes, as Vice President Biden blurted out today, they want to raise taxes by a trillion dollars. It's more like $2 trillion by our calculation. He has laid out the same policies he has been following for the last four years. And I don't think that sells very well when people hear that."
