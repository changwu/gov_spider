    Mount Pleasant, Iowa – On the second day of his 36-hour "Marathon for the Middle Class," Senator John Edwards delivered the following remarks at an event in Mount Pleasant, Iowa:
"There are people and corporations and powerful interests in Washington and all over this country who think their position in power on the top of the heap is inevitable and unchangeable. What I know is that when you rise up to take this country back for the middle class, you will be unstoppable."
After more than 24 hours on the road on his "Marathon for the Middle Class," John Edwards continues to pick up momentum as he heads through southeastern Iowa. The marathon across Iowa is giving Edwards a chance to talk to thousands of caucus goers about his plans to stand up to the powerful special interests and give hardworking middle class families a voice in Washington. Each hour, he is highlighting one specific policy initiative – a total of 36 steps to strengthen the middle class. Edwards will conclude the marathon tonight with a "This Is Our Country" rally in Des Moines with John Mellencamp.
