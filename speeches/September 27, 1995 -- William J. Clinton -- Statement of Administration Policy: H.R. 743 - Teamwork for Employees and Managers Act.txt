    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Gunderson (R) WI and 37 cosponsors)
The Administration supports workplace flexibility and high- performance workplace practices that promote cooperative labor- management relations. The National Labor Relations Act currently permits the creation of employee involvement programs that address workplace quality, productivity, and efficiency, with appropriate protections.
H.R. 743 would undermine these employee protections. The bill would allow employers to establish: (1) company unions where no union currently exists; and (2) alternative, company-dominated unions where employees are in the process of determining whether to be represented by a labor organization through a democratic process.
For these reasons, the Administration opposes H.R. 743. If the bill were presented to the President, the Secretary of Labor would recommend that it be vetoed.
