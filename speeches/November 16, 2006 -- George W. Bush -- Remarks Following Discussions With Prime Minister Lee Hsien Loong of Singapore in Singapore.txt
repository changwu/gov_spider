    Prime Minister Lee. Well, I have just a few words to say. I'm very happy to have President Bush here and visiting Singapore for the second time in 3 years. We've had a very good conversation on many issues. Our bilateral relationship is excellent. We've had a very good time talking about it. We discussed what was happening in the region, what's happening in the Middle East, what's happening all over Asia, our economic matters, as well as security issues, as well as terrorism.
And on many of these areas, we not only exchanged notes but found a significant degree of matching in our views. Maybe it's because we've exchanged views so many times and we know how each other think, but I think it's also because our interests are aligned. And Singapore is very happy that America has a stake in the region and is growing the stake in the region. And we would like to help this to happen and to ensure that this continues for a long time to come.
So welcome, sir.
President Bush. Mr. Prime Minister, thanks. Thank you for your hospitality, again. Laura and I feel very comfortable in your country, and we feel comfortable in your presence. You're right, we had a wide-ranging discussion. I always benefit when I get your advice and your counsel on the neighborhood. And I think America's presence in the Far East is very important for our own country. And therefore, when you share your thoughts with me, it makes it much easier for us to conduct wise foreign policy.
We've got a lot in common, particularly our desire to continue to promote free and fair trade, because your country has shown that open markets are capable of lifting up an entire people. And I congratulate you on your leadership, congratulate the people of Singapore for really being a model for the neighborhood.
And I'm looking forward to the dinner tonight that you're giving.
Prime Minister Lee. Thank you very much.
