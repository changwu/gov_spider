Administrations prior to that of President Reagan are not included for comparison purposes as those administrations occurred prior to the enactment of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. That law introduced financial disclosure requirements which have added significant time to the nomination process. Thus, the figures from administrations prior to that of President Reagan do not provide a meaningful comparison.
