SAN ANTONIO, TX (November 20, 2019) – On Wednesday, November 20, 2019, presidential candidate, former Obama Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Mayor of San Antonio, Texas, Julián Castro, trended on Twitter nationally during the Democratic debate in Atlanta as many of the issues he has led the field on were discussed on stage.

"Congrats to Julian Castro for winning this debate.," said journalist David Perry
