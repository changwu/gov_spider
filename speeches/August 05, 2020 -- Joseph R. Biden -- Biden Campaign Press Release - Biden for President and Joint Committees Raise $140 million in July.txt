    Biden's Summer Momentum Continues as Final Full Quarter of Fundraising Begins
Today, Biden for President (BFP), the Democratic National Committee (DNC), and their joint fundraising committees announced that they raised a combined $140 million in July and now have $294 million cash on hand, an increase of $50 million in the last month alone.
These figures continue the grassroots momentum that Biden's campaign is building across the country as it heads into the final full quarter of fundraising before the general election. Last month 97% of donations were from grassroots donors and the average online contribution was $34.77.
"The Biden campaign is on the march, building off the incredible momentum from this summer with another lights-out fundraising month, banking another $50 million for the final stretch to election day," said Jen O'Malley Dillion, Campaign Manager, Biden for President. "Fueled by our growing community of grassroots supporters, we are rapidly expanding our operations around the country to create many paths to the 270 electoral votes we need to defeat Donald Trump this fall and win the battle for the soul of our nation."
