Donald Trump was asked this morning about his promise weeks ago to announce a set of foreign policy advisors.
In the span of about six seconds, he offered three different answers: 
"Yes, there is a team."
"No, there's not a team."
"I'm going to be forming a team."

Since Trump said in August 2015 that he gets his national security knowledge from "watch[ing] the shows," he's dodged questions about his advisors at least seven times, by our count.
Marco, by contrast, has a set of highly qualified foreign policy experts who are advising him and supporting his candidacy.
As with so many issues, Trump talks tough on foreign policy but has absolutely nothing to back it up.
