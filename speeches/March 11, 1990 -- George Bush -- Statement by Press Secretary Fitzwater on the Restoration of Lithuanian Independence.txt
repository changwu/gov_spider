    The United States has never recognized the forcible incorporation of the independent states of Estonia, Latvia, or Lithuania into the U.S.S.R. We have consistently supported the Baltic peoples' inalienable right to peaceful self-determination.
The new Parliament has declared its intention to restore Lithuanian independence. The United States would urge the Soviet Government to respect the will of the citizens of Lithuania, as expressed through their freely elected representatives, and expects the Government of Lithuania to consider the rights of its minority population.
The United States believes it is in the mutual interest of Lithuania, the Soviet Union, and all CSCE countries to resolve this issue peacefully. We call upon the Soviet Government to address its concerns and interests through immediate constructive negotiations with the Government of Lithuania. We hope that all parties will continue to avoid any initiation or encouragement of violence.
