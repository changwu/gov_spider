    Earlier this evening President Obama called Missouri Governor Jay Nixon about the severe winter storm. The President asked for an update on the situation and for the status of emergency response efforts. He informed the Governor that he would be signing his request for federal aid and would declare a federal emergency. The President signed the declaration shortly after the call.
The President tonight declared an emergency exists in the State of Missouri and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local response efforts in the area struck by a severe winter storm beginning on January 26, 2009, and continuing.
The President's action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, and to provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures, authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act, to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in all 114 Missouri Counties and the Independent City of St. Louis.
Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide at its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. Emergency protective measures, limited to direct Federal assistance, will be provided at 75 percent Federal funding.
Nancy Ward, Acting Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Thomas A. Hall as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
