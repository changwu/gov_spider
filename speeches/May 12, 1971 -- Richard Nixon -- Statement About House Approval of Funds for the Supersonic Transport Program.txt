    I CONGRATULATE the House of Representatives for having very wisely reversed their earlier position on the SST, and I strongly urge the Senate to reconsider promptly its earlier vote.
The Congress has today taken an important first step on behalf of thousands of workers across the country who have been engaged in the SST program--and whose vital skills and experience might otherwise be lost to the Nation.
It has been a mark of America's greatness through the years that this Nation has been willing to explore the unknown, to maintain technological leadership, and, in so doing, to contribute enormously to the progress of civilization.
I reaffirm a pledge made earlier: that the SST will not be committed to production until all environmental concerns have been thoroughly satisfied. I hope the Members of the Senate will find persuasive the same considerations that moved the House, and that when it comes before them they also will give it their approval.
