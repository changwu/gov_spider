    Memorandum for the Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency
Based on a request submitted to me by the Governor of the State of Florida to extend my April 6, 1979 determination that a regional energy emergency exists in the State of Florida of such severity that a temporary suspension of certain particulate and opacity control regulations which apply to fossil-fuel fired electric generating plants under the Florida Air Quality Implementation Plan be necessary, and that other means of responding to the energy emergency may be inadequate, I hereby extend that determination from May 5 to June 4, 1979. This extension shall be effective for not more than thirty (30) days and is limited by the same conditions as my original determination. If, during the extension, I find that a regional energy emergency no longer exists in Florida, I will direct that this extension be rescinded and that all suspension orders issued by the Governor be terminated on the day of that rescission. You will continue to retain full authority to disapprove temporary suspension of regulations in Florida and to exercise your emergency powers authority under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act, when and if necessary.
It is important to keep suspensions to an absolute minimum since Section 110 (f) of the Clean Air Act limits each suspension to a maximum duration of 120 days.
This determination shall be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER.
