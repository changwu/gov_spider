    I HAVE today signed H.R. 12910 to establish a Judge Advocate General's Corps in the Navy.
This does not mean the Navy is hiring lawyers for the first time. Legal officers have served in the Navy for more than a century. More than 900 serve today in the Navy and Marine Corps.
This Act gives them a new professional status and organization. For the first time it creates a staff corps comparable to the Judge Advocate General's Corps in the Army and Air Force. It gives Navy lawyers the same professional recognition accorded to doctors, dentists, chaplains, and others who perform specialized duties.
At a time when the Navy's need for legal services is increasing, this measure will help attract and retain good lawyers.
I also note, for the better half of our population, that this Act--for the first time-permits women to serve as lawyers in the Navy.
