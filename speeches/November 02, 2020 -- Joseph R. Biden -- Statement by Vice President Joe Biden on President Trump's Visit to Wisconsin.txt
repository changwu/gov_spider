    As the coronavirus continues to surge, Wisconsinites are bearing the brunt of President Trump's failure to lead.
Back in February, President Trump knew the dangers of this virus. But instead of telling the American people the truth, he lied to us, froze, and tried to wish it away. And now, more than eight months into the pandemic, the President still has no plan to get the virus under control. We see the costs of President Trump's inaction in the families who will never again be whole â€” the empty chairs around dinner tables, the folks who've lost jobs and are barely hanging on.
When I'm in the Oval Office, I will stand with Wisconsin, and I will listen to the experts, trust the science, execute on my plan to get the virus under control, get our schools and small businesses safely back open, and speak the truth to the American people. There's so much at stake in this election, and that's why Wisconsinites have to get out and vote on Tuesday. Together, we can begin to restore the soul of this nation we all love.
