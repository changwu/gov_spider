    As Assistant to the President for Speech-writing, Bill McGurn has worked tirelessly to help communicate my agenda to the American people and the world. Bill is a serious thinker and a gifted writer whose command of language and knowledge of history have helped shape a wide variety of my speeches. I have counted on Bill to help me prepare State of the Union Addresses, policy announcements, and speeches to the Nation. In all our work together, I have valued Bill's creativity, insight, and sound judgment. And I have appreciated his friendship, generous spirit, and sense of humor.
As he moves on to the next stage of his career, Bill can be proud of his service at the White House. The son of a marine, Bill loves his country and has served it well. Laura and I have come to know Bill's wife Julie and their daughters Grace, Maisie, and Lucy, and we wish Bill and his family all the best.
I am pleased to announce that Bill's deputy, Marc Thiessen, will succeed him as Assistant to the President for Speech-writing. Marc has done superb work in the speechwriting office for more than 3 years. Before coming to the White House, he served as chief speechwriter to Secretary Rumsfeld. Marc is a talented writer and experienced communicator who will do an outstanding job in his new position. I look forward to continuing to work with him.
