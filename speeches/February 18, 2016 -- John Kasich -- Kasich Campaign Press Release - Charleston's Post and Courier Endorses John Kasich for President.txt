Gov. Kasich's record clearly recommends him as a proven leader who can push sound conservative principles forward while forging productive compromises with Democrats. He's also the only candidate in either party whose record includes impressive accomplishments both as a long-term federal legislator and as a second-term governor.

[. . .] Mr. Kasich sounds an optimistic tone. He points out that compared to the people of so many other nations, we Americans "don't have it bad." He adds that we could have it even better if we unite behind practical changes. As he said of our economic woes: "We can fix these things, and we will."
Still, Gov. Kasich also warns that the next president must come in ready to get those repair jobs started. As he said of the other candidates:
"If they don't have an agenda and know exactly what they're going to do, they're going to get crushed."
And if Republican primary voters in our state and across the land don't back the candidate with the best record of turning a truly conservative agenda into overdue changes, they're going to get disappointed — again.
So vote for John Kasich.
