Script For "Safe" (TV:30) 
JOHN MCCAIN: Only a fool or a fraud talks tough or romantically about war.
When I was five years old, my father left for war.
My grandfather came home from war and died the next day.
I was shot down over Vietnam and spent five years as a POW. Some of the friends I served with never came home.
I hate war.
And I know how terrible its costs are.
I'm running for President to keep the country I love safe.
I'm John McCain and I approve this message.
