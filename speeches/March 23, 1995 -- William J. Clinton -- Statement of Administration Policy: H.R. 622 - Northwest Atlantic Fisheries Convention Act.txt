    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 3/24/95)(Studds (D) MA and Young (R) Alaska)
The Administration supports H.R. 622.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 622 would increase receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary PAYGO estimate is zero.
