    On World Refugee Day, the United States stands with the more than 45 million people around the world who have been forced to flee their homes due to conflict and political violence.
This year, I want especially to thank countries and communities working to meet the needs of those who have fled the ongoing violence in Syria. In word and deed, countries like Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, and Egypt have taken on extraordinary burdens as they host people displaced by horrific violence. We are grateful for their generosity and pleased to support their efforts in addressing this humanitarian crisis.
Today we reaffirm our commitment to working with the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and our partners and allies to protect and assist all those displaced as they work to rebuild their lives in peace and dignity.
