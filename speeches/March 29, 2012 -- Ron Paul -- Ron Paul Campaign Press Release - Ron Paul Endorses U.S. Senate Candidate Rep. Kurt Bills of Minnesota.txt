LAKE JACKSON, Texas — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul endorsed today Minnesota State Rep. Kurt Bills, candidate for U.S. Senate. Rep. Bills, an advanced economics professor who eschews the label of career politician, is a family man, wrestling coach, involved community member, and man of integrity.
"Rep. Kurt Bills is the precisely the kind of Republican who can defeat incumbent Senator Amy Klobuchar. He appeals to both conservatives and independents with his support for balanced budgets, free markets, civil liberties, and a commonsense foreign policy," said Ron Paul.
"I am proud to wholeheartedly endorse Kurt Bills for United States Senate and hope all of my friends and supporters will help him go all the way to Washington," added Dr. Paul.
Kurt Bills is a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives. While serving in the Minnesota Legislature, he continues to teach economics at Rosemount High School each morning before heading to the capitol building. His teaching duties over the last 15 years include advanced courses in micro and macroeconomics, and American government and politics.
Kurt and his wife, Cindy, have been married for 17 years and are parents of four children ranging in age from five to 14. Kurt and Cindy also own and operate a home daycare. The Bills family is active in their church community as members of Christ Church in Apple Valley, Minnesota.
