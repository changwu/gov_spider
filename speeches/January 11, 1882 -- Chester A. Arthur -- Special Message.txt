    To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a communication from the Secretary of the Interior, with draft of a bill and accompanying papers, in reference to an agreement by the Shoshone and Bannock Indians with the United States for the disposal of certain of their lands in the Fort Hall Indian Reservation, in Idaho, for the use of the Utah and Northern Railway.
The matter is commended to the careful consideration of Congress.
CHESTER A. ARTHUR
