    U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.) released the following statement today regarding Missouri's upcoming presidential caucuses:
"As we saw during last night's primaries, Mitt Romney's plan to help put people back to work and rein in out-of-control spending is resonating with voters nationwide. Thanks to his experience as governor and in the private sector, Mitt Romney is clearly the best prepared candidate to help put America back on a path to economic prosperity.
"In a few weeks, Missourians will make their choice during our state caucuses. I'm proud to support Governor Romney's bold agenda to jumpstart our nation's economy, and I urge my fellow Missourians who are looking for a fiscally responsible leader to support his candidacy for president."
