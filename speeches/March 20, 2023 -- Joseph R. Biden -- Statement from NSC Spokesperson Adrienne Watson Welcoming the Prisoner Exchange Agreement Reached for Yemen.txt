    The United States welcomes today's announcement in Geneva of a major prisoner exchange agreement by the parties to the Yemen conflict. Under the deal, 887 detainees related to the war will be released by all sides. This important step builds on the positive environment created by a truce in Yemen that has effectively stopped the fighting for the past 11 months. We thank UN Special Envoy for Yemen Hans Grundberg and the International Committee of the Red Cross for their hard work finalizing the agreement. Over the past year and thanks to active and persistent U.S. diplomacy, Yemen has seen the lowest level of violence since the war began over a decade ago. We remain committed to building on this work to advance a durable resolution to the conflict.
