  A Proclamation

The economy of the United States, in the midst of one of the longest sustained periods of growth since World War II, is creating a record number of new jobs. More Americans are at work now than ever before. Technological advances in all areas of American industry are contributing not only to the growth in the number of jobs, but to sustained growth in productivity. The dynamic changes occurring in our own marketplace as well as in the global economy will place an even greater emphasis on the development of new job skills.
One of America's greatest competitive assets is the high quality and productivity of its work force. It is appropriate, therefore, that Americans have come to understand the changes that are underway in the workplace and the demands these developments are generating for new skills. In order to focus national attention on the role of job training efforts in maintaining a competitive work force, the Congress adopted House Joint Resolution 721 designating the week of October 12 through October 18, 1986, as "National Job Skills Week."
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of October 12 through October 18, 1986, as National Job Skills Week, and I urge all Americans and interested groups to observe this week with appropriate programs and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.

RONALD REAGAN
