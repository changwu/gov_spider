The administration recommends that H.R. 1612 not be considered under suspension of the rules and that it be amended to:
— Authorize appropriations for the U.S. Geological Survey consistent with the 1988 budget request: $32,540,000 for FY 1988 and $33,679,000 for each of fiscal years 1989, 1990, and 1991 (instead of $36,540,000 for FY 1988, $37,819,000 for FY 1989, $39,142,000 for FY 1990, and $40,512,000 for FY 199l);
— Authorize appropriations for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) consistent with the 1988 budget request: $5,313,000 for FY 1988 and $5,322,000 for each of fiscal years, 1989, 1990, and 1991 (instead of $5,778,000 for FY 1988, $5,788,000 for FY 1989, $5,798,000 for FY 1990, and $5,808,000 for 1991); and
— Delete section 5, which would prevent FEMA from conforming State matching and cost sharing requirements under the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act to those which prevail under other emergency preparedness programs administered by FEMA.
