    In light of Democrat Presidential Candidate Pete Buttigieg's recent blunder with the black community, through the unveiling of his "Douglass Plan," Campaign Senior Advisor, Katrina Pierson issued the following statement:
"Under the Trump Administration, the Black community has seen historic levels of economic growth and advancement. We have seen historically low black unemployment, a reformed criminal justice system, and a 14 percent increase in funding for HBCUs; all thanks to President Trump. Mayor Pete's 'Douglass Plan' is not only named after America's most prominent Black Republican but also is incredibly misleading and presumptuous. His lack of awareness to the current state of the black community, the historical figure his 'plan' is named after, and inability to get real support from blacks in South Carolina shows how out of touch he is. Presidents don't talk, they act. What have you done for the black community in your city, Pete?"
