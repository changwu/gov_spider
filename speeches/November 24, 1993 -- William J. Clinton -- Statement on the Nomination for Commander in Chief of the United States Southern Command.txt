    I am pleased to announce that I have nominated Lt. Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey to succeed Gen. George A. Joulwan as Commander in Chief of U.S. Southern Command and for promotion to the rank of General, United States Army.
Lieutenant General McCaffrey has had a long and brilliant career spanning nearly three decades. He has served our Nation proudly in four combat tours and in seven foreign nations. As commanding general of the 24th Infantry Division, he deployed the division to Saudi Arabia and led it on combat missions essential to the success of Operation Desert Storm. In addition, his performance in sensitive and demanding staff positions in Washington, including his current role as Director for Strategic Plans and Policy, Joint Staff, has distinguished him as one of our Nation's foremost military analysts and strategists. He has fully demonstrated both the military expertise and political acumen needed to fill one of our most strategically important postings.
I have asked Lieutenant General McCaffrey to apply his considerable talents to enhancing the important security relationships we have developed with our neighbors in the region, to refining the role of the U.S. Southern Command in hemispheric affairs, and to continuing the outstanding work done by General Joulwan. I have the utmost trust and confidence in his ability to do so.
