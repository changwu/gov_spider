    I AM DEEPLY interested to learn of the wish of the Dental Society of the State of New York to cooperate in furthering the ideals set forth by the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection by emphasis upon the dental care of children and especially the preschool child. I will be obliged if you will express to the Society my deep appreciation of their cooperation in this great work in behalf of our most precious National asset.
