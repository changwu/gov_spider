In-town pool report #2: Church in Georgetown
POTUS is attending mass in Georgetown, where he arrived at 5:32 p.m. He walked in and waved to a small crowd nearby that cheered. Flagging that this was not originally on the schedule for today.
Motorcade left the White House grounds at 5:22 p.m. It was a chill ride here, the weather’s nice and in the high sixties here in Washington.

In-town pool report #6: first color dispatch from WHCD
POTUS and FLOTUS took their seats at the head table at 9:28 p.m. as the program started. They were greeted with a standing ovation.
We arrived to a very crowded venue as dessert was being served. The vast majority of people are unmasked, though a few people here and there, including many of the people serving food, do have them on.
For context, this large, indoor gathering is happening as members of the administration, including Vice President Kamala Harris, tested positive for COVID in recent days. It's happening despite Anthony Fauci deciding he wasn't willing to take the risk of attending. And it's happening in the wake of dozens of people reportedly testing positive after the Gridiron Dinner, another Washington-establishment event, earlier this month.

In-town pool report #7: more color from WHCD
POTUS started speaking at 10:07 p.m. EST to a standing ovation. He hasn't worn a mask leading up to this.
As award winners were announced and came out on stage to be recognized, Biden stood and shook their hands. He joined a standing ovation for the Dunnigan-Payne for lifetime achievement award, and another after the in memoriam video played.
Passing on the below seating chart via a White House aide:
"Seated to the President's right:George Cheeks, CBS News President and CEOThe First LadyTrevor Noah, Host of the Daily ShowKaren Travers, ABC White House CorrespondentJustin Sink, Bloomberg White House Correspondent

In-town pool report #8: final dispatch from WHCD
POTUS remarks wrapped up at 10:20 p.m. EST. He spoke for under 15 minutes. Won't quote him here since it was streamed, but biggest laugh seemed to be in response to his Fox News joke early on in his remarks. No hecklers during his speech.
He introduced Trevor Noah and returned to his seat. POTUS continued not wearing a mask for the rest of the time he was at the head table.
Noah opened with a very good question for the room: "Do any of you read any of your own newspapers?" Joked this is the most distinguished super-spreader event in the country.
