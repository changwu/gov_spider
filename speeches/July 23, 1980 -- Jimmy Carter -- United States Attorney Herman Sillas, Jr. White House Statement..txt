    The matter of the continued service of the prosecutor referred to in the annual report of the Office of Professional Responsibility continues to be under review by the Counsel to the President. After fully evaluating Department of Justice recommendations concerning the prosecutor, the Counsel will make a recommendation to the President. We have been evaluating the Department of Justice's recommendations in light of materials submitted by the counsel to the prosecutor and the Department's responses to those submissions.
The issues involved in this matter are difficult and complex. Primary concerns of the President's Counsel, since beginning his evaluation of this case, have been to protect the integrity and public reputation of the office of the United States attorney, while at the same time affording the prosecutor and his own legal counsel a fair opportunity to present his side of the matter.
Everything we have done in connection with this matter has been in consultation with the office of the Deputy Attorney General. The process is still underway, although we expect it to be completed shortly. It would be inappropriate to make any further remarks on this matter at this time.
