    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ John Edwards for President campaign spokesperson Mark Kornblau released the following statement in response to tonight's Republican presidential debate.
"John Edwards will fight and stop terrorists with a strong, smart national security policy that is focused on the mission of protecting Americans, not using bumper-sticker slogans for political advantage. According to his own Administration, George Bush has made America less safe, but the Republican candidates are still tripping over themselves to be just like him. Bush's failed foreign policy has left us with more terrorists and fewer allies. The "Global War on Terror" isn't an anti-terror strategy; it's a political sledgehammer the Republicans use to shut down debate and justify their ideological agenda."
