    Since taking office, I have relied on Louisa Terrell's wise counsel and tireless engagement with our Nation's legislators, and she has delivered for the American people. I am pleased to announce that Shuwanza Goff, a day 1 member of my team, will serve as my new Director of Legislative Affairs and help finish the job.
Shuwanza is a proven leader and trusted voice on both sides of the aisle. She returns to the White House with strong relationships across both Chambers, forged over more than a decade on Capitol Hill.
As my Deputy Director of Legislative Affairs, Shuwanza helped pass monumental pieces of legislation through Congress: from the American Rescue Plan and the bipartisan infrastructure bill, to the Chips and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.
Shuwanza's close partnership with my decades-long friends in the House and Senate and her expertise, instincts and deep respect for the United States Congress will continue to serve our administration and the American people well.
