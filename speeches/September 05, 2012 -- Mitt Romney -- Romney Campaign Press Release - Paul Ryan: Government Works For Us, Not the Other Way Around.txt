BRIAN KILMEADE: "Chairman, I heard a lot about spending. I heard a lot about government programs. In fact, one of the statements was and one of the beliefs amongst the same theme through all the speakers was, we all only belong to one thing and that is government. We saw Governor Mitt Romney's tweet to that saying, we don't belong to government. The government works for us essentially. What's your reaction?"
PAUL RYAN: "That's exactly what I would have said, which is the government works for us. Not the other way around. But this is in perfect keeping with President Obama's philosophy of a government-centered society, of a government-driven economy. And so it doesn't really surprise me that they say this. It also kind of gives us a glimpse, Brian, of what a second term would look like if President Obama got one."
