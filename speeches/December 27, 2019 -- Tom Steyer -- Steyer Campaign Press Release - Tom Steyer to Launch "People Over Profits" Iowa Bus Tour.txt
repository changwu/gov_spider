    Steyer will make the case that he is the best candidate to go toe-to-toe with Trump on the economy
(Des Moines, IA, December 27, 2019) â€“ Presidential candidate for the Democratic nomination Tom Steyer will be starting the new year by traveling through fifteen counties in Iowa on his "People Over Profits" bus tour, starting in Council Bluffs and ending in Newton. Steyer was recently in Iowa City where he laid out his economic agenda to leverage his decades of experience building a successful business from the ground up and understanding global markets coupled with his success taking on corporate power at the ballot box to reform our system of unchecked capitalism and create nationwide prosperity.
This bus tour is about talking with Iowans about their economic frustrations and future. Steyer will lay out how we can revitalize the rural economy, organize together to take on the corporations that have bought the government, ensure economic justice by undoing the purposeful exclusion of communities of color from wealth building, and build a green economy that saves the planet and creates well paying union jobs. Iowan and senior advisor to the Steyer campaign, Zack Davis said this about the bus tour:
"Tom has demonstrated time and time again that he is ready to take on the tough fights that lay ahead. Whether it's giving rural communities the tools they need to lead on climate or creating a green economy that revitalizes whole communities while saving the planet, Tom has unmatched experience, success, and passion on creating an economy that works for all people. Iowans are sick of a fake businessman who has gone back on too many promises and ruined too many livelihoods. Throughout this tour, Tom will engage directly with Iowans, meeting them where they are, and demonstrating that the way to break the corporate stranglehold on our democracy is to put people over profits."
The route of the bus tour is:
Jan 1: Kickoff in Council BluffsJan 2: Logan, Manning, Onawa, Sioux CityJan 3: Sheldon, Spirit Lake, Algona, Fort DodgeJan 4: Hampton, Mason City, New Hampton, WaterlooJan 5: Marshalltown, Newton
