    President Donald J. Trump held a productive meeting with more than 30 members of the House Freedom Caucus in the Cabinet Room today to discuss the building momentum toward repealing and replacing Obamacare. Members of the House Freedom Caucus thanked the President for engaging with them throughout the negotiations. The President thanked the group for their willingness to work closely with the White House and their colleagues in Congress to craft the strongest possible bill. The group agreed that their ultimate goal is to implement a system that will drive down costs and increase access to healthcare for millions of Americans. This meeting was a positive step toward that goal. The President will also be meeting with the Tuesday Group later this afternoon and looks forward to further discussing our efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare.
