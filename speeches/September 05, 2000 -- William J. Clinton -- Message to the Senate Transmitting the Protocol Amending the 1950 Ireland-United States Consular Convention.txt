    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the Senate's advice and consent to ratification, the Protocol Amending the 1950 Consular Convention Between the United States of America and Ireland, signed at Washington on June 16, 1998. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol.
The Protocol expands the scope of tax exemption under the 1950 Consular Convention Between the United States of America and Ireland to provide for reciprocal exemption from all taxes, including Value Added Taxes (VAT) on goods and services for the official use of the mission or for the personal use of mission members and families. The amendment will provide financial benefit to the United States, both through direct savings on embassy purchases of goods and services as well as through lowering the cost of living for United States Government employees assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Dublin.
Because the Protocol will achieve long-term tax exemption on the purchase of goods and services for our embassy and personnel in Ireland, I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
