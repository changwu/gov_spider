    Since the Proliferation Security Initiative was launched in Krakow, Poland, 2 years ago, nations around the world have been cooperating to develop new and dynamic approaches to stop the global trafficking of weapons of mass destruction. To counter proliferation networks, we are working in common cause with like-minded states prepared to make maximum use of their laws and capabilities to deny rogue states, terrorists, and black marketeers access to WMD-related materials and delivery means.
Today, more than 60 countries are supporters of the PSI. Its global reach continues to expand, most recently by endorsements from Argentina, Georgia, and Iraq. The goals of PSI have been endorsed by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 1540.
Through training exercises involving military, law enforcement, customs, intelligence, and legal experts, many PSI partners are developing new tools to improve their national and collective capacities to interdict WMD and related shipmentsâ€” whether on land, at sea, or in the air.
On this foundation, PSI partners are building a record of success by stopping the transshipment of WMD-related materials, prosecuting proliferation networks, and shutting down front companies trafficking in WMD materials.
I urge all responsible states to join this global campaign by endorsing the PSI Statement of Interdiction Principles and by committing to work to end the security threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
