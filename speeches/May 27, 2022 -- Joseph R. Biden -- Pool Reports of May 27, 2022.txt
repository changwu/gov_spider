Print pool report #4: Color from the stadium
Some color from the Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium:
The graduating class is seated in rows of white folding chairs on the stadium grounds facing the stage. Family, friends and other spectators are seated in the stands, which are mostly full.
The skies are overcast and there's an occasional breeze, but no rain so far.
The ceremonies will be live streamed on the White House website, so your pooler will not be sending a feed from POTUS' remarks.

Out-of-town pool report #8: Presentation of diplomas
More color from the ceremony:
The sun broke through the clouds briefly and a light breeze blew as Marine Corps selectees rose from their seats, raised their right hands and swore to support and uphold the Constitution during their commissioning ceremony. A few minutes later, Navy selectees stood and took their oath of office. POTUS remained on stage during the ceremony.
At 11:19 a.m., POTUS began presenting diplomas to the distinguished, top 100 graduates. One by one, they walked across the stage as their names were called over the loudspeakers. POTUS handed diplomas to each graduate, shook their hands and spoke with each for a few seÂ­conds. Pool was seated too far from the stage to make out any of their conversations.
Afterward, POTUS began receiving the rest of graduates, who walked to the center of the stage one by one. POTUS shook their hands and patted a few on the shoulder or the elbow. The graduates then were handed their diploma from a receiving line that included Secretary Del Toro, Vice Admiral Buck, Admiral Gilday, General Berger and Colonel McDonough. Some of the graduates held their diplomas up in the air as they exited the stage.
The presentation of diplomas is still under way.
