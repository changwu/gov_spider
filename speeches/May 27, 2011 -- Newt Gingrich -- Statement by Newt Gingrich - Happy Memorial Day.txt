    During one of the darkest hours of the American Revolution, Thomas Paine wrote "Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as FREEDOM should not be highly rated."
Memorial Day is an opportunity to reflect upon the precious nature of the remarkable freedom we enjoy as Americans, and of the enormous sacrifice which has been necessary to preserve this way of life throughout our history.
On Friday, I was very fortunate to meet several members of America's armed forces at the airport in Columbia, SC, before they departed for deployment. The courage and consummate professionalism of these brave men and women was inspiring.
This weekend, as we relax with family and friends, please take a moment to say a prayer for the brave men and women stationed across the world, putting their lives at risk to defend our freedom from those who would do us harm.
