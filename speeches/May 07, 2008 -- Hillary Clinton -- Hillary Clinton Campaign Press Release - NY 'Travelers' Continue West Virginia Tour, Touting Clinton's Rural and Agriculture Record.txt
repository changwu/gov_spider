    Farmers Campaign Today in Fairmont, Clarksburg, Grafton, Weston, and Parkersburg
Charles Town, WV â€“ Urging rural West Virginians to vote for the presidential candidate who can best expand opportunities for agriculture and rural America, a pair of New York 'travelers' has been traveling across the Mountain State this week to promote the success of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's (D-NY) rural and agricultural initiatives in New York State. Today, the travelers continue their trip to West Virginia, making stops in Fairmont, Clarksburg, Grafton, Weston, and Parkersburg today.
The travelers, made up of a New York hay and beef farmer, a county president of New York Farm Bureau and a former National Farmer's Union adviser, are reaching out to farmers and rural residents and making stops in West Virginia to promote Clinton's positive impact in New York.
These advocates are part of a larger "Travelers for Hillary" group made up of more than 100 farmers, wine growers, rural and economic developers from upstate New York. The group has already toured Iowa, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, North Carolina and Oregon on behalf of Clinton.
Hillary is committed to expanding opportunities for rural communities and small towns in America. As a Senator, she has fought hard to maintain programs in resource conservation, economic development and agriculture that are vital to the environmental and economic health of family farms. From her creation of rural trading cooperatives (e-commerce initiatives), to her Farm-to-Fork initiative, to her efforts to create better access to credit and capital for business entrepreneurs, to her support for broadband in all rural areas, and her efforts to keep VA facilities open, Hillary is dedicated to helping small towns and rural communities thrive.
