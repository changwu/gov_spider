    Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee announced today that state Representative Stephen Stepanek has endorsed Mayor Giuliani for President. Stepanek serves as the Republican Whip in the New Hampshire House.
"I am a conservative New Hampshire Republican who supports Rudy for President," said Stepanek. "As Mayor, Rudy stood strong for the conservative principles of low taxes, less spending and small government. Here in New Hampshire we pride ourselves on fiscal discipline. His record of cutting taxes 23 times, turning a $2.3 billion deficit into a multi-billion dollar surplus and scrapping nearly 20% of city bureaucracy is the strongest in the GOP field."
"Representative Stepanek's endorsement helps bolster Rudy's New Hampshire campaign as we move closer to Primary day," said Wayne Semprini, Giuliani's Granite State Chairman. "Securing the backing of a legislative leader like Stephen Stepanek reflects the growing support for Rudy that we're seeing in towns across the state. We look forward to working with him as we spread the Mayor's message in Amherst and across New Hampshire."
Stepanek hosted a house party for Rudy on Sunday during the Mayor's two day swing through the Granite State.
