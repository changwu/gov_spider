    Senator Hillary Clinton released the following statement commending TPI Composites' plan to build a new wind turbine blade manufacturing plant in Newton, IA:
"I applaud today's announcement because developments like these are the blueprint for America's clean energy future. The facility will create 500 new, good paying jobs in the same city that just suffered the devastating loss of the Maytag plant.
"I recently unveiled a bold and comprehensive plan to address America's energy and environmental challenges by establishing a green, efficient economy that would generate at least five million new jobs. The jobs created by this new development in Newton are exactly the kind of jobs we need to create across Iowa and America.
"It is plants like this - rooted in American ingenuity - that will create the model economy for the 21st Century. I envision the 21st Century economy with the new, good jobs essential to broad-based prosperity, fairness and built around the basic bargain that if you work hard, you can get ahead.
"Today in Newton, Iowa we took an impressive step towards a renewed 21st century economy and as President I will continue efforts like this here and across the country."
