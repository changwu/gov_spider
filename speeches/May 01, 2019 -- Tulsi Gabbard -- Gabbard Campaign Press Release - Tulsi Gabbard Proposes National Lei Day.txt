    WASHINGTON, DC â€” Tulsi Gabbard, Hawaii congresswoman and presidential candidate, is proposing a national Lei Day on May 1st. A lei is a flower garland, traditionally given as a gesture of unity and friendship. Lei Day has been celebrated annually in Hawaii since 1928.
Tulsi Gabbard said, "Join me in sharing aloha-respect and love for others-by giving a lei to a loved one, neighbor, or friend. A lei symbolizes the peace and harmony our country and world so badly need. It's Lei Day in Hawaii-and as president, I'll propose a national Lei Day to help unite our divided country."
