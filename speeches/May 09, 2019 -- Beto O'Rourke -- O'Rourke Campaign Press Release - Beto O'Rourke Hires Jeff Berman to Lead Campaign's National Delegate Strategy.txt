    EL PASO, TEXAS â€” Today, U.S. presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke announced that Jeff Berman has joined his campaign team as Senior Advisor for Delegate Strategy.
As National Delegate Director for President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign, Berman played a crucial role in securing the necessary delegates that led to Obama's historic primary victory, widely considered one of the greatest political upsets of all time. Berman also served as a senior consultant to Hillary Clinton's campaign, helping her clinch the 2016 Democratic nomination.
"We're excited that Jeff Berman has joined our team," said O'Rourke. "His expertise and proven success in navigating the primary process will help us put people back at the center of our democracy as we ensure every voice is heard during the most consequential election of our lifetimes."
Berman will be joining a team led by fellow Obama veteran Jen O'Malley Dillon who O'Rourke named campaign manager in March.
"Jeff and Beto met early on, and he was one of the first people I reached out to when I came on board because delegate strategy is so critical to our overall strategy," said O'Malley Dillon. "Jeff and I were both struck by Beto's unifying leadership, the energy he inspires at the grassroots level, and his persistent belief that you can campaign to be a president for all Americans. That's exactly what voters are searching for."
