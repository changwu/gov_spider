    The commitment of this administration to issues important to the women of the country is strong and permanent. Each member of the National Advisory Committee for Women was personally selected by the President, and they are individuals for whom he has great respect and in whom he continues to have confidence. We hope that the members of the Committee will continue to serve in this work, which is so important to gain the legitimate rights of women.
The President feels that the Committee can and will be more productive on behalf of women, and individual members on behalf of their constituencies, if there is a harmonious working relationship between the administration and the Committee's leadership.
The President reached his decision to appoint a new Chairperson after concluding that new leadership is necessary to achieve the goals he 'shares with the members of the Committee and the Women of the country.
We are contacting members of the Committee to offer the continued cooperation of the administration and to urge them to work even more effectively with the President and with other Government leaders toward these important goals.
