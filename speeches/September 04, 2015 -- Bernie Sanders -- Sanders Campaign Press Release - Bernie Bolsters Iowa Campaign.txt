    MUSCATINE, Iowa â€” U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders announced on Friday that he appointed Lilia Chacon to serve as press secretary in Iowa. An award-winning journalist, Chacon is part of Sanders' growing team spread across 15 campaign offices throughout the state that will kick off next year's presidential nomination contest.
"We are thrilled to have Lilia on board," said Iowa State Director Robert Becker. "Lilia's experience will be a huge asset to this campaign as we continue to build on our momentum in Iowa."
Chacon will be a key leader in Sanders' Iowa organization. The staff that now numbers more than 50 is poised to take advantage of the Sanders' momentum in the state where he is drawing larger crowds than any other White House hopeful and has closed to within seven points of the front-runner in the most recent "Iowa Poll" for The Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics.
"Never in my career have I covered a politician like Bernie Sanders," Chacon said. "His message has been consistent for decades and has always put the people first. It's inspiring and energizing to be a part of his presidential campaign." Chacon's work as a broadcast journalist earned her six Emmys, a Peabody Award and an Edward R. Murrow Award.
Sanders made the announcement here in Muscatine on Friday midway through a three-day swing across Iowa. After participating in a Latino roundtable discussion, Sanders was headed to the Meskwaki Nation Town Meeting in Tama, Iowa.
Later in the day he was scheduled to make stops in Cedar Rapids, where he planned to walk a picket line with picketing workers and hold a town meeting at Coe College.
Sanders was a guest at Thursday's taping of this weekend's "Iowa Press" program on Iowa Public Television. He also met with the Des Moines Register editorial board before heading to Grinnell, where 700 people came out for to hear Sanders speak from a gazebo in a city park.
