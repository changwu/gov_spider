    Yesterday, in a North Carolina COVID-19 update, Dr. Viviana Martinez-Bianchi shed light on reports that non-English speaking Latinos with COVID-19 symptoms are getting turned away by hospitals. As the pandemic wreaks havoc on the nation, the Latino and Black communities continue to bear the brunt of the crisis. In response, Biden for President Director of Latino Media Jen Molina released the following statement:
"No person should ever be sent away from the hospital, period. We should be expanding health care access in North Carolina and across our country, not shutting out our most vulnerable communities. In a Biden Administration, we'll take urgent steps to address COVID-19's disproportionate impact on our communities of color and support our hospitals in every state. Unlike Trump and his administration, Joe Biden knows it's the federal government's responsibility to ensure states have sufficient resources to care for every patient."
