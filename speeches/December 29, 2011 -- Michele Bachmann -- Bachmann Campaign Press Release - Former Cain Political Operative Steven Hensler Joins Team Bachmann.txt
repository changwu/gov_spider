    Urbandale, Iowa â€“ Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann today announced that Herman Cain political operative Steven Hensler has joined Team Bachmann as Director of Voter Identification and Field Operations. Hensler will help the Bachmann campaign with polling, surveying, and volunteer coordination.
"Michele demonstrates, more than any other candidate in the race, the conservative principles Iowans are looking for in a president," said Hensler. "We are excited about the momentum we are receiving for the caucuses and I couldn't more honored to join such an organized and driven team."
Since joining the Bachmann campaign, Hensler has doubled the number of precinct captains and as early as last evening, with a big Get Out The Vote (GOTV) push, identified 129 additional precinct captains. In addition, Hensler has organized an extensive grassroots support.
"I'm proud to have Steven on my team because he understands how the Iowa political process works and he has the experience and the organization that will help lead us to victory on Jan. 3," said Bachmann.
