    Hunter received two special waivers to enter the reserves.
Hunter Biden was discharged from the United States Navy Reserve after testing positive for cocaine in June 2013.
Hunter was commissioned into the Navy Reserve as an officer in 2012 despite having no prior military experience. He received two special waivers.


USA Today: "Biden, who had no prior military experience, was one of six officers commissioned nationally into the Navy Reserve public affairs division ... Biden, 44, was discharged from the Navy Reserve in February."


The Wall Street Journal: "Because of his age—43 when he was to be commissioned—he needed a waiver to join the Navy. He received a second Navy waiver because of a drug-related incident when he was a young man."
