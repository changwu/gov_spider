    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Hoilings (D) South Carolina and 30 others)
The administration opposes enactment of S. 1196, which would reauthorize, as well as amend, a multi-million dollar National Sea Grant Program during fiscal years 1988-1992. The 1988 Budget proposed the termination of this program, and if S. 1196 is presented to the President, his senior advisers would recommend its disapproval.
