LAKE JACKSON, Texas — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul again polls better against President Barack Obama in a head-to-head matchup than establishment-choice moderate Mitt Romney, according to a poll released today from Rasmussen.
The poll notes that in a general election matchup, the 12-term Congressman from Texas edges out Obama by 1 percentage point, 44 to 43 percent. The survey also notes that in a hypothetical 2012 head-to-head, Obama and Romney are tied at 45 percent, which bodes poorly for Republicans being urged to believe the race is over, only to later experience buyer's remorse.
The poll also finds that this far into Obama's first term, 40 percent of voters respond that they "strongly disapprove" and 27 percent "strongly approve" of his performance. With a Presidential Approval Index of -13 points, it is noteworthy that some Republicans are seemingly settling on a candidate no more popular than the President, suggesting an establishment liberal Democrat is no more popular than a establishment liberal Republican. The Rasmussen poll may be prescient in showing a general election scenario of confusion among voters over which candidate has the least liberal record.
"Now that other candidates presenting themselves as the 'conservative' alternative to Mitt Romney have stepped aside, the numbers are clear. Ron Paul is the only conservative able to garner the enthusiasm, resources, and votes required to win in November. Voters perceive the contrast, and are ready to elect the candidate who will end the status quo and Restore America Now," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
Rasmussen's daily tracking results are collected from 1,500 Likely Voters and have a +/- 3 percentage point error margin. To view the poll release online, click here.
