    The President is announcing a judicial nominee, who is extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution. This choice continues to fulfill the President's promise to ensure that the nation's courts reflect the diversity that is one of our greatest assets as a country — both in terms of personal and professional backgrounds.
Stephanie Dawkins Davis is the President's nominee to the Sixth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals. Judge Davis would be the first Black woman to serve on the Sixth Circuit from Michigan and only the second Black woman to serve on the Sixth Circuit.
This is President Biden's fourteenth announcement of nominees for federal judicial positions, bringing the number of announced federal judicial nominees to 84.
President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal bench, which is why he continues to move rapidly to fill judicial vacancies.
