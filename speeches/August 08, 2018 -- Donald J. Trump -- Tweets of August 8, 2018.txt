When I decided to go to Ohio for Troy Balderson he was down in early voting 64 to 36. That was not good. After my speech on Saturday night there was a big turn for the better. Now Troy wins a great victory during a very tough time of the year for voting. He will win BIG in Nov.Retweets: 20677Favorites: 100341

The Republicans have now won 8 out of 9 House Seats yet if you listen to the Fake News Media you would think we are being clobbered. Why can't they play it straight so unfair to the Republican Party and in particular your favorite President!Retweets: 36082Favorites: 152820

As long as I campaign and/or support Senate and House candidates (within reason) they will win! I LOVE the people & they certainly seem to like the job I'm doing.
