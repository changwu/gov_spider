    The United States extends its condolences to the people of Malawi and the family of President Bingu wa Mutharika following his recent passing, and we welcome today's announcement that Vice President Joyce Banda was sworn in as President. By following constitutional procedures for this transition, the government and people of Malawi have reaffirmed their commitment to democratic principles and demonstrated the critical importance of sound democratic institutions. We stand with the people of Malawi during their time of mourning, and look forward to deepening the partnership between our nations.
