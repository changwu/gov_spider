    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Studds (D) Massachusetts and 9 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2061 because it would:

—  extend the exclusive fishery management authority of the United States to tuna (Sec. 104). In its current form, this provision would be inconsistent with the interests of U.S. citizens who fish for tuna in distant waters.
—  require the United States to seek an international ban on large-scale driftnet fishing without adequate scientific documentation (Secs. 102(c)(4), 108, and 207). Such a ban is premature and would threaten the driftnet agreements signed in 1989 with Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. Moreover, by prohibiting large-scale driftnet fishing in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone, Sec. 113 would abrogate a treaty with Japan and Canada regarding salmon fishing in the North Pacific.
—  interfere with the President's constitutional authority by requiring the Secretary of State to negotiate with foreign nations (Secs. 104, 108, 207, and 501). The bill raises other constitutional concerns (e.g., by limiting the President's appointment power (Secs. 201 and 503) and discretion to recommend legislation (Sec. 108)).
—  impose excessive operational requirements on Fishery Management Councils that do not sufficiently take into account their public trustee responsibilities.
