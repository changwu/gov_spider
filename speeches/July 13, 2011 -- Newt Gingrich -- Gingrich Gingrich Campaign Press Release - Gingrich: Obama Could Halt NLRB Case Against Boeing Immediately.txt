GOP presidential contender Newt Gingrich toured the Boeing plant in North Charleston today and afterward called on President Obama to remove the National Labor Relations Board general counsel and the complaint challenging the company's expansion to South Carolina.
Obama, he said, needs to "simply end the NLRB case," which Gingrich said is without merit. The former House speaker toured the plant for about two hours.
Besides being an attack on Boeing and it South Carolina workers, Gingrich said the suit is working to stymie various suppliers who could be streaming themselves into the Boeing pipeline but are unsure how much of the plant will be functioning in the months ahead.
"What it does is slow down new manufacturers from moving in because they are not going to take the risk with their own money," he said.
The NLRB and general counsel Lafe Solomon sued the airplane giant in April, saying it had illegally retaliated against unionized workers in Washington state when it opened the 787 passenger jet manufacturing line in North Charleston.
Local and federal lawmakers tied to South Carolina, a right-to-work state, have challenged the suit as politically motivated.
Gingrich said Obama has the power to halt the case immediately.
Boeing currently produces the 787 near Seattle area but leaders hope the 1,000 non-union workers here will eventually build three of the aircraft per month.
