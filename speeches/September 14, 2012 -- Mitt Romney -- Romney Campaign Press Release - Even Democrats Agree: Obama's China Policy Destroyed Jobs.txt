    "For nearly four years, middle-class families have struggled with fewer jobs and fewer opportunities in the Obama economy. And the President's policies toward China have only made things worse — they've cost hundreds of thousands of jobs and left American manufacturing in decline. As president, Mitt Romney will take immediate action to stop China's cheating and protect American jobs here at home." — Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson

President Obama's Failure To Confront China Has Resulted In Trade That Cost The United States Hundreds Of Thousands Of Jobs Since 2008. "American jobs have been shifting to low-wage countries for years, and the trend has continued during Obama's presidency. From 2008 to 2010, U.S. trade with China alone cost about 450,000 American jobs because of the growth of Chinese exports, said Robert E. Scott, a pro-labor advocate at the liberal Economic Policy Institute. That figure was less than in previous years, but the decrease was probably tied to the U.S. economic slowdown, which crimped demand for imports." (Tom Hamburger, Carol D. Leonnig and Zachary A. Goldfarb, "Obama's Record On Outsourcing Draws Criticism From The Left," The Washington Post, 7/9/12)
FLASHBACK: Candidate Obama, In 2007: "If They're Manipulating Their Currency ... We Take Them To The Mat..." OBAMA: "China is a competitor, but they don't have an enemy, as long as we understand that they are going to be negotiating aggressively for their advantage, and we've got to have a president in the White House who's negotiating to make sure that we're looking after American workers. That means enforcing our trade agreements; it means that if they're manipulating their currency, that we take them to the mat on the that issue..."
