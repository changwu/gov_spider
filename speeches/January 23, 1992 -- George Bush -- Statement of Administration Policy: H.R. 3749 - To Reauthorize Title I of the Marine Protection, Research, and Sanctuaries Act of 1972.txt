    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 1/24/92)(House)(Hertel (D) Michigan and four others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 3749, but will work in the Senate to bring the bill's funding level into conformance with the President's FY 1993 Budget.
The Administration will also work to ensure that the bill's provision on seizure and forfeiture, with regard to foreign flag vessels, is consistent with customary international law as reflected in the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea.
