    The President met this afternoon with members of the National Security Council and other senior advisers to review the continuing crisis in Iran and to consider the serious threat to peace posed by the invasion of Afghanistan by armed forces of the Soviet Union.
The President has recalled our Ambassador to the Soviet Union for consultations. Ambassador Watson will be arriving in Washington tomorrow.
The Secretary of State reported to the National Security Council on a series of diplomatic exchanges which have taken place over the past several days. Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher reported on his recent conversations with representatives of Allied Nations.
The President made a number of decisions this afternoon on actions to be taken in response to the Soviet invasion. These decisions involve unilateral actions and actions to be taken in conjunction with other nations.
The President's decision will be made public when appropriate consultations and notification have taken place. The President has directed that this process be completed without delay.
Thank you.
