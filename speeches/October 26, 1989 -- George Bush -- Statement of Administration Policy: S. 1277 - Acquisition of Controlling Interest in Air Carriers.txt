    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Ford (D) Kentucky and 24 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of S. 1277, and the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto this bill or any similar legislation. The Department of Transportation has sufficient authority to ensure that airline operators are financially fit, and comply with safety and U.S. citizenship requirements.
