    Kasich For America launched a new web ad today targeting Utah Caucus attendees to share Gov. Mitt Romney's message about Gov. John Kasich being the only Republican candidate with a proven record and is best prepared to be President.
"What was true last week remains true today, Governor Kasich is the only candidate with a track record of conservative accomplishments and the only candidate who can defeat Hillary Clinton in November," said John Weaver, chief strategist for Kasich for America.
