    I have an announcement this morning before taking off for Washington and Oregon.
I'm pleased to announce that the Secretary of Commerce will designate 36 counties along our border with Mexico-in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas--as the Southwest Border Economic Development Region. This region is being established in response to a request by Governor Brown, together with the Governors of New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas.
The request has been analyzed by the Department of Commerce, which has recommended establishment of this development region to me. I'm convinced that organization of a regional commission, as authorized by an amendment to the Public Works and Economic Development Act, passed in 1975, will make a major contribution to promoting economic development in the border counties.
California counties to be included in the development region are San Diego, Riverside, and Imperial. As an economic development region, the Southwest border area will become eligible for Federal assistance in organizing projects to develop local economic resources. This ties in with my personal philosophy that the proper role of the Federal Government is to help regions and communities work out solutions on their own problems.
Thank you very much. We've enjoyed it here--wonderful part of California-and, of course, we love California.
Thank you very much. Nice to see you all.
