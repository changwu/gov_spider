    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 11/20/91)(House Rules) and SENT to House 11/21/91(Swift (D) Washington and 16 others)
If H.R. 3644 is presented to the President in its current form, his senior advisers will recommend a veto. Changing the rules just as the election cycle begins is inappropriate. Any modification to existing law should be made effective with fair lead time, hence not before January 1993.
