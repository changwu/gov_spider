• While Serving In The Illinois Senate, President Obama Sponsored Legislation To "Allow Undocumented Immigrant Students To Pay In-State Tuition At Public Colleges And Universities." "[T]he Senate voted 55-1 to allow undocumented immigrant students to pay in-state tuition at public colleges and universities. Currently, the undocumented students are required to pay out-of-state tuition even if they spend their entire education in Illinois schools. House Bill 60 would change that, allowing in-state tuition rates for undocumented students who have attended school in Illinois for at least three years and graduated high school in the state." (Rich Frederick, "Senate OKs In-State Tuition Bill," The State Journal-Register, 5/8/03; Illinois General Assembly Website, www.ilga.gov, 9/29/11)
• In 2007, Senator Harry Reid Supported A Bill That "Would Have Allowed Illegal Immigrants To Become Legal Residents And Qualify For Lower In-State Tuition Rates At State Universities." "In late 2007, the Senate rejected an attempt to pass the Dream Act which would have allow illegal immigrants under age 30 to gain legal status if they attended college or joined the military. Fairness demanded action, said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, arguing that 'children should not be penalized for the actions of their parents' who brought them to the United States. But the bill would have allowed illegal immigrants to become legal residents and qualify for lower in-state tuition rates at state universities."

• "The Dream Act Would Allow Students Who Have Lived In The Country Since Age 15 To Apply For Conditional Legal Residence ... They Would Then Be Able To Work And Pay In-State College Tuition Rates." (Eddy Ramirez, "College Board Backs Bill To Legalize Undocumented Students," USNews.com, 4/22/09)

• House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi Supports In-State Tuition Discounts For Illegal Immigrants, Saying "Our Country Does Not Benefit By Depriving Our Young People Of An Education." "Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi stopped in Tempe on Monday to tout congressional Democrats' push to make college more affordable for young people, including those without legal residency. ... Pelosi made reference to the effect of Proposition 300, an Arizona initiative passed by voters in November that requires illegal immigrants to pay out-of-state tuition to attend public universities and community colleges. Pelosi said she met with a young woman Monday who wants to attend college but lacks documentation proving legal residency. 'Our country does not benefit by our depriving young people of an education,' Pelosi said." (Josh Kelley, "Pelosi Addresses College Cost," The Arizona Republic, 2/20/07)

MITT ROMNEY:"Four years of college, you're almost $100,000 discount if you are an illegal alien to go to the University of Texas. If you are a United States citizen from any one of the other 49 states, you have to pay $100,000 more. That doesn't make sense to me."
