    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Fasten (R) Wisconsin and 36 others)
The Administration strongly supports enactment of S. 640, which would bring about a fair, predictable product liability system. The bill would encourage innovation and improve our international competitiveness, while preserving essential protections for consumers.
