    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Protocol Relating to an Amendment to Article 56 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, done at Montreal on October 6, 1989. I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report received from the Department of State with respect to the protocol.
Article 56 of the convention concerns the composition of the Air Navigation Commission of the International Civil Aviation Organization and currently provides that it shall be composed of 15 members. The present protocol would increase the membership of the Commission to 19 members.
I recommend the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the protocol submitted herewith and give its advice and consent to ratification.
