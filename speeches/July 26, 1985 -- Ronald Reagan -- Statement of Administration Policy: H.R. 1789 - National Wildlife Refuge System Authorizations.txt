    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Reps. Breaux (D) Louisiana and Young (R) Alaska)
The Administration opposes H.R. 1789 which would extend and in some cases increase appropriation authorizations for land acquisition at four units of the National Wildlife Refuge System. The President's 1986 Budget does not contemplate land acquisition for expansion of these units and advocates postponement of major land acquisition in the interest of deficit reduction.
