    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
On August 10, 1998, I reported to the Congress that two teams of U.S. military personnel had been deployed to Kenya and Tanzania to assist in the provision of security for our embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in the aftermath of the terrorist bombings at those sites. I am providing this supplemental report, consistent with the War Powers Resolution, as part of my efforts to keep the Congress informed about the continuing deployment of U.S. military personnel in Kenya.
The military personnel that deployed to Tanzania have since redeployed. Military personnel have remained in Kenya, however, to assist in provision of security for our embassy and American citizens in Nairobi. The need for this additional security support will continue until renovations are completed to provide a secure and permanent embassy facility in Nairobi.
I have continued this deployment of U.S. Armed Forces pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. I appreciate the support of the Congress in this action to assist in embassy security and the security of American citizens overseas.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
