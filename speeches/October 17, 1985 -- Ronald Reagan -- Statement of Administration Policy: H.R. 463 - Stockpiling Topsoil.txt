    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Reps. Smith (D) Iowa and Udall (D) Arizona)
The Administration opposes H.R. 463, because it would unnecessarily duplicate ongoing programs of Interior's Office of Surface Mining and Agriculture's Soil Conservation Service. Moreover, creation of a National Land Resources Protection Commission to oversee topsoil preservation would confuse management of such activities currently conducted by Interior and Agriculture, as required by existing law. Finally, analysis of potential impacts on topsoil and development of measures to mitigate these impacts are standard parts of environmental assessments and environmental impact statements prepared under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA).
