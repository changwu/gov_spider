    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Boehner (R) OH and Rep. Moran (D) VA)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 5684, which will approve and implement the United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement (FTA or Agreement), as signed by the United States and Oman on January 19, 2006.
The United States-Oman FTA advances U.S. national economic interests and meets the negotiating principles and objectives set out by Congress in the Trade Act of 2002. The Agreement enhances our bilateral relationship with a strategic friend and ally in the Middle East region and will promote economic growth and prosperity in both nations.
The Agreement provides for increased access to Oman's markets for U.S. industrial, consumer, and agricultural goods. Pursuant to the Agreement, Oman will provide substantial market access across its entire services regime, provide a secure, predictable legal framework for U.S. investors operating in Oman, provide for effective enforcement of labor and environmental laws, and protect intellectual property.
The United States-Oman FTA cements the long-standing friendship and growing commercial ties between both countries, and helps advance political and economic freedom in other countries in the Middle East. The Agreement is a significant step in implementing the President's plan for a broader Middle East Free Trade Area.
