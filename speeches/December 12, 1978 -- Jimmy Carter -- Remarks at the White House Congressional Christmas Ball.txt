    What I'd like to do this evening is to welcome all of you to a typical President and congressional meeting— [laughter] similar to what we've had all this past 2 years. But this time we thought we'd let the wives see what it's like.
I'm not going to make a speech. But I would like to say that Christmas is a time for love and for friendship, for an assessment of our many blessings and for peace. Our country has been blessed greatly the last 2 years, in great measure because of the superb work and the courage of the Congress of the United States. And I, as President, want to thank you on behalf of the 215 million American people.
We have enjoyed peace for our own Nation and we've worked tirelessly, you and I, to bring peace to others as well. And during this religious season, regardless of your faith, I know that you will join me and all Americans in praying for peace in the Middle East and throughout the world.
This evening is a time for enjoyment and for getting to know each other better. When we had the Democratic Convention, which made a superb choice- [laughter] —I was lucky enough to be blessed with Peter Duchin's music there. He played for the Inauguration, which was a great day for me and for some of you as well. And tonight we have a man who enjoys as much popularity as any bandleader has ever enjoyed in our country, one of the greatest bandleaders of all time, who follows in the footsteps of his father, Eddie Duchin, and who last year, I believe, gave a new Christmas work, "Christmas Music with Peter Duchin." So, he's here to help us help one another enjoy Christmas and enjoy the fellowship of the White House.
On behalf of me and Rosalynn and our' whole family, you're welcome, my friends.
