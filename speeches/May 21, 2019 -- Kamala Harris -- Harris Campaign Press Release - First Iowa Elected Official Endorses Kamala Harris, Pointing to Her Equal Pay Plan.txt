    Today, Coralville City Councilwoman Meghann Foster announced her endorsement of Senator Kamala Harris in her run for president. Foster, a mother of five, a small business owner, and a University of Iowa educator, points to Harris' policies like her new equal pay plan as why she is coming out early for Harris. Foster is the first elected official in Iowa to endorse Harris.
"I'm excited to be supporting Kamala Harris in the Iowa Caucus," Foster said. "Senator Harris's plans to close the gender pay gap, increase teacher pay, provide tax relief for the middle class, and her advocacy on behalf of affordable housing are things that are important to me as both a local leader and a mom. She is focused and fearless, and I'm excited to get to work on behalf of her candidacy."
"I'm so grateful to have Meghann's support in this race," Harris said. "She understands what Iowa families are facing every day, and I know that together we can build a better future for all of our children. That starts with ensuring women earn the wages they deserve and our teachers are supported in the classroom."
Harris will return to Iowa on Thursday for her fourth trip to the state since announcing her candidacy. She will discuss her equal pay policy throughout the visit. In Iowa, women are paid just 79 cents for every dollar paid to men.
