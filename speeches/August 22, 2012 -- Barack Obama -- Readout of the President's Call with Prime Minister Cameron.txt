    The President and Prime Minister Cameron spoke today by telephone to continue their close consultations on a wide array of global issues. President Obama reiterated his strong support for decisive action to address the economic crisis in Europe. The President also conveyed his concerns about the increasingly dire humanitarian situation in Syria, and the need for more countries to contribute to the United Nations Syria humanitarian appeals. The two leaders exchanged views on ways the international community can assist those displaced by the conflict, apply pressure on the Assad regime, and support the opposition so that the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people can be realized.
