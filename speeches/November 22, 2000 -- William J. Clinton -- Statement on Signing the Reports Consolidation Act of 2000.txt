    Today I am pleased to sign into law S. 2712, the "Reports Consolidation Act of 2000." This Act, which passed with bipartisan support, provides permanent authority for Federal agencies to consolidate certain financial and performance reports into a single, comprehensive annual report.
This Act builds on the success of a pilot program started in 1994 and represents an important step in the maturity of financial management reporting by the Federal Government. An agency can now combine its audited financial statements, as required by the Chief Financial Officers Act, and its performance reports, required by the Government Performance and Results Act.
These new consolidated reports will give the American people a more comprehensive and useful picture of the many important services we provide to the Nation.
