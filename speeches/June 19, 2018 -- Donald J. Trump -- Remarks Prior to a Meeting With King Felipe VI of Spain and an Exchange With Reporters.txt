    President Trump. Well, thank you very much. It's a great honor to have the King and Queen of Spain, a beautiful country. We were in Spain not so long ago, and we love it. Very special people and a beautiful place.
And our relationship has been outstanding over the years and, I think, especially right now. Excellent trade relationship, military relationship, just about everything you can have. So we love Spain. And it's really a tremendous honor to have you both at the Oval Office.
Thank you very much.
King Felipe. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to, first of all, thank you for your time. As you know, we had a visit around the country. We were visiting Texas and Louisiana. And this is a great end to a perfect visit.
We appreciate very much our common history, our heritage. So many years that we've shared. And we like to use that as a good benchmark for our very excellent relationships that we enjoy today.
As you said, that there's so many issues of common interest, of sharing the efforts in many areas. But as well, I think there's one basic common issue, which is our value for democracy——
President Trump. That's true. True.
King Felipe. ——and our work together through—in many different areas in the world.
President Trump. Thank you very much. It's a great honor.
King Felipe. Thank you.
President Trump. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.
