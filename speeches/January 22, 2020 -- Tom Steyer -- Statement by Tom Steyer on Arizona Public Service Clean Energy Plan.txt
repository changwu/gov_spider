    (SAN FRANCISCO, January 22, 2020) — Today, Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer released the statement below following the new clean energy proposals from Arizona Public Service:
"This is a huge win for the people of Arizona. Our efforts behind Proposition 127 in 2018 have moved the state to a clean energy future. We have shown that when public interest advocates keep pushing energy companies, they can get real results. What's more, our advocacy will benefit Arizonans by saving lives and reducing asthma, reducing the harm being done to our climate, creating jobs, saving consumers money, and ultimately transitioning the state to clean energy.
"The results in Arizona reflect what we have been able to do in California, Nevada, and Michigan, and what I intend to do across the country if I become president — break the corporate stranglehold and require businesses to benefit local communities, create clean jobs, grow economies, and address climate. Corporations cannot write their own rules and I pledge to continue holding them and government agencies accountable to make sure they represent all people, not just interest groups."
