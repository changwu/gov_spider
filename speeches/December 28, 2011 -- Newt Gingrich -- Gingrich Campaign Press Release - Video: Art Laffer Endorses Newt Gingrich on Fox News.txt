    In an interview this afternoon on Fox News, former Reagan economist Art Laffer explained why he supports Newt.
I just think he's got the best economic plan of any of the candidates.  I love the idea that he wants a strong dollar--that was clearly Reagan all the way.  An optional flat tax, that's wonderful.   Spending restraint.  If you look at some of his reforms of programs, it is just a very, very good, well-designed economic package and that's what I am all about. I figured it would be remiss of me not to come and out and say, "I think he's the best candidate."
