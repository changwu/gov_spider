    Today I have signed into law Senate Joint Resolution 53 ("Resolution"). This Resolution makes technical corrections to Public Law 104- 134, the "Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996" ("Act"), which I signed into law on April 26, 1996.
Two of the corrections merit comment.
The Resolution repeals two paragraphs relating to the Tongass National Forest, which were mistakenly not deleted when the operative language was moved to another section.
The Resolution also includes the repeal of section 21104 of the Act, which relates to international population assistance programs and which was inadvertently included in the Act. Nevertheless, I believe that the level of funding that the Congress has provided for FY 1996 for these programs remains inadequate, given the critical importance of these services to protecting the health of women, strengthening families, and preventing unwanted pregnancies and abortions. I regret that the House and Senate were unable to come to an agreement to lift the severe limitations placed on U.S. programs by the FY 1996 Foreign Operations appropriations act. It is my hope that the Congress will remove these limitations and provide full funding for these programs in the FY 1997 appropriations process.
