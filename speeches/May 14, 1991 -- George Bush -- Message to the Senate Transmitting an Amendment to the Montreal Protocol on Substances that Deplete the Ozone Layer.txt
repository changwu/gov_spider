    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, an Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, adopted at London on June 29, 1990, by the Second Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. I am also enclosing, for the information of the Senate, an unofficial consolidated text of the Montreal Protocol that incorporates the Amendment, as well as the adjustments also adopted on June 29, 1990, under a tacit amendment procedure, which provide for a phaseout of CFCs and halons by the year 2000. The report of the Department of State is also enclosed for the information of the Senate.
The principal features of the Amendment, which was negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Program, are the addition of new controlled substances (other CFCs, carbon tetrachloride, and methyl chloroform), reporting requirements on transitional substances (HCFCs), and provisions concerning financial and technical assistance to developing countries to enable them to meet their control measure obligations. As such, the Amendment, coupled with the adjustments, will constitute a major step forward in protecting public health and the environment from potential adverse effects of stratospheric ozone depletion.
The Amendment enters into force on January 1, 1992, provided that 20 Parties to the Montreal Protocol have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, or approval. Ratification by the United States is necessary for effective implementation of the Amendment. Early ratification by the United States will encourage similar action by other nations whose participation is also essential.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Amendment and give its advice and consent to ratification.
