    President Bush and President Hu Jintao of China spoke by phone this morning. President Bush thanked President Hu for the sympathies of the Chinese people on the hardships suffered by Americans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Both Presidents agreed that, in the present circumstances, it was best not to have a meeting in Washington next week; and they agreed to reschedule the visit of President Hu to another mutually convenient time. They agreed to meet in New York on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly later this month.
