    The United States believes that order and security should be brought to Lebanon as soon as possible by the legitimate government. We believe that implementation of the Taif Accord should proceed. The United States strongly supports the unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Lebanon and urges the disbandment of all militias and the removal of all foreign forces from Lebanon so that the process of national reconciliation can proceed.
For 15 years we have argued against violence in Lebanon. Now is not the time to settle old scores. Now is the time for healing. The United States has made this point to Syria as well as to the various Lebanese parties.
