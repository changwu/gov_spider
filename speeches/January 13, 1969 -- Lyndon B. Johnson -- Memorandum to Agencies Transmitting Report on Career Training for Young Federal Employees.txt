    Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
The attached Report was prepared in response to my memorandum of October 10 concerning career training for young employees in the Federal Government.
The report represents a preliminary attempt to probe the opinions, concerns and problems of young employees in the Federal Government. Too often in the past, evaluations of trainee programs have proceeded from the top down, involving the young employee only in the end results. This time, through the creation of youth committees in each agency and through a questionnaire survey, a significant number of young people have been involved from the very start.
Though the overall picture emerging from the questionnaire indicates a considerable degree of job satisfaction, two findings stand out: 1) only half of the employees questioned feel now that their job is as good as they thought it would be when they were hired; and 2) when asked about future plans, 35% plan to leave the Federal Government. These findings should remind us, clearly and forcefully, that the Federal Government cannot rest content in the continuing challenge to motivate and develop its young employees to the highest level of their ability. I note with encouragement the variety of actions already initiated by the new youth committees to improve communications, enhance job opportunities, reexamine training systems and improve summer intern programs. These actions are hopeful signs of progress and change.
I ask you to bring this Report to the attention of your successor. It is my firm hope that the new Administration will capitalize on this momentum, broaden the mandate and membership of the youth committees and explore the feasibility of the recommendations made in this Report.
