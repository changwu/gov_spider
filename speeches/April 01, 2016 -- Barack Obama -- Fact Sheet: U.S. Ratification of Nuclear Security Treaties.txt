    The 2005 Amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM/At); The International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism (ICSANT); The Protocol of 2005 to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (2005 SUA Protocol); and The Protocol of 2005 to the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf (Fixed Platforms Protocol) are critical to global efforts in securing nuclear materials and preventing and responding to acts of nuclear terrorism and nonproliferation
The United States deposited its instrument of ratification for the CPPNM/A on July 31, 2015. The Amendment will enter into force thirty days after 2/3rds of the 153 states party to the original convention have deposited their instrument of ratification with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
On September 30, 2015, the United States deposited its instrument of ratification for ICSANT with the United Nations, making it the 100th country to ratify. ICSANT opened for signature on September 14, 2005 and entered into force in 2007.
On August 28, 2015, the United States deposited its instruments of ratification for the SUA Protocol and the Fixed Platform Protocol. The United States is now the 37th state party to 2005 SUA Protocol and the 32nd state party to the 2005 Fixed Platforms Protocol. The SUA Protocols had been opened for signature in 2005 and entered into force in 2010.
U.S. ratification of the CPPNM/A, ICSANT, and SUA Protocols deliver on pledges made at the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit and at the Proliferation Security Initiative 10th Anniversary Meeting in 2013 and further demonstrates our commitment to enhancing the global nuclear security architecture and preventing nuclear terrorism and nonproliferation. We call on all countries who share this commitment to become parties to these treaties.
