    Dalton and Sugar and Joe Waggonner and all you wonderful people from Shreveport and the other areas that are around:
It's really been a wonderful day for me to come down to Barksdale and to participate in the several interesting, challenging and, I hope, productive incidents, meetings that we had and this is a sort of frosting on the cake. I really enjoyed meeting all your children this afternoon. You know we have to build for the future.
So, it was nice meeting them, it was a pleasure having an opportunity, and I hope to meet all of you. This is the last place that I think anybody ought to get serious, and I've been much too much of that today. I just want Dalton and Sugar and Joe and everybody else in the Shreveport area to know that it's been a great day. All of you have been very hospitable and warm in your welcome, and I just wish 1 could stay here 4 more days.
But I have got a few schedules over west of here someplace. [Laughter] And we are going over there and give it our best, but this has been an awfully nice opportunity to get to know all of you, to make some reacquaintances, along with some new acquaintances. I thank you for your hospitality, and the next time I'll bring Betty down here. That's the trouble--I'm getting very self-conscious about her popularity. She takes care of the CB part of the--[laughter]. She told me after she got back from Texas that there was no problem. She had all the truckdriver vote. [Laughter]
So, I'm going to send her down again to try and get my votes to her polls. But thank you very much. It's been great being here and, Dalton and Sugar, thank you and may I express my deepest appreciation for being made a member of the Ambassador's Club. I've enjoyed it, being here, Holiday in Dixie, and as I said, the next time, sometime in the next 5 years, if we get invited, Betty and I will come down.
Thank you very much.
