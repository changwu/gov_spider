Q. [Inaudible]
The President. I'm going to have another meeting in the morning about it, do a little more work on the way back today, and then have another meeting in the morning. And then I may want to make another round of phone calls after we meet with the principals. And I expect then we'll be pretty close to deciding where we are. I want to get an updated report on the situation, and I'll ask a lot of questions about it.
Q. Mr. President, has all this talk about military force already had an impact, sir? Do you think it's already had an impact?
The President. I hope so. I hope so. I think it may well have, and I certainly hope so.
