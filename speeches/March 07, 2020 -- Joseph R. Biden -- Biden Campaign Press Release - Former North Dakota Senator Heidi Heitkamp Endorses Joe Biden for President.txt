    Yesterday, former North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"I'm endorsing Joe Biden because he understands the America that showers after they work. Those who lie awake at night adding up how much they'll make versus how much they owe, who don't have time for grandiose promises â€” they want results. Joe Biden will deliver them. Joe Biden personally understands the challenges working families face because that's where he comes from. We have a president in the White House who never had to worry about a bill and has no empathy for the struggles of the American worker. We need Joe Biden because he will keep his promises to our farmers and ranchers and revitalize our farm economy. He will restore empathy for others to the White House."
Biden leads the field in congressional endorsements with support from more than 75 U.S. Representatives and 12 U.S. Senators, including the most endorsements from members of both the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,600 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
