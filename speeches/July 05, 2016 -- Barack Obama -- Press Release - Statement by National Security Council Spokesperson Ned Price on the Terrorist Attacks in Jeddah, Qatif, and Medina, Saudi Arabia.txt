    The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attacks yesterday in Saudi Arabia and commends the work of Saudi security forces, whose decisive response prevented further loss of life. Although the investigation of these attacks is still in its early phases, the intent of the terrorists is clear: to sow division and fear. As we join in mourning the loss of at least six individuals, we stand in solidarity with the Saudi people, particularly during this time of celebration and prayer that marks the culmination of the holy month of Ramadan. Moreover, we reaffirm our commitment to the security of Saudi Arabia and to further strengthening our robust counterterrorism cooperation with the Saudi government.
