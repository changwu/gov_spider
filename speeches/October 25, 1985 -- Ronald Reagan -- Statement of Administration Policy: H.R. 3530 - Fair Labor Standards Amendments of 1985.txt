    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Murphy (D) Pennsylvania and 72 others)
The Administration strongly supports legislation to correct the Supreme Court's Garcia decision applying the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act to State and local government employees. In this connection, the Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3530, but prefers S. 1570, the Senate companion bill, because it more satisfactorily resolves overtime and volunteer service issues.
