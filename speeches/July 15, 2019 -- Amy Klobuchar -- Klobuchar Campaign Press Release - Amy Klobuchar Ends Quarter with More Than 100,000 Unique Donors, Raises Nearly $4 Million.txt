"Senator Klobuchar is on track to hit the 130,000 donors needed to qualify for the next DNC debate and has already surpassed the polling requirements in 3 of the 4 polls needed to make the next round of debates. We're thankful to the tens of thousands of grassroots donors from every state in the nation who have joined our team because they know Amy is the strongest candidate to take on Donald Trump," said Amy For America campaign manager Justin Buoen. "We've seen a surge in support following Amy's strong performance in the first debate where she outlined her ambitious, optimistic agenda and took the fight to President Trump. We look forward to building on that momentum heading into the fall."
The campaign is averaging more than 1,000 unique donors per day, including one weekend of 4,000 new additional donors.
