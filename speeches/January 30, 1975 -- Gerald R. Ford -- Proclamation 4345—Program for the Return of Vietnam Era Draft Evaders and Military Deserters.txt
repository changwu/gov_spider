  A Proclamation

AMENDING PROCLAMATION No. 4313 OF SEPTEMBER 16, 1974, TO EXTEND THE APPLICATION PERIOD OF THE PROGRAM FOR THE RETURN OF VIETNAM ERA DRAFT EVADERS AND MILITARY DESERTERS
On September 16, 1974, I issued Proclamation No. 4313, announcing a program of earned return for those convicted and accused of violating certain provisions of the Selective Service Act or the Uniform Code of Military Justice during the Vietnam conflict.
Upon careful review of the progress of this program, I believe that many of those persons who could benefit from this program are only now learning of its application to their cases. Therefore, I am extending the date by which all applications must be received.
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford, President of the United States of America, pursuant to my powers under Article II of the Constitution, do hereby proclaim that Proclamation No. 4313 is amended as follows:
SECTION 1. Paragraph (i) of Section 1 is amended to read as follows:
"presents himself to a United States Attorney before March 1, 1975,".
SEC. 2. The first paragraph of Section 2 is amended by striking out the date "January 31, 1975," after the words "offenses directly related thereto if before" and inserting in place thereof "March 1, 1975,".
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-ninth.

GERALD R. FORD
