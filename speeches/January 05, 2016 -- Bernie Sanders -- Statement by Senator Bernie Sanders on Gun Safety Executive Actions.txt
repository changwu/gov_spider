    NEW YORK â€” U.S. Sen Bernie Sanders issued the following statement today after President Barack Obama announced he will sign a series of executive orders on gun safety:
"It's become clear that no mass shooting, no matter how big or bloody, will inspire Republicans to put children and innocent Americans over the interests of the NRA. They are simply more loyal to gun lobbyists than our children. That's why I support President Obama's executive actions to make our communities safer. A vast majority of the American people, including responsible gun owners who are sickened by the deaths of so many innocent people, agree with the common sense reforms announced today. As president, I will continue these executive orders because it's past time to end the moral outrage of Aurora, and Newtown and Charleston."
