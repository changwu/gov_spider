In-town pool #8 - Event ends/attendee list
Gun safety event concluded at 3:16.
Since this was streamed, just some stand outs for those watching virtually:
There was a sizable number of guests seated in chairs on the Rose Garden. Your pooler estimates at least 200 attendees.
There was thunderous applause and excitement (with some standing) for Congressman Maxwell Frost before and during his remarks.
Someone shouted, "Let's go!" after Frost introduced President Biden.
There was nearly a full standing ovation when POTUS announced the Office of Gun Violence Prevention.
Someone yelled, "That's right!" when POTUS called for the new office to respond to gun violence in the same way that FEMA responds to disasters.
There was also thunderous applause and a few standing ovations when POTUS suggested members of congress should be elected out of office if they do not work to enact further gun safety measures.
Also see the below from the White House on the attendees list:
