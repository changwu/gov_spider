    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, the Statutes of the World Tourism Organization done at Mexico City on September 27, 1970. The report of the Department of State is enclosed for the information of the Senate.
The Statutes establish the World Tourism Organization as an international organization of intergovernmental character replacing 'the International Union of Official Travel Organizations, a non-governmental organization.
The World Tourism Organization will continue the activities of the International Union of Official Travel Organizations in promoting and facilitating international tourism. Additionally, because of the World Tourism Organization's intergovernmental character and close association with the United Nations system, it is anticipated that it will become an even more effective organization. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Statutes and give its advice and consent to ratification.
