    (Virginia Beach, November 5, 2019) â€” Tom Steyer 2020 campaign staffers took to the streets of Virginia this weekend, knocking on over 2,500 doors, doing their part to flip the General Assembly blue while Republicans struggle to hang on to a razor-thin majority.
"We are fighting for a democratic future not just for the Commonwealth of Virginia but for the entire country," said National Organizing Director Brandon Upson, "We are so close to flipping Virginia blue today, and we'll be going after every voter in order to secure this historic victory."
Over the past three weeks, staffers from Tom Steyer's 2020 campaign team have been knocking on on the ground in state, knocking on doors, calling, and sending text messages to voters across Hampton Roads and Virginia Beach.
"A majority in Virginia is within reach," said National Distributed Organizing Director Clarice Criss, "This is it. With just a few short hours before the polls close, our teams continue to knock on doors around the clock, urging all eligible Democratic voters to make their voices heard in this critical election."
Over the past decade, Tom Steyer has put his time, his heart, and personal resources behind his values to fight corporate greed and corruption, and organize people at the local level in support of progressive causes. His support for Virginia Democrats in this historic election is no different.
