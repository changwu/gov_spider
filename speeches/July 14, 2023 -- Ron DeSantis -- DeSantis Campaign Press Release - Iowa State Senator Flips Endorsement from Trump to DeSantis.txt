    Ron DeSantis earns three new endorsements from state legislators in Hawkeye State
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. â€“ Iowa state Senator Jeff Reichman today announced that he is flipping his support from Donald Trump to Ron DeSantis. Reichman joins state Representative Matt Rinker and state Representative Josh Meggers as one of three new Iowa state legislators endorsing DeSantis today.
The additional endorsements are a sign of growing momentum for DeSantis in Iowa and come after Donald Trump "ruffled feathers" in the Hawkeye state by lashing out at Governor Kim Reynolds and skipping the FAMiLY Leadership Summit.
"Iowa Republicans must be united if we are going to take our country back and reverse Joe Biden's failures," Iowa state Senator Jeff Reichman said. "Governor DeSantis has achieved the same type of commonsense policy victories in Florida as we have in Iowa under Governor Kim Reynolds, and he will deliver historic success for the conservative movement as president as well."
"As a veteran, I know Ron DeSantis has the experience and the drive we need to restore our military to greatness," Iowa state Representative Matt Rinker said. "I look forward to the governor becoming the first veteran of a war to serve in the White House since 1988, and will work tirelessly to help him succeed in Iowa. I support Ron DeSantis because he is the fighter we need to reverse our nation's decline."
"Iowa Republicans are tired of racking up conservative victories here at home only to be thwarted by the disaster that is Democrat-controlled Washington," Iowa State Representative Josh Meggers said. "We need to nominate a candidate who can win in November and get our country back on track. Ron DeSantis will get it done."
DeSantis now boasts 39 endorsements from Iowa state legislators. He has been endorsed by over 260 state legislators nationwide.
The Iowa endorsements come as DeSantis is set to appear at multiple events across Iowa this weekend.
