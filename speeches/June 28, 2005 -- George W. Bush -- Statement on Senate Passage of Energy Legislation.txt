    The American people expect their leaders to work together to help provide economic and energy security. I applaud the Senate for working in a bipartisan way to pass comprehensive energy legislation consistent with what I proposed in 2001. This bill will help our economic growth by addressing the root causes of high energy prices and reducing our dependence on foreign sources of energy. It will encourage the use of technology to improve energy conservation and efficiency, help increase domestic energy supplies, support alternative and renewable sources, and enhance reliability. I urge the House and Senate to resolve their differences quickly and get a good bill to my desk before the August recess.
