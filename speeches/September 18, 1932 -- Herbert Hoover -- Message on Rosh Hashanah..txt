THE APPROACH of Rosh Hashanah serves to remind Americans of all creeds of the great debt that is owed by all our people to the Jewish race for their unparalleled contribution to the spiritual life of mankind, since to them more than to any other race we owe the exalted and pure conception of God and of the highest ethical principles to be practiced in His service. I speak the good will of the Nation in extending to the Jewish community of America my heartiest good wishes for happiness in this annual season of renewal.
