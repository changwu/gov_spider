    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Sensenbrenner (R) Wisconsin and 97 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 4128 in order to safeguard the rights of private property owners. H.R. 4128 would prohibit States and local communities that receive Federal economic development funds from using their eminent domain power to seize private property that is subsequently used merely for economic development purposes. The bill would also prohibit the Federal government from using its eminent domain power for such purposes. Private property rights are the bedrock of the Nation's economy and enjoy constitutionally protected status. They should also receive an appropriate level of protection by the Federal government. The Administration looks forward to working with both Houses of Congress on legislation that is consistent with principles of federalism and that ensures the constitutional rights of private property owners are protected.
