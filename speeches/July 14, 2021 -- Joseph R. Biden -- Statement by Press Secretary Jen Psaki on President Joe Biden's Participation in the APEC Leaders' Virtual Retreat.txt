    On Friday July 16, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will participate in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Virtual Retreat, where Leaders will discuss ending the COVID-19 pandemic and supporting the global economic recovery, hosted by Prime Minister Ardern of New Zealand. The President's participation will demonstrate U.S. leadership in the Indo-Pacific region and the President's commitment to multilateral institutions. As President Biden's first engagement with many of the APEC Leaders, particularly those in Southeast Asia, he will emphasize the importance he places on the region as well as his vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific. He will provide an update to Leaders on what the U.S. is doing to serve as an arsenal of vaccines for the region and to support all those suffering from COVID-19. He will also advance an economic agenda that promotes our shared prosperity, leverages the economic potential in the region, and builds inclusive and resilient economies.
