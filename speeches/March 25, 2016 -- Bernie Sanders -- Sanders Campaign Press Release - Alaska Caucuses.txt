Topics discussed ranged from national issues such as universal health care and foreign policy to climate change and the fossil fuel industry. "Our transition from fossil fuels to clean energy must also include a transition for workers." Sanders said.
Asked w how her husband could be effective as president, Sanders said, "Bernie doesn't say one thing and do another. He doesn't say, 'We can't.' He does what's right and finds a way to move toward it."
Sanders reminded everyone to get out and caucus on Saturday.
