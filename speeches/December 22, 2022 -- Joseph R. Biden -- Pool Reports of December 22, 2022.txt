In-town pool report #5: spray
Pool was ushered into the Oval at 10:31 a.m. for the spray at the top of POTUS's storm briefing.
The president made brief remarks and took no questions shouted by pool.
He was seated at his desk and gestured to a large display screen showing the forecast minimum wind chill across the country from Dec 20-25. He said he is going to be briefed by the National Weather Service and FEMA.
Biden called the storm and extreme cold weather reflected on the map "dangerous" and "threatening."
"I encourage everyone, everyone to please heed the local warnings. We've tried to contact 26 governors so far in affected regions. Go to weather.gov for more information," he said. "This is not like a snow day when you were a kid. This is serious stuff."
He urged people who are traveling to leave earlier ahead of the storm. He said he's sending his staff out early who planned to travel tomorrow or tonight, telling them to "leave now," saying they can talk to him by phone if need be.
Pool was ushered out at 10:34.
