    GOVERNOR BUSH: I think we can grow our economy at 4 percent instead of this anemic 2 percent.
JACK HEATH: You think we can get to 4 percent GDP?
BUSH: Absolutely and the fact that Paul Krugman disagrees with me warms my heart. The fact is we can grow at that rate. It will require fixing a few really big complex things, the tax code, how we regulate, embracing the energy revolution with a North American strategy that will allow for high wage jobs to be created in our own country and fixing entitlementsâ€”along with moving from a broken legal immigration system to an economic driver. All those things could allow us to grow at a faster rate. It allows us to solve our entitlement challenges and many other things. And in order to grow at that rate we also need a secure world. I think have the leadership skills based on my record to do it. We cut taxes totaling $19 billion, reduced the state government work force by 13,000, 11%, we created, we were one of two states to go to triple a bond rating in my time. I left with a $9 billion reserve for a rainy day for the next guy. We created 1.3 million jobs during my time. Small businesses, more jobs, more small businesses were created in Florida during those eight years.
