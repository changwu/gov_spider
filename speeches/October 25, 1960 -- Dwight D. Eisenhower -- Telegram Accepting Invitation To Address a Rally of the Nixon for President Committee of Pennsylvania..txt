    I AM HAPPY to confirm my acceptance of your invitation to join you for a dinner meeting in Philadelphia on Friday, October 28th. Looking ahead to the future of our country and to the freedom we want for our children and grandchildren the decision to be made by the American people on November eighth is, I think, one of the most important in our history.
I propose on Friday evening to give my own convictions and try to clear the air on why this is so and on the choice our fellow citizens must make. I am particularly happy that your group will include Democrats and Independents as well as Republicans.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
