    We have seen the remarks attributed by the Shreveport Journal to Frank Moore, but have not been able to reach Mr. Moore to see whether or not the newspaper report corresponds to comments he actually made.
In the meantime, three points should be noted:
1. Mr. Moore is not a spokesman for the administration on matters relating to Iran;
2. The administration has no information suggesting that the Ayatollah Khomeini is terminally ill; and
3. As a matter of policy, the administration does not speculate on the course of internal developments in Iran.
