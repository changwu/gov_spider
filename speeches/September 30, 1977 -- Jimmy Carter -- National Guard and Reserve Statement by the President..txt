    I have today signed a statement pledging that all Federal agencies will support their employees' participation in the programs of the National Guard and Reserve. Our Nation continues to depend for its defense upon our Reserve forces. Under the total force concept, Reserve forces would perform critical missions in any future conflict. My administration is committed to ensuring that these vital forces are fully manned, well trained, well equipped, and capable of rapid mobilization and integration into the active force in time of national emergency.
The programs available in the Reserve offer an excellent opportunity for many young men and women to learn valuable skills while also serving their Nation.
I call upon employers throughout the Nation, both public and private, to join me in continued support of these programs which are so necessary to our national defense.
