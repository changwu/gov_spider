    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Smith (R) NJ and 93 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 6099, which would provide information and options to pregnant mothers contemplating an abortion regarding the development of the unborn child and the capacity of the unborn child to feel pain.
H.R. 6099 would require those who perform abortions on unborn children 20 weeks or more after fertilization to inform the mother of medical evidence that the unborn child feels pain and that the process of being killed in an abortion will cause the unborn child pain. Additionally, the bill would give the mother the opportunity to request pain-reducing drugs for the child to make the procedure less painful to the unborn child.
Medical science has greatly improved our knowledge and understanding of fetal development in recent years, and pregnant women should be fully informed of the facts. This bill is an important step in that direction.
