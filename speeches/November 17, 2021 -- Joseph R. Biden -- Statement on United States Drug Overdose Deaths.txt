    Today new data reveal that our Nation has reached a tragic milestone: More than 100,000 lives were lost to the overdose epidemic from April of last year to April of this year. As we continue to make strides to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot overlook this epidemic of loss, which has touched families and communities across the country.
As we grieve those we've lost and honor their memories, my administration is committed to doing everything in our power to address addiction and end the overdose epidemic. Through the American Rescue Plan, we've delivered nearly $4 billion to strengthen and expand services for substance use disorder and mental health. We're working to make health coverage more accessible and affordable for all Americans so that more people who need care can get it. We are strengthening prevention, promoting harm reduction, expanding treatment, and supporting people in recovery, as well as reducing the supply of harmful substances in our communities. And we won't let up.
To all those families who have mourned a loved one and to all those people who are facing addiction or are in recovery: You are in our hearts, and you are not alone. Together, we will turn the tide on this epidemic.
