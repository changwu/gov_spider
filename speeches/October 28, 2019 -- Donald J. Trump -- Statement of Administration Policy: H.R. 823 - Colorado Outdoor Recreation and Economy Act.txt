    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. Neguse, D-CO, and 3 cosponsors)
The Administration opposes H.R. 823, the Colorado Outdoor Recreation and Economy Act. This bill would impose land restrictions on nearly 400,000 acres of land in Colorado, and would reduce areas open for motorized recreation. The Administration has pledged to expand access to America's public lands, increase hunting, fishing, and recreational opportunities nationwide, and enhance conservation stewardship. H.R. 823, however, would not achieve these goals in a balanced way, and the Administration opposes it as currently drafted.
The Administration is committed to managing public lands as a good neighbor to the local communities and to the Americans who live and work in close proximity to them. Engaging local stakeholders and considering their on-the-ground expertise are critical steps in making decisions about public lands management. Rural communities have raised concerns that the land-use restrictions included in H.R. 823 would have negative effects on local economies, and, as evidenced by the committee process, it appears that local sentiment has not been adequately taken into account when developing this bill. The Administration, therefore, opposes H.R. 823 in its current form, but it is willing to work with the Congress to improve it if the bill is considered further.
If H.R. 823 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he veto it.
