    I want to thank the leadership of the United States Senate for joining me today. We have just been briefed from Baghdad about the formation of the unity Government. Not everybody around this table has agreed with certain aspects of this war on Iraq, but all of us agree that the formation of the unity Government is a very important moment in the history of a new Iraq.
I want to thank the Members for their strong support of our diplomatic mission and the United States military, who are engaged in heroic efforts to help this young country succeed. We're on our way to victory.
We've got more work to do. But the peopleâ€”our troops need to know, and those working in the field need to know, there is a bipartisan desire for us to be successful in this very important theater in the war on terror.
I want to thank you, Senators, for coming. I appreciate your time. Thank you for your interest in this vital subject.
