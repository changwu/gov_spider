    THE PRESIDENT has decided that for the next few months he will be unable to participate in formal White House receptions. No less than 160 organizations will hold annual meetings in the National Capital during this period. Requests for formal White House receptions to their members have been received already from scores of these organizations. Although the President cannot grant these requests, because of the extraordinary demands upon his time, he will be glad to receive committees representing these organizations during office hours so they may present their conclusions or lay before him such recommendations as their organizations may have adopted.
The courtesy of a reception, if extended to one association, should be extended to all associations. Hundreds and some times thousands of people attend each reception. To greet so many visitors presents too great a task for the President at such a time as this, when official demands occupy his every waking hour. Shaking hands with literally thousands of people in the course of a season constitutes a demand would impair proper consideration of matters of the greatest moment to the Nation.
Mrs. Hoover will be delighted, whenever possible, to extend the courtesies of the White House to visiting organizations, the officials and members of which so desire to be received. The President, however, must request to be excused from participation.
