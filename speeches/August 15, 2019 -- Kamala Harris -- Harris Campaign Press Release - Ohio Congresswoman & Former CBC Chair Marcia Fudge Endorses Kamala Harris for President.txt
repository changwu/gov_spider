    Says there is "no one better to make the case against Trump than Kamala Harris"
Today, on MSNBC's Morning Joe, U.S. Representative Marcia Fudge became the tenth member of the Congressional Black Caucus to endorse Senator Kamala for President. Fudge, who represents Ohio's 11th Congressional District, is a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and past national President of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. Fudge has served the people of Ohio for more than three decades, beginning in the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office and was later elected as the first African American and the first female mayor of Warrensville Heights.
Fudge cited Harris' energy, commitment to fighting domestic terrorism, and her preparedness to take on Donald Trump.
"I am supporting Kamala Harris, she is an excellent candidate," said Fudge "I think there is no one better to make the case against 45 than Kamala Harris. So, I'm excited about it. I do think she is a person that has the kind of energy, and she's a new fresh face. She's someone when people meet her people like her."
"I'm excited to have Marcia's support in this race," said Harris. "She is a national leader in the fight for the needs of America's working families including access to quality public education, health care and good-paying jobs. She is a trailblazer and I'm proud she stands with me as we fight to restore truth and justice in America and for bold solutions to the issues that keep Americans up at night."
Fudge is the tenth member of the CBC, and second former CBC chair to endorse Harris. Fudge joins Barbara Lee of California, Al Green of Texas, Fredricka Wilson and Alcee Hastings of Florida, Lacy Clay of Missouri, Jahana Hayes of Connecticut, Bobby Rush of Illinois, Danny Davis of Illinois and Brenda Lawrence of Michigan. Harris' ten CBC endorsements is more than any other candidate for president.
Ohio will award nearly 140 delegates in the 2020 Democratic primary.
