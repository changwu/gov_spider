    Former New Hampshire Senator John E. Sununu made the following statement on the Supreme Court decision on President Obama's healthcare law:
"The Supreme Court's decision today to uphold Obamacare is a sobering reminder of the need for new leadership in Washington. This massive government overreach is bad for businesses, patients and future generations of Americans who will be burdened with unsustainable debt and increased government intrusion into their personal lives. Mitt Romney believes in free markets and constitutional limits on government power, and has promised to repeal and replace Obamacare on day one of his administration. Washington needs a new leader who will allow states to determine the type of healthcare reform that best suits their constituents' needs without taking a one-size-fits-all approach that kills jobs and discourages free enterprise and I am confident Mitt Romney is that leader."
