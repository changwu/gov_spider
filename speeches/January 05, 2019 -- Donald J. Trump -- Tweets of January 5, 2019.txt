Great support coming from all sides for Border Security (including Wall) on our very dangerous Southern Border. Teams negotiating this weekend! Washington Post and NBC reporting of events including Fake sources has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)!Retweets: 18762Favorites: 86634

The Democrats could solve the Shutdown problem in a very short period of time. All they have to do is approve REAL Border Security (including a Wall) something which everyone other than drug dealers human traffickers and criminals want very badly! This would be so easy to do!Retweets: 26745Favorites: 116260

Many people currently a part of my opposition including President Obama & the Dems have had campaign violations in some cases for very large sums of money. These are civil cases. They paid a fine & settled. While no big deal I did not commit a campaign violation!Retweets: 20031Favorites: 91065

I don't care that most of the workers not getting paid are Democrats I want to stop the Shutdown as soon as we are in agreement on Strong Border Security! I am in the White House ready to go where are the Dems?Retweets: 26013Favorites: 127753

We are working hard at the Border but we need a WALL! In 2018 1.7 million pounds of narcotics seized 17000 adults arrested with criminal records and 6000 gang members including MS-13 apprehended. A big Human Trafficking problem.Retweets: 29835Favorites: 113660

The Democrats want Billions of Dollars for Foreign Aid but they don't want to spend a small fraction of that number on properly securing our Border. Figure that one out!Retweets: 35133Favorites: 131552

'Former @NYTimes editor Jill Abramson rips paper's 'unmistakably anti-Trump' bias.'Ms. Abramson is 100% correct. Horrible and totally dishonest reporting on almost everything they write. Hence the term Fake News Enemy of the People and Opposition Party!Retweets: 22225Favorites: 89071

Drug makers and companies are not living up to their commitments on pricing. Not being fair to the consumer or to our Country!Retweets: 26525Favorites: 135731

V.P. Mike Pence and team just left the White House. Briefed me on their meeting with the Schumer/Pelosi representatives. Not much headway made today. Second meeting set for tomorrow. After so many decades must finally and permanently fix the problems on the Southern Border!Retweets: 23790Favorites: 116464
