    Senator Bruce Tarr (R-Gloucester), Minority Leader of the Massachusetts Senate, today endorsed John Kasich for President.
"Now more than ever, voters in New England and across the country need a leader with the temperament and executive experience to make America strong again. John Kasich is that leader and I am proud to endorse him for President of the United States," said Tarr. "I encourage every voter in New Hampshire to look at his record of accomplishments as governor in spurring a robust economy in Ohio and for his historic work in Congress championing the bipartisan Balanced Budget Act for our entire nation."
Tarr emphasized that Kasich's 18 years of experience on the House Armed Services Committee would "strengthen the nation and guide us to a new and stable place in a turbulent and dangerous world."
Tarr is currently serving his eleventh term in the Massachusetts State Senate and his third as Minority Leader, where he represents the First Essex & Middlesex District of Massachusetts. Prior to his election to the Senate, he served two terms in the Massachusetts House. Tarr is an attorney by profession and a longtime advocate for the New England fishing industry.
"I have tremendous respect for Senator Bruce Tarr's long record of public service and conservative leadership in a blue state," said Kasich. "It's an honor to receive his endorsement as we expand our operations in Massachusetts leading up to the primary election in March."
