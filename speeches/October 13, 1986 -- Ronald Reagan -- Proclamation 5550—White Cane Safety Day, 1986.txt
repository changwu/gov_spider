  A Proclamation

As more and more blind and visually handicapped Americans enter the mainstream of society to live and work among sighted people, all of us should reflect on the significance of the white cane. Through the aid of a white cane and an informed public, many blind and visually handicapped people can better enjoy the fullness of life.
The white cane guides its users and signals othersâ€”but it also symbolizes the ability of blind and visually impaired citizens to enjoy the freedom and independence meant for all Americans. Sighted people should be aware that many white cane users lead independent lives and that others are well on their way to doing so. White cane bearers should always receive friendliness, consideration, and respect on the street, on the job, and everywhere else Americans' paths cross.
In recognition of the significance of the white cane, the Congress, by joint resolution approved October 6, 1964, has authorized the President to designate October 15 of each year as "White Cane Safety Day."
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 1986, as White Cane Safety Day. I urge all Americans to salute the independence of those who carry the white cane and to consider how each of us, in our work and in our daily rounds, can show our respect for these proud and able Americans.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.

RONALD REAGAN
