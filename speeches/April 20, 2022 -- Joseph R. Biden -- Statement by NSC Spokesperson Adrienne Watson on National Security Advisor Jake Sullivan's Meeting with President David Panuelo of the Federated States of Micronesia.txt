    National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with President David Panuelo of the Federated States of Micronesia to affirm the abiding U.S. commitment to the security and prosperity of the Freely Associated States, as well as to discuss issues of common concern in the Pacific Islands region. Noting the appointment of Special Presidential Envoy Ambassador Joseph Yun to lead negotiations for the United States on renewing the Compact of Free Association, Sullivan affirmed the U.S. goal of concluding the process by the end of the year. The two discussed the existential threat posed by climate change to Pacific Island nations, and voiced common concern about the People's Republic of China and the Solomon Islands signing a bilateral security agreement. President Panuelo and Mr. Sullivan agreed to identify additional opportunities to continue deepening U.S. engagement in this vital region.
