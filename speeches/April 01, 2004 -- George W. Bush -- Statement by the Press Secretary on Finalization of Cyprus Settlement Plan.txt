    We welcome the finalization of the comprehensive settlement plan of the Cyprus problem that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan presented yesterday in Switzerland. This historic settlement culminates decades of negotiations between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, as well as Greece and Turkey. It clears the way for all Cypriots to cement their future in Europe, as a united Cyprus enters the EU on May 1.
Greek and Turkish Cypriots now control their destiny as they prepare to vote on the settlement plan in referenda on April 24. We share Secretary-General Annan's assessment that the final settlement is a fair and balanced compromise that addresses the primary concerns of the parties, and which yielded clear improvements as the plan was finalized.
The United States will support full implementation of this settlement. We will participate in a pre-donors conference in coming weeks being organized by the European Commission. We call on all friends of Cyprus in the international community to join us in actively participating in that conference.
We commend the outstanding leadership on this issue of U.N. Secretary-General Annan, as well as the exceptional efforts of his Special Advisor Alvaro De Soto and the U.N.'s entire Cyprus team. We also salute the constructive efforts of Greece, Turkey, and of course, the Cypriot leaders.
