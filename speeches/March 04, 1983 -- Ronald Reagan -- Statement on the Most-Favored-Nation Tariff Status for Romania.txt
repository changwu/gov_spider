    The Government of Romania has implemented a decree requiring any Romanian citizen wishing to emigrate to repay in convertible currency the costs of education received beyond the compulsory level. This decree conflicts with the letter and spirit of section 402 of the Trade Act of 1974, which is intended to remove barriers to freedom of emigration. I therefore declare my intention to terminate Romania's most-favored-nation tariff status and other benefits effective June 30, 1983, if the education repayment decree remains in force on that date.
