    I deeply regret the death today in Bosnia of an American soldier who was killed this morning when he stepped on a landmine. This is the first fatality that U.S. forces have suffered in Operation Joint Endeavor.
Hillary and I join all Americans in extending our deepest sympathies to his family. They should know that he died in the noblest of causes, the pursuit of peace.
Since before Operation Joint Endeavor began, I have said it entails real risks. But our commanders have provided our troops with the finest training and equipment to confront the challenges in Bosnia. We will continue to take every precaution to protect American troops as they continue to perform this critical mission of securing an enduring peace in Bosnia.
