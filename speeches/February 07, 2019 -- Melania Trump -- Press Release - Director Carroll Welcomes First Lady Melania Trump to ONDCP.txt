    Today, White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Director Jim Carroll hosted First Lady Melania Trump for a wide-ranging policy briefing on the drug abuse epidemic in America.
"Tackling the addiction crisis in our country requires an all-hands-on-deck approach, and today was another example of how committed the Trump Administration is to saving lives. We are honored to share with the First Lady the incredible work being done here at ONDCP and by our partners across the nation, and we thank her for her leadership on this issue," ONDCP Director Jim Carroll said.
During the roundtable, Mrs. Trump and Director Carroll discussed the various challenges of the opioid crisis and how ONDCP coordinates efforts to prevent drug abuse, treat those struggling with addiction, and reduce the availability of illegal drugs in the United States.
