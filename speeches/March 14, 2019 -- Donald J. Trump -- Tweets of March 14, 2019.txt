'Democrats are frantic to throw something else at the President. That's why you saw those 81 subpoenas. It's ridiculous. Just because your still upset over an election that happened 2 1/2 years ago you should not be allowed to ruin people's lives like this.' Lara Trump @FoxNewsRetweets: 21355Favorites: 89302

A big National Emergency vote today by The United States Senate on Border Security & the Wall (which is already under major construction). I am prepared to veto if necessary. The Southern Border is a National Security and Humanitarian Nightmare but it can be easily fixed!Retweets: 20567Favorites: 87096

The three very weak and untalented late night 'hosts' are 'fighting over table scraps. Carson did a great job it wasn't political. I don't know what they're going to do in 2024 when he's no longer President? Will be wacky in the unemployment line.' Michael Loftus @foxandfriendsRetweets: 14017Favorites: 67750
