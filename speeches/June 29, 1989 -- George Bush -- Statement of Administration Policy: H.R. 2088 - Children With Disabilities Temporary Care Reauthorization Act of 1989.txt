    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Reps. Owens (D) NY and Bartlett (R) TX)
The Administration supports the purposes of the activities authorized by H.R. 2088 â€”respite care for disabled and seriously ill children and nursery care for abused and neglected children. However, the Administration believes that extension of the special authority for these activities in H.R. 2088 is unnecessary. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) already is operating temporary child care and crisis nurseries activities under section 426 of the Social Security Act (child welfare research and demonstration projects). HHS will continue to fund these demonstration projects in FY 1990. H.R. 2088 would also greatly increase the administrative and paperwork burdens imposed on the States.
