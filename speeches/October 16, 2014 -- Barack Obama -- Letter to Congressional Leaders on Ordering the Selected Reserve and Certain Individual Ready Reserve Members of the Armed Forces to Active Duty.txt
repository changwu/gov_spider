Effective today, pursuant to sections 121 and 12304 of title 10, United States Code, I am authorizing the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to order the Selected Reserve and certain members of the Individual Ready Reserve to active duty to augment the active forces in support of Operation United Assistance, providing humanitarian assistance and consequence management related to the Ebola virus disease outbreak in the West Africa region. The authorities that have been invoked will ensure the Department of Defense can properly sustain the military operations required in this effort.
A copy of the Executive Order I have issued is enclosed.
Sincerely,
BARACK OBAMA
