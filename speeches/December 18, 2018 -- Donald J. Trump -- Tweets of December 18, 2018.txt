Biggest outrage yet in the long winding and highly conflicted Mueller Witch Hunt is the fact that 19000 demanded Text messages between Peter Strzok and his FBI lover Lisa Page were purposely & illegally deleted. Would have explained whole Hoax which is now under protest!Retweets: 20258Favorites: 76049

Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn. Will be interesting to see what he has to say despite tremendous pressure being put on him about Russian Collusion in our great and obviously highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion!Retweets: 18557Favorites: 77887

I hope the people over at the Fed will read today's Wall Street Journal Editorial before they make yet another mistake. Also don't let the market become any more illiquid than it already is. Stop with the 50 B's. Feel the market don't just go by meaningless numbers. Good luck!Retweets: 16500Favorites: 70330

Facebook Twitter and Google are so biased toward the Dems it is ridiculous! Twitter in fact has made it much more difficult for people to join @realDonaldTrump. They have removed many names & greatly slowed the level and speed of increase. They have acknowledged-done NOTHING!Retweets: 26345Favorites: 96334

....WILL NEVER BE PROVEN AND ARE LIKELY FALSE.' Thank you to Michael Isikoff Yahoo for honesty. What this means is that the FISA WARRANTS and the whole Russian Witch Hunt is a Fraud and a Hoax which should be ended immediately. Also it was paid for by Crooked Hillary & DNC!Retweets: 19460Favorites: 75842

Michael Isikoff was the first to report Dossier allegations and now seriously doubts the Dossier claims. The whole Russian Collusion thing was a HOAX but who is going to restore the good name of so many people whose reputations have been destroyed?Retweets: 21238Favorites: 82019
