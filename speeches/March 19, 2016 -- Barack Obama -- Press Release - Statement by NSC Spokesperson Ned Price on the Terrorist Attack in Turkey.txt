    The United States condemns in the strongest possible terms today's terrorist attack in Istanbul, Turkey. Two American citizens were among those killed in this heinous attack. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones of those killed, and we wish a speedy recovery to those injured.
Turkey has once again suffered a horrific terrorist attack, and we remain steadfast in our support for our NATO Ally and partner. These repeated acts of terrorism in Turkey must come to an end. We are in close touch with Turkish authorities and reaffirm our commitment to work together with Turkey to confront the evil of terrorism.
