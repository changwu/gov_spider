    WASHINGTON â€“ Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement tonight after a police dashboard video was released showing the arrest of the late Sandra Bland:
"This video of the arrest of Sandra Bland shows totally outrageous police behavior. No one should be yanked from her car, thrown to the ground, assaulted and arrested for a minor traffic stop. The result is that three days later she is dead in her jail cell. This video highlights once again why we need real police reform. People should not die for a minor traffic infraction. This type of police abuse has become an all-too-common occurrence for people of color and it must stop."
