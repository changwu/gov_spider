    Little Rock, AR â€“ Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee sent a letter to Sen. John McCain Tuesday, asking the Senator to join him in a Republican Presidential Debate. Huckabee said it's time to debate the issues in front of the American people.
"Now that the race for the Republican nomination is down to just the two of us, I believe this is the time for a real discussion about our vision for the future of this great country," Huckabee wrote in the letter to Sen. McCain. "I encourage you to join me in a Lincoln Douglas-style debate so that voters can better understand our views on critical issues such as health care, education, energy independence, terrorism and national security."
Huckabee said Democratic candidates, Senators Barrack Obama and Hillary Clinton, have had the opportunity to debate the issues before their constituents, and it's only fitting that Republican primary voters are offered the same.
"I look forward to working with your staff to schedule this as soon as possible. I would suggest we set the debate before the March Fourth Primaries," Huckabee wrote. "It is my hope that one of the TV networks would offer to sponsor such an event."
