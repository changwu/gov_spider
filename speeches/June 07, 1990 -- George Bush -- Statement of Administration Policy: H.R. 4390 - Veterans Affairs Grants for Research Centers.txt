    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Leath (D) TX and Montgomery (D) MS)
The Administration strongly supports medical research. The National Institutes of Health alone awards over $4 billion annually in grants to medical schools and universities for research. This research includes the types of research specified in H.R. 4390. In light of this substantial commitment, and the many competing priorities for Federal research support, the Administration opposes H.R. 4390.
H.R. 4390 would create a new grant program, authorizing $50 million for each of FYs 1991 through 1994, to establish new medical research centers at certain State medical schools. New State research centers are not a priority for Federal research assistance.
