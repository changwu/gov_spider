    In advance of the release of the We the People Act -- a bill introduced by Senate Democrats to restore accountability through reforms to the campaign finance system and to close the revolving door and reduce lobbyists' influence in Washington -- Hillary Clinton today issued the following statement:"I applaud the Senate Democrats for proposing a strong package of reforms to help restore our democracy and break the grip of wealthy special interests in Washington. As I have said consistently in this campaign, we need to overturn the disastrous Citizens United decision and make government more responsive to the American people. Our elections should be shaped by voters' voices, not bought and sold by corporations and special interests. Congress should pass this bill as quickly as possibleâ€”and should I be elected President, I would proudly sign it."
