    The President. We have justâ€”Laura and I have just been given a tour by the Whites in their new home. And they're going to be moving into this home this weekend maybe.
Gen White. Yes, this weekend.
The President. There's nothing more hopeful than to be with somebody who says, "Welcome to my home," particularly given the fact that these mixed-use housing projects have replaced old-style, low-income housing projects that frankly didn't work. In other words, the storm came, created a lot of heartbreak and heartache, but people took a different look at how best to help people in their homes.
And we're in this beautiful project. This is a stunning project. So I'm with homeowners-to-be, renters. Here's a home-owner-to-be right here. Right across the street, as a matter of fact, isn't that right? People are going to be able to say, "This is my home."
This is really a remarkable project. For people in New Orleans who remember what this site was like compared to what it is today, they've got to be full of hope. And so I appreciate the builders. I appreciate Alphonso Jackson in Housing and Urban Development, the group that have helped get this project started. But most of all, I appreciate the homeowners-to-be, people who are working hard to be able to say, "This is my home." And we really appreciate you giving us a chance to come by.
Ms. White. Thank you.
The President. And we wish you all the very best in your new home. Congratulations to you.
Thank you all. Good job. Thank you. Good luck to you.
