    THE PRESIDENT. Oh, hello, Helen [Helen Thomas, United Press International]. Did you make it?
Q. No, I didn't. But, listen, do you know your natural gas compromise is falling apart?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I talked to the Vice President about that today. We'll do a little work on it, maybe tonight.
Q. Do you think you still can pull it off?
THE PRESIDENT. I don't know.
Q. What will you be doing here by way of activities?
THE PRESIDENT. I don't know yet.
