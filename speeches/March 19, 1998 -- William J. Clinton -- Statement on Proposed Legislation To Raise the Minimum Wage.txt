    Two years ago, we raised the minimum wage to reward work and help millions of Americans raise their families with dignity. With our expanded earned-income tax credit and the higher minimum wage, we said to hard-pressed working families: If you work full-time, you should not have to raise your children in poverty. Without another minimum wage increase, too many of these families will fall through the cracks and back below the poverty line. That is wrong.
That is why I am pleased that Senator Daschle, Senator Kennedy, Representative Gephardt, and Representative Bonior are introducing legislation that includes another sound and prudent minimum wage increase. With our economy the healthiest in a generation and job growth strong, we can afford to increase the minimum wage by a dollar by the turn of the century. I strongly support raising the minimum wage. This legislation will help ensure that we pay people a decent wage and that parents who work hard and play by the rules can lift their children and themselves out of poverty. It's right for America and right for America's workers.
