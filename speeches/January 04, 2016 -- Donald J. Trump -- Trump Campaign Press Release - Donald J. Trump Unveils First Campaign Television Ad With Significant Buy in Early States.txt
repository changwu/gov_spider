(New York, NY) January 4th, 2016 - Today Donald J. Trump unveiled his first campaign ad, which will air in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire beginning Tuesday, January 5th. Mr. Trump will be spending at least $2 million dollars per week, with $1.1 million allocated to TV in Iowa and close to $1 million spent on TV in New Hampshire.
Mr. Trump said, "I am leading in every poll by wide, double digit margins. We have tremendous crowds, incredible support from all over the country and I am $35 million dollars under budget. We have spent the least amount of money and have the best results and this is the kind of thinking the country needs. I am very proud of this ad, I don't know if I need it, but I don't want to take any chances because if I win we are going to Make America Great Again."
The initial ad focuses on the key issues of Mr. Trump's campaign including national security, illegal immigration and his vision to Make America Great Again. Mr. Trump has previously run radio ads in the first three primary states and will continue to do so with a new radio ad also premiering this week featuring Kathryn Gates-Skipper, the first female Marine to serve in combat operations. Kathryn endorsed Mr. Trump at his Sarasota rally in November.
Also airing this week, is a new radio ad in South Carolina featuring Nancy Mace, the first female graduate of The Citadel.
Mr. Trump continues to lead all national and state polls and will travel to Lowell, Massachusetts, Claremont, New Hampshire, Burlington, Vermont, Rock Hill, South Carolina, multiple stops in Iowa and Reno, Nevada for rallies this week.
