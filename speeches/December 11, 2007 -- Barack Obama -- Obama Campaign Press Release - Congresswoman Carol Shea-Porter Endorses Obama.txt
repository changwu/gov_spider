    Elected on strong opposition to the Iraq war, Shea-Porter praises Obama
for his judgment in opposing the war, taking principled stands on tough
issues
Shea-Porter will serve as a national co-chair of Obama for America
Manchester, NH -- Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter of New Hampshire's First
District announced today that she is endorsing Senator Barack Obama's
campaign for change. In her successful race to unseat an incumbent
Republican in the 2006 elections, Congresswoman Shea-Porter galvanized
voters by demanding a change of course in Iraq and standing up for
principles.
"Carol's exactly the kind of leader we need in Washington," Senator
Obama said. "When she ran in 2006, Carol didn't care what the polls
said. She ran on her convictionsâ€”to end this war in Iraq. And because
she stood up for what she believed in, the voters of New Hampshire stood
with her. That's how we're going to win this election, and it's how
we're going to change Washington."
Congresswoman Shea-Porter will serve as a national co-chair of the Obama
campaign.
"Sen. Barack Obama stands ready to lead our nation for the next eight
years. He will heal our divisions at home and abroad. I know the Senator
will use diplomacy before force wherever possible and will show
intelligent restraint. After all, he was the one who turned a cold,
sober eye on the Iraq evidence and accurately judged it, and wisely
spoke against the war. That showed true leadership and courage."
