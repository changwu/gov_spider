    The President agrees with House Republicans that we must reduce our deficit and put our country on a fiscally sound path, but we disagree with their approach. The House Republican plan places the burden of debt reduction on those who can least afford it, ends Medicare as we know it, and doubles health care costs for seniors in order to pay for more than a trillion dollars in tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. This week, the President put forth a balanced approach to deficit reduction based on shared responsibility and shared prosperity. The President's approach ensures the nation lives within its means by cutting spending and bringing down the debt, while supporting our economic recovery and ensuring we are making the investments we need to win the future. Though our approaches differ, our goal remains the same. Any solution will require Republicans and Democrats working together, and we are committed to that process.
