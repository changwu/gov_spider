    Mitt Romney today announced the support of former Virginia Congressman Tom Davis.
"I'm honored to earn Tom's support," said Mitt Romney. "Tom has been a leader in our party for many years and is a tireless advocate of responsibility in government. I look forward to his counsel in the weeks and months to come to help get Virginians back to work and our country back on track."
"In this crucial election, the choice is clear: four more years of misguided economic policies that have made our recovery worse or a proven leader who has a detailed plan to create jobs and shrink the size of government," said Congressman Davis. "Mitt Romney is a leader who has proved numerous times that he can be counted on to turn troubled organizations around, whether it was in business, the Winter Olympics, or as Governor of Massachusetts. That is why I urge all those who want to fight for the America we love to join me in standing with Mitt."
