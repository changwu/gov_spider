If inspection of such returns is necessary such inspection shall be made in an office of the Internal Revenue Service and shall be in accordance and upon compliance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury in a Treasury Decision, relating to inspection by the Department of Agriculture of income tax returns made for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1967, of persons having farm operations, to the extent readily available in the Internal Revenue Service (for the purpose of obtaining data about such persons' farm operations), approved by me this date.
