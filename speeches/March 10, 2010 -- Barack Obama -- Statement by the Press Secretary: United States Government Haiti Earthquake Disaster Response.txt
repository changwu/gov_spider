    I've directed my administration to launch a swift, coordinated, and aggressive effort to save lives and support the recovery in Haiti. The losses that have been suffered in Haiti are nothing less than devastating, and responding to a disaster of this magnitude will require every element of our national capacity - our diplomacy and development assistance; the power of our military; and, most importantly, the compassion of our country.
President ObamaJanuary 14, 2010
In response to the President's direction, a whole of government effort has been launched to support the people of Haiti.
