    The President. I have come to this fantastic facility to, first of all, thank the people that have supported the programs that exist here. I like the idea of mentors reaching out to children to set good examples and to encourage them to achieve big goals in life. And that's what happens here in this Boys and Girls Club in Wichita. This is a place where dreams are fostered and skills are given so that people can realize their dreams.
This is a community-based program. It gets some help from the government, but it gets a lot of help from the local community. And I think it's very important for the people of Wichita to support program such as this. After all, we can change our country one heart and one soul at a time. So I'm really pleased to be here. It's a beautiful facility full of beautiful people.
And so thank you for giving me a chance to come by and say hello. Yes, you won an award didn't you?
Ciera Ivy. Yes.
The President. What award did you win?
Ms. Ivy. Youth of the Month.
The President. Youth of the Month. That's good. Congratulations to you.
Ms. Ivy. Thank you.
The President. I want to thank the counselors who are here and all the adults that are working with the boys and girls.
Anyway, nice to see you all. Thanks for coming by. Thank you.
