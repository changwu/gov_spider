    Michelle and I were saddened to hear about the passing of Congressman Jim Oberstar. Jim cared deeply about the people of Minnesota, devoting his 36 years of service to improving America's infrastructure, creating opportunity for hard-working Minnesotans, and building a strong economy for future generations of Americans. Jim will be deeply missed, and Michelle and I send our condolences to his wife Jean, his children, and grandchildren.
