    Wednesday, November 6th the First Lady will visit Boston, Massachusetts to highlight a treatment program for babies born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS), as part of her Be Best initiative.
Mrs. Trump will visit Boston Medical Center to learn about their Cuddling Assists in Lowering Maternal and Infant Stress (CALM) Program developed to treat babies born with NAS.
In addition to CALM, Boston Medical Center developed several other programs aimed to assist pregnant women with Substance Use Disorder (SUD) and newborn babies suffering from the impact of SUD. Mrs. Trump will receive a briefing from the Boston Medical Center Staff on the status of these programs. Following the briefing, Mrs. Trump will tour Boston Medical Center's Pediatric Unit to see first-hand how these programs are implemented and meet with the children and families who have been successfully treated.
