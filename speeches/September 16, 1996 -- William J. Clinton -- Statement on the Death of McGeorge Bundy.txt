    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of former National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy. During a career that joined public service and scholarship, McGeorge Bundy was a central figure in the postwar history of our Nation. He served Presidents Kennedy and Johnson with great distinction through difficult times, including the Cuban missile crisis and the early days of the war in Vietnam. After leaving Government, he continued to dedicate himself to strengthening our Nation through his long stewardship of the Ford Foundation. In books and articles published over five decades, McGeorge Bundy brought a compelling intelligence to some of the most important issues of our timesâ€”foremost among them, reducing the danger of nuclear weapons. At this time of sorrow, our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends.
