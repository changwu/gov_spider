    Today, Speaker of the Ohio House Clifford A. Rosenberger (R-Clarksville) endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich to be the next President of the United States. Rosenberger will serve as an Ohio Co-Chair of Kasich's campaign.
Rosenberger, a former Bush administration official, was elected to the Ohio House in 2011 and became Speaker in 2015. In 2015 he and Kasich worked together to pass a state budget that cut taxes by nearly $2 billion, including eliminating taxes for virtually every small business.
Rosenberger issued the following statement:
"Today, I am proud to endorse my friend and colleague Governor John Kasich for president. Our nation faces serious issues and we need a serious leader in the White House who doesn't require on-the-job training and who has proven he is not afraid to make tough decisions. During my time in the Ohio House, Governor Kasich has demonstrated time and again that he will never back down from a challenge and is not intimidated by the call to lead."
Kasich said: "As someone who has worked with the Speaker closely, I have enormous respect for his work ethic and commitment to the people of Ohio. Last year we worked together to pass a budget with record tax cuts and a record investment in education, all while maintaining a budget surplus. That takes teamwork and trust. Cliff is doing a fantastic job as Speaker of the House, and he will be a major asset to our team in Ohio."
As an Ohio Co-Chair of Kasich's campaign, Rosenberger will join U.S. Senator Rob Portman, Lieutenant Mary Taylor, Attorney General Mike DeWine, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, Auditor of State David Yost and Senate President Keith Faber in leading the Kasich campaign's Ohio efforts.
Nationally, Governor Kasich continues to build momentum. As evidenced by the four recent New Hampshire polls that have Kasich in 2nd place, he is surging in New Hampshire and confident in his team's efforts to reach as many voters as possible before the February 9th primary election.
