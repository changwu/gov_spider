    Dear Mr. President:
I was distressed to learn of the extensive damage and suffering caused by yesterday's earthquake in Romania. My family and I, and the American people, share your nation's shock and sorrow. The United States stands ready to extend emergency assistance to ease the suffering of those who were injured or made homeless by this tragic event.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
