    My dear Admiral:
In calling you to active duty as Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief of the United States Army and Navy, I accept your resignation as Ambassador to France.
In so doing I want you to know first of all of my great satisfaction in the way in which you have carried out an extremely difficult task at an extremely difficult time and, second, that there has been such good agreement in our national policy in respect to France during your Ambassadorship. In the words of the Navyâ€”"well done."
Always sincerely your friend,
Franklin D. Roosevelt
