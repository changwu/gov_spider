    Yesterday, White House Gender Policy Council Director Jennifer Klein and staff from the Office of the Vice President and the White House Office of Public Engagement convened a meeting with a diverse group of national religious denominational leaders on reproductive rights. Attendees discussed the importance of protecting access to health care, including reproductive health care, with a particular emphasis on the importance of equitable access for underserved communities.
