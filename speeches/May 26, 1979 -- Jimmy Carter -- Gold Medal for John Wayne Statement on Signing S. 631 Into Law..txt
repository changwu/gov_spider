    I have today approved S. 631, a bill to authorize the presentation of a specially struck gold medal to John Wayne. For nearly half a century, the Duke has symbolized the American ideals of integrity, courage, patriotism, and strength and has represented to the world many of the deepest values that this Nation respects. His conduct off the screen has been as exemplary as that of the characters he has portrayed. He has served, and will continue to serve, as a model for America's young people.
I ask all Americans to join with me in expressing our best wishes to John Wayne as he celebrates his 72d birthday this Saturday.
