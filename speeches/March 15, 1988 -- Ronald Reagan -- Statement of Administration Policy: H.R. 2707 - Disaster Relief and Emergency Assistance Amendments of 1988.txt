    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Ridge (R) Pennsylvania and 109 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2707 because it contains numerous provisions which, contrary to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement, would result in substantial increases in Federal Disaster Relief expenditures. In addition, the Administration is concerned that several provisions of H.R. 2707 would unduly constrain the authority of the President and conflict with other statutory provisions.
The Administration believes that any legislation revising the Disaster Relief program must, at a minimum, be deficit neutral, and should be consistent with the principles set forth in the Federal Emergency Management Agency's report dated March 8, 1988, to the Public Works and Transportation Committtee.
