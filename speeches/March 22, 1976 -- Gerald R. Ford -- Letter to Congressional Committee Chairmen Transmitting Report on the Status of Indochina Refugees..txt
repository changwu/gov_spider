    IN ACCORDANCE with the provisions of the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975, I am reporting to you on the status of refugees from Cambodia and Vietnam.
I am proud of the fact that we were able to achieve our goal of complete refugee resettlement before the end of calendar year 1975. My first three reports to the Congress described the activities undertaken to successfully complete the resettlement phase of the program. The task since that time has been to provide the Indochina refugee necessary assistance in his becoming a stir-reliant member of his new community. I must report that in the majority of cases the Indochina refugee is achieving his assimilation into American society largely on his own efforts. Numbers of refugees, however, do require financial, medical, or educational assistance. Through private and governmental efforts we have been able to provide that assistance.
On the whole, I believe this report will show an encouraging start has been made in assisting the Indochina refugee to participate fully in American life.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
