    Verona, PA - Adding to his 22 point win in Louisiana this weekend, Rick Santorum also won a major straw poll this weekend as Pennsylvanians picked Rick Santorum by almost double the margin over Mitt Romney.
At the Pennsylvania Leadership Conference on Saturday, Rick Santorum was the attendees' clear choice for President, receiving 147 of the 323 votes cast, followed by Romney with 91, Ron Paul with 50, and Newt Gingrich in last place with 35 votes.
Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said "While Mitt Romney continues to claim he's the inevitable candidate, and his team says those who don't support Romney are insignificant, America's voters continue to pick Rick Santorum as the candidate they trust to stand up for our freedom and advance a pro-growth, pro-family agenda to revitalize our nation. Voters in Pennsylvania and across the country are sending a clear message that they don't want another Etch A Sketch politician who has spent his entire career promoting big government top down solutions. Rick Santorum is the only candidate who believes in the American people and will stand up for freedom no matter which way the political wind is blowing."
