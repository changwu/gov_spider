    The President has declared a major disaster exists in the State of Tennessee and ordered Federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the area struck by a series of storms and tornados on November 11, 2002.
Federal funding is available to eligible individuals in the counties of Anderson, Bedford, Carroll, Coffee, Crockett, Cumberland, Gibson, Henderson, Madison, Marshall, Montgomery, Morgan, Rutherford, Scott, Sumner and Tipton.
The assistance, to be coordinated by the Federal Emergency Management Agence (FEMA), can include grants to help pay for temporary housing, home repairs and other serious disaster related expenses. Federal funding is also available on a cost share basis for hazard mitigation measures.
Joe M. Allbaugh, FEMA Director, named Gracia Szczech as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The Agency said that damage surveys are continuing in other areas, and additional jurisdictions may be designated after the assessments are completed.
