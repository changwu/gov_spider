    Mrs. Clinton and I are deeply saddened over the passing of President Turgut Ozal of Turkey. We have expressed our condolences to the Acting President of Turkey, Hussametin Cindoruk, and to Mrs. Semra Ozal at this difficult and sad time. Friends of Turkey everywhere mourn his passing.
President Ozal devoted his life to public service, and Turkey is a stronger country because of his dedicated and visionary leadership. President Ozal's mark on the political life of Turkey, both at home and abroad, has been extraordinary. He crafted a new regional role for his country, stressing always the importance of democracy, trade, and peace. The alliance of Turkey and the United States is stronger today because of the personal leadership of the late President.
On behalf of all Americans, Mrs. Clinton and I extend our heartfelt sympathies to the people of Turkey and to the family and friends of President Ozal.
