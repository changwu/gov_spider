in town pool report #5 - POTUS finishes, takes Qs 
The remarks were live-streamed so I won't send a recap, but POTUS noted that the gas situation will return largely to normal by this weekend and urged Americans to remain calm.
"I know seeing lines at the pumps … can be extremely stressful. But this is a temporary situation."
"Panic buying will only slow the process."
He warned gas station owners against taking advantage of consumers: "Nobody should be using this situation for financial gain.
Said: "We do not believe the Russian government was involved in this attack," but had "strong" reason to believe the criminals are in Russia
On Q+A:
POTUS says he expects to discuss this issue in his meeting with Putin. "We are working to try to get to the place where we have sort of an international standard … That we all move on those criminal enterprises."
When asked if he's confident Putin was not involved, POTUS says "I am confident that I have read the report in the FBI accurately," and says Putin was not involved.
When asked if he was ruling out retaliatory cyberattacks, POTUS said "No."
On whether he had been briefed that the company had paid the ransom, POTUS said: "I have no comment on that."
POTUS wrapped at 12:40 p.m. Pls check all quotes against transcript.

In town pool report #8 — POTUS + senators in the Oval
Pool ushered into the Oval at 1:42 p.m. POTUS spoke very briefly, said he got together with the senators at their "mutual request." He wants to define what "constitutes infrastructure from both our perspectives" then discuss how much we want to fund above the baseline levels of spending from last year. Says he believes the discussions are in "good faith."
On one shouted Q re: whether he was prepared to make a lower offer, POTUS said: "I'm prepared to compromise."
Seated on the couch to POTUS' left was Sen. Capito and Secretary Raimondo. On the couch across from them (to VP's right) was Sen Crapo and Secretary Buttigieg. Sitting on socially distanced chairs across from POTUS/VP were Sens. Barrasso, Blunt, Toomey and Wicker.
Pool ushered out at 1:44 p.m.

In town pool report #8a - more POTUS quotes from Oval meeting 
Please, as usual, check against the transcript. Some more quotes ahead of POTUS meeting with Republican senators:
"We'll see if we can work out some, on a compromise on infrastructure. And I know they're sincere about it, so am I. And what we're going to try to do is figure out what we can – what constitutes infrastructure from … our perspectives and then see whether or not we're in a position that -- how, how much we want to fund it above the baseline, the baseline meaning what we spent last year, and then talk about how to proceed from there."
"It's a genuine effort, I think we get there," and just in case, POTUS brought along two secretaries (Buttigieg and Raimondo) "who are smarter than I am."

In town pool report #14 — Rose Garden remarks
POTUS came out into the Rose Garden at 3:57 p.m. The remarks were carried live but some quick notes: POTUS said today's CDC news on mask guidance was a "great milestone." Said as of today, the U.S. has administered 250 million shots in 114 days.Also noted there are 580,073 lost lives due to covid-19.At the progress, POTUS said he was "Pleased but not surprised.""The American people have never ever ever let their country down."POTUS stressed: "If you are fully vaccinated, you no longer need to wear a mask."He also said if you see someone wearing a mask, "please treat them with kindness and respect."
POTUS was asked how you enforce unvaccinated people from not taking off their masks. "We don't enforce it .... It's not an enforcement thing, we're not gonna go out and arrest people." Says "vast majority" of Americans care about the safety of others.
Says his meeting with GOP senators was "very very good" and said he was "very optimistic" on a deal, but "even if we don't," that it was a "good faith" effort. Says they'll talk again next week.
He left the Rose Garden at 4:11 p.m. Please as usual check quotes against transcript.
Should add from note in earlier pool report that the senior White House aides present in the Rose Garden were not wearing masks.
