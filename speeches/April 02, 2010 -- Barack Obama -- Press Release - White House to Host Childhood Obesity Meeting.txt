    WASHINGTON, D.C. -- On Friday, April 9, the White House will host a meeting on childhood obesity to discuss ways to combat the growing health epidemic. Experts and practitioners from across the country will join First Lady Michelle Obama, Administration officials and Childhood Obesity Task Force members to discuss challenges, trends, empowering parents, access to healthy, affordable food, and more.
In February, Mrs. Obama launched the Letâ€™s Move! campaign to solve the childhood obesity epidemic within a generation. As part of this effort, and President Barack Obama established the Task Force on Childhood Obesity to develop and submit an interagency plan that details a coordinated strategy, identifies key benchmarks, and outlines an action plan to fight childhood obesity. This meeting is part of a broader effort by the Task Force to gather input for this action plan.
Participants and coverage details will be announced next week.
