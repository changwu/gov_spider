    The President is pleased that the United States and Canada today reached agreement on a final text that will conclude the long-standing dispute on softwood lumber trade. Many difficult issues were overcome by both sides in concluding this text, and we look forward to the agreement taking effect this fall. The President appreciates Prime Minister Harper's strong leadership on this issue, and congratulates the lead negotiators on both sides, U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab and Ambassador Michael Wilson of Canada.
