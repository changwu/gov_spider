    DENVER, CO - Today, Hickenlooper 2020 filed its first-quarter filing report with the FEC. The campaign reported raising over $2 million in its first four weeks, with donations coming from all 50 states.
"As this report reflects, the Governor has a decisive base of support in Colorado and his record of results is resonating with supporters across the country. This strong early fundraising will allow us to make sure more Americans know about the Governor's pragmatic progressive vision," said Hickenlooper 2020 Campaign Manager, Brad Komar.
Over 97% raised can be used in the Governor's primary campaign. The campaign is not actively soliciting general election contributions. Ninety-three percent of the donors who gave to Hickenlooper 2020 can give again. Eighty-five percent of donations were under $200. Approximately half of the donations came from outside of Colorado. Cash on hand is over $1.33 million.
