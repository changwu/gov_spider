    The President today recognized the new Czech and Slovak Republics and offered to establish full diplomatic relations. In an exchange of letters, Czech Prime Minister Klaus and Slovak Prime Minister Meciar welcomed U.S. recognition and accepted our offer of full diplomatic relations.
Both leaders provided assurances that the new states will fulfill the obligations and commitments of the former Czechoslovakia and will abide by the principles and provisions of the U.N. Charter, the Charter of Paris, the Helsinki Final Act and subsequent CSCE documents. They also pledged to prevent the proliferation of destabilizing military technology, to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, to uphold international standards concerning national minorities, and to move rapidly to create free-market economies.
The United States looks forward to full and mutually productive relations with the new Czech and Slovak states. We commend both Republics for the peaceful means by which their separation was carried out. In the interest of ensuring stability and prosperity in the region and speeding full integration into the international community, the United States urges continued close regional cooperation among the states of central Europe.
Our Ambassador to Czechoslovakia will remain in Prague as the U.S. Ambassador to the Czech Republic. We look forward to appointing an Ambassador to the Slovak Republic as soon as possible.
