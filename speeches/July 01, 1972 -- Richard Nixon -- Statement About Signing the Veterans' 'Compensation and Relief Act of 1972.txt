    I AM pleased to have signed into law S. 3338, the Veterans' Compensation and Relief Act of 1972.
At my request the Veterans Administration proposed legislation to increase veterans disability compensation benefits in order to meet rises in the cost of living, and I am gratified that the Congress has responded to my request with this act.
I would also like to express my appreciation to the Congress for their cooperation with my efforts to have this act delivered to me so that I can sign it into law before midnight tonight [June 30]. As a result, the increased compensation benefits will now be delivered to disabled veterans beginning August 1, 1972, rather than a month later.
Among other things, this act provides for a 10-percent increase in the monthly payment for disabled veterans and a similar increase in allowances for those more seriously disabled veterans with dependents.
This is the second opportunity I have had during my Administration to sign into effect an increase in disabled veterans compensation benefits. I am pleased that these benefit increases will soon be helping over e million of our most deserving men and women.
