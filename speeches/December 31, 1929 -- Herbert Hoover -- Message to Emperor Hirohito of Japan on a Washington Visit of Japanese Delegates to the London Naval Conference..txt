    BOTH Mrs. Hoover and I were very happy to have Mr. Wakatsuki and the other members of the Japanese Delegation as our guests and we are gratified to learn that their visit to our Capital city was a pleasant one. The American Delegates to the London Conference were most pleased to meet their fellow Japanese Delegates and look forward to reciprocal and hearty cooperation in their coming mission.
