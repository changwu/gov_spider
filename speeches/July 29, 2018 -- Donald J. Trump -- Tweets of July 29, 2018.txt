Please understand there are consequences when people cross our Border illegally whether they have children or not - and many are just using children for their own sinister purposes. Congress must act on fixing the DUMBEST & WORST immigration laws anywhere in the world! Vote 'R'Retweets: 33183Favorites: 127626

Had a very good and interesting meeting at the White House with A.G. Sulzberger Publisher of the New York Times. Spent much time talking about the vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media & how that Fake News has morphed into phrase 'Enemy of the People.' Sad!Retweets: 18359Favorites: 75592

The biggest and best results coming out of the good GDP report was that the quarterly Trade Deficit has been reduced by $52 Billion and of course the historically low unemployment numbers especially for African Americans Hispanics Asians and Women.Retweets: 21443Favorites: 88751

I would be willing to 'shut down' government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security which includes the Wall! Must get rid of Lottery Catch & Release etc. and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT! We need great people coming into our Country!Retweets: 34842Favorites: 135850

When the media - driven insane by their Trump Derangement Syndrome - reveals internal deliberations of our government it truly puts the lives of many not just journalists at risk! Very unpatriotic! Freedom of the press also comes with a responsibility to report the news...Retweets: 22434Favorites: 91737

...accurately. 90% of media coverage of my Administration is negative despite the tremendously positive results we are achieving it's no surprise that confidence in the media is at an all time low!

There is No Collusion! The Robert Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt headed now by 17 (increased from 13 including an Obama White House lawyer) Angry Democrats was started by a fraudulent Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC. Therefore the Witch Hunt is an illegal Scam!Retweets: 31048Favorites: 115212

Is Robert Mueller ever going to release his conflicts of interest with respect to President Trump including the fact that we had a very nasty & contentious business relationship I turned him down to head the FBI (one day before appointment as S.C.) & Comey is his close friend..Retweets: 24839Favorites: 87857

....Also why is Mueller only appointing Angry Dems some of whom have worked for Crooked Hillary others including himself have worked for Obama....And why isn't Mueller looking at all of the criminal activity & real Russian Collusion on the Democrats side-Podesta Dossier?Retweets: 25755Favorites: 96234
