    I AM profoundly distressed at the news of the sudden passing of Douglas Southall Freeman.
America has lost one of her most distinguished citizens--a fine historian and an outstanding American. He was a true and valued personal friend whom I shall miss greatly.
Mrs. Eisenhower and I extend our deep sympathy to Mrs. Freeman and the members of her family.
