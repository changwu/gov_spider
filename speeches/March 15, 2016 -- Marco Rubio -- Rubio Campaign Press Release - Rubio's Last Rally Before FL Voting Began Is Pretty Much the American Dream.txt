March 15, 2016
Marco returned last night to a park he played basketball in as a kid for one last rally before voting in Florida began.
It was a humble affair for a candidate with humble origins.

In fact, Marco's stage was the back of a pickup truck:

Marco reminded those gathered in this community of exiles about the danger of personality cults and mob movements:

He was  happy to acknowledge he's an underdog, but his hometown supporters believe he  can make it happen. From the local NBC station:

  Speaking through a weak-sounding bullhorn, Rubio did not deny the daunting task ahead.
"If this community doesn't vote tomorrow in historic numbers, I'm not sure I'm going to win," Rubio told the crowd in Spanish.
The West Miami audience cheered on as Rubio talked about a White House kitchen filled with croquetas, cafecito, and a caja china to roast a pig.
"I think he can pull it off. If there's anyone that can pull it off it will be Marco Rubio," supporter Luis Valverde said.
