    Atlanta, GA – Former presidential candidate and Georgia businessman Herman Cain announced his endorsement of Newt Gingrich for president earlier this evening at the Palm Beach County GOP Lincoln Day Dinner.  In addition to his endorsement, Cain has accepted Newt's invitation to co-chair the Tax Reform and Economic Growth Advisory Council for Speaker Gingrich.
"It is time for conservatives and Republicans to refocus their attention on the ultimate mission of defeating President Obama," Cain said. "I believe Speaker Gingrich is the bold leader we need to accomplish this mission."
"America's challenges are too great for mere tinkering around the edges. Just like Herman, who ran his campaign based on big ideas, I am running on bold solutions that will boost job creation, cut bureaucratic red tape, and fundamentally transform Washington," Gingrich said. "I'm honored to have Herman's support, and I look forward to working with him to help put the American people back to work."
Cain and Gingrich have been friends for more than 20 years. In the early 1990's they worked together to defeat Hillarycare, and as speaker, Gingrich appointed Cain to the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform (also known as the "Kemp Commission").
