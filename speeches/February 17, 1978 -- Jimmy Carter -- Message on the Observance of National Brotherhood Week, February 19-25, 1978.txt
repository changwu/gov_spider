    I have said on many occasions that government cannot solve all of the critical problems we face. Our ability to surmount these challenges of modern life depends greatly on the selflessness, generosity and resilience of our spirit as a people.
In the earliest days of our history when there was little organized government, everything often depended on the willingness of individuals to help each other, to work together as brothers for the common good. The observance of National Brotherhood Week focuses on the value of such personal commitment. It gives us a chance to look with pride on a heritage that was profoundly strengthened and enriched by it, and it encourages us to revitalize and expand it in our family, community and national life today.
Be it the day-to-day plight of the poor, the elderly, the sick or the disadvantaged; be it an unexpected disaster or misfortune-there are endless opportunities for us to show our kindness and goodwill toward those in need.
Inspired by the courage, compassion and unselfish perseverance of our forebears, let us join with the National Conference of Christians and Jews in making this Brotherhood Week the rallying point of a renewed commitment to accept freely and fully our individual responsibilities as members of a democratic society.
