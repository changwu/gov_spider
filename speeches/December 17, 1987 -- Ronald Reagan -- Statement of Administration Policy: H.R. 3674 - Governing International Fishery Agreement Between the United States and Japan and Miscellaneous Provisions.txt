    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Studds (D) Massachusetts and Young (R) Alaska)
The administration opposes H.R. 3674 unless it is amended to delete: (1) Title III, which would amend and extend the National Sea Grant College Program, and (2) Title V, which amends the Jones Act with respect to sewage sludge barges and certain launch barges.
The National Sea Grant College Program was proposed for termination in the 1988 Budget because State and local governments and industries, the primary beneficiaries of the program, should now assume responsibility for funding of sea grant activities. With respect to the Jones Act amendments, the administration opposes proposals which would appear to extend Jones Act requirements generally to the Exclusive Economic Zone or which provide special interest exemptions from the Act.
The administration urges that H.R. 3674 not be amended to include new provisions that could impede the prospect for extension of the Governing International Fishery Agreement contained in Title I.
