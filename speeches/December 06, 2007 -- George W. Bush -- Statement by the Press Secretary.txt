    We appreciate the U.S. Senate passing a clean, one-year patch of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) this evening - as the President has called on them to do since February. If left unaddressed, the AMT would result in an unexpected, unfair tax increase for as many as 25 million Americans. This would mean that these taxpayers would have to pay, on average, an extra $2000 in higher taxes next year. We encourage the House of Representatives to swiftly pass this bill to stop this tax increase, and to prevent a costly delay in refunds.
