    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Sen. Cohen (R) Maine and seven others)
If S. 1721 is presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that it be vetoed because the bill raises a number of serious constitutional issues.
Specifically S. 1721 would:

—    unconstitutionally infringe on the foreign policy powers of the President by requiring him to report every "finding" approving a covert activity to the intelligence committees of Congress within 48 hours of the signing of that finding; and
—    seriously impinge on the President's ability to fulfill his constitutional duties in the field of foreign affairs by virtually eliminating the flexibility to determine the timing and substance of congressional notification due to the disclosure requirements in sections 502 and 503.
