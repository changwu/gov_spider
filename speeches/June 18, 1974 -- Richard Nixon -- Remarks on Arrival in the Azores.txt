    Mr. President:
I am very pleased that our first stop after returning from the Mideast is in this friendly country of Portugal, and I look forward to the first opportunity to have a talk with you about our mutual relations between two countries that have such a close, friendly relationship.
PRESIDENT ANTONIO DE SPINOLA. I am also very happy to have this opportunity to meet with the President of the United States, the first chief of state I meet after the events of the 25th of April.
THE PRESIDENT. I am very honored.
