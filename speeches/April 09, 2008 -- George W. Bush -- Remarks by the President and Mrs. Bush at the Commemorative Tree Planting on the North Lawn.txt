    MRS. BUSH: We are replacing the Scarlet Oak that fell earlier -- actually, I think it was before Christmas, that was planted by Benjamin Harrison, I think in 1898*, I believe, is when it was planted. And so now we're replacing it. And we've invited descendants of Benjamin Harrison to come help us plant it. So we see all the family members over here, and three -- two great-great-grandsons, and one great-grandson of Benjamin Harrison who are here with us.
So we're ready to do it. Are you ready?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes, getting ready to shovel -- (laughter) -- dirt.
