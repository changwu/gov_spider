    Hello, Ohio! How you all doing? Thank you, guys. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you so much.
Thank you, everybody. So it is good to be back in Columbus, Ohio. And I'm so sorry that we can't fit everybody into the other place, but I wanted to make sure that I came by just to say thank you for everything you've done for me. Thank you for everything you've done for Michelle and the girls. Your support has meant everything to us.
But there's one last thing I need you to do, and that is make sure that my successor, the 45th President, is Hillary Clinton. Make sure mom, dad, grandpa, grandma, aunts, uncles are voting.
This one is too important to sit out. And if you care about all the progress we've made over the last 8 years, then all that progress is on the ballot even if I'm not.
So I just want to say, I love you guys. I appreciate you. Let's make sure we keep Ohio blue!
Thank you, everybody. God bless you.
