    I am pleased that the United States and Canada concluded a framework agreement today to resolve the long-standing dispute on softwood lumber trade. This agreement shows how NAFTA partners can overcome differences and work together. The United States close ties with our good friend and northern neighbor made this agreement possible. I applaud Prime Minister Harper's leadership in resolving this issue, and I am grateful to the lead negotiators on both sides, Ambassador Susan C. Schwab for the United States and Ambassador Michael Wilson of Canada.
