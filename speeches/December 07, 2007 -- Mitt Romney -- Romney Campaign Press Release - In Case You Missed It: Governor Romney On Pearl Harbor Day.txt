Governor Romney: "And the significance is not lost on me that we're here on the day where we commemorate the loss of 2,400 lives at Pearl Harbor. Their memory is etched in our minds and this is a date which will long live in infamy as we recognize the infamous attack against our sovereignty and our peace and our citizens."
