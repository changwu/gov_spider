    Vice President Biden met today with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis. The two leaders discussed bilateral relations, European security, anti-corruption, energy security, and the European migration crisis. The leaders discussed ways to strengthen bilateral relations in the security, political, and economic spheres, as well as Romania's important contributions to NATO security efforts, including its support for the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan and the hosting of a missile defense site at Deveselu, which will become operational later this year. The Vice President welcomed President Iohannis' focus on anti-corruption efforts and rule of law as a means to strengthen national security and promote greater investment and economic growth. Finally, the two leaders discussed the importance of having a unified European approach to both energy security and the current migration crisis.
