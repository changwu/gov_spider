    SANTA FE -- New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson issued the following statement today urging North Korean leaders to move quickly to honor their commitment to him and invite the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to monitor the shutdown of North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear facility.
During a bipartisan mission to Pyongyang in April, Governor Richardson and former Veterans Affairs Secretary Anthony Principi pressed North Korean leaders to shut down the reactor and put it under international monitoring. They were assured that as soon as frozen North Korean banking assets in Macao were made available, North Korea would immediately invite the IAEA to oversee the shutdown.
Governor Richardson received word today that the North Korean banking assets are now available to the DPRK through an account in a Russian bank.
"The North Koreans pledged to me when I was there in April that they would invite the IAEA to return to oversee the shutdown of the nuclear facility as soon as the banking issue was resolved," Governor Richardson said. "I urge them to act swiftly now to invite the inspectors back in. Another round of Six Party Talks should take place soon followed by the six-way Foreign Minister-level talks called for in the Feb. 13th agreement. The parties should now move quickly to make up for lost time."
