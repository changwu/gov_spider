    To the Congress of the United States:
Weather and climate are at once familiar and sources of deep concern. Through technology, we have minimized the harmful effects of weather and have adapted our civilization to a wide range of climatic conditions. Yet, we now know how fragile is the balance between our activities and the environment. Understanding that balance is the key to the successful management of energy, food, and water resources and the beneficial application of technology. Our national goals in improving weather predictions and warnings and coping with the vagaries of climate cannot be accomplished except in the context of a worldwide endeavor. All nations play roles; the United States can be truly proud of our contributions.
The World Weather Program is the U.S. commitment to an effort that will affect every one of us. I am pleased to report significant and continuing progress in furthering the goals of the World Weather Program. The following accomplishments are representative of the progress being made:
--There has been a smooth transition into the operational use of geostationary meteorological satellites. The Western Hemisphere, much of the Atlantic, and part of the Pacific are now observed continuously. A nationwide network of Satellite Field Service Stations has been implemented by NOAA to capitalize on these new data. Hurricane and typhoon forecasting has been aided, for example, as has the observation, tracking, and warning of severe weather over the United States.
--The data processing system at the World Meteorological Center, Suitland, Maryland, has been expanded through the operational use of a third, fourth-generation computer. This system is essential to handle the improved forecast models and the increased volume of data being received from the World Weather Watch.
--Augmented environmental monitoring and climatic programs have been initiated at the South Pole, American Samoa, and Barrow, Alaska.
--Engineering tests have been completed on large meteorological and oceanographic buoys. The first prototype operational system was moored 240 miles off the Oregon coast. Others are scheduled for operation this summer.
--The initial data-processing phase for the Global Atmospheric Research Program's (GARP) Atlantic Tropical Experiment has been completed and scientific analysis is well underway.
--A series of Data Systems Tests have been completed as a dress rehearsal for the First GARP Global Experiment which starts in 1978.
--The Global Experiment received major impetus when over 40 nations met in February 1976 and agreed to commit ships, buoys, balloon systems, satellites, and other critical facilities for the observational period planned for 1977-1979.
It is with pleasure that I transmit this annual report describing current planned Federal activities contributing to the World Weather Program. The report details how the United States is following the intent of Senate Concurrent Resolution 67 of the 90th Congress to participate in this international program.
