    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Herger (R) CA and 13 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3463, the SUTA Dumping Prevention Act, which would strengthen the financial integrity of State unemployment insurance (UI) programs. The bill would support the President's Management Agenda by saving hundreds of millions of dollars in fraudulent UI benefit payments and reduce tax avoidance by employers.
The Administration urges Congress to act on these common-sense reforms to promote fairness and reduce erroneous payments.
