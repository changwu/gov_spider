    The Federal Government bankrolls so many unnecessary and opulent programs, yet it constantly fails to accomplish it's basic duties, and the private sector suffers as a result. In Louisiana I slashed the budget 26% and eliminated 30,000 unnecessary bureaucrat jobs, put the government on a diet and I will do the same thing in DC. Sign the petition if you want a smaller federal government.
