    "Conservatism, Republicanism, is a philosophy of strength. We believe in a strong military, a strong economy, and in strong families and values. We believe in the American people. ... And when you need to call on the strength of America, you don't strengthen government, you strengthen the American people." - Gov. Mitt Romney (Gov. Mitt Romney, Remarks At The Young Republican National Convention, Hollywood, FL, 7/7/07)

Gov. Romney Believes In Private, Market-Based Health Insurance And Encouraging Personal Responsibility:
Gov. Romney's Plan Emphasizes Individual State-By-State Health Care Reform, Not Universal Health Care. "Governor Romney's health care reform plan is a comprehensive solution to America's health care ills that expands access to affordable, portable, quality, private health insurance. But rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all, government-run system, Governor Romney's plan recognizes the importance of the role of the states in leading reform and the need for innovation in dealing with rising health care costs and the problem of the uninsured." (Romney For President, "Expanding Access To Affordable Health Care," Press Release, 8/24/07)
Gov. Romney Believes That A "One-Size-Fits-All" Approach To Health Care Reform Is Wrong. "But [Gov. Romney] will also aim to reassure conservatives by saying that a 'one size fits all' solution isn't right for the 50 states. As for why he would use a different philosophy as president than as governor, they say he would have greater powers in the White House. 'Massachusetts didn't have the federal tax code to play with,' said Glenn Hubbard, a former Bush administration chief economist, now advising the Romney campaign." (Mary Jacoby and Sarah Lueck, "Romney's Federal Prescription," The Wall Street Journal, 8/24/07)

Sen. Clinton On Paying For Her Big Government Health Plan: "That's Going To Mean Taking Money Away From People Who Make Out Really Well Right Now." "On Saturday, she said that the failure of her proposal for universal coverage in 1994 made her more determined to achieve the goal now. 'It also makes me understand what we are up against,' Mrs. Clinton said. 'We have to modernize and reform the way we deliver health care. But we have to change the way we finance it. That's going to mean taking money away from people who make out really well right now.'" (Robert Pear, "Candidates Outline Ideas For Universal Health Care," The New York Times, 3/25/07)
Sen. Obama Would Pay For His Government-Run Health Plan By Rolling Back Tax Cuts. "Obama said his plan could save the average consumer $2,500 a year and bring health care to all.

("Obama Unveils Universal Health Care Plan," The Associated Press, 5/29/07)
Sen. Edwards "Would Raise Taxes" To Pay For His Health Plan. "Seven Democratic candidates for president promised Saturday to guarantee health insurance for all, but they disagreed over how to pay for it and how fast it could be achieved. ... John Edwards, the former senator from North Carolina, offered the most detailed plan for universal coverage, saying he would raise taxes to help pay the cost, which he estimated at $90 billion to $120 billion a year." (Robert Pear, "Candidates Outline Ideas For Universal Health Care," The New York Times, 3/25/07)
THE ROMNEY VISION: FREE AND FAIR TRADE
Gov. Romney Supports Free And Fair Trade:

(Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At The Detroit Economic Club, Detroit, MI, 2/7/07)
- Gov. Romney: "A safe and prosperous Western Hemisphere requires a strong and democratic Colombia. ... We can and must consolidate the gains we have made in Colombia by strengthening the economic ties between our countries.

(Romney For President, "Statement On Colombia's Independence Day," Press Release, 7/20/07)
The Democrats: Protectionism At The Expense Of Our Key Allies:
Democrats Have Opposed Free Trade Deals With Latin America. "Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and former Sen. John Edwards - who is the most isolationist of them all - have all opposed the 2005 U.S. free-trade deal with Central America and the Dominican Republic (CAFTA). And now, they are balking at crucial free-trade deals with Peru, Panama and Colombia, which are crucial for these countries. Without mentioning that free-trade deals often create more jobs than they displace, Edwards claims that free-trade agreements 'have devastated towns and communities across this country.'" (Andres Oppenheimer, "Democrats Should Be Grilled On Trade Policy," The Miami Herald, 9/6/07)
THE ROMNEY VISION: STRONGER RELATIONS WITH LATIN AMERICA
Gov. Romney Believes America Should Strengthen Our Allies, Instead Of Coddling Our Enemies:
Gov. Romney: "Last night, Senators Obama and Edwards demonstrated a dangerous naivete about the Castro Brothers and Hugo Chavez. Instead of embracing these brutal dictators, we need to work with freedom-loving people in their countries. Too many have sacrificed in the pursuit of Cuba's freedom for Barack Obama and John Edwards to abandon them now. Too many in Venezuela are working to reverse the dangerous course Chavez has embarked on. We must be steadfast in our vision of a free and democratic Cuba and Venezuela." (Romney For President, "Statement On Democratic Debate," Press Release, 7/24/07)
Gov. Romney Has Proposed A Seven-Point Latin American Strategy. "It is time for the United States to adopt a Latin American strategy that will strengthen human rights and freedom, that will advance our own interests, and that will weaken the threat of the Castros and Chavez. I propose seven elements in this strategy." (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At The Miami-Dade Lincoln Day Dinner, Miami, FL, 3/9/07)

The senator from Illinois responded: 'I would, and the reason is this: the notion that somehow not talking to countries is somehow punishing them, which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration, is ridiculous.'" (Beth Reinhard, "Obama, Edwards Say They Would Meet With Castro, Chavez," The Miami Herald, 7/24/07)
Former Sen. Edwards Suggests He Would Meet With Castro And Chavez. "The question was then posed to Edwards, who said, 'Yes, I think Senator Clinton is right, though. Before that meeting takes place, we need to do the work, the diplomacy to make sure the meeting is not going to be used for propaganda purposes.'" (Beth Reinhard, "Obama, Edwards Say They Would Meet With Castro, Chavez," The Miami Herald, 7/24/07)
