NBC News incorrectly reported (as usual) that I was limiting the FBI investigation of Judge Kavanaugh and witnesses only to certain people. Actually I want them to interview whoever they deem appropriate at their discretion. Please correct your reporting!Retweets: 45075Favorites: 159356

Like many I don't watch Saturday Night Live (even though I past hosted it) - no longer funny no talent or charm. It is just a political ad for the Dems. Word is that Kanye West who put on a MAGA hat after the show (despite being told 'no') was great. He's leading the charge!Retweets: 46040Favorites: 221791

So if African-American unemployment is now at the lowest number in history median income the highest and you then add all of the other things I have done how do Democrats who have done NOTHING for African-Americans but TALK win the Black Vote? And it will only get better!Retweets: 34181Favorites: 136934

Wow! Just starting to hear the Democrats who are only thinking Obstruct and Delay are starting to put out the word that the 'time' and 'scope' of FBI looking into Judge Kavanaugh and witnesses is not enough. Hello! For them it will never be enough - stay tuned and watch!Retweets: 37794Favorites: 141208
