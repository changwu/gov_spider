    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Maryland Treasurer Nancy K. Kopp.
"I support Hillary because I think she's the best candidate -- bright, tough, experienced and devoted to public service. She is a person of great substance and depth. I know she'll be a great President," Kopp said. "As State Treasurer I know we have to invest wisely and prudently in our families, our communities and our environment if we aim to assure a bright future for all our children. Hillary has shown she has the strength and experience to deliver the change America needs."
Kopp took office in 2002, and was elected in 2003 and again in 2007. She is Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Maryland State Retirement and Pension Systems, Chair of the College Savings Plans of Maryland and a member of the Maryland Supplemental Retirement Board. She is Chair of the Northeast State Treasurers organization and was recently elected Treasurer of the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers.
Prior to her election as Treasurer, Kopp served in the Maryland House of Delegates for 27 years. She chaired the Joint Committee on Spending Affordability, as well as the Appropriations Subcommittee on Education and Economic Development. At various times during her tenure, she served as Deputy Majority Leader and Speaker Pro Tem. During her legislative career, Kopp was named by her colleagues as the most effective woman legislator and one of the ten most effective members of the House.
"Nancy has devoted her life to serving the people of Maryland," Clinton said. "I'm honored to have her support and delighted that she'll help bring our message of change across the state."
Treasurer Kopp joins a host of Maryland leaders already endorsing Clinton, including Governor Martin O'Malley, Senator Barbara Mikulski, Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown, Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger and dozens of state legislators and local officials.
