    Merry Christmas.
First of all, let me say that Rosalynn and I want to welcome you to the White House to an old-fashioned Christmas party. We had anticipated having a very warm day today, but Pat Caddell's survey was not exactly accurate. But I hope you won't be too cold, because the entertainment we have is going to warm everybody up.
We've got snow in the background, and after the show is over we've got refreshments and also sleigh rides for thoseâ€”or rather, hayrides for those who want to enjoy them, and if you would like to go inside the White House to get warm and enjoy the beauty of the tree which is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. The decorations are in the Victorian style.
This is the, I think, 181st Christmas at the White House, and it's the 80th Christmas since the Secret Service began to protect the President. Through, I think, 14 administrations and something like 17 campaigns the Secret Service has provided safety and protection and security for the First Family and those who sought the Presidency. And as we approach this holiday season, Rosalynn and Amy and I and all our boys and grandchildren want to express our deep appreciation to all of you for being so wonderful to us, for keeping us safe, sometimes at the danger of your own lives, and we just want to say, God bless you, Merry Christmas to you. Have a good time this afternoon.
You have performed like true Olympians, and this afternoon to entertain you, I would like to introduce a real Olympic star, someone who's soon to show you that she's poetry on ice, a young woman who is a gold medal winner in the winter Olympics, who comes here as part of the only cabaret ice show this side of Las Vegas, the Urban Hilton on Ice. And now I'd like to introduce to you, Peggy Fleming and a wonderful show for your entertainment. We're grateful to you.
Merry Christmas. God bless all of you. Thank you.
