ANKENY, Iowa -The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign today announced that Congressman Paul will attend the Iowa state Republican Party's Reagan Dinner.After finishing second in the recent Iowa Straw Poll in Ames by less than one percent, Paul has continued to make Iowa a top priority for his 2012 Presidential campaign.
"Iowa has always been an important state in establishing momentum and shaping the national debate," said Ron Paul 2012 Presidential Campaign Manager John Tate. "Dr. Paul's recent performance in the Iowa Straw Poll and his continued growth in polls show that Iowa and the nation are looking to his leadership and experience for real solutions to the problems facing this country."
