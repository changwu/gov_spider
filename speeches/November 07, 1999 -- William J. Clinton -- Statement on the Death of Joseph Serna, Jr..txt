    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Mayor Joe Serna earlier today. Joe was an extraordinary public servant, educator, father, husband, and friend. He was a great leader of Sacramento and a source of inspiration to the Hispanic community and all Americans. Our Nation has lost a remarkable man. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family.
