    IN THE death of Maurice C. Latta, a beloved figure passes from the Washington scene. His service, covering almost 50 years, embraced 9 administrations. It was distinguished not only by its great length but by the rare qualities which this remarkable public servant brought to his duties.
When he came to the Executive Office in the days of the first McKinley administration, the force of two or three which he joined did its work in one of the upper rooms on the second floor of the White House. At his death he supervised the activities of personnel exceeding two hundred, working in quarters many times expanded since the erection of the first office building in the administration of President Theodore Roosevelt.
Three times during Mr. Latta's long service he helped to bridge the transition period when a President died in office. I can bear witness to his steadying influence when the duties of the office came to me so unexpectedly 3 years ago.
He had many notable qualifications for the work which fell to him as the custodian of executive papers. Strict integrity, a thorough knowledge of the public laws and of learned precedents, a precise mind and a prodigious memory were part of his equipment. Always fair-minded, he was solid and firm in principle, shrewd in judgment, ever kind and courteous. He was selfless in his devotion to the public interest and to the interests of the nine Presidents whom he served so well and faithfully through 3 wars and other crises without number.
Mr. Latta closes a career of singular usefulness respected and loved by all.
