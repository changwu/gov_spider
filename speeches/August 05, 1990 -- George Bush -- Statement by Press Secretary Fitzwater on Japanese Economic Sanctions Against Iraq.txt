    Prime Minister Kaifu of Japan called the President this morning to inform the President of Japan's decision to impose various sanctions against Iraq. These unprecedented measures undertaken by Japan are in step with those that the United States and other countries have put in place against Iraq for its blatant aggression against Kuwait. The President welcomed Prime Minister Kaifu and the Japanese Cabinet's decision and expressed confidence that such measures will help intensify international pressures aimed at achieving the immediate, complete, and unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait.
