    Melania and I join in recognizing October as National Dyslexia Awareness Month. We are committed to improving the learning environments and working conditions for all Americansâ€”especially the creative thinkers and great Americans with dyslexia. We encourage all Americans to learn more about dyslexia, advocate on behalf of children and adults with dyslexia, and to support friends, family, colleagues, and loved ones with this condition.
Dyslexia is a neurocognitive learning disorder that affects one's ability to read, spell, and process speech. Through early evidence-based reading programs and accommodations, however, individuals with dyslexia can reach their full potential in society and be highly successful students and workers. Many Americans with dyslexia lead happy, healthy, and productive lives. They are top industry executives, creators of beautiful masterpieces, inventors of groundbreaking technologies, and defenders of American liberty.
This month, we especially recognize the extraordinary contributions of individuals with dyslexia and pledge to ensure that any child or adult struggling with dyslexia receives the resources needed to succeed in school and excel in any field. My administration remains committed to working with families and schools to improve early identification of dyslexia and benefit from advanced research on dyslexia.
Dyslexia need not be a barrier to success. Our Nation will continue to expand opportunities for every American, especially those striving to succeed with this condition.
