    Paul Ryan today made the following statement on Governor O'Malley's comments that Americans are not better off than they were four years ago: 
"Today's admission by Democratic Gov. O'Malley that Americans aren't better off today than they were four years ago is more proof that President Obama's policies aren't working. President Obama's failure of leadership has led to 42 straight months of unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million Americans struggling for work, $5 trillion in new debt and a $716 billion cut in Medicare to fund Obamacare.
"While Team Obama continues their campaign of fear and division, we are talking about the big issues that Americans face. That's why we have a plan to strengthen the middle class and create 12 million jobs, protect Medicare, and cut the federal deficit so our economy can start growing again."
