    Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesSubject: Red Cross Month, 1985I have just issued a proclamation that designates March as Red Cross Month.
This has been an especially tragic year for hundreds of thousands of our fellow countrymen left destitute by disasters. To assist these victims, the Red Cross has spent a record amount of money for help and for disaster preparedness. As a recipient of blood voluntarily donated through the Red Cross, I know the value of its Blood Services and its efforts to ensure that we constantly have adequate supplies for the sick and injured. The Red Cross also provides help for men and women serving in our country's military forces, their families, and veterans. Millions of Americans are trained in first aid, water and boating safety, and health care through programs sponsored by the Red Cross. Our Nation's young people, through Red Cross school programs, acquire leadership skills and learn the value of giving service to their communities.
Within the Federal government, the Red Cross is part of the Combined Federal Campaign. During the month of March, more than one-half of the Red Cross chapters nationwide will raise funds, while others will use this observance to inform the public about Red Cross services and to recruit new blood donors.
As President of the United States and Honorary Chairman of the American National Red Cross, I urge all civilian employees of the Federal government and members of the Armed Forces to support in every way possible this vital voluntary effort.
