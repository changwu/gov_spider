    Treasury Secretary-designate Janet Yellen and Deputy Treasury Secretary-designate Wally Adeyemo met with members of the Business Roundtable Board of Directors on Friday, capping their first week of meetings with leaders from racial and economic justice organizations, American manufacturing and other economic organizations.
Today's conversation with business leaders focused on issues of common concern and areas where the government and private sector must work together to address the immediate economic and public health crisis and get the country through the challenging six to nine-month period ahead, so we can begin to Build Back Better. They discussed their shared encouragement about the bipartisan effort underway to provide crucial relief to millions of Americans.
They also discussed shared priorities for the medium- to long-term to promote growth, get more Americans back to work and encourage full participation in the economy, boost American competitiveness, strengthen and restore relationships with our partners and allies, and address long-standing structural inequities to create an economy that works for everyone.
Dr. Yellen reiterated key investment priorities, including increasing access to broadband, clean energy, education and skills training. Mr. Adeyemo emphasized the incoming administration's commitment to providing certainty about what the United States stands for on critical issues ranging from trade, to strategic global alliances, to immigration policy as we work to restore American competitiveness. Finally, they discussed opportunities for the private sector to play a significant role in addressing inequality, and reaffirmed their commitment to working together to pursue a constructive agenda focused on promoting equity and restoring growth and prosperity to the nation.
