Scott Walker: Jobs. Freedom. Security.
That's what's at stake, and that's why I'm supporting Ted Cruz for President.
Ted is a Constitutional conservative.  He'll challenge the status quo, just like we've done in Wisconsin.
And Ted has a real plan to grow jobs and restore opportunity.
On Tuesday, please join me in supporting Ted Cruz - the only conservative who can beat Hillary Clinton and reignite America's promise.
Ted Cruz: I'm Ted Cruz, and I approve this message.
