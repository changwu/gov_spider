    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Lewis (R) California and 5 others)
The Administration strongly opposes enactment of H.R. 5028. The Bureau of Reclamation's review of this project has not been completed; therefore any authorization would be premature. Moreover, the project appears to be a single-purpose municipal and industrial water supply project, and such projects have traditionally been the responsibility of non-Federal interests.
