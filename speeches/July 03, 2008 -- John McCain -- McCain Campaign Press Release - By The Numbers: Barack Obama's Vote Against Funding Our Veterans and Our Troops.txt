    ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, Barack Obama travels to North Dakota for an event focused on our veterans. Yet, in 2007, only 13 days after saying he would vote to support our military men and women in Iraq, Barack Obama opposed billions in critical funding that our troops needed in a political move to satisfy his base. This included over a billion in funding for our veterans. In the end, Barack Obama's talk about supporting our military and our veterans were just empty words:
IN 13 DAYS, BARACK OBAMA WENT FROM SUPPORTING FUNDING FOR OUR TROOPS IN IRAQ TO VOTING AGAINST IT
On May 13, 2007, Barack Obama Supported Funding To Give Our Men And Women The Equipment They Need In Iraq:
Barack Obama Told ABC's George Stephanopoulos That He Supported Funding To Give Troops The Equipment They Need. Stephanopoulos: "[Y]ou said then you have to say 'no' to George Bush because we can't get steamrolled. Yet you go in the Senate, your critics say, and vote for the funding every single time." Obama: "Because at that point you've got hundreds of thousands of young men and women who have to carry out the mission on behalf of the American people. It's not their fault that our civilian leadership made bad decisions and what I wanted to make sure of was that they had night vision goggles that they needed, the Humvees that they needed and I also felt and I've continued to feel this way that if we could create some semblance of stability and success in Iraq, that would be a good thing."
