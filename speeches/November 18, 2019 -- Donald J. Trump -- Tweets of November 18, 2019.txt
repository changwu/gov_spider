Never has the Republican Party been so united as it is now. 95% A.R. This is a great fraud being played out against the American people by the Fake News Media & their partner the Do Nothing Democrats. The rules are rigged by Pelosi & Schiff but we are winning and we will win!Retweets: 30138Favorites: 128490

....that I testify about the phony Impeachment Witch Hunt. She also said I could do it in writing. Even though I did nothing wrong and don't like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax I like the idea & will in order to get Congress focused again strongly consider it!Retweets: 13898Favorites: 54889
