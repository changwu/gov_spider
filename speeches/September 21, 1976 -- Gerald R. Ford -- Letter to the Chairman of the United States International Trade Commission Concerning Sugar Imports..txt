    IT IS my understanding that the Senate Finance Committee, acting pursuant to Section 201(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, has requested that the U.S. International Trade Commission begin an investigation under Section 201 of the Trade Act to determine whether United States sugar producers are being harmed or threatened with harm by imports of sugar. I urge the Commission to promptly make such an investigation in view of recent trends in the sugar industry.
As a separate action, within the limits of my authority to establish appropriate rates of duty for sugar provided for in TSUS items 155.20 and 155.30, I have proclaimed a rate of duty applicable to such sugar imports of approximately 1.9 cents per pound. This action is not intended to prejudge the results of the Commission's investigation.
I request that the Commission expedite its investigation and submit its report to me as quickly as possible.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
[The Honorable Will E. Leonard, Jr., Chairman, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20436]
