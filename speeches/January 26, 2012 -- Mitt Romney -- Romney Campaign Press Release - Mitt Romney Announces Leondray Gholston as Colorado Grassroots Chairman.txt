    Mitt Romney today announced Leondray Gholston as Grassroots Chairman of his Colorado campaign.
"I am proud to announce the addition of Leondray Gholston to my campaign in Colorado," said Mitt Romney. "In order to defeat President Obama, it is important that we defeat him in Colorado. Coloradans have felt first-hand the effects of the failed Obama administration — President Obama has overregulated, overspent and made job-growth more difficult. With the hard work of individuals like Leondray, we can bring positive change to Washington and Colorado."
"I have studied, reflected, and selected the champion I see most fit and able to be president in this time of national and international difficulty," said Leondray Gholston. "He is a proven executive, an accomplished private sector businessman, and a man of courage and vision. My choice for our president and standard bearer is Governor Mitt Romney.  As a patriot, a conservative, and a person with deep affection for our Constitution and country, I urge and argue most fervently for the election of Mitt Romney as GOP nominee and next President of the United States."
Leondray Gholston is the former Colorado Republican State Vice-Chairman. Gholston has been active at all levels of Colorado Republican politics and has worked on campaigns throughout the state. Gholston served for ten years in the U.S. Navy.
