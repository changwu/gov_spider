Travel pool report 1 - gathering
Pool has been swept and is holding near the Biden residence in Greenville, outside Wilmington. There is nothing on his schedule before departure, set for 8:25 pm, back to the White House. However, it is a fine Sunday, so you may not have trouble guessing probable movements.

Travel pool report 2 - rolling
At 12:50 pm POTUS motorcade is rolling from residence.

Travel pool report 3 - church
At 12:55 pm POTUS arrived at St Joseph on the Brandywine, the Catholic church where he regularly attends Mass. Pool did not see him going in and is holding just across from the cemetery.

Travel pool report 4 - confirmation of grandson
White House tells pool that the president is attending not just regular Mass but the confirmation of his grandson Hunter, son of the late Beau Biden.
FLOTUS was also seen entering the church.
We are still holding outside.

Travel pool report 5 - post-church
POTUS, FLOTUS, newly confirmed grandson Hunter and extended Biden family left church at 2:08 pm, walking into the beautiful spring sunshine. They spent some minutes outside the doors for photos and chatting. Jill Biden then walked to her SUV and re-emerged with a bouquet of flowers that she took to the other side of the church, where the Biden family graves, including that of Beau, are located. During this time, the president stayed with the group of friends/relatives talking. Frequent laughter drifted across the grassy church yard. At 2:17 pm, the president and that main group strolled to the other side of the church, presumably joining FLOTUS, although pool was no longer able to witness anything.

Travel pool report 7 - Greenville
At 2:35 pm the motorcade entered the leafy driveway of a Greenville residence that was not the presidentâ€™s home. No official word from the White House yet on whom the house belongs to or how long the Bidens are spending there. Pool is holding nearby in the parking lot at a nearby high school.

Travel pool report 8 - residence
POTUS motorcade left the Greenville residence where POTUS had been since church and was back at the Biden family home in Greenville at 3:55 pm. Pool, which could not lay eyes on POTUS himself, peeled off.
We are still tracking an 8:25 pm departure for Washington from the Delaware Air National Guard Base.

Travel pool report 12 - Marine One + handover
At 8:06 pm, with twilight sliding into night, POTUS boarded Marine One at the Air National Guard base in New Castle.
He did not come over to pool to gaggle.
Pool has hurriedly boarded an Osprey and take off is imminent.
With this, handing off to in-town pool which is in place to cover the POTUS arrival at the White House this evening.
My thanks to all on the trip.
