    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Bonker (D) Washington)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3166 but is concerned that the Berman amendment would hinder the Overseas Private Investment Corporation's ability to operate in the least developed countries rather than accomplishing its intended purpose of advancing international worker rights.
