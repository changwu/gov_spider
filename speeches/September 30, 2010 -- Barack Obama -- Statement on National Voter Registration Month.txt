    I join all those observing National Voter Registration Month and renew the call for all qualified citizens to register to vote if they haven't done so already. Many States have early deadlines and registration requirements for those wishing to participate in this fall's elections, and I encourage everyone to get informed and get involved. A healthy, vibrant democracy depends on the full participation of its citizens, and that's something we can all agree should transcend party or ideology. Every qualified citizen not only has the right to vote, but also a greater civic responsibility to exercise that right and play your part in the life of this country.
