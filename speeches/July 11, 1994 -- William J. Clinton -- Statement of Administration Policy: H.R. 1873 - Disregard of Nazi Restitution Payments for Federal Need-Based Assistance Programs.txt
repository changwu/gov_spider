    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 7/12/94)(House)(Waxman (D) CA and 45 others)
The Administration supports H.R. 1873. The Administration, however, notes that offsets are not provided for the increased direct spending associated with the bill. In addition, the Administration is concerned about the notification provision and will work with the Senate to reduce the associated administrative costs.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 1873 would increase direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). The bill does not contain provisions to offset the increased direct spending. Therefore, if the bill were enacted, its deficit effects could contribute to a sequester of mandatory programs. OMB scoring estimates for this bill are under development.
