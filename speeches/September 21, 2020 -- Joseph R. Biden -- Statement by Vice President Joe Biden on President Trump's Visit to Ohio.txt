    President Trump has failed Ohio. From a bungled pandemic response that has cost jobs and lives, to openly calling for a boycott of Goodyear, to abandoning workers in Lordstown whose jobs he promised to protect — Trump has broken promise after promise and turned his back on the Buckeye State at a moment when we are in desperate need of real leadership.
Ohio deserves a leader in the White House who will fight for workers and families — not just corporations and the super wealthy. As president, I'll ensure that we not only recover from this crisis and end this pandemic, but that we support the small businesses that fuel our economy and create millions of good-paying jobs. There's nothing Americans can't do if given half a chance — and as president, I will help bring this country together so we can build back better than ever before.
