    In selecting Governor Celeste to chair the national health care campaign, David Wilhelm has made a superb choice. I had the pleasure of working side-by-side with Governor Celeste for 8 years as a fellow member of the National Governors' Association. I learned then what the people of Ohio know well: Governor Celeste is a strong, effective, charismatic leader, and a remarkable motivator of people.
Governor Celeste's proven ability to forge bipartisan consensus will be a great help as Democrats and Republicans work together to reform our health care system. I am heartened to know that Governor Celeste will help in our fight to bring health security to every American. Health care reform is a complex issue, and it is critically important to our lives.
I know that Governor Celeste accepted this new challenge because he wants to serve all the people, and I compliment David Wilhelm on his leadership in making this appointment.
