    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Wisconsin and ordered Federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms and flooding on June 21-25, 2002.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to eligible local governments in the counties of Adams, Clark, Dunn, Marathon, Marinette, Portage, Waushara and Wood on a cost-sharing basis for the repair or replacement of public facilities damaged by the severe storms and flooding. Federal funding is also available on a cost share basis for hazard mitigation measures.
Joe M. Allbaugh, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), named James L. Roche as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The Agency said that damage surveys are continuing in other areas, and additional assistance and counties may be added after the assessments are completed.
