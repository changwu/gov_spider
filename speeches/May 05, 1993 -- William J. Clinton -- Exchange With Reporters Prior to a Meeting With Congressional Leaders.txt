    Bosnia
Q. Mr. President, will you be going to Congress to get authorization before any troops would be sent to Bosnia?
The President. We're here consulting about Bosnia today, and I have been extensively consulting, and no decision has been made by this administration about this yet. So when I do, then we'll continue to have proper process.
Q. Do you think the War Powers Act is constitutional?
The President. Ask my lawyer. I don't play lawyer. I think it's worked reasonably well.
Q. How do you think the vote will go in the Serb parliament?
The President. I don't know. I hope they'll not only vote for it, I hope they'll observe it, which is two different issues. We have to start our meeting here in a minute, but I think one of the things that we have to discuss is that we want an agreement in words and an agreement in fact. And that's what we've got to watch.
Q. Are you feeling any comfort in what Mr. Christopher is saying? It sounds as though he's running into roadblocks.
The President. No, I talked to him several times since he's been on the trip. I'm pretty pleased, actually, with the progress he's made. We're in a much different place and much nearer agreement than we were 10 or 12 days ago.
Q. Have you and Senator Dole made up? The President. Absolutely. I agree with what he said yesterday.
