    Mayor Rudy Giuliani released the following statement on National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day:
"On December 7th, 1941, the United States of America was attacked at Pearl Harbor. We lost not only 2,403 brave Americans, but also the sense of security that had come from being a nation separated from wars in Europe and Asia by two oceans. Today, 66 years after the attacks, we remember the heroism of those who lost their lives, and we honor the courage of those men and women in uniform who still stand ready to defend our liberty.
"In the aftermath of the Pearl Harbor attack, an entire generation mobilized overnight and dedicated itself to defeating the dictatorships of the Axis Powers. The example of the Greatest Generation inspires us in our own struggle against the tyranny of terrorism. As we mark this anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attacks, we remember their sacrifice and honor their success in expanding the reach of freedom around the world."
