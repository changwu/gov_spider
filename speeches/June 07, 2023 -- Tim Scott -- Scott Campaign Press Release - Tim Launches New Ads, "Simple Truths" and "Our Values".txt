    "If you're a man, you should play sports against men." – Tim Scott
CHARLESTON, SC – Tim Scott released two new TV ads today, titled "Simple Truths" and "Our Values" that will begin airing in Iowa today. The ad "Simple Truths" was previously shared by Elon Musk on Twitter.
Tim recently hosted a Business Roundtable and Town Hall in Council Bluffs, Iowa, and spoke at Joni's annual Roast and Ride.
WATCH: Our Values 
OUR VALUES TRANSCRIPT:
SCOTT: I'm about to say something really controversial in Joe Biden's America.
If you're able-bodied, you work. If you take out a loan, you pay it back. If you commit a violent crime, you go to jail.
And if you're a man, you should play sports against men.
America needs more victors and less victims.
I'm Tim Scott and I approve this message because these aren't just conservative values, they're American values, and as president, I will defend them.

SIMPLE TRUTHS TRANSCRIPT:
SCOTT: Today's kids are growing up immersed in a culture where everyone's a victim.
We have to start teaching the necessity of individual responsibility.
If you are able-bodied, you work. If you take out a loan, you pay it back. If you commit a violent crime, you go to jail.
Can I get an amen? I'm telling you the truth.
I'm Tim Scott and I approve this message.
These ads are part of the previously announced $6 million ad campaign running in Iowa and New Hampshire. Last week, Tim launched the TV ad "Land of Opportunity." Tim's first ad, "Made in America," launched the week of his announcement.
