    Dear Mr. President:
Upon the achievement of independence by the Republic of Cyprus, I am happy to extend in my own name and on behalf of the people of the United States most cordial greetings and felicitations to you, the members of your Government, and the Cypriot people in the Greek, Turkish, and other communities of the Republic.
The emergence of an independent and democratic Cyprus is a tribute to your statesmanship as well as that of Vice President Kutchuck and all those whose dedicated efforts have brought to a successful conclusion the negotiations of the past year and a half. The United States is a close friend of all parties to these negotiations, and is therefore especially gratified at their happy outcome.
The Government and people of the United States welcome the independent and democratic Republic of Cyprus to the family of nations, and look forward to maintaining close and cordial relations with the Government and people of Cyprus.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
