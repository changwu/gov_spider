    After the CNN Town Hall in Des Moines, Polk County Democrat is all in for Beto O'Rourke
DES MOINES, IOWA — Today Beto O'Rourke's campaign in Iowa announced the endorsement of Lou McDonald, Polk County Soil and Water District Commissioner.
"I walked into Beto's town hall undecided on Tuesday night — and I walked out ready to support him as the next President of the United States. He shares Iowans' stories with the compassion we need, and I was very impressed with his answer on conservation, agriculture, and how we work together to solve these crises facing us," said McDonald.
The endorsement comes after Beto O'Rourke's CNN Townhall held at Drake University in Des Moines, which was part of O'Rourke's fourth trip to the Hawkeye State. He spent three days traveling across Iowa where he toured flood damage in Davenport and had conversations with Iowans in Davenport and Tipton about how we fight the effects of climate change, uphold women's reproductive rights, and keep our families safe from our nation's gun violence epidemic.
With 67 town halls and 36 counties visited thus far, O'Rourke has visited the most counties in Iowa of any other presidential candidate this cycle to meet with, listen to, and learn from Iowans in every corner of the state.
