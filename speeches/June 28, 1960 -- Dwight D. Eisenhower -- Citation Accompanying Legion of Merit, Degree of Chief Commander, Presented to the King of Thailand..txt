    THE PRESIDENT of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 20, 1942, has awarded the Legion of Merit, Degree of Chief Commander, to
HIS MAJESTY, KING BHUMIBOL ADULYADEJ
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, ROYAL THAI ARMED FORCES
for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services:
His Majesty, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, defender of the faith and Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Armed forces, has since his coronation on 5 May 1950, served as a symbol of unity and steadfastness in the free World. His Majesty's manifold tasks have demanded sagacity and breadth of vision in perceiving that in a turbulent world swept by war and ideological conflict, causes of freedom required collective efforts and mutual aid devoted to the interests of his country and preservation of its freedom and ways of life. His Majesty has been a staunch supporter of the South East Asia Treaty Organization since its inception in 1955 and has significantly contributed to its growth and development. His Majesty's personal efforts through extensive travel to other nations have been singularly fruitful in developing a closer understanding among these countries. Indicative of the marked progress of His Majesty's Armed forces under his guidance and leadership is the high esteem accorded to them by the United Nations Command, Korea, and all nations of the free World.
