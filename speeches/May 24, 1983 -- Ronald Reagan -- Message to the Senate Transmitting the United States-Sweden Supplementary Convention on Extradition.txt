    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Supplementary Convention on Extradition between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Sweden, signed in Stockholm on March 14, 1983.
It is my desire that the supplementary convention transmitted herewith be considered in place of the Supplementary Extradition Convention with Sweden signed in Washington on May 27, 1981, which was transmitted to the Senate with my message dated July 28, 1981, and which is now pending in the Committee on Foreign Relations (Treaty Doc. No. 97-15). I desire, therefore, to withdraw from the Senate the supplementary convention signed in 1981.
I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Secretary of State with respect to the supplementary convention transmitted herewith. The reasons for the substitution mentioned above are explained in that report.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the supplementary convention.
