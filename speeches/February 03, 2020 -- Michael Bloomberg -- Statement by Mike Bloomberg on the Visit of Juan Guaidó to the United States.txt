    "The crowd that gathered in Miami this weekend to support Juan Guaidó, Venezuela's rightful leader, showed that the people of Venezuela are not alone. They should know that when the Maduro government falls, we will support the country's efforts to rebuild a free, prosperous and democratic Venezuela.
"Under the regime of Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela has become a case study in how despotism can lead a country to ruin – and destabilize an entire region in the process. Ordinary Venezuelans have suffered appalling shortages of food and medicine and been deprived of their basic human rights. More than 4 million have fled the country, including to our shores. The U.S. and our allies must remain steadfast in our support for them, for free and fair elections in Venezuela, and for the restoration of its democratic institutions."
