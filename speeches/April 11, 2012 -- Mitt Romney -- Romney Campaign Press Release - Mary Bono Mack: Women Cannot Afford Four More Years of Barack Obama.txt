    California Congresswoman Mary Bono Mack today made the following statement on how President Obama's economic policies have failed women:
"Barack Obama talks a good game on women in the economy, but the facts don't back him up. Women in the Obama economy are facing hardships of historical proportions. Unemployment among women is at record levels and the number of women in poverty has risen to a near-two decade high. Everyone knows that President Obama has presided over massive job losses during his term. What they may not know is that women account for the vast majority of those lost jobs. All the Obama Administration has to offer is more of the same. Simply put, women cannot afford four more years of Barack Obama."
