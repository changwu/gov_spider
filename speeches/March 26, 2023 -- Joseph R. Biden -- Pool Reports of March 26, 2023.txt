Out-of-town pool report #4 - DANG departure
The motorcade arrived at Delaware Air National Guard Base at 7:57 pm. POTUS is lifting directly to the WH.
We are running a bit ahead of schedule (POTUS and FLOTUS were initially scheduled to arrive on the White House South Lawn at 9:20 pm).
Pool was positioned at a distance but briefly saw POTUS step on to Marine One at 8pm.
Pool loaded into a nearby osprey and did not see Marine One lift.
It's been a pleasure. Handing off to in-town pool.
