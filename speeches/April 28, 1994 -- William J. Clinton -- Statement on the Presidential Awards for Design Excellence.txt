    Quality design is essential if we are to compete effectively in the world marketplace, create more jobs, make our cities more livable, protect our environment, and enrich our cultural life.
The Nation is indebted to the designers and the Federal Government partners responsible for these exemplary projects. As we strive for first-rate quality for every tax dollar spent, theirs is an example of excellence we want others to emulate.
