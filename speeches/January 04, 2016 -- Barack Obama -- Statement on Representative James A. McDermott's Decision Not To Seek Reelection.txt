    For more than 40 years, Jim McDermott has worked tirelessly on behalf of the people of Washington State. As a State legislator, he helped pass laws that offered healthcare to unemployed and low-income Washingtonians, the first such program in the Nation. In the United States Congress, he continued to be a much-needed voice for his most vulnerable constituents. Across America, you'll find families that are better off because Jim McDermott was fighting for them. I'm grateful for Jim's service, and Michelle and I wish him all the best in whatever the future holds.
