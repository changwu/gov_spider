    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Vento (D) Minnesota and ten others)
The Administration has no objection to House enactment of H.R. 4350, but will seek amendments in the Senate, including those to:
— conform the designation of the Cache la Poudre River in Colorado to the President's proposal, including deletion of the mandatory grant to Fort Collins for a study of a potential national recreation area;
— include more of the technical amendments proposed by the President to facilitate management of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System; and
— delete the required studies of the Farmington and Great Egg Harbor Rivers, because these rivers run entirely through non-Federal lands and are not appropriate candidates for Federal designation. Technical assistance for State and local conservation efforts can be provided under existing law.
