Travel Pool Report No. 1 - checking in
Good morning from overcast Wilmington, Delaware.
Your pool was COVID-19 tested this morning and we're holding in the press van awaiting President Biden's departure near his Wilmington residence.
We are heading to Delaware Air National Guard Base and taking Air Force One back to Joint Base Andrews.
Earlier, there was a bad weather call preventing President Biden from taking Marine One, the helicopter, all the way back to the White House from Delaware.
There is also a bad weather call preventing the president from taking Marine One from JBA to the White House South Lawn, so your travel pool will be taking the motorcade back with him.
More TK.

Travel Pool Report No. 4 - JBA arrival 
Air Force One was wheels up at 11:15 a.m.
We landed at JBA at 11:44 a.m. It’s spitting rain and windy here.
President Biden walked off Air Force One at 11:54. He did not answer questions on Trump’s CPAC speech or Neera Tanden’s nomination. He was holding a folder with papers in it and gave pool a wave.
The White House says the same staff who traveled with Biden up to Delaware returned with him. Pool did not spot Dr. Jill Biden on the return trip.
We’re motorcading with POTUS to the White House as of 11:56 a.m.

Travel Pool Report No. 5 - White House arrival 
President Biden’s motorcade pulled into the White House driveway at 12:20 p.m. Pool did not see Biden exit the SUV. Biden walked into the Oval at 12:23 p.m.
A few waves from people on the National Mall as we drove through.
Thanks to my co-poolers Cleve Wootson and Ken Thomas on this weekend’s trip. Handing it off to in-town pool - have a great rest of your day!
