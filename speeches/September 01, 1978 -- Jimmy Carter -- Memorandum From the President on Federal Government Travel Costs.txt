Subject: Reduction in 1979 Administrative Travel Costs
It is extremely important at this time, when we are trying to hold down inflation, that every effort be made to reduce Government travel costs. All travel must be limited to the absolute minimum necessary to carry out your programs.
Specifically, I ask that you reduce fiscal year 1979 administrative travel costs by 20% below the amount estimated in the 1979 budget transmitted to the Congress. Administrative travel is defined to include all travel that is not directly related and essential to the performance of a Federal program.
While I am not directing that travel for program purposes be reduced by a specific amount, I do ask that you limit all travel to purposes that are clearly necessary and cannot be accomplished effectively in any other way. The proper management of travel should permit reduction in travel budgets for program as well as for administrative purposes.
I am asking the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to provide Government-wide instructions to achieve this reduction.
I count on your full cooperation in directing your agency to help reduce the amounts spent for Government's travel.
JIMMY CARTER
