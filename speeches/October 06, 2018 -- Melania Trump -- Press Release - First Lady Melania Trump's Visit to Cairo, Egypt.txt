    First Lady Melania Trump landed in Cairo, Egypt on Saturday Morning. Entissar Amer, the First Lady of the Arab Republic of Egypt and Thomas Goldberger, the Chargé d'Affaires of the United States Embassy to Egypt, greeted Mrs. Trump.
The first stop in Egypt was to Ittihadiya Palace for a meeting with President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi of Egypt and First Lady Lady Entissar Amer. Mrs. Trump discussed her focus and goals of supporting children all over the world in order to ensure future generations have every opportunity to grow up and contribute to society in meaningful and positive ways.
Following the meeting, the First Lady met with the Chargé d'Affaires, Thomas Goldberger and his wife Eden Goldberger, and staff of the United States Embassy, thanking them for their service to the United States.
Mrs. Trump visited a few of Egypt's many cultural sites including the Sphinx, and the Great Pyramid — one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. While there, she also received a briefing about USAID's Water Table Reduction Project at the base of the Sphinx.
"I want to thank President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi and First Lady Entissar Amer for hosting me in Egypt," said First Lady Melania Trump. "It was a nice opportunity to see the pyramids in person, which are truly a historical treasure. We must always do our best to preserve such important historical sites, and I was so pleased to learn of the work that USAID has done to help with preservation efforts at the base of the Sphinx."
