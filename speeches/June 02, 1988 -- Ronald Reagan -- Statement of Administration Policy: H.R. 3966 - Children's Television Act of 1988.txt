    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Bryant (D) Texas and eight others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3966. Attempts such as this one, to inject the Federal .Government into programming and advertising decisions that are properly those of television broadcast licensees are inappropriate, ill-advised, and inimical to the spirit of the First Amendment.
