    HOUSTON, Texas — Today, the Cruz for President campaign announced the endorsement of Texas Congressman Randy Weber. Originally a small business owner, the second-term Congressman has been a strong conservative voice in Congress for fiscal discipline, national security, and protecting life. Weber won election in 2012 for the seat previously held by Ron Paul.
"We have an impressive field for the 2016 elections, but we need a President who will march into the White House on Day One with their conservative values in one hand and the Constitution in the other. I believe Ted Cruz is the candidate who will do just that. It is for this reason that I offer my endorsement, and look forward to the march towards new leadership in the White House."
"I am honored to have Randy's endorsement," said Cruz. "He is one of several new leaders we have in Congress that will stand up for conservative principles every time. I look forward to having his help as we move forward in our campaign to restore the promise of America."
Congressman Weber joins fellow Texas Congressmen Louie Gohmert, Michael Burgess, John Culberson, John Ratcliffe, and Brian Babin endorsing Ted Cruz.
