Tim Scott: The future of our country is not defined by the color of our skin, it is defined by the quality of our education. The radical left has been bought out by big labor unions in education, trapping poor kids in failing schools, and trapping poor kids out of the best future they have. So what can we do about that? African Americans around 68%, Hispanics around 70%, the majority population over 80%, all agree with some form of school choice. Let's bring opportunity to these kids. If we do that, the American future will be, not a colorblind future, but one where we respect and appreciate every unique individual for the content of their character, not the color of their skin. Here's what we're seeing, the radical left is quaking in their boots. Because when an African American conservative who believes in the future of this nation stands up to be counted, they push back. That's a good sign. We're on the right message. 
Yesterday, Tim Scott announced his candidacy for president at his alma mater, Charleston Southern University. Watch the full announcement here.
