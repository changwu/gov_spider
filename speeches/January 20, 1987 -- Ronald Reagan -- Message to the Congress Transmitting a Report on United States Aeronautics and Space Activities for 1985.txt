    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit this report on the activities and accomplishments of the United States in aeronautics and space during calendar year 1985. Fourteen departments and agencies of the Federal government contributed to the report, but the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) were the major participants. The report is provided in accordance with Section 206 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2476).
During 1985, the Nation's activities in aeronautics and space continued to provide significant benefits. The basis for future space missions has expanded by acquiring new scientific knowledge about the solar system and the physical and life sciences; processing materials and manufacturing new products in space that have commercial potential; and intensifying the concentration of aeronautical research and development programs in potentially high-payoff technologies that will allow the United States to maintain a technological advantage in international competition.
