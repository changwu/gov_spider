    Jill and I extend our warmest congratulations to Speaker Pelosi on her well-deserved reelection today as Speaker of the House of Representatives. A trailblazing leader — and one of the most effective and accomplished legislators in our nation's history — I have no doubt that Speaker Pelosi will continue to lead the House with dignity, principle, and patriotic resolve.
As our country begins to emerge from this period of pain and loss in the months to come, we have an extraordinary opportunity ahead of us to unite around our values and make unprecedented progress as a nation. With Speaker Pelosi's leadership, we will come together to defeat the ongoing pandemic, take on the existential threat of climate change, instill greater equity and justice in our society, and build our economy back better than before. I look forward to working closely with the Speaker and her colleagues in the House, majority and minority alike, to pursue that vital work on behalf of all of the American people.
