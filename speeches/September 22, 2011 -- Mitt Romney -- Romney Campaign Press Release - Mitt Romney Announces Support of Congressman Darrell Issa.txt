    Mitt Romney today announced the support of California Congressman Darrell Issa.
"As someone who shares my background in business, Congressman Issa understands that we need to make fundamental changes in Washington," said Mitt Romney. "I am proud to have his support, and look forward to working with him as I campaign in California and work to bring jobs back to the state and strengthen the American economy."
Announcing his support, Congressman Issa said, "As a former businessman, I know that Mitt Romney is the right candidate to get both California and the country's economy on the right track again. The country would be well served to have someone who knows how the economy works and has worked in the private sector. President Obama never worked in the real economy â€“ we can't afford to have another president who has spent his career outside the real economy."
