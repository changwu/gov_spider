    More than 80 national organizations and labor unions sent a letter to senators urging the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, arguing that its "investments would create new jobs through project construction in the short term, and provide improved safety, mobility, and quality of life for decades to come."
The letter, organized by the American Road & Transportation Builders Association (ARTBA), states: "The investments made in the Senate package would facilitate long overdue repairs and improvements to our roads, bridges, rail, and public transportation systems, as well as investing in airports, ports, broadband, and water systems."
ARTBA joins national and local leaders, community groups, advocacy organizations, as well as large majorities of Republicans and Democratic voters, to express support for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal.
