    I am deeply disappointed by the action of the Senate Judiciary Committee this morning. That some members of the committee chose to use the confirmation process to conduct an ideological assault on so superbly qualified a candidate was unjust and deeply wrong.
Let me emphasize that Mr. Reynolds' civil rights views reflect my own. The policies he pursued are the policies of this administration, and they will remain our policies as long as I am President.
Mr. Reynolds retains my full faith and confidence.
