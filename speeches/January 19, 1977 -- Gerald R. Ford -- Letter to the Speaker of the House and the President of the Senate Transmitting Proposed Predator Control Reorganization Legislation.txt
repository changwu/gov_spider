    EACH YEAR animal predators destroy large numbers of livestock in many areas of the Nation. Sheep are especially vulnerable to kills by coyotes.
Since 1931 the Federal government has assumed a degree of responsibility of controlling animal predation--on both public and private lands. This function was originally established in the Department of Agriculture, then transferred to the Department of Interior in 1941.
I believe that it is now appropriate to return this function--except for migratory bird control--to the Department of Agriculture. Accordingly, I am herewith transmitting the necessary reorganization bill.
This legislation would reestablish most of the animal damage control activities of the Federal government in the department generally responsible for protecting the Nation's crops and livestock from various forms of damage-the Department of Agriculture. That Department already conducts predator research. It is close to the Nation's farmers and ranchers. At the same time, the Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Interior will be relieved of a function at times inconsistent with its broader objective of protecting and enhancing the wildlife resources of the Nation.
I am committed to solving the predator problem by environmentally acceptable means. Increased research will be devoted by the Department of Agriculture to selective and humane ways of dealing with predators. Control activities will continue to be regulated under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as administered by the Environmental Protection Agency.
No additional budget outlays would be required as a result of this proposed legislation.
An identical letter has been transmitted to the President of the Senate.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
