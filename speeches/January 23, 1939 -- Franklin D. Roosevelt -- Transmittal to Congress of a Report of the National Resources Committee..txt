    To the Congress:
I transmit herewith for the information of the Congress, a report entitled "Researchâ€”A National Resource," compiled by the National Resources Committee.
This report deals with the relation of the Federal Government to research. Subsequent reports in this field will cover research by colleges, universities and foundations, by business organizations, by the industrial laboratories, and by the state and municipal governments.
The dependence of civilization on science is universally recognized, but the extent of the activities of private and public agencies carrying on scientific inquiry is not generally known. It is unlikely that large numbers of our people have any adequate realization of the services which are being rendered by the executive agencies of the Federal Government through scientific researches in medicine, agriculture, economics, public administration and the other natural and social sciences.
This report indicates the new emphasis in recent years on activities in the social science fields and stresses the need for effective coordination of all agencies engaged in research in order to achieve the solution of many of our more difficult problems.
I commend the report to the consideration of the Congress.
