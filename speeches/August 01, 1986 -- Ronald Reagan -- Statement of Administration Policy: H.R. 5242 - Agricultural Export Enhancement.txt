    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Daschle (D) South Dakota and 6 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 5242. On August 1, 1986, the President decided to allow grain to be sold to the Soviet Union at current world market prices in sufficient quantities to fulfill the terms of the U.S./Soviet Long Term Grain Agreement. The unfulfilled portion of the contract calls for the Soviets to purchase 4 million metric tons of U.S. wheat by September 30, 1986.
Adequate authority already exists to implement fully the current three-year, $1 billion Export Enhancement Program. H.R. 5242 is unnecessary, therefore, and could seriously jeopardize U.S. foreign policy and national security interests. Accordingly, the President's senior advisors would recommend a veto of H.R. 5242 if passed by Congress.
