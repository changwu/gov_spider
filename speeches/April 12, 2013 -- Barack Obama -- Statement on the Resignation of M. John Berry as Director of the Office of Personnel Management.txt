    John Berry has served the American people well as Director of the Office of Personnel Management. He's streamlined the way Federal employees are hired, modernized the workplace, made the Federal workforce more diverse, and increased the number of returning servicemembers hired by the Government. John has been a champion for Federal workers: men and women who devote their lives to vital tasks like securing our borders, curing disease, and keeping the American people safe. This country is better off because of John's talent and dedication, and I'm grateful to him for his service.
