    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 9/20/91)(House)(Gordon (D) Tennessee)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 2370. However, the Administration will seek an amendment in the Senate to clarify that the Secretary of the Interior is authorized, but not required, to accept transfer of ownership of Fortress Rosecrans, a Civil War defense fortification, from the city of Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The site has lost most of its historical setting and has only local historical significance. The Administration will also seek an amendment to assure that the due dates for completing certain plans are at least two years after the date that funds are made available.
