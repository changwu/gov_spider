Speaking Program Kezia Rodriguez, Introducer, full-time nursing student, and mother of two The President
Background on Introducer Kezia Rodriguez is a Queens native first-generation American and the daughter of immigrant parents from Brazil. Kezia benefited from a tuition-free child care program while she was working to become a certified nursing assistant at Bergen Community College in New Jersey. The child care initiative was made possible through President Biden's American Rescue Plan. She is now seeking her bachelor's degree in nursing full-time at Felician University in New Jersey, which does not offer the same child care program. As a result, she now has to pay for her twin girls?Naomi and Navy (4) ?to go to preschool. They pay $1,000 a month, the most affordable care they could find. Even with that, Kezia's husband has to take days off when Kezia is in school.

In-town pool #6- event ends
President Biden started speaking at 2:21pm. After 17 minutes of remarks, he signed his executive order.
Some people joined him for the signing at the desk set up next to the podium. The crowd cheered and someone yelled "thank you!"
He mingled for 5 minutes and did not answer shouted questions from the press.
A ground of lawmakers, including Reps. Pelosi, Dingell, and Jayapal, lined up outside the Oval Office and waited for the president. They greeted him with cheers when he walked up and he spoke with them for a minute or so and took a photo.
The president and the lawmakers went into the Oval Office at 2:46pm.
Check transcript but some quotes from the remarks--
He said the executive order recognizes "the labor of love to make sure family caregivers are involved and informed when the hospital discharges the one they love."
"Folks, there's a lot we can do. We're doing all of this. Why? Because right now, the cost of care is too high."
"Too many folks lie awake at night, wondering, mom can't take care of herself at home... how do I do it all?"
"Some of you have had to spend your own retirement savings to pay for elderly parents."
"It's overwhelming, I get it. I was a single parent for five years with two young children after my wife and daughter were killed in an accident."
He said that his family chipped in and his sister moved in.
"Folks, you know, I couldn't have done it without their help."
"I had a big family, I had help. I often ask myself what in god's name I would have done."
"We know there's more to do and yet yesterday, the Speaker of the House of Representatives Kevin McCarthy went to Wall Street."
"...he proposed huge cuts to important programs that millions of Americans rely on... he threatened to be the first speaker to default on our national debt."
"We got to ask ourselves, what are MAGA Republicans in Congress doing?"
"I urge Congress to take the threat of default off the table."
"In the meanwhile, we're not waiting around. That's what today's all about."
