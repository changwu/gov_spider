    I congratulate the Senators from both parties who voted to break the filibuster of campaign finance reform. Today the Senate showed it has heard the American people's demand for change. I have long believed that we will not give the middle class the economic growth and health care reform it needs unless we also reform our political system. Today's vote is a breakthrough in the fight to give the Government back to the American people.
The stage is now set for passage of campaign finance reform legislation that limits spending, curbs the special interests, and opens up the airwaves to greater competition. Make no mistake: This legislation, while it necessarily contains compromises, will change Washington for the better.
This must be only the first step in our effort to ensure that Washington works for the national interest and not narrow interests. I urge the Senate to pass this legislation tomorrow. I urge the House to act quickly on its own campaign finance reform bill. And I urge the Congress to move forward on lobby disclosure legislation that brings the activities of lobbyists into the sunlight of public scrutiny.
