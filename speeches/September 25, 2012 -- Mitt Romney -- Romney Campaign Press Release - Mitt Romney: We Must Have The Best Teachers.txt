 MITT ROMNEY: "Teaching is a profession. I understand the interest of the teachers union, and the teachers union has every right to represent their members in the way they think is best for their members. But we have every right to in fact say, no, this is what we want to do which is in the best interests of our children. And I believe in the best interests of our children is to recognize that teaching is a profession, like your profession, like my profession, like lawyers like doctors. And the very best are more highly compensated and rewarded and measured. We don't just presume that because we've been here for a certain number of years we should get more and more pay every year. Instead, we get measured. And if teachers say, well, there's no good measurement system, we say, well, let's look for one. Let's see what does work. Let's see if we can agree on some kinds of measures and learn from those things. But I want the best teachers to be highly compensated. I want starting teachers, particularly those that have extraordinary records who have a track record in school of excellence and learning, I want them to be well compensated, to be drawn into the profession. Education is about teachers, great leadership and parents. And the union has a different objective. I understand, it's fine for them to promote it. It's not fine for us just to go along with it."
