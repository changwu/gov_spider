Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney convincingly won the Wyoming County Conventions as voters in the state selected the nation's first delegates to the 2008 Republican National Convention. In a crowded field, Governor Romney won the clear majority of delegates selected by counties today. With the announcement of today's results, Governor Romney released the following statement:
"Today, the people of Wyoming took the first step towards bringing true conservative change to Washington. From Gillette to Jackson and Riverton to Cheyenne, my family and I visited Wyoming many times, meeting with residents and addressing the issues most important to voters in the Cowboy State. We worked hard to earn the support of voters here, and I am honored to have won many of the first delegates awarded this primary season. As the Republican nominee, I promise to fight to seat all of Wyoming's delegates at the national convention.
"The voters participating in today's county conventions made it clear that the Reagan coalition of fiscal conservatives, social conservatives and defense conservatives is alive and well in the West. In the coming weeks, I will work hard to share my optimistic vision for our country's future with voters as ballots are cast in New Hampshire and beyond.
"Today's results are evidence that Americans want change, and our message of strengthening America through strengthening our economy, our military and our families is resonating with voters. I want to thank the people of Wyoming for their support and generosity, and I will continue to campaign in this important state as the remainder of its delegates are selected and through to the general election in November. This is just the beginning."
