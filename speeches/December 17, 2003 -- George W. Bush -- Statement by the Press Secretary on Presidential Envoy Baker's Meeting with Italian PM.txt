    Special Presidential Envoy James A. Baker III had a very productive meeting today with Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi. We welcome the Prime Minister's statement supporting substantial debt reduction for Iraq in the Paris Club in 2004. We appreciate his leadership and look forward to working with him and the Italian government in this effort.
