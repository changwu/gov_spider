    A year ago I launched a national effort to get guns out of America's schools. Today, almost one year after I signed the Gun-Free Schools Act, I'm very pleased to announce that our message of zero tolerance has been made a reality around the country. The Gun-Free Schools Act is working and working well.
Guns have no place in our schools, and this directive ensures that any student in America who brings a gun to school will be expelled for at least a year. Our message is clear: We will not tolerate threats to the safety of America's students and teachers. Period. Parents have a right to expect that their children will be safe when they go to school in the morning.
We still need more good parents and strong communities if we are to win the fight against crime in America. But through efforts like this one, my administration is committed to doing its part to protect our children and ensure that they can learn in safety, free from fear and violence.
