    I want to express my deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones in the crash of Singapore Airlines Flight SQ-006 in Taiwan yesterday. It is too early to know the cause of the accident, but the United States is helping Taiwan authorities find the answers. A team from the National Transportation Safety Board is on its way to Taiwan now to assist with the investigation. We are also doing all we can to assist the victims and their families, both through the American Institute in Taiwan and the American Red Cross in Los Angeles.
