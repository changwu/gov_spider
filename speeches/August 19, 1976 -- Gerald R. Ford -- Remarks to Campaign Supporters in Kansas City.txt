    It is really awfully hard to express adequately my deep appreciation, that of Betty, all of the family.
As we have traveled in every one of the 50 States, you have been wonderful in helping and assisting. You have been tremendous here as an inspiration in the closing minutes of a tough ball game.
When things didn't go as well as we would have liked, we know that we had literally millions and millions of people--young, old, all kinds of Americans-who were out there willing to go to the mat to help us. And I want you to know that helped us get through and win, and win on November 2.
I want you to know that I just returned from a meeting with Governor Reagan. I complimented him on a real good campaign. I indicated that we certainly wanted him to be standing shoulder to shoulder with us in the months ahead. And I am glad to report that he indicated he would be there fighting just as hard as I am.
So, I think we can leave that arena tomorrow night unified, vigorous, determined to win for the American people on November 2.
Thank you.
