    Throughout America—wherever the irrepressible Irish spirit thrives—St. Patrick's Day is a special time for celebration. Each year it reminds us of the warmth, the joy in living, and the basic human goodness of the Irish people whose qualities are so deeply etched upon our own national character.
Recognizing the unique bond of festivity, faith, and national pride that this day commemorates, Rosalynn and I join every American in honoring St. Patrick's Day by the wearing o' the green.
