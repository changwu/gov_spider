The Trump administration is exploring new approaches for easing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that build on talks with a budding Sunni Arab coalition of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Jordan.

"This young, dynamic leadership presents opportunities that may not have existed before," said Yousef al-Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to Washington. The White House clearly shares that view.
