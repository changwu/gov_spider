    U.S.-EU Summit
US-EU Aviation Agreement
On June 25, 2003, the United States and the European Union announced agreement to begin comprehensive air service negotiations in early autumn 2003.
Air services between the United States and the European Union are currently conducted under bilateral aviation agreements with each of the European Union Member States.
On June 5, the European Transport Council granted the European Commission a mandate to negotiate an aviation agreement with the United States on behalf of all the European Union Member States.
A comprehensive U.S.-EU aviation agreement would further liberalize international aviation markets between the United States and the countries of the European Union, providing airlines, consumers, shippers, and national economies the enormous benefits of a market-based approach to international civil aviation.
We look forward to extending the benefits of liberalization to the transatlantic market and building on the foundation established by the open skies agreements we have already concluded with eleven European Union Member States.
Such an agreement would minimize government intervention and facilitate meaningful airline competition across a broader array of markets.
The agreement would also enhance economic opportunities, including expanded scope for enriching cooperative marketing arrangements, while ensuring implementation of the highest standards of international aviation safety and security.
