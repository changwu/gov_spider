By Michael McCord, Portsmouth HeraldOctober 1, 2008
PORTSMOUTH, NH -- Campaigning in support of Republican presidential contender Sen. John McCain, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani applauded McCain's work on the $700 billion financial rescue plan that was voted down in the House Monday -- and criticized Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Barack Obama for not showing leadership on the issue.
"(McCain) jumped in and risked failure, while the other wants to stay away," said Giuliani at a roundtable discussion at the Portsmouth Public Library on Tuesday afternoon. "(Obama) is totally without experience."
Giuliani, who ran against McCain in the Republican primaries, told the largely McCain-supportive audience, "I believe that we should do the rescue plan," but added that he understood why Americans were angry about the Congressional proposal to buy bad assets from failing financial institutions. He also said supporters of the bill should do a better job of explaining what the plan is and why it's necessary.
"Both sides (Democrats and Republicans) share the blame," said Giuliani, who added that Obama received significant campaign contributions from the failed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. ...
For almost an hour, Giuliani answered questions from voters on the economy, leadership styles, Social Security, tort reform and McCain's vice-presidential pick, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin.
"We need a sledgehammer," Giuliani said of McCain's plans to rein in government spending. "Obama is a big-spending liberal from Chicago. That's all they are about."
