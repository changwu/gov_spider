    The President met for about 35 minutes this afternoon with the leader of the British Labour Party, Mr. Neil Kinnock, in a wide-ranging discussion of East-West relations, including the just-concluded summit meetings in London and Houston. The two men had a good exchange of views. It was the first opportunity in this administration for the President to meet with the leader of Britain's opposition.
The President expressed his pleasure with the July 16 announcement after the Kohl-Gorbachev meetings that the Soviet Union was prepared to accept a united Germany as a full member of NATO if that was the German choice. The President emphasized his support for the continuing process of reform in the Soviet Union. While the London summit had shown the alliance's readiness to adapt to the new European realities, the President stressed that the United States remains fully committed to the North Atlantic alliance.
Following his meeting with the President, Mr. Kinnock was scheduled to meet separately with Vice President Quayle and the national security adviser, Gen. Brent Scowcroft.
