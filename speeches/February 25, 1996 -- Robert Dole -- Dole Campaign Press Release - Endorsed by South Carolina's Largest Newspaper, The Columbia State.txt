    The largest newspaper in South Carolina today endorsed Senator Bob Dole's campaign for President. Saying that "Bob Dole offers no gimmicks," the Columbia State -editorial called Dole a "man of character, experience, and traditional values."
"He is a man of depth and substance," the editorial continued, "We Prefer Bob Dole for the very countercultural reason for which his opponents deride him -- his long years Of service at the heart of national government. Experience is at least as valuable and honorable in public service as in any other endeavor. If you want to see how the consummate outside' is likely to fare, look at Jimmy Carter."
The paper said that "Pat Buchanan plays upon fear and loathing...he exploits our fear for our jobs, our fear of free enterprise, our fear of those different from ourselves. Bob Dole isn't afraid of foreigners. He's faced the worst they can dish out. Pat Buchanan, who (like Bill Clinton) never served in uniform, talks tough about running to the sound of the guns.'"
"Bob Dole doesn't talk like that because he's heard those guns too closely. He was gravely wounded in the spring of 1945 and nearly died waiting for help. His situation remained desperate even after he went home. But he struggled back to near-full function and dedicated the next five decades to public service."
The editorial said that "Bob Dole knows the price of freedom and the price of peace, That's why he Would never think of turning his back on the rest of the world, whether the rest of the world is Competing with us economically or demanding American leadership to keep other young men (even foreigners) from lying broken on battlefields."
Concluded the editorial: "The time has come to settle down and choose. We choose Bob Dole."
