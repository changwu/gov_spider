    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (P.L. 94-265:16 USC 1801), I transmit herewith a governing international fishery agreement for 1978-1982 between the United States and Japan, signed at Washington on March 18, 1977.
This Agreement is significant because it is one of a series to be negotiated in accordance with that legislation. It sets out the principles that will govern fishing by Japan for fisheries over which the United States exercises exclusive management authority. I urge that the Congress give favorable consideration to this Agreement at an early date.
