    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House) AND SENATE(Walker (R) PA and Bliley (R) VA)
The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1022. While the Administration supports risk assessment and cost/benefit legislation that is fair, effective, and affordable, HR 1022, in its current form, fails to meet these criteria. HR 1022 would impose overly broad, prescriptive, and costly analytical requirements on the regulatory process and would encourage excessive litigation. Moreover, in the guise of procedural reform, it would supersede the substantive requirements of many existing health, safety, and environmental laws that were signed into law by both Democratic and Republican Presidents.
The Administration is committed to improving the regulatory process and has already taken administrative steps to encourage the appropriate use of risk assessment and cost/benefit analyses. H.R. 1022, however, is an extreme measure that would exacerbate some of the very problems with the regulatory system that it seeks to address. If enacted, H.R. 1022 would increase costs for both the Government and the private sector and would impair the protection of human health, safety, and the environment.
Pay-As-You-Go-Scoring
H.R. 1022 would affect direct spending and receipts; therefore, it would be subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's review of this bill has not been completed. However, the bill does not contain provisions to offset any potential deficit increases. Therefore, if the bill were enacted, any such deficit effects would contribute to a sequester of mandatory programs.
