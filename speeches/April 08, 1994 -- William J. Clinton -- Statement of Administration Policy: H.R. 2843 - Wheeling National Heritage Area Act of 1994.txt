    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 4/11/94)(House)(Mollohan (D) West Virginia)
The Administration does not object to H.R. 2843, which designates the Wheeling National Heritage Area, West Virginia, in a manner generally consistent with the Administration's recently transmitted "Heritage Partnership Program Act of 1994."
The Administration's proposal would establish a systematic process for evaluating sites that may be suitable for designation by Congress as National Heritage Areas. The Administration recommends that additional National Heritage Areas be considered for designation under the procedures established in the Administration's proposal.
