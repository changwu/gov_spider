    Governor Evans and Mrs. Evans, and all of you here at Fairchild Base, and all of our guests:
As you know, Expo '74 is going to have to open at 12 noon sharp, and the Governor has told me therefore my remarks here must be very brief. But while they will be brief, I can assure you that they will come very much from the heart.
First, I want to express appreciation to all of those who serve in our Armed Forces. You serve on a voluntary basis, and by reason of your service here at this base and, of course, the other hundreds of thousands of Americans that serve around the world, you are helping to keep peace in the world. That is a great venture. We thank you for what you are doing in helping to keep peace in the world.
And second, I want to say a word-since I understand that when we get over to Expo we will be talking to the whole Nation; as a matter of fact, to the whole world--a word about Spokane.
Governor, generally, when people think of the State of Washington, they almost always refer to the Seattle-Tacoma area. Now, that is a beautiful area, and a lot of people live there. But I have been to Spokane five times, and I know this is great and good country out here, and I am glad to be here in Spokane. And among many other things that this Expo will do, things that are good for America and good for the world, it will point all of the people of America and the world to Spokane and this area. What a beautiful country this is, what strong people you are, and that, believe me, that alone is worth having Expo '74 here in Spokane.
Thank you very much.
The Governor just reminded me that perhaps far more important than his introducing me and both of us standing here so you could see us was that you should see the First Lady of the United States and the First Lady of this State of Washington. I think when you see these two lovely ladies, you will agree that both the Governor and I married above ourselves.
