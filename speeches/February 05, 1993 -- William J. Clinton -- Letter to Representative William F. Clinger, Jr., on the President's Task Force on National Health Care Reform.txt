    Dear Congressman Clinger:
Thank you for your letter of February 1 concerning my health care task force. I appreciate your support of my efforts to formulate a national health care policy. It is my intention to develop a plan for high quality, affordable health care for all Americans, and I have asked the health care task force to help me develop legislation for comprehensive health care reform.
I have referred your questions concerning the Federal Advisory Committee Act to Bernard Nussbaum, the White House Counsel. Mr. Nussbaum has prepared a letter addressing your concerns, which he will deliver to you under separate cover. I have also asked Mr. Nussbaum and his staff to be available to answer any further questions you may have on legal issues relating to the health care task force.
With best wishes,
Sincerely,
BILL CLINTON
