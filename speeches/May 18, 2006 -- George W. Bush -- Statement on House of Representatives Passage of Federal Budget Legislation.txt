    The House's vote to pass a responsible budget marks a positive step toward controlling Federal spending. This Budget Resolution helps enforce spending discipline and moves us in the right direction to fund our Nation's key priorities. I congratulate Chairman Nussle, the House leadership, and all Members of the House who voted for this budget for their hard work and commitment to spending restraint.
