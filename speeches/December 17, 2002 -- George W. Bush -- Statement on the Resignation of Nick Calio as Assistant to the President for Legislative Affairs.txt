    Nick Calio has been a valuable and trusted member of my administration since the day I took office. As my top staff representative on Capitol Hill, he has been at the center of major legislative victories, from landmark education reforms to historic tax relief for the American people. Members of Congress have always been able to rely on Nick's integrity, forthrightness, and civility. I have been able to count on his good judgment, his energy, and his loyalty. He has given 2 years of faithful service, and he leaves with my gratitude and friendship.
