    Chicago, IL - The Obama campaign announced today that Barack Obama will attend the College Democrats of America Convention at the University of South Carolina at Columbia.
The College Democrats convention is a premier national gathering of organizers who know how to get out the vote on college campuses.
"I am looking forward to seeing all the College Democrats in South Carolina," said Senator Barack Obama. "Thousands of young people are getting involved in this campaign because they see it as a powerful way to change our country. I'm pleased to see young organizers taking leadership roles at the grassroots level, and I hope that College Democrats everywhere will get involved in our student organization."
The Obama campaign has a strong and active student structure called Students for Barack Obama. College Democrats across the country are leading Students for Obama chapters, and the Students' national leadership also has organizers from College Democrat campus chapters. The group started before Obama even decided to run for President, and it now has nearly 400 chapters nationwide.
Student activists have been leaders in national grassroots activities for the Obama campaign, including the national Walk for Change door-to-door effort, community clean-ups, and rallies. With a national youth vote department and youth vote staffers in the key states, the Obama campaign is fully committed to engaging young people in the political process.
