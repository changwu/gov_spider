    Dear Dick:
Over the past year, you have served our Nation with great distinction as my assistant for national security affairs. You have provided me with invaluable advice and counsel over the years of our association and I am grateful for your constant loyalty and dedication.
Thus it is with deep regret that I accept your resignation as Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. I am pleased, however, that you will continue to serve our Administration in a new assignment.
As you leave your post, I want you to know that you do so with my confidence, trust and admiration for your personal integrity and your exemplary service to the Nation.
Nancy and I extend our best wishes to you and your family.
Sincerely,
RON
[Mr. Richard V. Allen, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, The White House, Washington, D.C. 20500]
