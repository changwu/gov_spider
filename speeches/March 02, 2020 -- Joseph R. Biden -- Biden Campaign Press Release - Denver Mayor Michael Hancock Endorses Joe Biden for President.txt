    Today, Mayor of Denver Michael Hancock released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for the President of the United States:
"Joe Biden is the President our country needs. I know he'll unite our nation and get to work immediately delivering for working families all across the country including right here in Colorado. As the Mayor of a growing and vibrant city, Donald Trump's reckless attacks on immigrants, health care, and the environment are deeply personal. Joe is a candidate that has both the experience and the ability to get our country back on track. I'm proud to endorse Joe for President -- he'll be a leader for all Americans."
Hancock was elected Mayor in 2011. Prior to that he served on the Denver City Council since 2003.
Hancock joins more than 40 already announced endorsements from Colorado, including former Senator and former Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and former Mayor of Denver and former Secretary of Energy and Transportation Frederico Pe√±a. Biden for President has announced more than 1,400 endorsements from national, state and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, and community leaders.
