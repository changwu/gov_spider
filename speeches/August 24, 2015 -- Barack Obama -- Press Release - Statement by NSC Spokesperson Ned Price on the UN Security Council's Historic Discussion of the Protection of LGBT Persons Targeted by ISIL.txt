    The United States welcomes today's first-ever "Arria formula" discussion by the UN Security Council of how better to protect the lives and dignity of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) persons, who are frequently among the most vulnerable in conflict and post-conflict situations. Today's session focused on ISIL's atrocities targeted against LGBT persons and those perceived to be LGBT in Syria and Iraq. In highlighting acts of horrific brutality that these individuals have endured, today's discussion challenged the international community to develop better and more effective protections for LGBT persons. The United States thanks the government of Chile for its partnership in convening today's discussion as well as all those who contributed to it. Just as the United States will not relent in our efforts to defeat and ultimately destroy ISIL, we will continue striving for a world in which no one is subject to violence or persecution because of who they are or whom they love.
