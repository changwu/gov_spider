    Tonight, in a partisan vote, the Republican leadership succeeded in passing a flawed, unworkable private insurance prescription benefit that provides more political cover than insurance coverage for our Nation's seniors. If this unworkable private prescription drug benefit passes the Congress, I will veto it. The legislation was designed to benefit the companies who make prescription drugs, not the older Americans and people with disabilities who need to take them. It puts special interests above the public interests. I urge the Congress to work across party lines and develop a bipartisan bill that ensures an affordable, available, and meaningful Medicare prescription drug benefit option for all seniors.
