    Sanders will offset emissions from travel and events by supporting renewable energy and innovative carbon reduction projects
WASHINGTON â€“ Bernie 2020 today announced its commitment to renewable energy projects and offsetting all carbon emissions produced from campaign travel activities, as part of his longstanding commitment to the fight against global climate change.
"Bernie Sanders is a champion in the fight for climate justice and, like him, we know we need to address our emissions through action, not just rhetoric," said Faiz Shakir, campaign manager. "We are proud to lead the way in the fight against climate change by acting boldly to move our energy system away from fossil fuels and towards sustainable energy sources."
In an effort to balance out the carbon emissions produced by travel activities associated with both himself and his staff, Sanders is partnering with NativeEnergy, a Vermont-based leader in emissions reduction project investments, to support renewable energy projects and invest in carbon reduction projects. Bernie 2020 will also offset event venue and attendee-related emissions.
In 2016, Bernie also offset the emissions from all of his staff's campaign offices and travel activities, and he addressed the emissions from his 2018 Vermont Senate campaign by supporting an innovative emissions reduction project on a Vermont dairy farm.
Bernie is a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal resolution and has introduced the boldest legislation in the Senate to combat climate change by rapidly transitioning away from fossil fuels to 100 percent renewable energy, creating millions of good-paying jobs in the process.
