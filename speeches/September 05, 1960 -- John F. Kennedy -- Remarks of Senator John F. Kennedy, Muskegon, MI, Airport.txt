    Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my thanks to all of you for coming down to this airport to meet us. I am sure after spending the day traveling around Michigan that Michigan is going Democratic in November. We want your help. [Applause.]
I want you to know that this campaign, I think, is the most important election that we have had in many ways since the election of 1932. I don't think we want to turn this country for 4 more years over to the Republicans. I think we can win. We can send Pat McNamara back to the Senate, elect a great Governor to succeed Mennen Williams, John Swainson, and give me your help. Thank you. [Applause.]
