    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94 - 265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an agreement effected by exchange of notes February 17, 1989, and March 27, 1989, extending for the period of 2 years from July 1, 1989, until July 1, 1991, the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Korea Concerning Fisheries off the Coasts of the United States, signed at Washington on July 26, 1982, as amended and extended. The exchange of notes together with the present agreement constitute a governing international fishery agreement within the meaning of section 201(c) of the act.
Several U.S. fishing industry interests have urged prompt consideration of this agreement. Because of the importance of our fishing relationship with Korea, I urge the Congress to give favorable consideration to this agreement at an early date.
Since 60 calendar days of continuous session, as required by the legislation, may not be available before the current agreement is scheduled to expire, I recommend the Congress consider passage of a joint resolution.
George Bush
The White House,
May 1, 1989.
