    Today's announcement by the British and Irish Governments on the arrangements for the June 10 negotiations on Northern Ireland marks another historic step toward a brighter future for the people. I welcome this agreement, which will enable the negotiation of a comprehensive and lasting settlement to the conflict that has plagued generations.
I commend Prime Ministers Major and Bruton for the perseverance and determination that they have shown in the cause of peace. I have just spoken with them both, and once again I am impressed by their commitment to the peace process. From the Downing Street Declaration of December 1993 to the Joint Framework Documents of February 1995 and the joint communique of February 28 of this year, the two governments have worked tirelessly to establish the foundation for successful talks. I am pleased that Senator George Mitchell has agreed to chair the plenary session of the talks. I know that he and his colleagues, General John de Chastelain and Mr. Harri Holkeri, will again make a major contribution to the peace process.
With the start of the talks on June 10, the parties have a real chance to set aside the past and negotiate a future of hope and promise, justice and peace. This is something only they can do. But I want them to know that the United States will continue to stand with them as they work to make that dream a reality. I call once again for a restoration of the IRA cease-fire which will enable the talks to be fully inclusive.
The success of these talks will depend on the vision and generosity of spirit of the elected representatives of the people. My hopes and prayers are with them as they begin to forge a bright and prosperous future for the children of both of Ireland's vibrant traditions.
