    Manchester, NH – Today, the Edwards family began their four-day 'Fighting for One America' bus tour across New Hampshire. Senator John Edwards discussed his bold plan to achieve energy independence and stop global warming by creating a new energy economy.
"Elizabeth and I are looking forward to the opportunity to talk to New Hampshire voters over the next four days," Senator John Edwards said. "I look forward to discussing my detailed plans of how we are going to build one America that benefits everyone.
"One of the crucial issues facing us today is global warming," Edwards continued. "My plan will combat global warming, reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, and create good-paying 'Green Collar' jobs in America."
New Hampshire continues to suffer from increases in particulate matter and ozone, as well as additional air pollution blowing up from the mid-west and other states.
Edwards is leading by example by using a biodiesel bus on this tour and running a carbon neutral campaign.
Edwards continues to drive the Democratic agenda with his specific ideas to transform our country. While Washington offers only rhetoric, empty talk and half-measures, Edwards is offering courage, conviction and bold ideas to build one America.
The next three days of the tour will focus on additional critical issues facing America – delivering truly universal healthcare; providing economic fairness and rewarding work; and ending the war in Iraq and honoring our veterans.
