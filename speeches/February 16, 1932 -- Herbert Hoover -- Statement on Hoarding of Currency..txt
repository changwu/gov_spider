    THE PRESIDENT said:
"I am glad to report that since February 4 when I took action on hoarding, there has been an entire turn in the tide. Up to a few days previous to that time hoarding was greatly on the increase. Since that time it has not only stopped, but it is estimated that $34 million has been returned to circulation from hoarding."
