    Mr. Mayor, President and Mrs. Ceausescu, the wonderful people of Bucharest, the wonderful, wonderful people of Romania:
Let me first extend on behalf of Mrs. Ford, my son, and myself, our deep gratitude for the opportunity of visiting you in this gorgeous city.
The key to the city is indicative of the ties between the people of Romania and the people of the United States, and I receive the key as an expression of the closeness that has developed and will continue to grow and flourish.
As we came in from the airport, it was my privilege to see, Mr. Mayor, the beautiful fields, the gorgeous trees, and most importantly, the friendly and warm people of the country that we are now privileged to visit.
Mrs. Ford, our son, and I thank you for welcoming us to Bucharest, and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts on behalf of the American people.
