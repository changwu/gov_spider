Whereas the many preventable fires which occur each year in the United States cause loss of life or serious injury to thousands of persons; and
Whereas hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of property is destroyed annually by fires in this country; and
Whereas the great number of fires occurring in homes in the United States emphasizes the urgent need for impressing upon every citizen the fullest realization of individual responsibility for bringing about the curtailment of losses of life and property resulting from fires;
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim and designate the week beginning October 9, 1938, as Fire Prevention Week, and I urge upon all the people of the nation that they cooperate in the movement to emphasize the disastrous consequences of preventable fires to the end that more effective precautionary measures may be taken to eliminate fire hazards, and thus to safeguard human life and prevent the needless waste of property.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done at the City of Washington this 19th day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-third.
