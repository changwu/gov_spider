    Mr. President:
Let me, on behalf of the American people, thank you for two things.
First, of course, we thank you for this very generous gift to the American people on our Bicentennial. It will be, I think, used most beneficially in cementing relations in the future between your Government and ours.
But secondly, let me thank you for recognizing one of our great citizens, John J. McCloy. Unfortunately, the American people have not, in my judgment, adequately understood and recognized the significant contributions that John McCloy made to the postwar era and the development of relations between the Government of West Germany and our own.
I believe the establishment of this fund will, in this case, give recognition to a man who was always available for public service, a public service that seldom got proper public recognition, but a public service that was absolutely essential in the difficult times following World War II.
So this, in my judgment, is greatly appreciated not only by the people of the United States for what it can do in the future, but it does, at the same time, indelibly make as a matter of record a career of a person, in John J. McCloy, that needs that proper public exposure and recognition.
So, I thank you in both cases and congratulate John McCloy for his never-ending service to our country.
