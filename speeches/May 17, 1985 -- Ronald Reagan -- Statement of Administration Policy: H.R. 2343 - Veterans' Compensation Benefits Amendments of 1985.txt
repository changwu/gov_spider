    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Montgomery (D) Mississippi and 12 others)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2343, but will urge deletion by the Senate of the provision requiring maintenance of full-service Veterans Administration regional offices in each State. The Administration strongly opposes this provision, which would limit the VA's ability to administer its programs in the most efficient manner.
