    David K. E. Bruce was not only a diplomat of uncommon character and influence, he was also a man whose breadth of friendships, intellect, and empathy for the feelings of others made him an ideal representative of this Nation abroad. His service as Ambassador to France, Germany, and the United Kingdom fittingly symbolized his personal commitment to help reduce the age-old antagonisms of Europe and forge a bond of Western unity. As our country's first envoy to the People's Republic of China, he carried forward the process of normalizing relations set forth in the Shanghai Communiqu√©. In his life, as in his diplomacy, he showed how much could be achieved by "the application of intelligence and tact."
