    
MIAMI â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement tonight after The Associated Press projected that he won Tuesday's primary election in Michigan:
"I am grateful to the people of Michigan for defying the pundits and pollsters and giving us their support. This is a critically important night. We came from 30 points down in Michigan and we're seeing the same kind of come-from-behind momentum all across America.
"Not only is Michigan the gateway to the rest of the industrial Midwest, the results there show that we are a national campaign. We already have won in the Midwest, New England and the Great Plains and as more people get to know more about who we are and what our views are we're going to do very well."
