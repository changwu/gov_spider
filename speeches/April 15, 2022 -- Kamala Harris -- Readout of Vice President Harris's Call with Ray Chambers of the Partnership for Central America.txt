    Today Vice President Kamala Harris spoke to Ray Chambers, Vice Chair of the Partnership for Central America and World Health Organization Global Ambassador, about the ongoing work to address the root causes of migration from Central America. The Vice President provided an update on progress in implementation of the Administration's Root Causes Strategy, including marshalling private sector investment in the region through the Vice President's "Call to Action," which has generated more than $1.2 billion in private sector commitments to create new jobs and opportunities for people in the region. Mr. Chambers provided an update on the Partnership's progress in implementing economic development programs with private sector partners, and he shared recommendations to spur additional investment that benefits people in the U.S. and in Central America. The Vice President thanked Mr. Chambers for his leadership as Vice Chair of the Partnership. They discussed next steps to build on the progress achieved since the Vice President launched the "Call to Action" last year.
