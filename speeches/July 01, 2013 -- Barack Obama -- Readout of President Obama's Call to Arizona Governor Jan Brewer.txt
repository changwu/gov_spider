    Today, President Obama called Governor Jan Brewer to receive an update on the Yarnell Hill fire and express his condolences to the families of the 19 brave firefighters and all whose lives have been impacted by this tragedy. He also expressed his gratitude to the hundreds of first responders who continue to work around the clock to protect homes and businesses from this deadly blaze.
The President reinforced his commitment to providing the necessary federal support to the state and local efforts. The administration will continue to keep in constant contact with the local officials and coordinate with our federal partners including FEMA, Department of Homeland Security, US Forest Service and Department of Interior.
Hundreds of brave men and women are responding to the Yarnell Hill fire, and hundreds more are battling dangerous fires in Arizona and other parts of the Nation. Additional assets have been deployed to support and assist the ongoing effort including airtankers, engines and helicopters. A National Wildland Fire Type 1 Incident Management Team has also been deployed to assist with the response. FEMA has approved Fire Management Assistance Grants for the Yarnell Hill fire and the President asked the Governor to inform him of any additional resources that could be provided to protect the communities and families across the state. The President encourages all local residents to follow the instructions of local officials, especially evacuation orders.
