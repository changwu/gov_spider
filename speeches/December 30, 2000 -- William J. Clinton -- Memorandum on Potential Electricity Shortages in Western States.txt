Subject: Potential Electricity Shortages in Western States
Increased demand for electricity during cold winter weather can make it a challenge for electric utilities to meet the demand of their customers and keep lights on and their homes and businesses warm. Currently, the supply of electric power is tight on the West Coast due to record demand for electricity. The region faces the possibility of electricity shortages in some areas, which would put both consumers and businesses at risk.
The Federal Government is among the largest consumers of electricity in Western States. It is important that the Federal Government lead by example in taking energy conserving steps to reduce the risk and severity of power outages. Therefore, I direct that:

All managers of all Federal buildings in Washington and Oregon join those in California and take steps to reduce consumption of power to the maximum extent practicable consistent with public health and welfare, and that of employees; and
Federal agencies coordinate with other State and local government agencies to minimize the use of electricity in all government buildings in Washington, Oregon, and California.

When the Federal Government, State governments, businesses, and consumers work together to use electricity wisely, we can reduce the risk of power shortages in the short term and keep the power on.
