    "The people who benefit the most from the food fight are the media and Joe Biden." - Tim Scott
CHARLESTON, SC - Today, Tim Scott joined Fox News' Faulkner Focus following the first GOP debate to discuss his debate performance and his time on the campaign trail.
In the days to come, Tim is taking his message of restoring hope and creating opportunity directly to voters in New Hampshire, Iowa, and his home state of South Carolina.
Watch here
Tim Scott:  It was an exciting time last night. I'm so excited to be still here in Milwaukee, heading to New Hampshire next, but I'll say no doubt, the people who benefit the most from the food fight are the media and Joe Biden. We need to have a serious conversation about the priorities of the American people. We need to reassure this nation that we are not in decline, but under President Biden, we're in retreat. We need to break the backs of the teacher's unions so that every child and every zip code has a quality education. That means a parent has a choice and a kid has the best chance for the rest of their lives. ...
Tim Scott: I'm going to continue to make sure that I provide the American people with an adult in the room having a conversation about their priorities. Certainly the more you interrupt, the more time you get. But frankly, the more that helps Joe Biden. What I'm gonna do is focus on those issues that set captives free. I'm talking about a kid who's born in poverty, who realized the American dream. Because America is the solution, not the problem. You heard people on the stage last night refer to America as a part of the problem because we're a nation in decline. We are a nation in retreat because Joe Biden has us as a nation in retreat. As the next President of the United States, I'll be standing proud and strong on the fact that the windshield of America's future is a whole lot better than the rear view mirror of our past.
