    (San Francisco, CA November 12, 2019) — Today presidential candidate for the Democratic nomination Tom Steyer released the following statement as the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments addressing the constitutionality of the cancelation of the DACA program this morning:
"I stand in solidarity with the nearly 800,000 DACA recipients who are our coworkers, students, and military personnel living and contributing to our country.
"As usual, the racist actions of Donald Trump, along with the inhumane, and cruel immigration policies of his Administration have neglected to consider the long term impacts of Trump's irrational decision. Since the Trump administration decided to cancel the program, DACA recipients have faced significant uncertainty, subjecting members of our communities across the country to the potential threat of deportation.
"To target Dreamers is ignoring their social and fiscal contributions. As contributing members of society, they are actively engaged in scholarly pursuits and gainful employment as qualifiers for their protected status. Dreamers are a part of the fabric of our country, and as such, it's our obligation to stand by them.
"It is my hope that the U.S. Supreme Court will rule on behalf of the DACA program and put an end to the uncertainty faced on a daily basis by those youths living in limbo or unable to reapply for the program. Immigrants make our nation great — their home is here. The future of our country depends on them."
