    I want to thank the Senate for confirming my nominee for Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Jared Bernstein. Our economy continues to show progress tackling inflation while unemployment remains at historic lows. While there is more work to do, jobs are up, wages are up, and inflation is down, and Jared uniquely understands that a job is about far more than a paycheck, it's about the dignity of work.
I look forward to Jared's continued leadership as we build an economy that works for working people.
