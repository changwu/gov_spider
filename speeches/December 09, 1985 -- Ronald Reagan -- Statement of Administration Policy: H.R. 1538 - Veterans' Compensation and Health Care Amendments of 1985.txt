    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Applegate (D) Ohio)
The Administration will not oppose House passage of H.R. 1538 but will work in Conference to amend several objectionable provisions, including:
— changing from 3.7 percent to 3.1 percent the increase in the rates of compensation, of dependency and indemnity compensation, and aid and attendance allowance. The Administration strongly supports a 3.1 percent increase because it represents the actual cost of living increase that will be provided to Social Security and veterans7 pension beneficiaries, and
— changing the bill's provisions reforming VA medical care eligibility to be more consistent with the Administration's proposal which would have set the eligibility threshold at twice the maximum annual pension rate (approximately $15,000 for a family of 2). In addition, if a copayment policy is to be pursued (as in H.R. 1538) for non-service-connected veterans who have higher incomes, the fees should be restructured to provide for payments which accurately reflect the utilization of services provided.
