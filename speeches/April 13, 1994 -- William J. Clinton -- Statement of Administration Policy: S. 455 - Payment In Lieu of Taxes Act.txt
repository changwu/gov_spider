    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Hatfield (R) OR and 44 others)
The Administration supports the payment in lieu of taxes (PILT) program to compensate units of local governments for losses to their real property tax base due to Federal lands within their boundaries. The Administration, however, cannot support S. 455, which would authorize substantial increases in PILT payments.
Unlike other public land payments to States and units of local of government that are funded principally from revenues arising from public land use the PILT program is funded through direct annual appropriations. Consequently, given the discretionary limits imposed by the omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, additional PILT payments would come at the expense of other priority programs.
