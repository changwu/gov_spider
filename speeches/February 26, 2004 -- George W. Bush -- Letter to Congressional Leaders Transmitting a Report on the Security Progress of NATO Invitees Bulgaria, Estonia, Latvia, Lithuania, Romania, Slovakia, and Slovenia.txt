    Dear __________:
Consistent with Condition 3(2)(A) of the Senate resolution of advice and consent to ratification to the Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, passed on May 8, 2003, I am providing a report prepared by my Administration.
This report describes the progress of the seven NATO invitees in satisfying the security sector and security vetting requirements for membership in NATO. As the report makes clear, all seven satisfy these NATO requirements.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
