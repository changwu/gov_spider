    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(English (D) Oklahoma)
The Native American Cultural Center is a State facility for the benefit of State and local interests. As such, the Federal government should not assume responsibility for the center and should limit any support to technical assistance, as provided for under current law. The Administration, therefore, opposes House passage of H.R. 3370.
