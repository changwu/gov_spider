    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 7/27/92)(House)(Miller (D) California)
The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 4004, because the bill:

—   fails to address directly the obstacles that prevent judicial independence and impartiality in tribal courts;
—   unnecessarily duplicates on-going Federal services and programs; and
—   authorizes appropriations that foster unrealistic expectations of increased funding and expanded Federal assistance.
