    Whitehouse Will Serve as RI Campaign Co-Chair
The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and named him a Co-Chair of Clinton's Rhode Island campaign.
"All of my colleagues seeking the Democratic nomination are committed to a new direction for our country, and it has been an honor to serve with, and learn from, each of them. Today, I'm proud to endorse Senator Hillary Clinton to be our next president," Whitehouse said. "Her smart, tough, experienced leadership will be critically important as we work to bring our troops home from Iraq, reform our health care system to cover more American families, and solve the energy challenges of the 21st century."
Appointed United States Attorney for Rhode Island by President Bill Clinton, Whitehouse has also served as a senior advisor to former Governor Bruce Sundlun and as Rhode Island's Attorney General.
Elected to the Senate last November as part of a string of Democratic victories that returned majority control of Congress to Democrats, he is a member of the Senate committees on the Budget, Environment and Public Works, Judiciary, Aging, and Intelligence. He has introduced legislation aimed at encouraging health quality reforms and is part of the Senate's investigation into the Bush administration's unprecedented firing of several U.S. Attorneys late last year.
"We need more leaders like Sheldon Whitehouse in the Senate, urging the President to change course in Iraq and pushing for healthcare coverage for all Americans," Clinton said. "I'm honored he'll help lead our efforts in Rhode Island."
