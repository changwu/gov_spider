    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Molinari (R) NY and two cosponsors)
The Administration has a long history of strong support for breast cancer research. Between 1993 and 1997, funding for breast cancer research at NIH has increased $172 million, or 75%.
H.R. 1585 would create a new mechanism for allocating medical research funds, which may raise some practical difficulties. The Administration urges the Congress to consult closely with the National Institutes of Health and the Postal Service before finalizing this legislation.
