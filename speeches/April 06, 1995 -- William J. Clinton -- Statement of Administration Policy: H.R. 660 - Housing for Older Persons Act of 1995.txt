    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Shaw (R) FL and 23 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination against families with children but also contains an exemption for "housing for older persons." The Administration, however, also recognizes the need to clarify and simplify the application of the exemption. To this end, the Department of Housing and Urban Development is soliciting public comments on proposed clarifications. H.R. 660, however, would loosen the standards used to determine what housing qualifies for the "housing for older persons" exemption and, in doing so, would potentially increase discrimination against families. For this reason, the Administration prefers administrative action to clarify application of the "housing for older persons" exemption.
