(House Rules)
(Rep. Burgess, R-TX, and 4 cosponsors)
The Affordable Care Act made significant improvements to our Nation's health care system that are helping to improve individuals' health and give American families and sma ll business owners more control of their own health care. These important changes include: ending the worst practices of insurance companies; giving uninsured individuals and small business owners the same kind of choice of private health insurance that Members of Congress have; and bringing down the cost of health care for families and businesses while also reducing Federal budget deficits.
As the President indicated in the State of the Union, the Administration is eager to work with the Congress to improve the Affordable Care Act by making care better or more affordable. Rather than making refinements to improve the law, H.R. 1214 simply proposes to eliminate funding. It does not advance the key objectives of the Affordable Care Act or offer alternative solutions for meeting these important objectives, and the bill may make it harder to achieve better and more affordable care. H.R. 1214 would repeal the Affordable Care Act's school-based health center construction grants and rescind unobligated balances. These funds support the improvement and expansion of health centers in schools across the Nation to improve access to primary care health care services for children.
The Administration will continue to work with the Congress to responsibly implement the Affordable Care Act. However, the Administration will strongly oppose legislation that attempts to erode the important provisions of the Affordable Care Act that are making health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans.
