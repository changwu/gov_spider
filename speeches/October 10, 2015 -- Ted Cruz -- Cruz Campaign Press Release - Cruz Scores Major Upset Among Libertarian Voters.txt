HOUSTON, Texas — Presidential candidate Ted Cruz continues to shore up his strong support among libertarian voters, earning 51 percent support from voters participating in the straw poll held at the Republican Liberty Caucus in Nashua, NH over the weekend.
Cruz received 399 votes (51%), just a few points behind Rand Paul's 445 votes (57%).
"We are very encouraged by the growing support we are seeing among liberty voters in the early states and across the country," Cruz said. "I have spent my career defending the constitutional liberties that our nation was founded upon, and that are increasingly under assault today. From free speech and religious liberty to our right to bear arms and our right to privacy, I have been proud to lead on all these issues, whether before the Supreme Court or in the Senate. If I'm elected president, libertarian voters across the country can be confident that I will continue to stand for the U.S. Constitution at every turn."
Sen. Cruz's strong performance in the straw poll comes at the heels of a growing coalition of libertarian voters organizing in the early states and across the country for the Cruz for President campaign. The campaign's Liberty Leaders coalition is chaired by former U.S. Congressman Bob Barr (the 2008 Libertarian Party presidential nominee), with 25 former Ron Paul organizers and supporters leading efforts in the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina.
Sen. Cruz continues to expand his base among Tea Party, evangelical, and libertarian voters. He has won multiple recent straw polls demonstrating his deep base of support across the spectrum of Republican voters, including decisive victories in both the Freedom Works and the Values Voters straw polls.
