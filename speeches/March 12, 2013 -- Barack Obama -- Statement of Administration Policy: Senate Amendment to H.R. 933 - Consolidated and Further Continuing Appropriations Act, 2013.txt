(Senate)
(Sen. Mikulski, D-MD)
The Administration supports Senate passage of the substitute amendment to H.R. 933, making appropriations for the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and other departments and agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2013, and for other purposes. The substitute amendment improves upon H.R. 933 by strengthening funding for transportation infrastructure, manufacturing, research and development, early childhood programs, and housing programs. Further, the Administration strongly supports inclusion of several full-year appropriations bills, which will improve the ability to efficiently allocate funding to key investments, including those that support science and innovation, nutrition, cybersecurity, community safety, and national defense. The Administration urges the Congress to promptly pass this bipartisan compromise allowing critical Government functions to operate without interruption in order to protect national security and ensure that Americans continue to receive vital services and benefits.
