    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Pursuant to section 8(b) of the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967, as amended (22 U.S.C. 1978(b)), generally known as the Pelly Amendment, I am notifying you that on November 3, 1992, in accordance with section 101(a) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the Secretary of Commerce certified to me that a denial of an affirmative finding and resulting embargo of yellowfin tuna and products derived from yellowfin tuna harvested in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP) by Colombian flag vessels has been in effect since April 27, 1992.
By the terms of the MMPA, such certification is deemed to be a certification for the purposes of the Pelly Amendment, which requires that I consider and, at my discretion, order the prohibition of imports into the United States of products from the identified country, to the extent that such prohibition is sanctioned by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Pelly Amendment also requires that I report to the Congress any actions taken under this subsection and, if no import prohibitions have been ordered, the reasons for this action.
After thorough review, I have determined that additional sanctions against Colombia under the Pelly Amendment will not be imposed at this time while the Administration continues to implement an international dolphin conservation program in the ETP.
Sincerely,
George Bush
