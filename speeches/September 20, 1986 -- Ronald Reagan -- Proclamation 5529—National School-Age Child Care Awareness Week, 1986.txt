  A Proclamation

The social context in which American children live is changing rapidly as the traditional balance between work and family life is being realigned. More mothers with children are entering the work force. Two-thirds of all mothers with school-age children are now working; three-fourths of our single parents are in the labor force.
To increase awareness throughout the country of the growing need for school-age child care and to reaffirm America's commitment to our children's well-being, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 60, has designated the week beginning September 15, 1986, as "National School-Age Child Care Awareness Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event.
Now, Therefore, L Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning September 15, 1986, as National School-Age Child Care Awareness Week.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.

RONALD REAGAN
