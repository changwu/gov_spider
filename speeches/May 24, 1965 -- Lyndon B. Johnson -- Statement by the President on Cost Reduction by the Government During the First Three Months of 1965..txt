    THIS IS the sixth time in the last year and a half that agency heads have reported to me on their efforts to reduce costs and improve operations. Some people have said that we have skimmed off the cream and that further savings will be harder to get. I think this quarter's results show just the opposite. They are most impressive. I am particularly pleased to note that we are beginning to strike pay dirt in savings that result from improvements in program accomplishment. Up to now most of our savings have come from better administration: this quarter $141 million of the savings-more than half result from improvements in the way in which agencies go about meeting their objectives. The potential for further savings in this area is very great.
