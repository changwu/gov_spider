    I commend the Senate for voting to confirm Justice Janice Rogers Brown. During her tenure on the California Supreme Court and California Court of Appeals, Justice Brown has distinguished herself as a brilliant and fair-minded jurist who is committed to the rule of law. Justice Brown exemplifies the American dream of personal achievement and excellence, and she will be a great asset to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
