    I applaud the House for taking a significant step to help our Nation's seniors.
This Medicare legislation broadly reflects the reforms outlined in my framework that give seniors the right to choose the health care that best meets their individual needs, including the option of staying in their traditional plan. It also modernizes Medicare so seniors will have access to the newest medical technologies and most effective medicines.
Seniors have waited too long for more choices and better benefits, including prescription drug coverage, similar to the kind now enjoyed by Federal employees and Members of the Congress. I will continue working closely with Congress during conference to make improvements and pass meaningful Medicare reform.
