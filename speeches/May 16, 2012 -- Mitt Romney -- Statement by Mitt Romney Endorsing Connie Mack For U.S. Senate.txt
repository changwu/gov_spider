    Today, Mitt Romney released the following statement on his endorsement of Florida Republican Senate candidate, U.S. Rep. Connie Mack.
"Connie Mack is a friend, a strong conservative and the type of principled leader we need in Washington to restore fiscal responsibility. By electing Connie Mack, the people of Florida will be sending a clear message to Senator Nelson and President Obama that their failed policies have not worked to change the borrow and spend ways of Washington."
