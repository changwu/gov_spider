    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 3/13/92)(House)(Ackerman (D) NY and eight others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 3209. The bill would require the payment of salary differentials to Federal employees serving in the Reserves, who were called to active duty for Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm. Paying salary supplements to such employees results in paying them more than other active duty personnel of the same rank. This is unfair, unjustified, and undesirable as a matter of military pay policy.
In addition, H.R. 3209 is objectionable because it does not include offsets to the increase in direct spending provided in the bill, as required by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA).
Scoring for the Purpose of Pay-As-You-Go
H.R. 3209 would increase direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of OBRA. No offsets to the direct spending increases are provided in the bill. A budget point of order applies in both the House and Senate against any bill that is not fully offset under CBO scoring. If, contrary to the Administration's recommendation, the House waives any such point of order that applies against H.R. 3209, the effects of enactment of this legislation would be included in a look back pay-as-you-go sequester report at the end of the congressional session.
OMB's preliminary scoring estimates of this bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If H.R. 3209 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within five days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to Congress.
