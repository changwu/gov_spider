    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Illinois House Republican Leader Tom Cross. The campaign also announced the endorsements of seventeen State Representatives and one State Senator.
"My message of more jobs, smaller government, and less debt is resonating in Illinois," said Mitt Romney. "I am proud to add these Illinois public servants to my growing team and look forward to working with them to spread my pro-growth message in the days leading up to the primary on Tuesday."
"Washington is broken and we need a Washington outsider to fix it," said House Minority Leader Tom Cross. "Mitt Romney spent his life in the private sector and knows that for our country to start creating jobs again, we need to get Washington out of the way. With Mitt Romney in the White House, voters in Illinois can be confident that they will have a president who will bring jobs back and shrink both the federal government and our federal debt."

Representative Cross serves Illinois' 84th District. Cross has served since 1993 and has focused on job creation, cutting wasteful spending, and making the Illinois government more accountable to the taxpayers.
