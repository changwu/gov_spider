    I want to thank Senator Nelson for his years of service representing the people of Nebraska, first as Governor, and then for more than a decade in the United States Senate. Over the course of his career, Ben's commitment to working with both Democrats and Republicans across a broad range of issues is a trait far too often overlooked in today's politics. Michelle and I commend Ben for his service and wish him and his family well in the future.
