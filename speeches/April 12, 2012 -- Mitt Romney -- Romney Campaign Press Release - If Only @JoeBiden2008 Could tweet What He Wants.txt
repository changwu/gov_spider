    Imagine if Vice President Biden decided to cut loose and tweeted what he really thought. We think it would look something like this.
@JoeBiden2008: I said in '08 that @BarackObama wasn't ready to be Prez. On-the-job training isn't going so well. http://youtu.be/RDVUPqoowf8


    In 2007, Joe Biden Said Barack Obama Was Not Prepared To Be President. Q: "But Senator Biden, you did go beyond talking about Pakistan. You were asked: Is [Obama] ready? You said, ‘I think he can be ready, but right now I don't believe he is. The presidency is not something that lends itself to on-the-job training.'" BIDEN: "I think I stand by the statement." (Democrat Presidential Candidate Debate, 8/19/07; http://youtu.be/RDVUPqoowf8)
  

@JoeBiden2008: There's a 30% chance that @BarackObama and I will get things wrong. Is that good enough? #inspiringconfidence


    In 2009, Vice President Biden Made An Interesting Estimation Of Getting Things Right. BIDEN: "If we do everything right, if we do it with absolute certainty, there's still a 30% chance we're going to get it wrong." ("Joe Biden's Stimulus Stumble," Time, 2/6/09)
  

@JoeBiden2008: I think Hillary Clinton would have made a better Vice President than me. I kinda wish she were. #Fact


    In 2008, Biden Said Hillary Clinton Would Have Been A Better VP Pick Than Him. BIDEN: "Hillary Clinton is as qualified or more qualified than I am to be Vice President of the United States of America. ... Quite frankly, it might have been a better pick than me." ("An Unlikely Endorsement," Time, 9/10/08)
  

@JoeBiden2008: We need to find more tax money for the government to spend. How about a GLOBAL TAX? Yes. #taxtheplanet

In 2012, Vice President Biden Called For A "Global Minimum Tax." BIDEN: "We want to create what's called a global minimum tax..." (Vice President Joe Biden, Remarks In Davenport, IA, 3/28/12)

@JoeBiden2008: Why not take it one step further? A GALAXY TAX could fulfill our wildest big-government spending dreams! #taxthegalaxy

In 2012, Vice President Biden Called For A "Global Minimum Tax." BIDEN: "We want to create what's called a global minimum tax..." (Vice President Joe Biden, Remarks In Davenport, IA, 3/28/12)

@JoeBiden2008: @BarackObama positions on Afghanistan sound similar to mine. I would never suggest he copied my foreign policy... #humblebrag


    In 2008, Biden Attacked Obama For Recently Copying His Foreign Policy Positions. "On Aug. 1, 2007, when Obama unveiled his counterterrorism agenda, the Biden camp fired off a snarky email congratulating him for his ‘Johnny-come-lately position' on Afghanistan, noting that during two Foreign Relations Committee hearings on Afghanistan and other subjects, Obama didn't ask questions about the Taliban, Al Qaeda, or Afghanistan." (Mark Murray and Domenico Montanaro, "Biden Wasn't Always Defending Obama...," NBC's First Read, 7/7/08)
