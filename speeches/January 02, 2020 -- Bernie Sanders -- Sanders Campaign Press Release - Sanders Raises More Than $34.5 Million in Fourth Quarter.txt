    More than 40,000 New Donors Flood in on Deadline Day 
WASHINGTON â€“ Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign on Thursday announced it raised more than $34.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 from more than 1.8 million donations, including contributions from 40,000 new donors that flooded in on the final day of the quarter.
"Bernie Sanders is closing the year with the most donations of any candidate in history at this point in a presidential campaign," Campaign Manager Faiz Shakir said. "He is proving each and every day that working class Americans are ready and willing to fully fund a campaign that stands up for them and takes on the biggest corporations and the wealthy. You build a grassroots movement to beat Donald Trump and create a political revolution one $18 donation at a time, and that's exactly why Bernie is going to win."
Sanders' campaign raised more than $18 million from over 900,000 donations in December alone, which is the campaign's single best fundraising month to date. Nearly 300,000 new donors gave in the fourth quarter.
"Teacher" was the most common occupation of Sanders'fourth quarter donors, the five most common employers were Amazon, Starbucks, Walmart, the United States Postal Service and Target, and the average donation was $18.53.
Since the campaign's February launch, Sanders has raised more than $96 million from over 5 million individual donations for an average contribution of $18 and more than 99.9 percent of donors have not maxed out and can give again. That total does not include an additional $12.7 million in transfers all made in prior quarters from Sanders' other federal accounts. Sanders' 2016 campaign did not hit the 5 million donations mark until after Super Tuesday.
