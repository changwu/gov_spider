In-town pool report #8 - POTUS remarks
POTUS began speaking at 2:46 pm. His prepared remarks ended at 3:06 pm.
He was accompanied by Education Secretary Cardona.
POTUS recounted how his father was ashamed that he couldn't borrow the money for Biden's college education. Biden said his father believed, as he does, that education is the ticket to a better way of life. But over time that ticket has become too expensive.
He said the debt burden is particularly hard on Black & Hispanic borrowers.
"Now it's time to address the burden of student debt," he said.
Biden said his actions honor his campaign promises.
"All this means people can finally start crawling out of that mountain of debt," he said. "When this happens, the whole economy is better off."
He said the changes provide real benefits for families without a meaningful effect on inflation.
"It's a game changer," he said of permanent changes to loan programs.
He said the administration will hold colleges accountable for jacking up costs.
"Our goal is to shine a light on the worst actors," he said.
Some will think his plan is too much & others will think it's not enough, he said. "I believe my plan is responsible & fair…will fix a badly broken system," he said.
He said he will continue to fight for doubling pell grants.
Biden took 2 questions:
On the FBI search of Mar-Lago, he said: "I didn't have any advance notice."
On whether the loan forgiveness is fair, he responded by asking if it's fair for the wealthy to get big tax breaks.

Biden: "I didn't have any advance notice. None. Zero. Not one single bit."
