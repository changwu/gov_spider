    Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, Lisa Monaco, met with Indian Deputy National Security Advisor Dr. Arvind Gupta in conjunction with the United States-India Cyber Dialogue. The leaders discussed a wide range of issues including cybersecurity, enhanced law enforcement cooperation, and U.S.-India collaboration against Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and other terrorist threats. Building on the commitment that President Obama and Prime Minister Modi made in New Delhi in January to make the U.S.-India partnership "a defining counterterrorism relationship for the 21st Century," they agreed to deepen their already close collaboration on these issues.
