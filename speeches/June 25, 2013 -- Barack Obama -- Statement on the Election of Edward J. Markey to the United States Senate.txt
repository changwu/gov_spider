    Tonight I spoke to Ed Markey to congratulate him on his election to the United States Senate.
During more than 36 years as a Congressman, Ed has distinguished himself as a leader on many of the key challenges of our time, from fighting carbon pollution to protecting our children from gun violence, to creating good middle class jobs. He's earned a reputation as an effective, creative legislator, willing to partner with colleagues across the aisle to make progress on the issues that matter most. The people of Massachusetts can be proud that they have another strong leader fighting for them in the Senate, and people across the country will benefit from Ed's talent and integrity.
I also want to thank Mo Cowan for his hard work and dedication over the last 5 months. And I want to thank John Kerry for his nearly three decades of extraordinary service to the people of Massachusetts in the Senate and for agreeing to continue to serve the American people as Secretary of State. I'm confident Ed will help carry on that legacy, and I look forward to working with him to strengthen our economy, protect the middle class, and expand opportunity.
