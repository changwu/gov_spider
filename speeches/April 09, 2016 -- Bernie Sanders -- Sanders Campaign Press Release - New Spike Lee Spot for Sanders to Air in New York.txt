    NEW YORK - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign released a new television ad for New York today, part of a multi-media advertising campaign produced by Spike Lee.
The 30-second spot features civil rights activists Harry Belafonte, Erica Garner, Shaun King and Linda Sarsour endorsing Sanders' political revolution for its impact on communities of color.
"People of color have a deeply vested interest in what Bernie Sanders brings to us in this election," Belafonte begins.
Garner continues, "people like Michael Brown, Sandra Bland and my father Eric Garner."
"They're not just hashtags and trending topics. But these are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters," King says.
"Bernie Sanders sees all of me. He sees all of you. He sees us a whole people, as a whole country," Sarsour declares. "That's why I'm voting for Bernie Sanders."
