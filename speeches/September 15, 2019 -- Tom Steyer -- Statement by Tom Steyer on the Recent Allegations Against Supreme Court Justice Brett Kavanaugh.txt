    (SAN FRANCISCO, September 15, 2019) — Today, in response to the recent allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanugh, presidential candidate Tom Steyer issued the following statement:
"The allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh are serious and should have been fully investigated before his confirmation vote. It's clear that the confirmation process for Justice Kavanaugh was nothing more than a farce put on by Senate Republicans and President Trump. There must be a full and transparent investigation, including the release of all relevant documents, and information. The White House and the Attorney General must stop blocking this information and allow the American people to see the whole body of evidence surrounding these grave allegations. If the only way to get the truth is to launch an impeachment process for Justice Kavanaugh, I support starting that process immediately.
Let's be clear though – this is a complete failure of our political system, including everyone who was part of the confirmation process. This isn't new – we have seen the impact of not listening to testimony from witnesses and victims during prior confirmation hearings. It's clear that the fundamental change we need will not come from inside Washington, but only when we put the structural reforms in place to give the power back to the American people."
