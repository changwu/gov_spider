    Today, new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the widespread benefits of the economic recovery – unemployment rates were lower in May than a year prior in all 389 metro areas and payroll jobs were up in 275 metro areas. 27 metro areas even had jobless rates of less than 3.0 percent. Unemployment rates over the past year also fell in the 51 largest – those with populations over 1 million -- metropolitan areas in the country.
Metropolitan areas that experienced the most severe economic impacts from the pandemic are rebounding at an unprecedented rate. Some of the metropolitan areas with the highest increase in employment since last year include Las Vegas, NV (+21%), Detroit, MI (+20%), and Buffalo, NY (+17%) – which were among the hardest hit when the economy shut down last year.
Thanks to President Biden's American Rescue Plan and a successful national vaccination strategy, the economy is getting back on track, and Americans are getting back to work.
President Biden's economic plan is working.
