    Eric Anderson, Chairman of Space Adventures, released the following statement on Mitt Romney's plan for Securing U.S. Leadership in Space:
"Mitt Romney's pro-innovation, pro-exploration vision for the U.S. space program will return it to a path of greatness and allow America's commercial space industry to fulfill its potential. I share his vision for America's commercial, civil, and defense space efforts and believe it will deliver significant growth in high-tech jobs, the creation of new space markets, rapid technical innovation, and a restoration of national pride.Â  In his business career, at the Olympics, and as governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney demonstrated a remarkable ability to prioritize goals, focus resources, and implement successful strategies in pursuit of excellence. We need his experience and leadership in the White House to help the next generation of entrepreneurs, engineers and explorers restore America's preeminence not only in space, but in the world."
