    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Annunzio (D) Illinois and two others)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2631. The bill's "buy America" provision, which Would generally require the United States Mint to purchase only United States products under certain procurement contracts, would violate the Agreement on Government Procurement under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The provision would invite retaliation and would raise unnecessary questions about the willingness of the United States to honor its international commitments.
The administration supports enactment of legislation authorizing appropriations for the United States Mint, consistent with the Ptesident's 1988 Budget request. Accordingly, H.R. 2631 should not be considered under suspension of the rules and should be amended to delete the "buy America" provision discussed above.
