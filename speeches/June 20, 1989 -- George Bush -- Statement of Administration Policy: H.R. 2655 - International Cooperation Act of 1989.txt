    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Fascell (D) Florida and 29 others)
The Administration has been seriously engaged over the past year in a major effort, initiated by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, to rewrite the authorities of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The task of making substantial changes to legislation first enacted in 1961, and amended annually thereafter, has been an enormous undertaking and one that was long overdue. The Report of the Task Force on Foreign Assistance, co-chaired by Representatives Hamilton and Gilman, was perceptive and basically accurate in its findings and recommendations. The Administration appreciates greatly the efforts of the leadership of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and those of other Members to take a fresh look at the foreign assistance program in order to establish more effective assistance programs, to eliminate obsolete and inconsistent provisions, and to foster greater cooperation between the Congress and the Executive branch. This effort coincides with the President's strong view, expressed to Congressional leaders in April, that the tendency toward legislative micromanagement should be rolled back.
The Administration recognizes that H.R. 2655, as reported by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, authorizes programs at or near the Administration request levels, authorizes the special assistance initiative for the Philippines, and improves or eliminates many obsolete and inconsistent provisions of current law. Among other things it provides for fair pricing in military sales; makes the Southern Region Amendment permanent; authorizes military assistance to the non-communist Cambodian resistance; revises congressional notification procedures; improves the language and reach of prohibitions on aid as well as administrative procedures that will increase programming efficiency; and eliminates outdated reporting requirements as well as modifying others to make them less burdensome.
The Administration continues to object, however, to provisions that raise serious constitutional concerns and impinge significantly on the ability of the President to conduct foreign policy. If these provisions were included in the bill presented to the President, his senior advisers would recommend that it be disapproved:
