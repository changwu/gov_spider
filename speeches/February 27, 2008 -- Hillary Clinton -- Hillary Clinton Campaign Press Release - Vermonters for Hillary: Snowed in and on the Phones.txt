    Snowed in due to a winter storm that covered most of the Green Mountain State with nearly a foot of snow, Vermonters for Hillary are wasting no time, helping the campaign by phone banking from their homes today. Campaign supporters will make hundreds of phone calls to ask their friends and neighbors to support Hillary when they head to the polls on March 4.
"Despite the weather, our volunteers, supporters and staff are hard at work," said Nancy Richardson, Vermont State Director. "With the election less than a week away, we are determined to make every day count."
The Vermont for Hillary campaign has a thriving statewide grassroots organization, with phone banks and visibilities taking place on daily basis. Yesterday the campaign announced its 15-person statewide steering committee and the opening of its second office in Rutland. Over the coming days, prominent national surrogates will join local leaders to campaign for Hillary in the Green Mountain State.
