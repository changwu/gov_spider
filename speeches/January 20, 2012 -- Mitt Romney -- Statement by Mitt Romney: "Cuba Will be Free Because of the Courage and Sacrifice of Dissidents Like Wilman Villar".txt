    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the death of Wilman Villar:
"The Castro regime is responsible for the death of Wilman Villar, just as it is responsible for the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, and countless other brave prisoners of conscience that the world might never know. Those of us who believe in freedom and cherish democracy must do our part to tell Wilman's story and denounce the injustices and cruelties of the Castro tyranny. Wilman's ultimate sacrifice requires that we renew our solidarity with Cuba's heroic pro-democracy movement.  Cuba will be free because of the courage and sacrifice of dissidents like Wilman Villar.  His young wife and family are in my thoughts and prayers."
