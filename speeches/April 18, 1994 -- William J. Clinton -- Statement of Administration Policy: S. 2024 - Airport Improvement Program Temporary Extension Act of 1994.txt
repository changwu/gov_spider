    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 4/19/94)(Senate)
The Administration has no objection to Senate passage of this legislation as a interim measure to release much needed airport infrastructure funding for the current construction season. The Administration, however, continues to urge enactment of the comprehensive legislative proposal, the "Aviation Investment Act of 1994" which it forwarded to Congress in January.
The Administration opposes, and recommends deletion, of the title addressing "Airport-Air Carrier Disputes." The Administration is sympathetic to the desire to equitably address issues raised by rates and charges imposed by airports. However, the Department of Transportation will soon release procedures for addressing this issue administratively, and believes that a legislative provision is not necessary.
