    I am disappointed that a minority in the Senate has again decided to play politics and block our Nation's ability to accomplish medical liability reform.
Today's vote is a blow to America's families, because pregnant women are losing access to their obstetricians and gynecologists due to frivolous and abusive lawsuits. Pregnant women who need prenatal and obstetric health care services deserve access to doctors in their own communities. Without the passage of reasonable reforms, the Nation's badly broken medical liability system will continue to drive physicians like obstetricians and gynecologists out of the practice of medicine and drive up the costs of health care for all Americans. For the benefit of America's families and for the sake of our health care system, there needs to be medical liability reform this year.
