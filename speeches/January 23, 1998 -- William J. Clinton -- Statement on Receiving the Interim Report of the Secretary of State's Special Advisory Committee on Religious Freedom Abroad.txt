    I welcome the report of the Committee, which my administration established in November 1996 to advise us on means to combat religious persecution and intolerance abroad.
I am pleased that the Committee has recognized the considerable efforts we have already made to raise the profile of these issues and invigorate our advocacy, and we will carefully study the Committee's recommendations on how we can do more.
This distinguished group of Americans is playing a critical role in our effort to promote religious freedom abroad, and we look forward to a continued and close collaboration as the Committee prepares its final report in the months to come.
