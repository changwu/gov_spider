    Earth Day encourages and celebrates countless acts of stewardship by individuals that improve the quality of our communities, parks, rivers, lakes, and private and public lands. The Government also has an important role to play in protecting our environment.
Three decades after the first Earth Day, our air is cleaner; our water is purer; and our lands and natural resources are better protected.
My administration is building on these accomplishments through new and innovative policies. We will reduce powerplant pollution by 70 percent. We will restore forest health, preventing catastrophic wildfires that devastate communities, wildlife habitat, and the landscape. And we will promote energy efficiency and security and improve and protect water quality, while encouraging economic growth. To help accomplish these goals, I have proposed legislation—Clear Skies, Healthy Forests, and the Hydrogen Fuel Initiative—which I call on Congress to pass this year.
Please join me in celebrating the 34th annual Earth Day by becoming a partner in service. I invite you to visit the USA Freedom Corps web site and EarthDay.gov to find environmental stewardship opportunities in your community. America's citizen conservation efforts play a vital role in preserving our Nation's natural resources, on Earth Day and throughout the year.
