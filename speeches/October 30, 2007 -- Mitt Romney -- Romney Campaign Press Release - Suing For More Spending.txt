    How Mayor Giuliani Sued For Increased Government Spending
"This guy is no judicial conservative. ... what's more troubling is that he went to court to get the policy he wanted each and every time. He says he's a 'strict constructionist' now, but again and again he has invited judges to be activist." â€“ National Review's Ramesh Ponnuru (Ramesh Ponnuru, "Giuliani On The Line-Item Veto," National Review Online's The Corner Blog, Posted on 10/9/07)
Mayor Giuliani Claims He Sued To Kill The Line-Item Veto Because He's "A Strict Constructionist":
Mayor Giuliani: "The Line Item Veto Was Unconstitutional. ... What The Heck Can You Do About That, If You're A Strict Constructionist?" (CNBC, Republican Presidential Candidate Debate, Dearborn, MI, 10/9/07)
But Mayor Giuliani Is No Strict Constructionist:
National Review's Ramesh Ponnuru: Mayor Giuliani "Is No Judicial Conservative." "Giuliani on the Line-Item Veto... This guy is no judicial conservative. I don't agree with him on gun control or the commuter tax or the 1996 welfare reform, but what's more troubling is that he went to court to get the policy he wanted each and every time. He says he's a 'strict constructionist' now, but again and again he has invited judges to be activist. And he hasn't repudiated any of that record." (Ramesh Ponnuru, "Giuliani On The Line-Item Veto," National Review Online's The Corner Blog, http://corner.nationalreview.com/, Posted on 10/9/07)
And Conservatives Agree That Mayor Giuliani Defeated Republicans And Conservatives:
The Weekly Standard's Terry Eastland: Giuliani "Fought And Defeated The Republican Congress" On The Line-Item Veto. "... [Giuliani] also fought and defeated the Republican Congress: the Line Item Veto Act was one of only two items in the Contract with America that it actually passed." (Terry Eastland, "Giuliani And Judicial Supremacy," The Weekly Standard's Campaign Standard Blog, http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/, Posted 10/10/07)
Power Line's Paul Mirengoff: "Giuliani's Argument That The Court's Decision Absolves Him Of Any Blame Strikes Me As Specious." (Paul Mirengoff, "The Line-Item Veto Debate, Who Got It Right," Power Line Blog, http://www.powerlineblog.com/, Posted 10/10/07)
Club For Growth's Pat Toomey: The Line-Item Veto Is A "Chink In Giuliani's Armor." "It's understandable that Romney would look for something [like the line-item veto] that would cut against that. It suggests a little chink in Giuliani's armor." (Janet Hook, "Republicans Draw Line On Veto Power," Los Angeles Times, 10/11/07)
National Review's John Hood Said He Was "Flabbergasted" At Giuliani For Attacking The Line-Item Veto, A Traditionally Conservative Ideal. "I am flabbergasted that Giuliani devoted so much energy at a GOP debate to attacking an idea traditionally associated with Republican fiscal conservatism, and personally with Reagan." (John Hood, "Re: Giuliani's Puzzling Mistake," National Review Online's The Corner Blog, http://corner.nationalreview.com/, Posted 10/11/07)
