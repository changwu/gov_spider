    Stan Scott was a close, personal friend. Barbara and I will miss him greatly. He was a man who dedicated his life to service of family, country, and the betterment of his fellow man.
Stan was universally admired. He was equally at home in the worlds of government, business, sports, and education. He used his friendships to improve the quality of life of all Americans. In particular, his lifelong commitment to the United Negro College Fund helped improve education for generations of Afro-American men and women.
Those who knew Stan felt a part of his extended family. To his wife, Bettye, and three children, Stan, Susan, and Kenneth, I send my deepest condolences and prayers.
