    
The economy and the world around us are undergoing historical changes. Ideas of the past no longer work and we are at a hinge moment in our nation's history.
We must decide whether we will embrace the future and confront its challenges, or be left behind by history.
If we embrace the future, the 21st century will not just be as good as the 20th century, it will be BETTER.
To do this, we have to wake up to the reality that yesterday is over. We must accept our role as the global leader and reclaim the American Dream at home.
We need leaders that understand the time has come for A New American Century. It's time to leave the past behind.
