    U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) made the following statement on tonight's third presidential debate:
"The president has many jobs, but perhaps none is more important than the role of Commander-in-Chief. Unfortunately, President Obama has shown a willingness to slash our military, weaken our global alliances, and rack up more than $16 trillion in debt, further weakening our national security. We need a president who will restore America's leadership abroad while strengthening our economic security at home. Mitt Romney represents a decisive break with the current administration's policies, and as he outlined tonight, he has a clear plan to renew America's influence around the world."
