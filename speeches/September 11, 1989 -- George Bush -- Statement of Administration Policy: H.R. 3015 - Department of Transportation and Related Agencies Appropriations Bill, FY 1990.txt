    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate Floor)(Sponsors: Byrd (D) , WV; Lautenberg (D) , NJ)
The Administration has several serious concerns about this bill. The bill assumes the use of $300 million of Department of Defense appropriations to fund services for the Coast Guard. The Administration strongly opposes the practice of diverting funds from needed Defense programs to augment inadequate appropriations for the Coast Guard. In addition, providing domestic discretionary programs (such as Coast Guard services) with funds intended for national defense violates the Bipartisan Budget Agreement (BBA).
Based on OMB's scoring, discretionary spending provided by this bill would result in outlays of $27.5 billion or $59 million above the 302(b) allocation. The Initial OMB Sequester Report of August 25th made clear that we have virtually no margin for expenditures above the 302(b) allocations if we are to avoid sequester. We therefore would respectfully urge the Senate to find appropriate means to bring the bill down to the 302(b) level.
The Administration is also concerned because the bill funds Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operations, modernization of air traffic control equipment, and Coast Guard services at levels below those contained in the President's request. We urge the Senate to fund fully the FAA and Coast Guard requests by making reductions in highways, mass transit, and Amtrak.
The Administration opposes a number of other provisions, as outlined in the attachment. We hope that the Senate will approve a bill that adequately funds essential programs, that complies with 302(b) allocations and the BBA, and that addresses satisfactorily the issues raised by the Administration.
