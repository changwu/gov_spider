    Verona, PA - While campaigning in Puerto Rico, Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum received the endorsement former major league baseball player Carlos Baerga.
"I support Rick because he is a Christian and has fought for the people of Puerto Rico for many years, and stands behind the people on the issue of statehood," Baerga said. "I am grateful to have played professional baseball in the United States and I want all young people to have the same opportunity, and Puerto Rican statehood would make that possible."
Baerga played for the Cleveland Indians, New York Mets, Boston Red Sox, and the Washington Nationals. He is the only major leaguer to hit a home run from both sides of the plate in the same inning.
Santorum said, "I was a fan of Carlos for many years and I'm thrilled to have his endorsement. Carlos is a role model for so many because of his career in baseball and his life as a Christian."
