    King Fahd of Saudi Arabia called President Bush to request that the state visit scheduled for later this month be postponed due to the sensitive phase of the mediation on the Lebanese situation by the Heads of State Committee of which the King is a member.
The President expressed his understanding as well as his wishes for the success of the Committee's effort to bring peace and stability to Lebanon. Both leaders agreed that the state visit would take place as soon as could be arranged after September 1.
