    MILFORD, NH -- New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson today released the following statement on the resignation of Idaho Senator Larry Craig:
"Senator Craig's resignation was the right thing to do. Dragging out this process and diverting the attention of the American people to personal matters would not have been appropriate conduct.
"Now we can get back to the domestic and international problems that our country faces. Let us end the war in Iraq. Let us fix our economy and provide good-paying jobs for our hard-working citizens. Let us provide health care for every American. These are the issues our nation should be tackling."
