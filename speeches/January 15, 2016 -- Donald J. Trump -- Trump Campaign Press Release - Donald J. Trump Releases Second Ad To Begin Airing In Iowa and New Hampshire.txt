(New York, NY) January 15th, 2016 â€” Today Donald J. Trump released the second major advertisement to begin airing in Iowa and New Hampshire. The buy is a total of $2 million dollars with $1.1 million spent in Iowa and nearly $1 million allocated to New Hampshire.
Mr. Trump stated, "I have tremendous crowds, we are leading all the polls and there are so many people that want to see our country be greater than ever before. My life has been about winning and Iowa and New Hampshire are so important to me. This is where we will begin to Make America Great Again!"
The footage is from a recent event in Lowell, Massachusetts, where Mr. Trump hosted a rally attended by a record crowd of over 10,000 people. The thirty-second spot outlines Mr. Trump's vision for the country. Mr. Trump's first ad, which focused on illegal immigration and national security, has been running in these early states for the last ten days.
Mr. Trump continues to lead in all national and state polls, including the just out NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showing Mr. Trump as the definitive front-runner with 33% support, more than doubling his lead over his nearest rival.
