After his sterling showing at last night's debate, Marco didn't take a minute to catch his breath. 
(He may have taken a couple sips of water — we're still waiting on the Politico dispatch.)
Early this morning, he flew from Las Vegas to Iowa, where he did a quick Fox News appearance to talk about the debate:

Here's what he had to say about the clash of views on national security we saw from the candidates:

Then it was off to a town hall in the Des Moines suburb of Ankeny. One political reporter noted the quick turnaround:

In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he focused on the issue at the top of so many voters' minds: how we keep America safe.

Then it was off to another flight. He wasn't leaving without checking in on the local press, though:

He flew to yet another crucial early state — New Hampshire, where he addressed a packed town hall in Manchester.

Drew Cline, the former editorial page editor of the state's biggest paper (the New Hampshire Union Leader) introduced Marco. 
It being football season, there were some Tom Brady jokes.

Drew Cline intro'ing Rubio in Manchester: "if you got a ring for every debate win, Rubio would have more than Tom Brady right now."

Here's what Marco had to say to the crowd:

Tomorrow, it's back to Iowa. We hope you'll get to catch Marco on the campaign trail soon!
