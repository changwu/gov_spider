So when will something significant happen to James Comey? Got caught cold. He is either very dumb, or one of the worst liars in political history. TOO LONG. EMBARRASSING!Retweets: 37225Favorites: 148707

Last night I did what the corrupt media has refused to do: I held Joe Biden Accountable for his 47 years of lies, 47 years of betrayals, and 47 years of failure. The whole nation saw the truth —Joe Biden is too weak to lead this Country! https://t.co/8WepHOC0XNRetweets: 23467Favorites: 92758

Comey is a disaster who cheated and lied. How do you write books when you can't remember anything? Should be tried for treason. This is ridiculous! https://t.co/Xc6OiM4dcJRetweets: 21333Favorites: 67092

I want to defend & preserve our nation's historic values. Our opponents stand with rioters – I stand with the heroes of Law Enforcement. Biden says Antifa is just an idea. Ideas don't assault cops & burn down buildings. Antifa is a domestic terrorist org. https://t.co/ZSnRJ8DaQoRetweets: 18699Favorites: 62522

As VP, Biden wiped out the Iron Range – seven plants were idled and more than 2K workers were laid off. After I put Tariffs on foreign steel, the Iron Range came roaring back to life! If Joe gets in, the Radical Left will shut down the Iron Range FOREVER! https://t.co/2Gk2uOjaCWRetweets: 13212Favorites: 44676

In just 3 and a half years, we have secured America's Borders, rebuilt the awesome power of the U.S. Military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate, fixed our disastrous Trade Deals, and brought JOBS back home to America – and back to MINNESOTA! #MAGA https://t.co/nX2oU5IWL0Retweets: 18737Favorites: 70211
