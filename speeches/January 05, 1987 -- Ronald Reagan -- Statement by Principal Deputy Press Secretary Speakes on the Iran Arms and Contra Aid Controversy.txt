    During the last week, at the President's direction, administration officials from the national security and foreign policy agencies of government worked with a staff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to make possible the release of a full, declassified staff report of the committee's finding on the Iranian arms sales matter. A declassified version of the staff report, amounting to 150 pages or so, was developed in the process, and we believe it is ready for release to the public. It is the most complete account thus far of how the President's policy concerning Iran was carried out and the most complete compilation of the available facts concerning the alleged diversion of funds to the anti-Sandinista forces in Nicaragua.
This afternoon, the committee will be meeting to consider whether to release this report. The President urges that the report be released to the public immediately. The administration cooperated fully with the committee during its investigation, fulfilling the President's desire that all of the facts concerning this matter be made available to the American people as promptly as possible. The release of a staff report would be a big step in this direction.
