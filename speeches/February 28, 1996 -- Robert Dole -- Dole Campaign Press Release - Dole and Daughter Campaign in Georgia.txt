    Following up on his solid victories in the North and South Dakota primaries, Senator Bob Dole and his daughter Robin will campaign in Georgia tomorrow. Senator Dole will campaign in Augusta while his daughter will visit Atlanta and Savannah.
"After our big wins in the West, our campaign has the momentum in the Southern primaries," said Dole Campaign Manager Scott Reed. "Bob Dole is the only candidate who can unify the social and economic conservatives in Georgia and lead the way to a victory in November."
Georgia will hold its GOP primary on March 5 and will send 42 delegates to the Republican National Convention in San Diego in August.
