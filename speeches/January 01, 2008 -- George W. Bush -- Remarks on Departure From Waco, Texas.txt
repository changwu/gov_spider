    The President. Laura and I wish our fellow Americans a happy and healthy 2008. I particularly want to say something to our troops and their families: This country respects you, we admire you, and we wish you a great 2008 as well.
We've just come off the ranch; had a good rest and good New Year's with some friends. And I'm looking forward to getting back to Washington to work on policies to keep this country safe and to keep this country prosperous.
I just wanted to stop by and wish everybody a happy 2008. Thank you.
The First Lady. Happy New Year, everybody.
