    Biden is an empty vessel for the radical left. 
Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield just this morning made clear that "everybody who believes that Joe Biden should be president" is "welcome into this campaign." That now includes Bob Avakian, the radical founder and leader of the Revolutionary Communist Party who just endorsed Joe Biden and instructed fellow communists to support Biden in the election. Avakian once faced serious charges of rioting and assault for protesting in favor of Chinese communist Mao Zedong's bloody and brutal regime. Avakian also titled his memoir My Journey from Mainstream America To Revolutionary Communist. "Bob Avakian has taken the whole idea and conception of communism to another level," one of his admirers once wrote.
Avakian's endorsement further demonstrates that Joe Biden is an empty vessel for the radical left. Indeed, Biden is seriously considering communist Rep. Karen Bass to be his running mate. Bass praised Fidel Castro, traveled to Cuba many times as part of a radical communist revolutionary group that trained in terrorist tactics, and eulogized a Communist Party USA member as her "mentor" in 2017. This is who Biden may put a heartbeat away from the presidency.
Joe Biden is too weak to be president and too weak to stand up to the radical left. He's nothing more than an empty vessel for the extremist fringe of the Democrat Party, a terrifying cabal which now includes active communist leaders.
They've taken over Joe Biden. Don't let them take over America.
