    (SAN FRANCISCO, December 3, 2019) â€” Today, presidential candidate Tom Steyer officially qualified for the Democratic National Committee debate in December by surpassing the required threshold of 200,000 unique donors. Steyer already hit the polling threshold last month by receiving 4% or higher in four qualifying polls.
"After terrific performances in the last two debates and a tremendous amount of earned media over the last month, Tom continues his surge in the early state polls which has led to an increased amount of donors over the last few weeks," Campaign Manager Heather Hargreaves said. "His message of ending the corporate takeover of our government and bringing democracy back to the American people continues to resonate with voters as they see him as the best candidate to go up against Trump."
The most recent weekly Morning Consult poll shows Steyer at 9% among early-state voters, up from 6% three weeks ago and in fifth place. In addition, recent public polling has shown Steyer at 5% or more in all 4 early states (PPP Iowa poll at 6%, Saint Anselm New Hampshire poll at 5%, Fox News poll in Nevada at 5%, and Quinnipiac 5% and University of North Florida 8% in South Carolina).
Steyer is the seventh candidate to qualify for the December debate. The DNC December debate will take place on December 19th in Los Angeles, California.
