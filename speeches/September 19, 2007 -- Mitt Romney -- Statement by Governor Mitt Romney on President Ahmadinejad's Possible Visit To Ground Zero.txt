Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement regarding the possible visit of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to Ground Zero in New York City:
"Ahmadinejad's shockingly audacious request should be met with a vehement no. It's inconceivable that any consideration would be given to the idea of entertaining the leader of a state sponsor of terror at Ground Zero. This would deeply offend the sensibilities of Americans from all corners of our nation. Instead of entertaining Ahmadinejad, we should be indicting him."
