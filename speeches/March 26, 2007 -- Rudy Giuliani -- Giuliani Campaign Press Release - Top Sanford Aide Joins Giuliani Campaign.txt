    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Exploratory Committee announced today that Jason Miller, former Campaign Manager and current Deputy Chief of Staff to Governor Mark Sanford, will join the Committee as a Deputy Communications Director in April. Miller joins Deputy Communications Director Maria Comella who overseas the regional media operation and serves as a spokeswoman for the committee.
Miller brings more than a decade of national political experience to the Committee, having won elections and shaped messages for successful House, Senate, and gubernatorial campaigns in California, Florida, Oklahoma and South Carolina. Miller has also worked as a staffer in both chambers on Capitol Hill, most recently as Chief of Staff to Florida Congressman Ric Keller.
Miller's role will be to oversee the Committee's national rapid response and surrogate speaker efforts from the headquarters in New York City, while also contributing to the Committee's organization-building efforts in South Carolina and several other early-primary states.
"With Jason we get an experienced communications professional who has campaign expertise in more than a half-dozen states across the country, and a proven coalition-builder whose understanding of the political ground game gives him unique insight for a national effort," said Committee Communications Director Katie Levinson.
