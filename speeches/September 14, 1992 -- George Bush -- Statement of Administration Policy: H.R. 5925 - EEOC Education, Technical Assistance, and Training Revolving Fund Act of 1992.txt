    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 9/15/92)(House)(Ford (D) MI and 4 others)
The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 5925.
Scoring for the Purposes of Pay-As-You-Go
H.R. 5925 would increase direct spending because it would transfer $1 million from the Salaries and Expenses appropriation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to a new revolving fund established by the bill. Therefore, the bill is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). A budget point of order applies in both the House and Senate against any bill that is not fully offset under CBO scoring. If, contrary to the Administration's recommendation, the House waives any such point of order that applies against H.R. 5925, the effect of enactment of this legislation would be included in a look-back pay-as-you- go sequester report at the end of the congressional session.
OMB's preliminary scoring estimates of this bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If H.R. 5925 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within five days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to the Congress.
