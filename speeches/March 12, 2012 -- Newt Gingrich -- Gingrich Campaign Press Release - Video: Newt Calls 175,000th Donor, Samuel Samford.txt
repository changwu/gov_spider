    Mobile, AL - Newt 2012 announced today the 175,000th donor of its presidential campaign, Samuel Samford, a warehouse manager from Jacksonville, Florida.  After learning the news, Newt Gingrich called Samford to personally thank him for his donation of $2.50 in support of Gingrich's American energy plan to lower gasoline to $2.50 per gallon.
"From the very beginning, we set out to run a people-powered campaign based on the creativity and enthusiasm of Americans looking to dismantle the old order and rebuild the America we love," said Newt Gingrich. "I'm proud to have Samuel Samford and our additional 174,999 donors standing with me as we work together to fundamentally change Washington.  Not only have they donated their hard-earned money, but they have also volunteered countless hours of their time, and Callista and I are extremely grateful for their support."
