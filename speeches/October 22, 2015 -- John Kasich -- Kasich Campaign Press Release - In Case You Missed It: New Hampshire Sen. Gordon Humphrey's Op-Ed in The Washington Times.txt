    Let's Make the U.S. Economy First in the World Again
By Gordon Humphrey — Washington Times
In his recently-released strategy for reviving America's economy, Ohio Governor John Kasich became the first Republican candidate to clearly articulate a plan for tearing down the barriers that Washington's size and cost pose to job creation.
Balancing the budget in eight years, cutting taxes, reforming regulations, federalism, and energy independence are all part of Kasich's plan and reflect his fundamental commitment to making America the world's leader in economic freedom.
Aren't we already first in economic freedom? No, we are not. In its annual ranking, the Cato Institute shows that 15 other countries, including Canada and the United Kingdom, are less burdened by regulations, bureaucracy and counterproductive taxes than the U.S. Alarmingly, America fell from 2nd to 16th place since 2000. No wonder most Americans have had no real growth in family income for years.
The problem with America's economy is called Washington. Stagnant growth isn't from the federal government doing too little; it's from too much regulating, taxing and stubbornly standing in our way. To paraphrase Ronald Reagan, Washington is not the solution; it's the problem.
As John Kasich has said, "We need less government and more ‘us.'" That is a message that would have gotten our Founding Fathers' heads nodding. Kasich's plan clearly shows his big vision and his commitment to taking our money, power and influence back from Washington and returning it to the states and communities where we live.
