    Mitt Romney today announced the support of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.
"Jeb Bush is synonymous with good government and with conservative policies that yield results. He has long demonstrated an outstanding ability to bring people together. I therefore take tremendous pride in having earned his endorsement. This is a key moment in the presidential contest and Jeb's counsel and support will be critical in the coming months in my effort to defeat Barack Obama and turn around our country."
