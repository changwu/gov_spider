The Orlando Sentinel is backing Marco Rubio, noting that the Florida contest on March 15th is perhaps the last chance to stop Donald Trump:
Florida's March 15 winner-take-all primary could be the last chance for party voters to throw up a roadblock in billionaire businessman Donald Trump's march to the GOP nomination.
We recommend Florida Republicans cast their ballots for another Sunshine State leader, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. Unlike Trump, Rubio has the knowledge and judgment to be president.
The Sentinel not only praises Marco, but outlines how catastrophic of a candidate Donald Trump would be against Hillary Clinton:
Where to begin on Trump's judgment? His idea of political discourse is hurling or tweeting insults at anyone who dares question him. He has maligned Mexican immigrants and Muslims. He has mocked people with disabilities and prisoners of war. He has disparaged and degraded women.
Lately Trump has been singing the praises of torturing suspected terrorists â€” which is not only illegal, but abhorrent to American values. He has called for changes in libel law to make it easier for politicians to muzzle the free press with lawsuits.
With multiple new polls showing Marco as the only candidate in position to defeat Donald Trump in Florida, the Orlando Sentinel is right. 
Marco is the last, best hope to reclaim our party and the conservative movement.
