    Alexandria, VA — In response to today's New York Times editorial, campaign manager Christian Ferry today released the following statement:
"The New York Times has become so desperate to salvage a bad nuclear deal with Iran, the support of which is plummeting with the American people, that they have taken to degrading the military service of the deal's chief critic, Senator Lindsey Graham.
"Their editorial today, which echoed a discredited report from The Washington Post, got basic facts incorrect and selectively ignored evidence contrary to their offensive point of view. The paper's political agenda has never been more clear.
"The New York Times and its selective research missed Senator Graham's glowing performance reviews and the direct statements of his commanders, including Generals David Petraeus and John Allen.
"Before being elected to public office, Senator Graham served six and half years on active duty, including two years at Shaw Air Force Base and four and half years in Europe during the Cold War as a military prosecutor. He also served in the South Carolina National Guard. During Desert Shield and Desert Storm, he served stateside helping prepare his unit for deployment and taking care of the legal needs of Guard families in South Carolina.
"Let's be clear, The Washington Post had an agenda when it wrote its biased article, one expertly exposed by investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson.The New York Times appears to be following the same playbook — degrading the honorable service of a 33 year Air Force career for the sake of its liberal, anti-military political agenda at home. What a shame that The New York Times has become the mouthpiece of liberal elites instead of living up to being the paper of record."
