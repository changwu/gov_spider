    In his first State of the Union, the President spoke directly to the American people about his vision to build a better America. He reminded the country that our best days lie ahead, and that his President is about giving everyone a fair shot -- because when given half a shot, ordinary people can do extraordinary things. The Biden-Harris Administration's domestic agenda represents an historic shift from the old, outdated trickle-down approach to one that puts workers, families, and small businesses first.
The President also announced his unity agenda, consisting of four areas where we have historically been able to come together and find agreement regardless of party. He has called on Congress to send bills to his desk to deliver progress for the American people: to beat the opioid crisis, address mental health, support our veterans, and end cancer as we know it.
Over the next year, the Biden-Harris Administration will continue working to make communities safer, combat COVID, and create good-paying jobs through revitalized domestic manufacturing.
State and elected officials as well as tribal and territory leaders championed the President's remarks.
Here's what they are saying:

Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont: "I commend President Biden for all that he and Vice President Harris have achieved, and I applaud the President's vision and goals that he outlined in his speech tonight.

In Connecticut, we're working to achieve the same goals. We're making historic investments in developing a modern workforce to fill Connecticut jobs, make Connecticut products, and reduce costs for Connecticut families. Likewise, just as President Biden proposed a plan to reduce the costs of everyday expenses, including energy and prescription drugs, in my Connecticut Difference budget we tackle these challenges head-on."

We stand with the Ukrainian people whose bravery is an inspiration to the world and encourage the ongoing military, economic and humanitarian support of Ukraine.

Black communities have been among the hardest hit by the pandemic, both in terms of health outcomes and finances.

As mayors of cities big and small, we are proximate to the challenges everyday Americans face and are encouraged by the president's bold vision for continued economic recovery that centers workers, families, and small businesses first. This includes producing more goods in America to help strengthen our supply chains, reducing the cost of everyday expenses, cutting childcare costs, and taking on climate change by building out critical investments and tax credits that strengthen the U.S. energy sector, create well-paying jobs, and cut energy costs for American families.

"Black mayors applaud the historic nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. Judge Jackson has deep experience across the justice system, which will make her a well-rounded Justice. She comes from a family of police officers, worked as a public defender, served on the bipartisan US Sentencing Commission, and served as a judge on the District Court and D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Jackson also has a proven track record of bipartisan support in the Senate and has been confirmed three times on a bipartisan vote.
"Black mayors across the country are excited to see that substantial investments in infrastructure will reach our most vulnerable communities. From upgrading our roads and bridges to expanding broadband access and affordable internet, and tackling lead pipe replacement and climate change - the infrastructure package has the promise to transform communities across the nation and right historic inequities. We applaud the Biden-Harris administration's historic commitments to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) with a $5.8 billion cumulative investment in HBCUs in the form of debt relief and capacity-building grants. We also commend the expanded power and support of the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) which includes the elevation of its agency head to Under Secretary and expanded funding pledges. My fellow mayors and I encourage the Biden-Harris administration and Congress to lean into Biden's Unity Agenda that calls on our country to take on seismic challenges. With support from Congress, we can change the trajectory of our nation including ending the opioid epidemic, building out a diverse mental health workforce with a focus on supporting children, supporting veterans, and ending cancer as we know it. The Biden-Harris cabinet has many former mayors who know how to tackle problems and get things done. Our mayors remain committed to working with our federal partners to better serve our constituents and ensure that no community gets left behind." [Press Release, 3/1/22]

Matt Chase, President, National Association of Counties: "Tonight's State of the Union address highlighted the need for a strong intergovernmental partnership. Counties will continue to work with the administration and bipartisan congressional partners to achieve our common goals. Only together can we recover from the pandemic, strengthen our economy, and improve the quality of life and the livelihoods of our residents. For the past two years, counties have served on the front lines of our nation's response to the pandemic. With resources from the American Rescue Plan, we are building healthier, safer counties where all our residents have opportunities to thrive. Investing in counties means investing in struggling small businesses, nonprofits, infrastructure, public health and safety, and human services, especially for those suffering from domestic violence, mental illnesses and substance use disorders. Additionally, with the resources in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, counties are building, maintaining and upgrading major infrastructure ? roads, bridges, airports, public transportation, water and sewage, and broadband. We will continue to work across the aisle to preserve local decision-making and streamline federal regulations. We urge our federal partners to embrace bipartisanship and focus on solutions that will enhance our resiliency for the future, solutions that will make a difference for Americans every day. We look forward to continuing to work with the administration and Congress as we build stronger counties that result in a stronger America." [Press Release, 3/1/22]

Thanks to federal investments through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), our communities are facing those challenges head on and paving the way for a more equitable future. In his State of the Union address, President Biden recognized the historic impact of these laws and laid the groundwork to continue to strengthen our economy. He highlighted how the American Rescue Plan act is helping local governments beat the COVID pandemic, support vulnerable communities, and increase public safety. He shared our enthusiasm to strengthen and rebuild the infrastructure that keeps Americans and our economy moving. We thank President Biden for his clear vision and we look forward to continuing to build on federal-local partnership for the benefit of all residents. This partnership extends to our commitment to democracy. As President Biden said, we stand with the Ukranian people. And we stand behind the President as he gathers our allies around the world against Russia's aggression and attacks on democracy." [Press Release, 3/1/22]

U.S. Conference of Mayors CEO Tom Cochran: "There is so much more that unites us than what divides us, and perhaps nothing is more sacred than our shared beliefs in democracy and freedom. Mayors appreciate President Biden's focus on protecting and promoting these core values here and around the world. America's mayors continue to unequivocally support the Ukrainian people and our fellow mayors in Ukraine who are fighting for the very survival of their communities. We also applaud the President's commitment to rebuilding our nation and addressing persistent obstacles to recovery. Mayors have been on the frontlines taking action to put this pandemic behind us and make cities the drivers of our economy. While great progress has been made, particularly through the American Rescue Plan and Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, more work must be done to strengthen our communities. We appreciate the President pledging to make the necessary and critical investments we need to tackle the challenges that remain, especially his commitment to doubling the budget of the Justice Department's COPS community policing grant program, which would make our cities safer and reduce gun-related crime. Mayors value the partnership we have with this administration and members of both parties in Congress. We look forward to working together to make a lasting difference in the lives of all Americans."
