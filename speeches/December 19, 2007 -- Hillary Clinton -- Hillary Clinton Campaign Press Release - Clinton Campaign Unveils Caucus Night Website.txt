    New Website www.caucusforhillary.com Offers Iowans Caucus Night Locations, Directions and Assistance
DES MOINES, IA â€” In a continuing effort to make the January 3rd caucuses easier for Iowans, the Clinton campaign unveiled a new caucus locator tool on its caucus night web site, www.caucusforhillary.com. The only campaign to offer such a tool, the site allows users to enter their addresses and receive a personalized local caucus location and a map.
"Iowans want a candidate who is an agent of change and that candidate is Hillary Clinton," Iowans for Hillary State Director Teresa Vilmain said. "Our new locator tool will help Iowans get out to caucus for Hillary so that she can enact the kind of change Iowans deserve on day one as President."
The new tool is the latest addition to a web site that is geared towards helping Iowans attend the caucuses. The web site, www.caucusforhillary.com , offers information on the Clinton campaign's "buddy" program, which aims to pair first time caucus goers with experienced caucus goers.
The user-friendly web site allows Iowans to sign up for caucus night assistance such as transportation to and from local caucus sites and babysitting. Users can also go to the web site for information on how to contact their local field organizer for further assistance. Additionally, the site has a variety of tools to help caucus goers, including a "Common Caucus Questions" section and information on how to volunteer for Iowans for Hillary.
