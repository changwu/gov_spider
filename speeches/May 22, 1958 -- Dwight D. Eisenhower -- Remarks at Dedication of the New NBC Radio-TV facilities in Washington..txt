    President Sarnoff , distinguished guests, fellow Americans:
I think all of us realize that in these fast-moving times it is highly important that our Nation's Capital should be attached to every single citizen in this country by the very fastest, best kind of communications. Decisions of a nation and of a government that at one time could tolerate three or four weeks of study now demand almost instantaneous reaction. So it is again apparent that unless our citizenry can be informed of the things that happen in the world and are reflected through the eyes of legislative and executive leaders in such a way that they may understand exactly what these things mean, then the United States cannot react as it should.
Now today, as I came through this building, which will itself make these communications better--more rapid, more comprehensive--I was completely overwhelmed by the technical complexities and problems that the broadcasting industry has been solving. I do not know whether the rest of you in this audience have been able to make that same tour, but it is like nothing else so much in my mind as the radar room in a big battleship or some other complex thing that really is entirely beyond my comprehension but is still capable of exciting my wonderment.
So I cannot fail to congratulate you, to felicitate the National Broadcasting Company for this particular step in developing the communications industry of our country. I felicitate the officials of the Company, and I must say I congratulate every citizen whose understanding of this nation, of the world, will be made better and fuller by this development. Thank you very much, sir. Thank you all.
