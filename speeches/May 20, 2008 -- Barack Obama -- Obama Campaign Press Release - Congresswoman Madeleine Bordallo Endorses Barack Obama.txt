    Chicago, IL — Guam Congresswoman Madeleine Bordallo endorsed Barack Obama today, saying she believes he is the right candidate to move our nation forward.
"Today I have pledged my support as a superdelegate to Senator Barack Obama. Senator Obama offers us the leadership needed to address the challenges Guam and our nation will face in the coming years.
Senator Obama is working very closely with Senator Patrick Leahy, Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, and other Senate leaders to secure more support for H.R. 1595, the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act. Senator Obama fully understands and supports the efforts to seek full recognition for the patriotism and suffering endured by the people of Guam during enemy occupation in World War II.
Senator Obama has also pledged to help improve Guam's economy, including through opportunities with the military build-up—an issue I have worked very hard on since taking office—and I believe he is the right candidate to help move Guam and our nation forward given the challenges we face in our world today."
Senator Obama said, "I thank Congresswoman Bordallo for her support. Senator Bordallo has been fighting to ensure that the people of Guam have a voice in Washington. I look forward to working with her to ensure that young people in Guam have the education and opportunities they need to meet the challenges of the 21st Century."
Bordallo is the 306.5th superdelegate to endorse Obama, who is 107 delegates away from securing the Democratic nomination.
