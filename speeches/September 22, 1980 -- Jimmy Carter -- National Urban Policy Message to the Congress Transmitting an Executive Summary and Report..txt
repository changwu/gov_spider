    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to issue the Executive Summary of the Second Biennial Report on National Urban Policy, as called for by Congress in the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970, as amended in 1977.
In 1978, I committed my Administration to implementing in cooperation with the Congress the nation's first comprehensive urban policy. Our efforts have yielded important benefits to cities, urban counties and their residents. It is my hope that this Executive Summary, and the full Biennial Report on which it is based, will help us define this nation's urban policy agenda for the 1980's.
