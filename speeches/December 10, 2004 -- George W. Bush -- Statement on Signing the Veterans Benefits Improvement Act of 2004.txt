    Today, I have signed into law S. 2486, the ''Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2004.'' The Act modifies and extends housing, education, and other benefits for the Nation's veterans.
Section 3677(d)(2)(B) of title 38, United States Code, as enacted by section 108 of the Act, purports to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to make a recommendation to the Congress on whether to continue a specified pilot project beyond its statutory expiration date, which would require enactment of legislation. Section 4332 of title 38, as amended by section 202 of the Act, purports to require officials in the executive branch to submit recommendations for legislative action in certain circumstances. The executive branch shall implement these provisions in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch and to recommend for the consideration of the Congress such measures as the President judges necessary and expedient.
GEORGE W. BUSH
The White House, December 10, 2004.
