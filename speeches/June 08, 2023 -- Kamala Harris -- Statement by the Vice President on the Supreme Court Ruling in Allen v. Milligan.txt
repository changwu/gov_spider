    The most fundamental right of American citizenship is the right to vote. Today, the Supreme Court rejected Alabama's attempt to dilute the voting power of Black Americans and to further weaken the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This decision upheld the law, but our fight to protect, strengthen, and expand the freedom to vote continues. Voting is the right that unlocks all other rights, and fair maps are essential for representation. Important freedoms we enjoy and continue to fight for today come from our equal access to the ballot box. That is why the President and I continue to call on Congress to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.
