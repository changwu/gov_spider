    Governor Jeb Bush released the following statement in response to President Obama's decision to re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba.
"As Americans prepare to celebrate the anniversary of our freedom from tyranny and commit anew to the democratic principles on which our nation was founded, it is no small irony that President Obama prepares to open an Embassy in Havana, further legitimizing the brutal Castro regime.
"I oppose the decision to further embrace the Castro regime by opening an embassy in Havana. The real test of the Obama Administration's rapprochement with the Castro regime in Cuba is not whether President Obama's legacy is burnished with dubious diplomatic achievements and photo-ops, but whether improved relations between Havana and Washington advance the cause of human rights and freedom for the Cuban people. The ongoing detention of dissidents and continued human rights abuses suggest the Administration's policy is failing this test.
"I hope the U.S. Congress will scrutinize the concessions made to Havana prior to considering any ambassador."
