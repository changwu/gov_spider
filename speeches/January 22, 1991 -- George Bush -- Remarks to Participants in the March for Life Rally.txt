    Once again, it is my distinct honor to address Nellie Gray and those courageous and determined Americans gathered on The Mall for the Rally for Life. January has become -- in large part due to the dedication and hard work of the March for Life -- a time of reflection, a time of rejuvenation for pro-life forces. And so, I'm pleased that my voice is part of the growing chorus that simply says, "Choose Life."
As I look back at past years' Rally for Life, I am encouraged by the progress which has taken place. Attempts by Congress to expand funding -- Federal funding -- for abortions have been defeated, and the Supreme Court has taken welcome steps toward reversing its Roe versus Wade decision.
Despite these successes, much remains to be done. Abortion on demand continues unabated in this country. And as I have said in the past, this prevalence calls into question our respect for the fundamental right to life. Government and private sector must be more involved in encouraging alternatives such as adoption.
And you, the thousands of tireless volunteers who have gathered here from across the United States, must make it your goal to keep this issue alive and predominant in the Halls of Congress, the courts, and in the minds of the American people.
Thank you for your commitment, and God bless you.
