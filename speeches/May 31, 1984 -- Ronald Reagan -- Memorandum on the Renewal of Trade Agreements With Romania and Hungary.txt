    Presidential Determination No. 84-10
Memorandum for the Honorable William Emerson Brock III, United States Trade Representative
Subject: Renewal of Trade Agreements with Romania and Hungary
Pursuant to my authority under subsection 405(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2435(b)(1)), I find that a satisfactory balance of concessions in trade and services has been maintained during the lives of the Agreements on Trade Relations between the United States and the Socialist Republic of Romania and the Hungarian People's Republic. I further determine that actual or foreseeable reductions in United States tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers are satisfactorily reciprocated by the Socialist Republic of Romania and by the Hungarian People's Republic.
This memorandum and the attached justification shall be published in the Federal Register.
RONALD REAGAN
