Dr. Barbara Stock Nielsen, the former State Superintendent of Education, explained why she's backing Marco:
Marco understands what it's like to have a massive student debt and to live paycheck to paycheck. He is the only candidate with a reasonable and detailed plan to reform college and technical education to make it more affordable and accessible. I am excited to join this historic campaign for such an exceptional candidate who can unite the country.

Terri Gowdy, a teacher from Spartanburg, explained why Marco is so appealing to voters across South Carolina:
He has lived the American Dream and knows firsthand the struggles facing so many Americans today. I am proud to support Marco Rubio because the stakes of this election are sky high and we need a candidate who understands the unique challenges facing America in the 21st century. Marco has the vision, experience, and character to lead our nation into the future.

Karen Iacovelli, SC Republican National Committee Finance Chairman, spoke about the level of enthusiasm building for Marco:
It has been many years since the Republican Party has seen a candidate as exciting as Marco Rubio.He is bright, inspiring, optimistic, and extraordinarily talented at communicating the conservative principles that make America great. Marco Rubio has the potential to bring America back from the disastrous Obama presidency to be stronger and more prosperous than ever. That's why I am joining his campaign for a New American Century.

Marco is gaining support from conservative women across South Carolina and across the country.
