    Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense
Subject: Ending Discrimination on the Basis of Sexual Orientation in the Armed Forces
I hereby direct you to submit to me prior to July 15, 1993, a draft of an Executive order ending discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in determining who may serve in the Armed Forces of the United States. The draft of the Executive order should be accompanied by the results of a study to be conducted over the next six months on how this revision in policy would be carried out in a manner that is practical, realistic, and consistent with the high standards of combat effectiveness and unit cohesion our Armed Forces must maintain.
In preparing the draft, I direct you to consult fully with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the military services, with other Departments affected by the order, with the Congress, and with concerned individuals and organizations outside the executive branch.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
