  A Proclamation

Whereas, it is provided by section twenty-four of the Act of Congress, approved March third, eighteen hundred and ninety-one, entitled, "An act to repeal timber-culture laws, and for other purposes", "That the President of the United States may, from time to time, set apart and reserve, in any State or Territory having public land bearing forests, in any part of the public lands wholly or in part covered with timber or undergrowth, whether of commercial value or not, as public reservations, and the President shall, by public proclamation, declare the establishment of such reservations and the limits thereof";
And Whereas, the public lands in the State of Montana, within the limits hereinafter described, are in part covered with timber, and it appears that the public good would be promoted by setting apart and reserving said lands as a public reservation;
Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States, by virtue of the power in me vested by section twenty-four of the aforesaid Act of Congress, do hereby make known and proclaim that there are hereby reserved from entry or settlement and set apart as a Public Reservation all those certain tracts, pieces or parcels of land lying and being situate in the State of Montana, and within the boundaries particularly described as follows:
Beginning at the south-west corner of Township six (6) North, Range three (3) West, Principal Meridian, Montana; thence northerly to the north-west corner of said township; thence easterly to the south-east corner of Section thirty-three (33), Township seven (7) North, Range three (3) West; thence northerly to the north-west corner of Section three (3), said township; thence easterly to the south-east corner of Section thirty-four (34), Township eight (8) North, Range three (3) West; thence northerly to the north-west corner of Section two (2), said township; thence easterly along the Second (2nd) Standard Parallel North to the south-east corner of Township nine (9) North, Range three (3) West; thence northerly to the north-west corner of Section nineteen (19), Township nine (9) North, Range two (2) West; thence easterly to the north-east corner of Section twenty-four (24), said township; thence southerly to the south-west corner of Township nine (9) North, Range one (I) West; thence easterly along the Second (2nd) Standard Parallel North to the north-east corner of Section four (4), Township eight (8) North, Range one (1) West; thence southerly to the south-west corner of Section fifteen (15), said township; thence easterly to the north-east corner of Section twenty-four (24), said township; thence southerly to the south-east corner of Township six (6) North, Range one (1) West; thence westerly to the south-west corner of Township six (6) North, Range three (3) West, the place of beginning; such of the above named corners as have not been established by the official surveys being intended to be located at the points where such irregularities which may occur in corners would fall in projecting the surveys in the directions indicated without allowing for any actually extending the surveys;
Excepting from the force and effect of this proclamation all lands which may have been, prior to the date hereof, embraced in any legal entry or covered by any lawful filing duly of record in the proper United States Land Office, or upon which any valid settlement has been made pursuant to law, and the statutory period within which to make entry or filing of record has not expired: Provided, that this exception shall not continue to apply to any particular tract of land unless the entryman, settler or claimant continues to comply with the law under which the entry, filing or settlement was made.
Warning is hereby expressly given to all persons not to make settlement upon the lands reserved by this proclamation.
The reservation hereby established shall be known as The Elkhorn Forest Reserve.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done at the city of Washington this 12th day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and five, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and twenty-ninth.

THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
