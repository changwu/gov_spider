    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICYThis Statement Has Been Coordinated by OMB with the Appropriate Agencies
(Senate)(Fawell (R) IL and 45 cosponsors)
The Administration does not object to the provision of H.R. 849 that would permanently exempt State and local firefighters and law enforcement officers from the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. However, the Administration views as unnecessary and duplicative the provision in this bill requiring the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to conduct a study of this issue, in light of the proposed permanent exemption, as well as a similar study published in 1992.
