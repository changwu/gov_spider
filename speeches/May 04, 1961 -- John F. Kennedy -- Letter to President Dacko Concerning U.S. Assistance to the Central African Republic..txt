Dear Mr. President:
I appreciated your letter on your desire to make plans for the economic and social development of your country. The United States, as you know, has always made clear its wish to assist the newly independent African countries to establish strong and stable economies, to the extent that our heavy commitments permit us to contribute to this goal. I can, therefore, assure you of my country's desire to be of assistance.
In the immediate future, if you wish, I am prepared to send to your country representatives from the United States International Cooperation Administration to discuss with you and your government ways in which the United States can best respond to your request.
In the meantime, may I suggest you and other appropriate officials of your government make available to our Charge d'Affaires, Mr. Lukens, more details of your thinking on an economic program for the Central African Republic. I shall read his reports and recommendations with great interest.
Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[His Excellency David Dacko, President, Central African Republic, Bangui, Central African Republic]
