    ON THE OCCASION of the Jewish New Year, my warm greetings go to all Americans of Jewish faith.
For the tens of centuries spanned by the history of the Jewish people, members of your race have given to mankind almost unbelievable examples of courageous devotion to noble principles--to justice, to liberty, to the right of men to worship according to the inner voice of conscience. Such are the principles which can now give the only sure guide to all men as they seek to establish true peace in the world, the peace which common people everywhere long for in their hearts. From this New Year's Day forward, may the inspiration of your devotion to these ideals give an ever more brilliant light to the path which leads to a real harmony and concord among nations.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
