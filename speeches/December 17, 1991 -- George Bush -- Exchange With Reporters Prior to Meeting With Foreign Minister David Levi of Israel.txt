    Repeal of U.N. Resolution 3379
The President. It was very significant. It was an action that I think will make the United Nations much more effective. And it is long overdue. And that resolution shouldn't have been passed in the first place, but I think we all heralded the repeal of it, and I know it was a great day for Israel as well as for the United States and many, many other countries. So, we're very pleased.
And I had a lovely call from Prime Minister Shamir about it yesterday afternoon.
Middle East Peace Talks

Q. What about the fact that -- --
The President. No, you didn't hear what I told Rita. [Laughter]
Thank you very much, though. Welcome, everybody. It's a great day, and we're very pleased to see you.
Q. It sounds like you're giving the polls a new -- you've taken a new look.
Q. None of the Arab countries in the peace process, however, joined with the United States in fighting the resolution. Do you have a reaction to that?
The President. Some have a little difficulty hearing.
