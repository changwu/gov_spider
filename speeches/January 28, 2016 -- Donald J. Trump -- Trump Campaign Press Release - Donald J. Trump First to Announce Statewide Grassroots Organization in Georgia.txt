(New York, NY) January 28th, 2016 - Today, Donald Trump for President Inc. announced that it is the first 2016 Presidential campaign to organize County Managers in all 159 of Georgia's counties. These committed volunteers consist of veterans of the Tea Party movement, GOP activists, local elected officials and political newcomers energized and inspired by Mr. Trump's candidacy to get involved in the political process for the first time in decades.
Mr. Trump said, "We have such tremendous support all over the country, the people of Georgia have been amazing. We are leading in all the polls, with 33% in the most recent Georgia survey. The support from this state is so important to me --- with their help we will Make America Great Again!"
These county-level leaders will form the backbone of the campaign's grassroots operations in Georgia. They will work with the district and statewide leadership team in turning out Trump supporters for the March 1st primary.
The County Managers and Statewide Leadership Team join the five staffers already on the ground building out a grassroots operation. The Georgia team is led by State Director Brandon Phillips and its headquarters is located at 1000 Circle 75 Parkway, Suite 700, Atlanta, GA 30339.
