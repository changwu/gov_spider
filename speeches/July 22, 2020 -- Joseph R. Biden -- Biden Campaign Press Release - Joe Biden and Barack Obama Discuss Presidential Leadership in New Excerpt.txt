    In a new preview clip of Vice President Joe Biden and President Barack Obama's conversation discussing our nation's future, Vice President Biden critiques President's Donald Trump's lack of leadership and President Obama commends Vice President Biden for having the experience, heart, and character to bring the country together.
 Watch a new preview video of the conversation HERE.
 Vice President Biden: "There's two ways in which presidents motivate people: by doing something really ennobling, important, and people go, 'Oh,' or to do something really bad. This guy has generated a sense out there that people are waking up to that he ran by deliberately dividing people from the moment he came down that escalator, and I think people are now going, 'I don't want my kid growing up that way.'"
President Obama: "You know what it's like as much as anybody to be in the White House during a crisis. You know what it's like to have to get laws passed through Congress. You know what it's like to deal with foreign leaders. You know what it's like, and how lonely it can be, to make tough decisions -- where not every decision is going to be perfect, but you gotta make them and take responsibility for it. I've seen you with families that have gone through tragedies and, and the thing I've got confidence in Joe is, is your heart and your character, and the fact that you are going to be able to reassemble the kind of government that cares about people and brings people together."
