Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following statement in response to U.S. District Court Judge Christopher Connor ruling that ObamaCare's requirement for individuals to purchase health insurance is unconstitutional.
Senator Santorum said, "I am so proud that Pennsylvania Judge Chris Conner stood up for the constitution. Now the nation sees what I saw in Chris when I recommended him for the bench under President Bush in 2002. Judge Conner has done a constitutional service for the state of Pennsylvania and the nation by striking another legal blow against Obamacare.
I've never waivered on this issue and I have consistently fought against universal healthcare - including leading the charge and defeat of HillaryCare, while Gov. Perry was busy pushing for its expansion. I'm not a recent convert to the fact that universal healthcare is wrong - whether at the state or federal level. And I pledge to repeal ObamaCare on day one as president. ObamaCare has crippled this country and crushed any potential to create jobs. Judge Conner's ruling is a victory for freedom, for American jobs and for the constitution."
