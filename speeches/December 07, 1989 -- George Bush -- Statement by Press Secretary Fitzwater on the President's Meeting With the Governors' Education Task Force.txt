    The President met this morning with Governors Ashcroft, Campbell, Clinton, Carruthers, Hunt, and Gardner to hear their thoughts on the development of national education goals before their Education Task Force meeting today with Cabinet members, where they will discuss the development of such goals.
The President is committed to working with the Governors to move the Nation forward in education reform. Since the education summit in Charlottesville, administration officials have met with Governors numerous times to move the process of developing national goals forward. In late November, the President met with his Education Policy Advisory Committee to hear their views with respect to national education goals. Our primary objective in the development of national education goals is to produce goals that are specific, measurable, and results-oriented.
