(Senate)
(Sen. Durbin, D-Illinois, and 20 cosponsors)
The Administration supports Senate passage of the Manager's Amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 510, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act. This bipartisan bill addresses longstanding challenges in the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) food safety and defense system by promoting a prevention-oriented approach and providing the Federal Government with many important tools to accomplish its core food safety and food defense goals, including authority to ensure that food producers implement appropriate preventive controls. The bill would complement efforts that the Administration has already undertaken administratively to improve food safety and address many of the key recommendations of the President's Food Safety Working Group, including support for an approach to food safety that leverages the work of Federal, State, and local regulatory and public health agencies. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to continue to make improvements in our food safety system and to ensure that FDA has sufficient fee resources to achieve our shared food safety and food defense goals.
