    I am gratified tonight that we could reach a bipartisan agreement on an omnibus parks bill that protects some of this Nation's most precious treasures. This legislation will improve the management of our Nation's parks and public lands, and protect some of our most valued resources.
This bill encompasses my top priorities for parks legislation, including measures to improve management of the Presidio, acquire the Sterling Forest, and establish the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve. It also deletes almost all of the provisions that I had found objectionable, including those that would have adversely affected the Shenandoah National Park and Richmond Battlefield National Park in Virginia, the Sequoia National Park in California, the Tongass National Forest, and other national parks and Federal lands.
Though not perfect, this bill represents a great victory for the American people and proves what we can accomplish if we work together.
