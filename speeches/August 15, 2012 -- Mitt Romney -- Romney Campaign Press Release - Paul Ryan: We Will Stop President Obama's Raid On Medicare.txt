PAUL RYAN: "We're eager to have this debate. We're going to have this debate and we're going to win this debate. And the reason you're hearing these kinds of things is because the President knows he is so vulnerable on this issue. It's the President who took $716 billion out from the Medicare program to spend on Obamacare. That's cuts to current seniors that will lead to less services for current seniors. We don't do that. We actually say end the raid and restore that, so those seniors today get the benefits that they organized their lives around."
