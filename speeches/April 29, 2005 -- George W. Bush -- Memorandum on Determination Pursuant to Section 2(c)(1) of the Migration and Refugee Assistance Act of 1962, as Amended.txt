Pursuant to section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(c)(1), I hereby determine that it is important to the national interest that up to $34.7 million be made available from the U.S. Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund to support unexpected urgent humanitarian needs in the West Bank and Gaza, and refugee repatriation to Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. These funds may be used, as appropriate, to provide contributions to international, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations, and, as necessary, for administrative expenses of the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.
