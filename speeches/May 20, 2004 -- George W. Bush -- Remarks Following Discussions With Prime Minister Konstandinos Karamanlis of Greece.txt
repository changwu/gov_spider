    President Bush. Thank you for coming. I've really been looking forward to this discussion with our friend. Welcome. It's the first chance I have to wish you a happy Name Day—tomorrow, isn't it?
Prime Minister Karamanlis. Tomorrow, you know about that?
President Bush. I know about that, and I'm glad to do so.
We will talk about a lot of subjects— we've already covered quite a few—and then I'm going to host a lunch with the Prime Minister here shortly.
One of the topics I do want to discuss is the Olympic games, how excited I am for your country to host the Olympic games. I wish I could attend, but this is a political season. So instead, I'm sending my father to lead our delegation.
I want to thank you for your very close cooperation, working together to make sure the games are successful, that people are able to travel to your beautiful country in as secure an environment as possible. You're making very good progress, Mr. Prime Minister, and I appreciate your hard work. I know your intentions are to have this the best possible games, and for that, I'm grateful.
I look forward to continuing our discussion over lunch, and of course, I want to congratulate you for your—for the victories you achieved and look forward to working with you. Welcome.
Prime Minister Karamanlis. Thank you very much, Mr. President, and I would like to thank you for your warm hospitality. And since you raised the question of the Olympic games, I would like to take the opportunity to say that we are doing everything humanly possible, in terms of energy, resources, professionals, to secure really successful games, and I'm confident that we'll succeed.
President Bush. Welcome.
