Script For "Love" (TV 1:00)
ANNCR: It was a time of uncertainty, hope and change. The "Summer Of Love."
Half a world away, another kind of love -- of country.
John McCain: Shot down. Bayoneted. Tortured.
Offered early release, he said, "No." He'd sworn an oath.
Home, he turned to public service.
His philosophy: before party, polls and self ... America.
A maverick, John McCain tackled campaign reform, military reform, spending reform.
He took on presidents, partisans and popular opinion.
He believes our world is dangerous, our economy in shambles.
John McCain doesn't always tell us what we "hope" to hear.
Beautiful words cannot make our lives better.
But a man who has always put his country and her people before self, before politics can.
Don't "hope" for a better life. Vote for one.
McCain.
JOHN MCCAIN: I'm John McCain and I approved this message.
