    I HAVE carefully considered the report of the Board of Inquiry on the labor dispute in the meatpacking industry. The report, of course, does not contain recommendations. It is, however, a thorough, careful, and objective analysis of the dispute. I am convinced that if it is read and studied by the parties with an open mind, it can provide a basis for renewed negotiations looking toward a prompt settlement of the dispute.
I have, therefore, requested the Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to arrange further conferences between his representatives and the parties in the light of the information contained in the report.
I am also requesting the Board of Inquiry to reconvene and to be available for assistance to the parties and to the Service in any manner which I may hereafter find essential.
