(Revision)
(House)
(Rep. Foley (D) Washington and 13 others)
The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4105, because it would reverse one of the cost saving provisions agreed to by the Food Security Act conferees in order to make that bill acceptable to the Administration. Changing the commodity provisions of the two-month-old 1985 Food Security Act, particularly in a fashion that would increase Federal outlays over fiscal years 1986-88 by approximately $850 million, is unwise and unacceptable.
The President's Senior Advisors would recommend disapproval of this bill in its present form.
