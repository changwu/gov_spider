    LAS VEGAS - Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee delivered a winning performance at tonight's GOP presidential debate. The following are some excerpts from the evening.
"I want my grandkids to grow up not in fear, but in faith and freedom."
"Our job is not to protect the reputation of Islam. It is to protect Americans first and foremost."
"Our system is not a system of tyranny. We don't elect kings, we elect servants."
(To terrorists who take action against us, or threaten to) "We're coming to get you. Won't be coming to our shore...you'll be going to your funeral."
"If we try to win this war on the cheap... we're making a huge mistake."
"We have an enemy this Administration refuses to acknowledge and refuses to go fight. "
"Every college kid who goes to a frat party, gets drunk and puts his picture on Facebook is going to have a potential employer look at that photo before he gets hired. Why should we have more attention for some college kid applying for a job than we have for someone who wants to come in with a semi-automatic and a pipe bomb to blow up Americans?"
"If it's such a good idea to bring in refugees and Obama thinks we're being un-Christian, let's send the first wave of them to Chappaqua, Martha's Vineyard, the upper East Side of Manhattan and to the South Lawn of the White House where we'll set up a camp. Let's see how that works out."
"If Islam is as wonderful and peaceful as its adherents say, shouldn't they be begging us to come in and hear these peaceful sermons? Shouldn't they be begging the FBI to come in?"
