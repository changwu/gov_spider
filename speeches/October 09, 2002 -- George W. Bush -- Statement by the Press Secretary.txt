    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Alabama and ordered Federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the area struck by Tropical Storm Isidore beginning on September 23, 2002, and continuing through October 1, 2002.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to local governments on a cost-shared basis for the repair or replacement of damaged public property in the counties of Baldwin and Mobile.
Federal funding is also available to the State on a cost-shared basis for hazard mitigation measures.
Joe M. Allbaugh, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), named Charles M. Butler as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The Agency said that damage surveys are continuing in other areas, and additional counties may be added after the assessments are completed.
