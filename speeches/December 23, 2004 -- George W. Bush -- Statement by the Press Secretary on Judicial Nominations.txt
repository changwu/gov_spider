    An effective and efficient judicial system is vital to ensuring justice for all Americans. The President nominated highly qualified individuals to the Federal courts during his first term, but the Senate failed to vote on many nominations. Unfortunately, this only exacerbates the issue of judicial vacancies, compounds the backlog of cases, and delays timely justice for the American people. The Senate has a Constitutional obligation to vote up or down on a President's judicial nominees and the President looks forward to working with the new Senate to ensure a well-functioning and independent judiciary. When the Senate reconvenes, the President intends to nominate again the following 20 individuals who did not receive up or down votes in the President's first term, 16 of whom were nominated more than a year ago:
