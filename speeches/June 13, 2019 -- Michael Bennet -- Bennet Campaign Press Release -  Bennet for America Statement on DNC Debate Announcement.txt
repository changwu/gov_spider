    DENVER â€” Bennet for America released the following statement today from spokesperson Shannon Beckham regarding Michael Bennet's qualification for the first DNC debates:
"In just six weeks, our campaign has gained remarkable ground and momentum. Just as he's done to win two tough races in a swing state, Michael is going to level with the American people from the debate stage. This is an opportunity for Michael to show voters how his ideas about economic inequality, health care, and fixing a broken Washington set him apart from the rest of the field."
