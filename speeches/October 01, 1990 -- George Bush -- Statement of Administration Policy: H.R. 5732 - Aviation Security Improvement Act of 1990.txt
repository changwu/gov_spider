    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Oberstar (D) Minnesota and 46 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5732 in its current form.
The Administration supports the report of the President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism and is already acting to implement most of its recommendations; In addition, the Administration urges prompt Senate ratification of Montreal Protocol 3 to assure prompt and fair compensation for victims of terrorism in the air.
The Administration particularly objects to provisions of H.R. 5732 which conflict with Presidential prerogatives and micromanage Federal progams. The most seriously troublesome provisions would:

—  impose counterproductive organizational requirements (section 101);
—  interfere with the prompt deployment of explosives detection systems (section 108);
—  impose threat evaluation and notification requirements which would not only be imprudently rigid, but improperly expose the Federal Government to financial liability (section 109);
—  infringe on the President's authority under the Constitution to conduct foreign relations (sections 201 and 216); and
—  lay the groundwork for exposing the Federal Government to unknown financial liability, create a narrow tax exemption, and infringe on the President's constitutional authority to recommend legislation (section 212).
