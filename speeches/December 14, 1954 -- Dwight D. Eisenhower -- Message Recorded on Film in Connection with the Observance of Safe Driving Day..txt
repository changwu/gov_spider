    AT THE REQUEST of the Governors and other officials, I have designated tomorrow, December 15, as Safe Driving Day.
I have a deep conviction that the United States can do anything to which 160 million citizens set their hearts and minds. If we are determined to have a day without a traffic accident in all of America, we can have it.
So let us see how many highway deaths and injuries we can prevent by obeying traffic regulations, following simple rules of good sportsmanship and courtesy, and staying alert and careful--whether we are driving or walking.
Let us establish an unblemished record of safety on Safe Driving Day, and then make that record our standard for the future.
