    President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and President Jair Messias Bolsonaro met today to reaffirm the strategic importance of the relationship between the United States and Brazilâ€”two of the world's largest democracies. At a moment when the globe is facing a cascade of crises, from Russia's war in Ukraine to global warming and pandemic recovery, the partnership between the United States and Brazil is vital to international efforts to address the climate crisis, and ensure peace. The Leaders pledged to continue their ongoing collaboration on trade and commercial matters, including through U.S. support for Brazil's OECD candidacy. President Biden and President Bolsonaro also discussed how our countries must work together to facilitate sustainable development in the larger Amazon Basin to dramatically reduce deforestation, coordinate closely at the UN Security Council over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and support democratic renewal.
