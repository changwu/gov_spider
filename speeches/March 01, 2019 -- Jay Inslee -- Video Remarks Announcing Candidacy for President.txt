    Voice: Hi governor, what do you have to say about climate change?
Gov. Inslee: A lot.
"We got to stop global warming. Everyone in this country know climate is changing. Reduce carbon pollution. New energy future. Climate change. Climate change. We should be dealing with climate change. Climate change. Climate change. We need to defeat climate change. That's what I believe."
We're the first generation to feel the sting of climate change.
And we're the last that can do something about it.
We went to the moon and created technologies that have changed the world.
Our country's next mission must be to rise up to the most urgent challenge of our time: defeating climate change.
This crisis isn't just a chart or graph anymore. The impacts are being felt everywhere.
We have an opportunity to transform our economy, run on 100% clean energy. That will bring millions of good paying jobs to every community across America, and create a more just future for everyone.
I'm Jay Inslee, and I'm running for president because I'm the only candidate who will make defeating climate change our nation's number one priority.
We can do this! Join our movement! This is our moment.
