    On behalf of the American people, Melania and I send our warm greetings to Muslims as they celebrate Eid al-Fitr. Muslims in the United States joined those around the world during the holy month of Ramadan to focus on acts of faith and charity. Now, as they commemorate Eid with family and friends, they carry on the tradition of helping neighbors and breaking bread with people from all walks of life.
During this holiday, we are reminded of the importance of mercy, compassion, and good will. With Muslims around the world, the United States renews our commitment to honor these values. Eid Mubarak.
