    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Thornberry (R) TX and 2 others)
The Administration, while supporting the underlying purpose of H.R. 2007, believes the bill is unnecessary and strongly opposes it in its current form. The bill's purpose is to enable a local water district in Texas to use Federal project facilities to convey additional waters to the community that it serves. As reported by the Resources Committee, however, H.R. 2007 could unfairly transfer certain costs to U.S. taxpayers and could also be construed as waiving important provisions of environmental law.
