    President Bush this morning underwent a colorectal screening procedure at Camp David in which no polyps were found and no evidence of any abnormalities was discovered.
At 7:09am (EDT), Article XXV of the Constitution was invoked, temporarily transferring the power of the Presidency to Vice-President Dick Cheney. At that time, anesthesia was administered to the President. The procedure was concluded at 7:29am and the President awoke at 7:31am. The power of the Presidency was returned to President Bush at 9:24am.
The President says he feels "great" and will resume his normal routine at Camp David.
