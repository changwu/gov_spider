    Our incremental costs for Operation Desert Shield expenses were roughly $10 billion in calendar year 1990. We have already received $6 billion in cash and in-kind support from our allies to defray these costs. We expect to soon receive an additional $2 billion more that has already been pledged to meet these 1990 costs. With these sums, and assuming Congress enacts the necessary appropriation, our coalition partners will have covered some 80 percent of our incremental expenses through December 31, 1990.
