    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(REVISED)(House)(Synar (D) Oklahoma)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3307, which would postpone the effective date for the United States Sentencing Commission's sentencing guidelines until August 1, 1988; and the President's senior advisors will recommend that he veto the bill.
The original effective date for these guidelines, November 1, 1986, has already been extended once, through November 1, 1987, by Public Law 99-217. Sentencing guidelines were a key and essential part of the important sentencing reforms enacted as part of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. In order to carry out the intent of the 1984 Act, the Commission's guidelines should not be delayed further and should be permitted to go into effect as currently scheduled.
