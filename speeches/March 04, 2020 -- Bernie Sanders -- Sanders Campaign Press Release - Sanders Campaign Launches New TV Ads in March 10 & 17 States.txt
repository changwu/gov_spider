"Protect Social Security"
Transcript:
Joe Biden: When I argued if we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans' benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government. And I not only tried it once. I tried it twice. I tried it a third time. And I tried it a fourth time.
Bernie Sanders: Well, we've got some bad news for them. We are not gonna cut Social Security. We are gonna expand benefits.
I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message.
"Feel the Bern"

President Barack Obama: Bernie is somebody who has the virtue of saying exactly what he believes. Great authenticity, great passion, and is fearless.

"Decimated"
Transcript
I've been a union autoworker since 2008.
The community has been decimated by trade deals.
Only one candidate for president has consistently opposed every disastrous trade deal. And that candidate is Bernie Sanders.
The banksters that have been robbing us blind and stealing our pensions and destroying our communities, they have something to worry about.
This is a man of conviction, a man of integrity, and that is going to stand up for you no matter what.
That's why I personally support Bernie Sanders.
