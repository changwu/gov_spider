With members from around the state, the group's membership spans generations, including veterans from World War II to the combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
One of the statewide Co-Chairmen on hand was fellow POW and US Navy Captain Mike McGrath. Capt. McGrath said, "I know firsthand the type of man John McCain is - either in the horror of a North Vietnamese prison camp or the arena ofAmerican politics. He has always put country first. He has lived his life to serve a cause greater than himself. His relentless self-sacrifice and courage, both moral and physical, are the backbone of why so many veterans and their families are supporting John in his campaign for president. I was honored to call him brother in Vietnam and the nation and I will be honored to call him Mr. President. "

Also on hand to offer their support for Sen. McCain were: Colorado Springs Mayor, Army Capt. Lionel Rivera, Air Force LT. Col. Don Smith, Colorado 14th District Representative, Air Force Col.
