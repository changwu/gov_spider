    Dear Mr. Speaker:
In accordance with provisions of Public Law 107-38, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States, FY 2001, today I have authorized transfers from the Emergency Response Fund totaling $902 million for emergency recovery and response and national security activities listed in the enclosed letter from the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget. As provided in Public Law 107-38, $900 million of these funds will be made available to agencies 15 days from the date of this transmittal and $2.3 million will be made available to the Department of the Treasury immediately.
These funds are in addition to the $8.8 billion that I previously authorized for transfer and will allow our Government to continue to address the consequences arising from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
I urge the Congress to enact without delay the $20 billion in critical defense and domestic needs that I requested on October 17th. My Administration does not intend to seek additional supplemental funding for either domestic or defense needs for the remainder of this session of Congress.
The details of these actions are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and observations.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
