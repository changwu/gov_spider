    Las Vegas, NV â€” The Yang Campaign is increasing its footprint in Nevada to be a serious contender on February 22, with new offices and staff on the ground in the important early state. This comes at a time when other campaigns are scaling back resources and cutting staff to stay in the race.
Andrew Yang has opened two more offices in the state to match the rapidly expanding grassroots volunteer base of the campaign. The campaign is also adding a wealth of experience with recent hires in Nevada. Jenny Lehner has joined the campaign as Nevada Political Director with a strong base of Nevada experience, including prior roles with Assemblywoman Rochelle Nguyen and Chris Giunchigliani's gubernatorial campaign. The campaign has also added Zachary Amos as Nevada Field Director, who was the Regional Organizing Director with Beto for America.
This commitment from the Yang Campaign in Nevada represents its growing momentum in the state. The campaign team continues to engage as many Nevadans as possible to let them know about Andrew Yang's vision for a New Way Forward that will put Humanity First.
