    LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul released a statement today saying that he was pleased with the National Labor Relations Board's decision to drop its lawsuit against Boeing for deciding to build a new plant in South Carolina.
Statement from Congressman Ron Paul:
"Hearing that the NLRB decided to stop pursuing its ongoing harassment of Boeing was welcomed news. I would like to think this is more than just a political move by the Obama administration with an election year looming, but experience tells me otherwise.
"I have long been an advocate for the rights of workers to work without interference by big government, often acting as facilitator for big labor. My unblemished voting record on the issue of right to work, according to the National Right To Work Committee, is a testament to that fact.
"The idea that government bureaucrats, acting to empower union officials, would try to stop a private company from building a new plant is an affront to the very principles of economic liberty this country was founded upon. These are principles I have pledged to uphold my entire career.
"As President I will work to repeal all federal laws that force workers and employers to submit to union officials and their enforcers in the federal bureaucracy."
