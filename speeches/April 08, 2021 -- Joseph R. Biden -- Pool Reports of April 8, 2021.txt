Pool Report #1 - Checking in, Rose Garden event attendees
Good morning from the White House!
It's another beautiful spring day in D.C. Your pooler imagines the cherry blossoms around the Tidal Basin must be popping and advises everyone to make their pilgrimage before it's too late.
The main event on the public schedule is the POTUS event in the Rose Garden. The event will be livestreamed. Your pooler won't provide any quotes, but color not able to be seen on camera. As always, your pooler will advise you of any updates to the schedule.
