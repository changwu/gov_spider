    Today the world is sending you its congratulations. In honoring you with its Peace Prize, the Nobel Committee has ratified a decision already made by millions around the world.
I add my own congratulations, for this honor you so fully deserve.
Through all the generations of leaders in your region of the world, none have wanted peace more than the two of you-and none have taken the risks, or displayed the courage, that you have in this quest. I know that the Middle East would not be so near to peace today were it not for your determined efforts, and I know that the same qualities that have earned you this award will guide your nations toward the lasting peace that all peoples of your region desire.
Time and again in the last year, you have overcome the obstacles that stood in your way, for you understood the importance of your goal. I know that this award will be an occasion for you and for all of us to rededicate our efforts, for it makes clear how much the people of the world value your search.
The work you have done so far must not be left uncompleted. Everything I have learned about your character, your commitments, and your courage gives me confidence that the promise of this moment will be fulfilled.
JIMMY CARTER
