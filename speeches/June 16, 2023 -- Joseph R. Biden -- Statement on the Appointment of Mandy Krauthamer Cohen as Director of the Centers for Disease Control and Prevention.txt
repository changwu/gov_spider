    Dr. Cohen is one of the Nation's top physicians and health leaders, with experience leading large and complex organizations and a proven track record protecting Americans' health and safety.
As Secretary of North Carolina's Department of Health and Human Services, Dr. Cohen developed innovative and nationally recognized programs that improved the health and lives of families across the State. Her leadership through the COVID-19 crisis drew bipartisan praise, as did her successful transformation of North Carolina's Medicaid program and pivotal role in the bipartisan passage of Medicaid expansion. Before serving in North Carolina, Dr. Cohen held senior roles at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, where she helped implement Affordable Care Act programs, including expanding insurance coverage and protections.
Dr. Cohen has been recognized by leaders from both parties for her ability find common ground and put complex policy into action. I look forward to working with Dr. Cohen as she leads our Nation's finest scientists and public health experts with integrity and transparency.
