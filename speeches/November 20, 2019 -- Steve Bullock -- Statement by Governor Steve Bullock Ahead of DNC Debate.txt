    Helena, MT – Ahead of tonight's DNC debate, Montana Governor Steve Bullock released the following statement:
"While other candidates bicker on stage about pie in the sky ideas, I will continue taking my case directly to voters on the ground. That's how I've been elected three times in a state Trump won by 20 points," said Montana Governor Steve Bullock. "We can't lose sight of political reality, otherwise we'll never beat Donald Trump in 2020.
"Over the last two weeks, Democrats have achieved major victories in deep red states by sticking to the playbook that won us 40 House seats in 2018 — show up everywhere and focus on serious solutions to the problems people face in their daily lives. Even President Obama warned Democrats that the vast majority of Americans aren't looking for a political revolution. The candidates on stage tonight would do well to remember these lessons."
