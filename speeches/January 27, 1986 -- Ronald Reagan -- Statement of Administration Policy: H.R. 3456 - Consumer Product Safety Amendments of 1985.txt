    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Waxman (D) California and 4 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3456, because it:
— provides an unwarranted expansion in the regulatory authority of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to include permanently-fixed amusement rides and devices. Title IV of the bill duplicates already existing State and private regulatory programs, and would not result in a decrease in the risk of accident or injury associated with amusement devices;
— exceeds the President's Budget by $10.3 million over the fiscal year 1986-88 period; and
— establishes 'a personnel floor of 568 officers and employees for the CPSC.
