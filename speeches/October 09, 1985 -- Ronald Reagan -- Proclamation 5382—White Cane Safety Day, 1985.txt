  A Proclamation

Americans admire courage and respect independence. Every day some of our neighbors renew our appreciation of these qualities. They are the Americans who set forth about their daily business bearing the white cane.
The white cane is the badge of courage carried by those blind and visually impaired citizens who believe freedom and independence are meant for all Americans. The white cane tells the world that its bearer expects not pity but fairness and considerationâ€”on the street, on the job, and everywhere Americans' paths cross.
In recognition of the significance of the white cane, the Congress, by joint resolution approved October 6, 1964, has authorized the President to designate October 15 of each year as "White Cane Safety Day."
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 1985, as White Cane Safety Day. I urge all Americans to salute the courage of those who carry the white cane and consider how each of us, in our work and in our daily rounds, can show our respect for these proud and able Americans.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-five, and the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth.

RONALD REAGAN
