Boston Globe: "If I had to pick one winner from last night, I'd say it was Amy Klobuchar. She was crisp, smart, and confident..."
Washington Post: "[Klobuchar] was one of the debate standouts, making the case calmly and persistently for a public option, cautioning against free college for rich kids and hammering at drug prices... Winners: NBC moderators (who covered a huge amount of ground and wasted no time on silly queries) ... and Klobuchar."
The New Republic: "Miami Moonglow for Booker and Klobuchar... Klobuchar managed the difficult trick of appearing both firm and likable."
Des Moines Register: "Winners: Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Klobuchar had some zingers. The Minnesota senator was quick to pop in with one-liners that were memorable, catchy and pointed. Klobuchar bashed Trump for saying he would bring down drug prices, something she said the president has yet to do."
