    Dear Mr. Chairman:
I am transmitting to you a report prepared by my Administration as required by section 701(d) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228).
The enclosed report broadly addresses policing reform and human rights in Northern Ireland. It provides information on topics of interest outlined by the Congress, including details on paramilitary decommissioning, and the manner in which U.S. law enforcement training for members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland is being administered.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
