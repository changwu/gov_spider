    Urbandale, Iowa â€“ Members of a large group of evangelical pastors and faith leaders supporting Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann praise the Family Leader's decision to remain neutral in the GOP race. Pastors Matt Floyd, Bill Tvedt and Brad Cranston and faith leader Tamara Scott issued the following statement with regard to today's announcement by the Family Leader:
"Michele Bachmann is a biblically qualified, capable, no-compromise leader who is the only truly consistent conservative in the race. When the Family Leader presented its pledge to candidates, Michele Bachmann didn't hesitate. She was the first to step forward, sign the pledge and stand shoulder to shoulder with the Family Leader. She endured relentless criticism from liberals as a result, but she never wavered from doing what she knew was right.
"The defense of marriage has been the highest priority of Bob Vander Plaats and The Family Leader, and Michele Bachmann has been a bold leader at both the state level and in Washington, D.C. She has met every criterion that the Family Leader has established. Iowans of faith know that Michele Bachmann, more than any other candidate in the race, can be counted on to defend and encourage the traditional, Christian values that made our country the greatest nation on Earth. She remains completely deserving of the Family Leader's full endorsement."
