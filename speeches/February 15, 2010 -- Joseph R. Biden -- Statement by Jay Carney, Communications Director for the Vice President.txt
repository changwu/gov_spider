    Below is a statement from Jay Carney, Communications Director for Vice President Biden, regarding a motor vehicle incident earlier today in Vancouver.
"Earlier this afternoon, a van in the Vice President's motorcade carrying members of the official US Olympic Games Delegation was involved in a minor accident while traveling to an event. Two members of the delegation, Peggy Fleming and Vonetta Flowers, received minor injuries and were taken to a local hospital as a precaution. They were both evaluated and have since been released. Neither the Vice President nor anyone else in his party was involved in the incident."
