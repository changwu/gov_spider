    Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
When schools close for the summer months, many young Americans will be seeking temporary summer employment. This year, as in the past, Federal agencies can help these young men and women put their vacations to practical
USC.
I am once again requesting that Federal managers give their full support to the Federal Summer Employment Program for Youth. Past experience clearly indicates that young people are not only effective in the performance of duties as replacements for vacationing employees, but are also useful in a variety of other activities necessary in accomplishing the Government's missions. Also important is the fact that summer employment gives us a chance to expand relationships with educational institutions and, at the same time, assist students who need the income to help out with school expenses.
I urge all agencies to conduct balanced programs through the selection of young people who have successfully competed in the summer employment examination, those who have qualified under merit staffing and the Federal Summer Intern Program. In addition, to assure that needy young people have the opportunity to become involved, I am again setting a general goal of one needy youth for every 40 regular employees.
Chairman Hampton of the Civil Service Commission will continue to provide guidance on all aspects of the Government's summer programs and will report to me on accomplishments. In the past, the success of this program has been the result of support by Federal managers. I urge your continued personal involvement.
