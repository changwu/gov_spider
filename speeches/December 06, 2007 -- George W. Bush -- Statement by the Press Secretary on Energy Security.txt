    We believe that reducing our dependence on foreign oil and increasing energy security is an area where both parties should be able to find common ground. Unfortunately, Democratic leaders in the House today pushed a partisan bill, that members had very little opportunity to study before the vote, which they knew was unacceptable to the President and had no chance being signed into law. Their proposal would raise taxes and increase energy prices for Americans. That is a misguided approach and if it made it to the President's desk, he would veto it.
In his State of the Union Address last January, President Bush laid out a bold vision to reduce our nation's consumption of gasoline by 20 percent in 10 years by greatly expanding the use of alternative fuels and modernizing our fuel economy standards. We can achieve much of his "Twenty in Ten" initiative without legislation, but we prefer a bipartisan approach in Congress that will improve our economic and energy security while protecting the environment. We hope the Senate will take a more cooperative approach and put forth a bill the President can sign.
