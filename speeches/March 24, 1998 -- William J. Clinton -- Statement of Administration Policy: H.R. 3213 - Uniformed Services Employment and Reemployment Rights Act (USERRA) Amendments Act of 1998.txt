    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Quinn (R) NY and 16 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 3213, but will work with the Senate to make certain technical and clarifying changes. The bill would amend USERRA to clarify enforcement procedures under the Act and extend the Act to cover overseas employees of U.S. companies.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 3213 would affect direct spending and receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. Because the annual direct spending and receipts would be offsetting, OMB estimates that the net pay-as-you-go effect would be zero.
