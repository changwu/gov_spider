National campaign chair and former Democratic National Committee chief Terry McAuliffe will join state chair Rory Reid and staff for a grand opening celebration of Senator Hillary Clinton's new campaign office in Pahrump this Sunday, August 19 at 1:00 p.m. The office opening comes on the heels of Hillary's recent visit to Pahrump, which brought 2,500 people to the Skate Zone for a "Conversation with Rural Nevadans."
The Pahrump office, located at 2050 N. Highway 160, Suite 200, expands Hillary's presence in rural Nevada in an effort to reach Nye County Democrats and continue mobilizing support throughout the state. The office opening event is free and open to the public.

"Our campaign is expanding operations across Nevada, and setting up shop in Pahrump - one of the fastest growing communities in the United States -is a cornerstone of that effort."
