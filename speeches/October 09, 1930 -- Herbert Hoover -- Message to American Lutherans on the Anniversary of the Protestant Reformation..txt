I SEND cordial greetings to the Americans of Lutheran faith who are celebrating on October 31 the anniversary of the Protestant Reformation and the 400th anniversary of the reading of the Augsburg Confession, from which date so many of the changes in point of view from older conceptions both of religion and government. The effects of these historical events are reflected in our National life and institutions, in religion through the predominant numbers of adherents to Protestant faiths and in Government through the principle of separation of church and state. It is fitting that we should commemorate the persons and events from which mighty forces have sprung.
