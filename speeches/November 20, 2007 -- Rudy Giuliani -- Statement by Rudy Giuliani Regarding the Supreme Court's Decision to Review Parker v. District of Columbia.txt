    Rudy Giuliani made the following statement today regarding the Supreme Court's decision to review the Court of Appeals ruling in Parker v. District of Columbia:
"I strongly believe that Judge Silberman's decision deserves to be upheld by the Supreme Court. The Parker decision is an excellent example of a judge looking to find the meaning of the words in the Constitution, not what he would like them to mean."
