    We welcome the Supreme Court's important decision yesterday in Zivotofsky v. Kerry, which reaffirms the long-established authority of the President to recognize foreign states, their governments, and their territorial boundaries. The Court's decision upholds the President's long-standing authority to make these sensitive recognition determinations as part of his conduct of diplomacy and foreign policy. Moreover, it confirms that the President's recognition determinations should be accurately reflected in official documents and sensitive diplomatic communications, including passports.
