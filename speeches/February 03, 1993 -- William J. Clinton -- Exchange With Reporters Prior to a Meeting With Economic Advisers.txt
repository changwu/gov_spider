    Q. Mr. President, while we have you, why do Social Security recipients in the middle class appear to be getting a little bit more nervous as your economic plan unfolds? Should they be?
The President. Well, the way you folks were leaking the story todayâ€” [laughter].
The people of this country ought to know that I'm going to do my best to be fair to the people that I ran to represent and to get the job machine of this country moving again and bring the deficit down. And I think the people will believe that I've been fair and comprehensive when the plan comes out. But you know, it's very difficult for us to make decisions in an environment where we have no control over who says what, about what really comes out, and half the stuff that comes out is not even accurate. So all I can tell you is I'm not going to comment on the specifics until I settle on the plan, and then I'll come forward with it. But it will be consistent with what I said today to the employees over at the OMB.
Thank you.
