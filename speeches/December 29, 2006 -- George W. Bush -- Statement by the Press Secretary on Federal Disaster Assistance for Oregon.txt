    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Oregon and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides during the period of November 5-8, 2006.
Federal funding is available to State and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides in the counties of Clatsop, Hood River, Lincoln, and Tillamook.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
R. David Paulison, Director, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Glen R. Sachtleben as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
