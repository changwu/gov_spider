    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)
(Rep. Stearns (R) Florida and 251 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 1036. The manufacturer or seller of a legal, non-defective product should not be held liable for the criminal or unlawful misuse of that product by others. H.R. 1036 would help prevent abuse of the legal system and help curb the growing problem of frivolous lawsuits in the United States. At the same time, the legislation would carefully preserve the right of individuals to have their day in court with civil liability actions. These civil actions are enumerated in the bill and respect the traditional role of the States in our Federal system with regard to such actions.
