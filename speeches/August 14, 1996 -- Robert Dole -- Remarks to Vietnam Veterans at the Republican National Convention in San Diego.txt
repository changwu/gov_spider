    Jay, thank you very much for that very generous introduction. I think we've got the Air Force flying over here this morning helping us out.
[laughter]
But the Air Force is represented here, right? Yes.
[applause]
Well, there's goes another one.
Certainly I'm proud to be with all of you in this place of remembrance this morning to the veterans of all wars, and men and women who fought for America, who died for America, who came back to lead a different life because of conflict somewhere around the world, protecting our liberty and our freedom.
And it's always an honor, as I said last night, to be in the company of veterans and their families because not everybody could serve, as I said, don't misunderstand me. But those of us who were privileged to serve, there's a special bond, there's a special relationship.
Whether the infantry or the Navy or the Coast Guard or Marines or whatever, the Air Force, there's something about serving your country that I think makes us better Americans, if that's possible, I think we are better, we understand, we appreciate what liberty and freedom's all about.
[applause]
And I want to particularly thank the veterans who are here today to help make V-J day possible 51 years ago, and there are a lot of those veterans here. And I also want to thank the many heroes in the audience today.
I was a second lieutenant, I didn't do anything heroic, but there are a lot of people here who are real heroes. And we'll always be proud of real heroes. I see a lot of Congressional Medal of Honors and other decorations here today.
And that's really what America's all about — someone who's willing to risk their lives or give their lives or come back not a whole person anymore because they cared so much for their fellow man they were willing to lay down their life for their fellow man. And you can't ask for a greater sacrifice or a greater spirit.
I was in looking at all the pictures and I was reminded about the great role that women played, not only in World War II but in all wars, and there are a lot of women here today, and I want to say thank you to all of you for all you've done for America's fighting men.
[applause]
DOLE: And I know Captain McGovern's here. Where's Captain McGovern? She's out here somewhere, who worked with Lieutenant General Ikelberger — and there are women in the WACs and the SPARS and the WAVES and the all the women that we associated with in World War II and since that time who made a direct contribution to the strength and freedom and liberty of America.
We talk a lot about values and I'll talk about values probably some tomorrow night in my acceptance speech, assuming I'm nominated tonight.
[laughter]
I don't know.
[applause]
There may be a late entry, I don't know. But in any event, patriotism to me is a real value.
As I said, you can be in or out the service and still be very, very patriotic. Somebody had to stay and make the planes and make the parts and make the tanks and grow the food and all these things necessary to keep the rest of us a real fighting machine.
But I think patriotism and community confidence and shared sacrifice gave a lot of us, in all these wars who were very young at the time, the confidence that was needed at that time. The strength to do extraordinary things in Europe and Asia a half century ago and later in Korea and Vietnam and the Persian Gulf and Somalia and Haiti.
And these values put America at the center of world affairs. Not because we wanted conquest, but because we wanted to uphold certain ideals like peace and freedom and self-determination.
And with our commitment to these ideals, there's no doubt about it, we've changed the direction of history and we've changed it for the better.
Because of American leadership, because of American sacrifice, because of American patriotism and confidence and willingness to go around the world to protect liberty and freedom, the world is a much, much better place.
Think what would have happened — if you go back to World War II, again — think what would have happened had American not entered that war, provided the leadership when sorely needed. We would not be meeting here today as free men and free women in a free country. That's what American leadership means. That's what your sacrifice meant, then, and every war before, and every war since.
And like Eisenhower, we all hate war. We never want to see another one. We hope that our children grow up, we hope that all the service organizations disappear because there are no members because we've lived in peace.
Now that's a big, big wish. But as long as we stay strong, and I've said many, many times, if I make a mistake on defense spending, I'm going to err on the side of spending a little too much, than a little too little.
[applause]
DOLE: I remember in our little war, we had people training with broomsticks. We didn't have enough M-1 rifles. Now if you spend too little, that will happen. And we'll be at risk and people will lose their lives and innocent civilians will be in danger. And that should not happen in America.
And I think President Clinton has gone too far. He's talked about cutting defense spending $60 billion, then he cut defense spending $127 billion.
And in my view, he went too far and we'll try to correct some of those mistakes starting in 1997.
[applause]
You've probably all heard what George Marshall said a long time ago. He was asked in the early days of World War II if America had a secret weapon for winning the war. He replied, "Yes. Our secret weapon is the best darn kids in the world" — end of quote. And that's what it was all about.
[applause]
And America still produces the best darned kids in the world, notwithstanding all the temptations and all the problems.
[applause]
And at this very moment, there are thousands of young men and women in uniform representing us all over the world — all over the world — away from their families, away from the comforts of home, but doing what they're asked to do — standing ready to preserve and protect and defend our national interests and our freedom and our way of life.
And those who serve today deserve our thanks. We're grateful for those who serve today, who are out there every day, every day, and we see the tragedies in Saudi Arabia. We see the threats around the world from tyrants. And the day will come when tyrants will never mess with the United States because they know we mean business.
If something happens, we will pursue them until the ends of the earth until we have justice in America.
[applause]
A few days ago, I had the great honor of visiting Abilene, Kansas, the home of my commander and sort of my military and political hero, Ike Eisenhower.
I think he was a soldier's soldier. We were very young at the time and the fact that Eisenhower, born in Texas, moved at an early age to Kansas — once he was able to understand geography and things like that...
[laughter]
But like most people like that who saw war close up, he hated it. He dreamed of a day when no one would wield a sword and no one would drag a chain.
He dreamed of an America whose greatest weapons are economic and spiritual.
DOLE: He also understood that we could not reach those goals unless we kept America strong. And I believe there's no better way to honor those who risked their lives and gave their lives for freedom than by re-dedicating ourselves to an America, as I said earlier, that's strong and prepared.
We are, in Lincoln's words, the last best hope for man in the world — on Earth.
And with a strong America, the world will remain a place where hope outweighs fear. With a strong America, peace will always have a chance. With a strong America, we will move closer to the day when no one wields a sword, and no one drags a chain and every child lives in freedom.
[applause]
That's what our goal is as Americans.
[applause]
So to all the veterans here today and all their families and friends and all those who've been involved one way or another over the last 50, 60, 70 years, I salute you. I wish you Godspeed. And above all, I thank you for your service. I thank you for helping us maintain and preserve liberty and freedom, not just in America, but around the world.
Young people are beginning to understand the sacrifices that many in this audience made. They're beginning again to look up to those who gave their lives or almost gave their lives and made the sacrifice in serving their country.
We are the greatest country on the face of the Earth. Thank you and God bless America. Thank you.
