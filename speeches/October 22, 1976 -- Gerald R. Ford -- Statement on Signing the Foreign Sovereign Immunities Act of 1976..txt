    IT IS with great satisfaction that I announce that I have signed H.R. 11315, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976. This legislation, proposed by my administration, continues the long-standing commitment of the United States to seek a stable international order under the law.
It has often been said that the development of an international legal order occurs only through small but carefully considered steps. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, which I sign today, is such a step.
This legislation will enable American citizens and foreign governments alike to ascertain when a foreign state can be sued in our courts. In this modern world, where private citizens increasingly come into contact with foreign government activities, it is important to know when the courts are available to redress legal grievances.
This statute will also make it easier for our citizens and foreign governments to turn to the courts to resolve ordinary legal disputes. In this respect, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act carries forward a modern and enlightened trend in international law. And it makes this development in the law available to all American citizens.
