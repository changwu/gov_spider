    Yesterday, more than 120 manufacturing organizations representing businesses across the nation sent a letter urging members of Congress to pass President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Proposal, which, it argues, will "strengthen manufacturers' global competitiveness, improve safety for the American workers ... and ultimately create more high-skill, high-paying manufacturing jobs."
The letter was led by the National Association of Manufacturers, which writes, "Importantly, this agreement advances these historic investments without putting at risk the competitive gains achieved for American businesses through tax reform, allowing manufacturers to reinvest in their facilities, their communities and their employees."
"With this bipartisan agreement and its framework for investment in roads and bridges, waterways, the electric grid, advanced telecommunications and so much more, we can make history," the letter reads. "This is how we build the future. This is how we build to win."
