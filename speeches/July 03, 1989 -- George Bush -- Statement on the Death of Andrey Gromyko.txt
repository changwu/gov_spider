    The President and Mrs. Bush extend their sympathies to the family of Andrey Gromyko and to Mrs. Gromyko. Andrey Gromyko's career paralleled the course of U.S.-Soviet relations for nearly 50 years. As Ambassador to the United States, as one of the architects of the United Nations, as Foreign Minister for nearly three decades, and finally as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, Mr. Gromyko knew every U.S. President from Franklin Roosevelt to George Bush and every Secretary of State from Cordell Hull to James Baker. Andrey Gromyko's death marks the passing of a generation that witnessed many of the most historic events of this century.
The U.S. Government extends its condolences to the Government and people of the Soviet Union and to Mrs. Gromyko.
