    I'm pleased to send warm greetings to the people of Iran and to welcome you to the new Radio Farda broadcast.
For many years, the United States has helped bring news and cultural broadcasts for a few hours every day to the Iranian people via Radio Freedom. Yet the Iranian people tell us that more broadcasting is needed, because the unelected few who control the Iranian Government continue to place severe restrictions on access to uncensored information. So we are now making our broadcast available to more Iranians by airing news and music and cultural programs nearly 24 hours a day, and we are pleased to continue Voice of America and VOA TV services to Iran.
The people of Iran want to build a freer, more prosperous country for their children and live in a country that is a full partner in the international community. Iranians also deserve a free press to express themselves to help build an open, democratic, and free society.
My thoughts and prayers are with the Iranian people, particularly the families of the many Iranians who are in prison today for daring to express their hopes and dreams for a better future. We continue to stand with the people of Iran in your quest for freedom, prosperity, honest and effective government, judicial due process, and the rule of law. And we continue to call on the Government of Iran to respect the will of its people and be accountable to them.
As I have said before, if Iran respects its international obligations and embraces freedom and tolerance, it will have no better friend than the United States of America.
Best wishes for a bright future filled with knowledge and information and freedom.
