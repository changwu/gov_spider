    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report two new deferrals of Energy Research and Development Administration funds totaling $127.2 million. The deferrals have no effect on budgetary outlays for fiscal year 1977 or subsequent years. In addition, I am reporting a revision to a previously transmitted Department of Commerce deferral.
The details of each deferral are contained in the attached reports.
