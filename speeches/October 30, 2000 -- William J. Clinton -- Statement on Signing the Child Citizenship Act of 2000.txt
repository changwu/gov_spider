    Today I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 2883, the "Child Citizenship Act of 2000." This Act confers U.S. citizenship automatically upon certain foreign-born children, including those adopted by citizens of the United States, who do not acquire U.S. citizenship at birth. This Act eliminates the need in many instances for parents to apply to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for Certificates of Citizenship for their children who are not U.S. citizens at birth.
Under prior law, foreign-born adopted children could be subject to removal if they did not acquire U.S. citizenship after being brought to the United Statesâ€”even if they had lived their lives since infancy in the United States. While this Act will not remedy past cases where adopted children were deported, it will ensure that this unfortunate possibility will be eliminated for most noncitizen adopted children under the age of 18 and for all noncitizen children adopted into U.S. households in the future. I welcome this action to support families who adopt foreign-born children by removing an unnecessary impediment to citizenship for these and other foreign-born children.
