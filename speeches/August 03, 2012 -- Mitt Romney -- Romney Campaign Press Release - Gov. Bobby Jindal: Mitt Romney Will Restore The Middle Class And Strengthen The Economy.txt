    Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal today made the following statement on the July employment report:
"Today's disappointing jobs report is just more evidence that the only thing President Obama's economic plan has 'worked' to do is slow the recovery, stifle job creation, and make it harder for small businesses to succeed and hire workers. After the 42nd straight month of unemployment over 8 percent, Americans are desperate for new leadership in the White House. Mitt Romney's Plan for a Stronger Middle Class will bring our economy back and create millions of good jobs."
