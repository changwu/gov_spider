    WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, President Barack Obama announced a new goal of recruiting 10,000 Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) teachers over the next two years. This announcement will move the country forward on the Obama Administration's ambitious goal of preparing 100,000 STEM teachers over the next decade.
Statement by President Obama: "When I came into office, I set a goal of moving our nation from the middle to the top of the pack in math and science education. Strengthening STEM education is vital to preparing our students to compete in the 21st century economy and we need to recruit and train math and science teachers to support our nation's students."
As America's students lag in math and science when compared to peers around the world, President Obama has made improving STEM education one of his top priorities. President Obama has identified three overarching priorities for STEM education, necessary for laying a new foundation for America's future prosperity:

Increasing STEM literacy so all students can think critically in science, math, engineering and technology; 
Improving the quality of math and science teaching so American students are no longer outperformed by those in other nations; 
And expanding STEM education and career opportunities for underrepresented groups, including women and minorities.
