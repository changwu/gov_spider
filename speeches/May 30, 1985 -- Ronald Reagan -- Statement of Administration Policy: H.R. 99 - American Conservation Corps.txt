(House)
(Rep. Seiberling (D) Ohio and 137 others)
The Administration strongly opposes enactment of H.R. 99, because (1) it would reinstate programs terminated by Congress because they were costly and ineffective; (2) youth employment programs funded under the Job Training Partnership Act are much less costly per trainee, more likely to result in permanent private sector employment, specifically tailored to needy youth, and scaled to meet today's needs; (3) the work that would be performed is generally of low priority; (4) there is no acceptable reason for now establishing a new State grant program covering part of the operation and maintenance costs of recreation lands; and (5) given the three year, open-ended authorization, the program could cost $370 million annually, as estimated by CBO.
This bill is very similar to H.R. 999 of the 98th Congress, which the President pocket vetoed on October 30, 1984, for the reasons cited above. If H.R. 99 reaches the President's desk, the Office of Management and Budget together with the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, and Labor will recommend that the President veto the bill.
