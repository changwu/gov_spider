    Today I have signed into law S. 1869, the "Coastal Barrier Resources Reauthorization Act of 2005." This Act provides for digital mapping in support of the coastal barrier resources system and authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 2010 for implementation of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act.
Section 3(c)(2) and section 4(c)(3)(C) and (D) purport to require executive branch officials to submit legislative recommendations to the Congress. The executive branch shall construe such provisions in a manner consistent with the Constitution's commitment to the President of the authority to submit for the consideration of the Congress such measures as the President judges necessary and expedient and to supervise the unitary executive branch.
