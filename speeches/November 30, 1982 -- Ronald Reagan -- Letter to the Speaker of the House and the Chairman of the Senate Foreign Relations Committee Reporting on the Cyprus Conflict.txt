    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-384, I am submitting the following report on progress made during the past 60 days toward reaching a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus problem.
Intercommunal negotiations resumed on November 9 following a one and one-half month recess and continue to focus on various elements of the U.N. Secretary General's evaluation document. The two parties remain committed to these U.N.-sponsored talks and to working for progress in this forum. We continue to believe that it represents the most fruitful course for negotiating progress. The parties are engaged in a genuine dialogue which has made it possible for each side to define its positions.
On October 6, Secretary Shultz and Cypriot President Kyprianou met in New York during the United Nations General Assembly and exchanged views on efforts to reach a settlement to the Cyprus problem. In addition, Mr. Christian A. Chapman, a senior Foreign Service Officer newly appointed by the Secretary of State as U.S. Special Cyprus Coordinator, traveled in early November to Cyprus where he met with President Kyprianou, Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash, the intercommunal negotiators, and U.N. Special Representative Gobbi. Mr. Chapman will coordinate our support for the efforts of the Secretary General and Ambassador Gobbi.
I wish once again to affirm my commitment, and that of this Administration, to the search for a just and lasting solution to the problems of the people of Cyprus.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
