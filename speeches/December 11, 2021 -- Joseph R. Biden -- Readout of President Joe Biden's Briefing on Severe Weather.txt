    The President was briefed by FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, White House Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Jen O'Malley Dillon, and White House Director of Intergovernmental Affairs Julie Chavez Rodriguez on the severe weather and tornadoes that impacted seven states overnight and which continues to affect communities across multiple states today. Administrator Criswell described the severe consequences, including in Kentucky, and tragic losses of life. She also briefed on the rapid deployment of FEMA emergency response personnel, water and other needed commodities. The President has directed that Federal resources be surged immediately to the locations where there is the greatest need to alleviate suffering from the devastating consequences of these storms. Because damage assessments are ongoing, further briefings will be provided to the President in the course of the day.
