LAKE JACKSON, Texas — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul's campaign recently swept a contest held to recognize innovative political advertising, affirming his organization's creativity and the aggressive posture it takes when promoting Dr. Paul's platform of constitutionally-limited government, a return to economic and civil liberties, and an unfailing respect for the sanctity of life.
The Pollie Awards are conferred by the American Association of Political Consultants (AAPC), an association of communications professionals whose talents craft the messaging and tactics that make political campaigns effective and memorable.
AAPC judges recognized the Paul campaign and its ad consultant Jon Downs of FP1 Strategies for Paul's overall ad strategy, awarding them the 2012 Gold Award for TV/Radio Campaign — Republican. Particular honors bestowed the Paul campaign are the Bronze Award for Best Use of Negative Contrast — Republican; an Honorable Mention for Radio in a Presidential Primary for its ad 'Life'; the Gold, Silver, and Bronze Award for Television in a Presidential Primary for the ads 'Big Dog,' 'Serial Hypocrisy,' and 'Conviction,' respectively; and the Gold Award for Best Use of Humor — Republican for 'Big Dog.'
"Our team is very proud of the recognition Ron Paul and we have received in what is a truly collaborative advertising process. We will continue our work with Jon Downs and FP1 Strategies, the best ad guy in the business," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton. "Our ads cut through the noise and clutter of better-funded campaign and multimillion-dollar Super PACS and pushed Dr. Paul's winning message to historic finishes in Iowa, New Hampshire, and beyond."
