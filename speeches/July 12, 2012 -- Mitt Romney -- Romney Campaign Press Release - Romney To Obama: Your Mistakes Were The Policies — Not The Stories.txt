    "President Obama believes that millions of Americans have lost their homes, their jobs and their livelihood because he failed to tell a good story. Being president is not about telling stories. Being president is about leading, and President Obama has failed to lead. No wonder Americans are losing faith in his presidency." —Mitt Romney
President Obama Says The Biggest Mistake Of His First Term Was Thinking His Job "Was Just About Getting The Policy Right":

OBAMA: "The mistake of my first term — couple of years — was thinking that this job was just about getting the policy right. And that's important. And that's important.

(Jeffrey Sparshott and Eric Morath, "Jobs Data Indicate Slowing Growth," The Wall Street Journal, 7/6/12)
Average Weekly Wages Declined In 2011, "One Of Only Five Declines Since The Category Was Created In 1978."

In the latest demonstration of the struggling economy that threatens President Obama's reelection, average weekly wages fell in 2011, one of only five declines since the category was created in 1978 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics."

(Martin Crutsinger, "Fed Report: Middle Class Net Worth Tumbles," The Associated Press, 6/12/12)
Wrong On Debt, Deficits, And Spending...

Wrong On Health Care...
Obamacare Contains "The Largest Tax Increase Since 1993." "Keep in mind that Mr. Obama has already signed the largest tax increase since 1993.

And the annual growth rate for the U.S. economy in the January-March quarter was unchanged at a tepid 1.9 percent. ... Growth of around 1.9 percent typically generates roughly 90,000 jobs a month.
