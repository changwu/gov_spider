    
  By the President of the United States of America
  A Proclamation

TEMPORARY QUANTITATIVE LIMITATION ON THE IMPORTATION INTO THE UNITED STATES OF CERTAIN CATTLE, BEEF, VEAL, SWINE AND PORK FROM CANADA
Whereas, Section 252 (a) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1882 (a)) authorizes the President to impose duties or other import restrictions on the products of any foreign country establishing or maintaining unjustifiable import restrictions against United States agricultural products which impair the value of tariff commitments made to the United States, oppress the commerce of the United States, or prevent the expansion of trade on a mutually advantageous basis;
Whereas, Canada has imposed unjustifiable restrictions on cattle and meat imports from the United States;
Whereas, such restrictions violate the commitments of Canada made to the United States, including the provisions of Article XI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and impair the value of tariff commitments made to the United States, oppress the commerce of the United States and prevent the expansion of trade on a mutually advantageous basis; and
Whereas, I deem it necessary and appropriate to impose the restrictions hereinafter proclaimed on imports of cattle, beef, veal, swine, and pork, which are the products of Canada, in order to obtain the removal of such unjustifiable restrictions and to provide access for United States cattle and meat to the markets of Canada on an equitable basis;
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes, including Section 252 (a) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1882(a)), do hereby proclaim (until such time as the President otherwise proclaims)
