    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of one of the true frontiersmen of television journalism, John Chancellor. John's scrupulous attention to the facts and his ability to capture the spirit of an issue won him the hearts and minds of the American people. From his historic coverage of a story very personal to me, the desegregation of Central High School in Little Rock, to his renowned political reporting, John brought us the very best journalism had to offer. We extend our sincerest prayers and deepest sympathies to his family, his friends, and his colleagues at NBC News.
