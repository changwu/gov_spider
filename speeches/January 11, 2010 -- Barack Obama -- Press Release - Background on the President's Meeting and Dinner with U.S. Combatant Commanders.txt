    At 5:30pm today, the President will meet with the U.S. Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) in the Cabinet Room. Later this evening, the President and First Lady will host a dinner for the Combatant Commanders and their spouses as well as six wounded warriors representing each branch of service.
The dinner will give the President and First Lady the opportunity to hear directly from our commanders, troops in the field and their spouses about the challenges that our military and military families face on a day-to-day basis.
