    Washington, DC -- "Tomorrow, I will cast my vote to send the President a clear message: Democrats are united in fighting to change course, redeploy our troops out of Iraq, and end this war as soon as possible.
"When the Senate votes on motions to allow debate on both the Feingold-Reid and Levin-Reid Amendments, I will vote for cloture on both. I do so because we, as a united party, must work together with clarity of purpose and mission to begin bringing our troops home and end this war.
"The bipartisan Iraq Study Group offered a way forward for beginning the redeployment of our troops out of Iraq. But President Bush rejected those recommendations and refuses to work with Congress to develop a strategy that will enable our troops to start coming home.
"President Bush vetoed the bipartisan bill to fund the troops, refuses to change course, and stubbornly denies the reality on the ground and the will of the American people.
"We will continue to press him to follow the will of the people. I will continue to pursue with Senator Byrd our legislation to deauthorize the war by October 11, 2007. I will continue to do everything in my power to convince the president to change course and to work with my colleagues in the Senate to bring an end to this war as soon as possible."
