Boston, MA – Today, Livonia Mayor Jack Kirksey endorsed Governor Mitt Romney and his campaign for President. Mayor Kirksey is a widely regarded public servant and community activist.
"Governor Romney has proven that he can bring needed change in business, in the non-profit world, and in government," said Mayor Kirksey. "Now, he has the opportunity to go to Washington and change a government that is fundamentally broken. Michiganders have lived through a one-state recession for too long, and we deserve a chance at success. Governor Romney can help achieve that by reducing taxes for the middle class, ending the death tax, and stopping illegal immigration."
"I appreciate Mayor Kirksey's support. The people of Michigan have seen the boom days of the last century pass them by and too many folks are unable to achieve the American dream. For me, Michigan is personal. It's where I was born, it's where I grew up, and it's where my father was Governor. As president, I can help spur the economy and drive businesses back to the United States and to great states like Michigan," said Governor Romney.
