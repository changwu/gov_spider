    Well, we had some bad news this weekend. Our good friend Tony Snow passed away. Tony, you know, worked with us and made a lot of friends here in the White House. And Laura and I are—we're really saddened by his death.
I came to know Tony as a very smart and capable man. He had good values. He was an honest guy. You know, he had a wonderful sense of humor. He loved to laugh, he loved his country, and he loved his family.
And our thoughts are with Jill and the three children now as they deal with their grief. We went to church this morning at Camp David, and I prayed for Jill and the family, that they would have—find comfort and strength during this tough time for them. And I just hope they understand that Tony was loved here in the White House, and a lot of those who, you know, got to know him really do care about Jill and the kids.
So anyway, thank you.
