    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Colorado Speaker of the House Frank McNulty.
"I am honored to have Speaker McNulty on my Colorado team," said Mitt Romney. "Earning the support of Coloradans will be critical in the upcoming election. President Obama won the state in 2008 - three years into his administration, voters are clearly rethinking their choice. Americans across the country continue to struggle to find work - the handiwork of the President's poor policies and lack of leadership. Speaker McNulty shares my focus on creating jobs, helping small businesses, and keeping taxes low. With his help, I am confident we can spread this message in Colorado, defeat President Obama in November 2012, and restore a strong America."
Announcing his support, Speaker McNulty said, "Three years ago, President Obama signed his $787 billion stimulus in Denver. Three years later, it is clear that the only jobs created from the stimulus were government jobs. Unlike our current president, Mitt Romney knows how the economy works and how jobs are created. He understands that the private sector, not government, will restart our economy. With Mitt Romney's conservative record and economic know-how, Coloradans can be confident that he will turn around our economy."
