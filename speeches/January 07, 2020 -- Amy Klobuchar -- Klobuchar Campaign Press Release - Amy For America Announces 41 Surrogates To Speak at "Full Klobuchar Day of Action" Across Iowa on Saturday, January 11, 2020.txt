    Th 41 Iowa and Minnesota Campaign Surrogates Will Lead Organizing Events in All 99 Iowa Counties on Saturday, January 11
DES MOINES, IA — Amy For America announced today that 41 surrogates from across Iowa and Minnesota will lead the campaign's "Full Klobuchar Day of Action," featuring organizing events in all of Iowa's 99 counties on Saturday, January 11.
Iowa and Minnesota surrogates will visit canvass launches, phone banks, and organizing meetings to fire up supporters and volunteers just 23 days before the Iowa Caucuses. Surrogates include Iowa and Minnesota state legislators, labor leaders, agriculture leaders, influential Iowa Democratic Party activists, and Senator Klobuchar's husband, John Bessler.
Klobuchar is the only candidate to have qualified for the January debate who has visited all of Iowa's 99 counties. With the recent endorsement from Iowa State Senator Rich Taylor, Klobuchar now has the support of more current Iowa legislators than any other candidate in the race.
