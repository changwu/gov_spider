    I congratulate the House on passing the bipartisan "Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act." This is legislation that will usher in a new era of service in America, and I look forward to signing it into law when I return to Washington.
Because of this legislation, millions of Americans at all stages of their lives will have new opportunities to serve their country: from improving service learning in schools to creating an army of 250,000 Corps members a year dedicated to addressing our Nation's toughest problems; from connecting working Americans to a variety of part-time service opportunities to better utilizing the skills and experience of our retirees and baby boomers. This legislation will help tap the genius of our faith-based and community organizations, and it will find the most innovative ideas for addressing our common challenges and helping those ideas grow.
But while our Government can provide every opportunity imaginable for us to serve our communities, now it is up to each of us to seize those opportunities. I call on all Americans to stand up and do what they can to serve their communities, shape our history, and enrich both their own lives and the lives of others across this country.
