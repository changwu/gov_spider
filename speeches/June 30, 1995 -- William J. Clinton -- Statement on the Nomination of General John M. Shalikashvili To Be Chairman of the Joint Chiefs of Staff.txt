    I am pleased to announce that I have nominated General John M. Shalikashvili, U.S. Army, for reappointment as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for a 2-year term.
As I said when I nominated General Shalikashvili for Chairman in 1993, he is a shining symbol of what is best about the United States and best about our armed services. He has again proven that over the past 20 months by maintaining the strongest military in the world, with the equipment and trained force to fight and win when we must, even as he completed the post-cold-war drawdown of our forces. From morale to readiness, General Shalikashvili has provided the sound leadership needed to keep our military strong while shaping the Armed Forces for the 21st century. I look forward to the next 2 years with General Shalikashvili as Chairman, to his wise and reasoned counsel, and to his advocacy for the men and women in the Armed Forces in support of the national security of the United States.
