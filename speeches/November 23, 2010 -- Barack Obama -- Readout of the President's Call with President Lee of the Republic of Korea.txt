    This evening, President Obama called President Lee to tell him that the United States stands shoulder to shoulder with our close friend and ally, the Republic of Korea. The President strongly condemned the attack by North Korea on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeoung, which took the lives of at least two Koreans and injured many more.
President Obama told President Lee that the thoughts and prayers of the American people are with the loved ones of those who were killed or wounded, and with all of the Korean people. President Obama said that North Korea must stop its provocative actions, which will only lead to further isolation, and fully abide by the terms of the Armistice Agreement and its obligations under international law.
Going forward, the United States remains firmly and fully committed to the defense of its ally the Republic of Korea. The United States will work with the international community to strongly condemn this outrageous action by North Korea, and to advance peace and security in the region.
The two Presidents agreed to hold combined military exercises and enhanced training in the days ahead to continue the close security cooperation between our two countries, and to underscore the strength of our Alliance and commitment to peace and security in the region.
