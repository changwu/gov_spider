    Today we received more evidence that our economy remains solid and strong, more proof that the economic strategy we have had in place for 6 years is serving America's working families well. Last month personal income rose a strong 0.5 percent. That's good news in this holiday season and good news for our future. Over the past year, personal incomes have increased nearly 5 percent, far faster than the rate of inflation.
While we should be pleased with our strong economic progress, now is not a time to rest; it is a time to build. To ensure that America's economy continues to work for America's working families, we must maintain the three-part economic strategy that has helped produce these remarkable gains. We must maintain our fiscal discipline; continue to invest in our people through education, health care, and research and development; and continue to lead the global economy.
