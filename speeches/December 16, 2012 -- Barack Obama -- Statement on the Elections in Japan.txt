    I congratulate Liberal Democratic Party President Shinzo Abe on his party's success in the elections in Japan today. The U.S.-Japan alliance serves as the cornerstone of peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific, and I look forward to working closely with the next Government and the people of Japan on a range of important bilateral, regional, and global issues. I also extend my appreciation to Prime Minister Noda for his many contributions to U.S.-Japan relations.
