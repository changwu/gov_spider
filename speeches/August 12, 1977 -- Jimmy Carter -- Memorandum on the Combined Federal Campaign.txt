    Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
Subject: Combined Federal Campaign
I am pleased to tell you that W. Michael Blumenthal, Secretary of the Treasury, has agreed to serve as Chairman of the Combined Federal Campaign for the National Capital Area this fall.
This campaign, which begins in September, combines the solicitation efforts of the United Way of the National Capital Area, the National Health Agencies, and the International Service Agencies. In this single drive we will seek to do our share to meet the needs of more than 150 local, national and international health, welfare and social service agencies.
The needs of the voluntary organizations supported by the Combined Federal Campaign are great. These organizations perform essential services in helping the disadvantaged, in serving youth and the aged, in healing the sick, and in helping those in need overseas. CFC gives all of us who are Federal employees, whether civilian or military, a unique opportunity to pledge our help to people in our community, our nation, and around the world--a pledge made more convenient by the availability of voluntary payroll deductions.
I request that you serve personally as Chairman of the campaign in your organization and that you appoint one of your top assistants as your Vice Chairman. Please advise Secretary Blumenthal of the person you designate as Vice Chairman. I am confident that Secretary Blumenthal will have your wholehearted support in this endeavor, and I urge you to commend the campaign to everyone in your organization.
JIMMY CARTER
