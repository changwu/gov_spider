    To the Congress of the United States:
On September 4, 1996, I determined and reported to the Congress that Mongolia was not in violation of the freedom of emigration criteria of sections 402(a) and 409(a) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. This action allowed for the continuation of normal trade relations status for Mongolia and certain other activities without the requirement of an annual waiver.
As required by law, I am submitting an updated report to the Congress concerning the emigration laws and policies of Mongolia. The report indicates continued Mongolian compliance with U.S. and international standards in the area of emigration.
