    I am signing into law H.R. 5013, the "Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992." I take great pleasure in signing this Act because it promotes the conservation of wild exotic birds and provides for other measures related to fish and wildlife conservation. It also demonstrates our global leadership in the protection and conservation of wildlife.
Over the past 4 years, my Administration has played a strong role in the development of a world conservation strategy. The United States is a long-standing member of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This Act provides an important mechanism for the United States to implement the decisions and resolutions agreed to under CITES. Other nations, including those within the European Community, have also acted to regulate imports of exotic wild birds whose populations may be detrimentally affected by trade.
Furthermore, this Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to support the management efforts of other nations in the conservation of their wild birds. Funds to assist these countries will be made available through the Exotic Bird Conservation Fund established by this Act.
Our action here exemplifies our commitment to wildlife conservation around the world. By strengthening our wildlife import policies and by encouraging the wildlife management programs of other countries, this Act will help to prevent any further decimation of wild bird populations.
I commend the bipartisan leadership of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee as well as a broad range of groups, including conservation organizations, importers, scientists, breeders, humane organizations, and the pet industry, for working with the Administration on this legislation.
