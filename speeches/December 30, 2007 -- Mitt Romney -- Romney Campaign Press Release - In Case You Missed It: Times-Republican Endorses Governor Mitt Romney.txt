"Selecting a president is a huge responsibility. It has been extremely difficult this year for Republicans however since all the candidates have some particular trait that appeals to GOP loyalists but no one seems to be the clear runaway candidate.
"But we think after Republicans finally dissect each of the candidates to determine who they should ultimately vote for, they will determine as we did and Mitt Romney will be their clear choice in the Iowa Caucuses on Jan. 3.
"Romney is the most conservative candidate who is running.
"Romney's views for a strong military, limited government, lower taxes, free market principles, immigration reform, family values and high ethical standards are what make him appealing to conservative voters and to this newspaper."
...
"But what distinguishes Romney from the rest of the pack in our eyes is his past performance in successfully running large enterprises."
...
"Romney offers proven executive experience. He has met payrolls and knows how to run a giant operation. He has proven his leadership ability and business acumen in his campaign and throughout his successful professional life."
...
"We think Romney has all the skills it takes to be an effective leader and a good president who will be able to follow through on his vision for America."
