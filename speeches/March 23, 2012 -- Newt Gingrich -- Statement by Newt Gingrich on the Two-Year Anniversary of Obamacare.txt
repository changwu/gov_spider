"Two years ago Barack Obama signed into law the most dangerous legislation in generations. Obamacare will ultimately lead to a government takeover of healthcare. It empowers bureaucrats at the expense of patients. It regulates doctors and the practice of medicine more than ever before. It taxes businesses and penalizes citizens for not complying with federal fiat. It cuts Medicare by half a trillion dollars, threatening seniors' access to care. It raises taxes by $500 billion. And it's a new entitlement that will cost untold trillions in the future.
"Next week, the Supreme Court opens its historic arguments to decide whether the Congress overstepped its constitutional bounds. I strongly support the 26 states that will argue that the Congress had no legitimate authority to pass Obamacare. If this law is allowed to stand, there will be no end to the power of government. The government will ultimately control very personal decisions over life and death.
"Ultimately, we must demand the full repeal of Obamacare, and that will most likely require Congressional action. Congress should listen to the American people and repeal this law now. As president elect, I will ask Congress to pass a bill repealing Obamacare before I take office so I can sign the bill after the inauguration. We can then work to pass a replacement bill which empowers patients and doctors to lower the cost of healthcare to expand access, rather than empowering Washington bureaucrats."
