And then it struck me: he's for all the sources of energy that come from above the ground. Wind and solar. He just doesn't like the things that come from below the ground. That's the course he's on. The course I'll put us on is to take advantage of what comes from above the ground as well as what comes from below the ground so that America can finally become energy secure and independent of the oil cartel."- Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "The road we're on, as Mr. Axelrod described it, the road we're on is one that says that energy's going to become more and more expensive. It's going to be harder and harder to get coal; harder and harder to use it here of course. It'll be sent to other nations around the world and used. But the cost here will go up. Harder to use natural gas. You saw the President kicked off the regulation, re-regulation of natural gas until after the election. Harder and harder to use oil. How in the world the President says, as he did the other day, he's for 'all of the above' when it comes to energy? I couldn't figure that out given his policies. And then it struck me: he's for all the sources of energy that come from above the ground. Wind and solar. He just doesn't like the things that come from below the ground. That's the course he's on. The course I'll put us on is to take advantage of what comes from above the ground as well as what comes from below the ground so that America can finally become energy secure and independent of the oil cartel."
