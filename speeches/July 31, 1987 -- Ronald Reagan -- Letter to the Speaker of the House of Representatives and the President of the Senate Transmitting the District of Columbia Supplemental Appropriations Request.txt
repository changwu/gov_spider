    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, I am transmitting the request for supplemental appropriations by the District of Columbia for the fiscal year 1987 in the amount of $51,236,000 in District of Columbia funds. This transmittal does not represent an endorsement of the contents.
Also, I am taking this opportunity to reiterate my request that the Congress ensure that none of the funds appropriated for the District of Columbia be used for abortion unless the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term. Thus, I will support an amendment to the District of Columbia's appropriations bill that restricts the use of both the District's Federal and locally generated funds for abortion.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
