    I am signing into law H.R. 5126, the "Civil War Battlefield Commemorative Coin Act of 1992." H.R. 5126 authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the protection of Civil War battlefields. The proceeds will go to the nonprofit Civil War Battlefield Foundation to be used for the preservation of historically significant Civil War battlefields.
This legislation provides a nonfederal funding mechanism to enhance the protection of Civil War battlefields. The minting of these coins will cost the taxpayers nothing. The monies raised will make a major contribution to the preservation of our Civil War heritage. The greatest beneficiaries of this bill will be the future generations of Americans who will be able to relive more of the history of the Civil War era.
Today, many of America's battlefields face unprecedented development pressures, and there is renewed interest in protecting them. My Administration has embarked on an ambitious campaign to identify and protect important battlefields through the American Battlefield Protection Program. This program is a national public/private partnership overseen by the Secretary of the Interior. The Civil War Battlefield Foundation is a privately established entity dedicated to raising funds for this endeavor. This legislation is timely in that it coincides with, and supports, this important program.
Innovative public/private partnerships such as the kind supported by this legislation are a necessity if we are going to preserve our heritage to the fullest possible extent. Therefore, it is with great pleasure that I approve H.R. 5126.
