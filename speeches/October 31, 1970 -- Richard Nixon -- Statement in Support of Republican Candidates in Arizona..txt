    PAUL FANNIN and Jack Williams are a tested and experienced leadership team who deserve the support of all Arizonans who are concerned about effective government.
Paul Fannin is a man who has proven himself worthy of your trust--and mine-in the Senate of the United States. He is a man who will stand with the administration on the crucial issues. He shares our commitment to peace through strength--both in ending war abroad and in restoring order at home. Highly respected by his colleagues, Paul Fannin is an effective spokesman for Arizona in the United States Senate.
As mayor of Phoenix and as the first Republican Governor to work with a Republican legislature since statehood, Jack Williams has been a strong and a sound leader. He has fought effectively against crime, against corruption, and against pollution. His experience and proven ability make him exactly the right man to be elected to the first 4-year term as your Governor.
Republican government means good government--in Arizona and in the Nation. I hope that the voters of Arizona will vote to support the Republican ticket in the coming elections.
