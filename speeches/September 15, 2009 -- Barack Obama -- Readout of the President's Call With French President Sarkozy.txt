    The President and President Sarkozy had a productive call earlier today on several issues on our shared strategic agenda, underscoring broad agreement on key issues. The two leaders discussed preparations for the upcoming G20 Summit in Pittsburgh, including the need to address a broad range of regulatory reform issues, including capital and executive compensation. They also discussed ways to reform international institutions to make them more inclusive and effective.
The two leaders discussed the status of diplomatic efforts to bring Iran into compliance with its international obligations on its nuclear program. They also agreed to continue working with key players in the Middle East region on setting the conditions necessary to restart Israeli-Arab peace negotiations. The President congratulated President Sarkozy on the historic appointment of French General St√©phane Abrial to the post of NATO Supreme Allied Commander Transformation, a key post that leads in the transformation of NATO's forces and capabilities to address the challenges of the 21st century.
The United States appreciates the strong French leadership and contributions on these important issues.
