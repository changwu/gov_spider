    Vice President Biden spoke to Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani today to reiterate U.S. Government support to Pakistan during the current flood crisis. Vice President Biden underlined that the United States is standing by Pakistan during this challenging time. He noted that the U.S. Government has provided around $260 million in emergency humanitarian assistance to the people of Pakistan to date. The United States has also provided other civilian and military in-kind assistance in the form of halal meals, pre-fabricated steel bridges and other infrastructure support. The U.S. is now using 25 helicopters, two C-17s, and five C-130s to transport relief supplies. We have already delivered more than 4.6 million pounds of supplies and transported more than 13,000 people to safety. While we continue our immediate flood relief, Vice President Biden highlighted that we are also pursuing a full-fledged diplomatic effort to encourage additional international resources to help Pakistan rebuild. The two leaders discussed ongoing coordination as Pakistan transitions from relief to recovery efforts.
