    Campaign Makes Aggressive Buy in Iowa
WASHINGTON â€“ Following a massive $25 million fundraising haul in the third quarter, Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday released his first paid television advertisement of the 2020 campaign and announced a $1.3 million buy in Iowa.
The ad, titled "Fights for Us," highlights Sanders' long history leading movements to lift up working people and transform the economy so it works for all of us.
"In this moment, we need a fighter," the narrator thunders over images of Sanders standing with working class Americans. "Bernie Sanders. We know he'll fight for us as president because he always has."
The ad was produced entirely in-house, and the buy will include a mix of 30-second and 60-second versions of the ad. The ads will begin running Thursday morning and this initial buy will run for two weeks.
The 60-second version of the spot can be seen here and a transcript is below:
'Living in a family that struggled economically powerfully influenced my life and my values.' Bernie Sanders. Fighting to raise wages for American workers, leading the fight to guarantee health care for all, standing up for civil rights, seniors, veterans, and our children's future. Whether it was Wall Street, the drug companies or other powerful special interests, Bernie has taken them on. For us.Now, our country is at a turning point. A dangerous demagogue tearing our nation apart, hard working people betrayed by Trump, a health care system that makes enormous profits for drug and insurance companies, and a planet on the brink of a climate disaster.In this moment, we need a fighter. Bernie Sanders. We know he'll fight for us as president because he always has.'I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message.'
