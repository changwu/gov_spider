    Today, I have signed into law H.R. 3057, the "Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2006." The Act provides funds in support of United States foreign policy objectives abroad.
The Executive Branch shall construe as advisory certain provisions of the Act that purport to direct or burden the President's constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations, either by purporting to direct the content of certain international negotiations and communications or by directing the Executive Branch to collaborate with other entities in the development of foreign policy. These provisions include sections 506(a), 514, 551, 561(a) and (d), 562, 575(a), 590(b) and 593.
The Executive Branch shall also construe certain provisions of the Act that purport to make consultation with the Congress a precondition to the execution of the law as calling for, but not mandating, such consultation, as is consistent with the Constitution's provisions concerning the separate powers of the Congress to legislate and of the President to execute the laws. Such provisions include sections 506(e), 509(b), 512, 534(k), 543(b), 564(b), 576(c), 595, and provisions under the headings "Transition Initiatives," USAID; "Andean Counterdrug Initiative," Department of State; and "Debt Restructuring," Department of the Treasury.
