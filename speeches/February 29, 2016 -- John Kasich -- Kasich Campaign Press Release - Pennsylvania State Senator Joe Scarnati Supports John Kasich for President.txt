    Today, Pennsylvania State Senator Joe Scarnati endorsed Ohio Gov. John Kasich for president and joined the Kasich for America Leadership Team.
"We need a president who is ready to serve from day one," said Scarnati. "John Kasich, a proven governor and a strong fiscal conservative, has the executive experience to lead. I am proud to endorse him today and spread his positive message across Pennsylvania."

A native of Brockway, Joe Scarnati serves Pennsylvania's 25th senatorial district, which includes Cameron, Clinton, Elk, Jefferson, McKeon, Potter and Tioga countries and portions of Clearfield County. Currently serving his 4th term in office, he is the President Pro Tempore of the Senate. He previously endorsed Gov. Chris Christie.
Said Kasich, "I welcome Senator Scarnati to the team as we forge ahead and bring positive, commonsense and real solutions to the American people. He is a committed public servant and a fearless advocate of making government more accountable and transparent. I am thankful for his endorsement."
