    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Sharp (D) Indiana and 9 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 2266 but will work in the Senate to amend the bill to conform the appropriations that it would authorize for pipeline safety — $11,473 million — to the President's FY 1989 Budget request of $9,723 million.
