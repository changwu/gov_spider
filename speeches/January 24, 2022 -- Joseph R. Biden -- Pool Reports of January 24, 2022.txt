In town pool report #9 - Biden remarks 
Biden sat down and said "It's good to see you all. Let's have a cabinet meeting."
Biden talked about his competition executive order. Said economy is being held back by consolidation.
"Rather than competing for customers they're consuming their competitors."
Biden talked about some of the 72 actions in the EO, including the creation of this council.
"In six months since i issued the order we've hit every deadline so far."
Biden talked about the right to repair - when consumers are trapped into going to the seller and paying their prices to repair devices. Biden said FTC is ramping up enforcement against illegal repair restrictions. He says many companies voluntarily changed policies, including Apple and Microsoft letting people repair phones and computers themselves. "Although I'm not sure I know how to do that."
Biden talks about new FTC rule making it possible for hearing aids to be sold over the counter without a prescription. He said he expects this to drop costs from thousands of dollars to hundreds of dollars.
More to come.

He touched on a number of issues from food prices to non-compete clauses workers are forced to sign.
"All designed to keep wages down and prices up."
"Our economy shouldn't be about people working for capitalism, if should be about capitalism working for people."
Asked About Ukraine says he had a "very, very good meeting. Total unanimity with all the European leaders."
Press are escorted out without him taking any more questions.

In town pool report #11 — Hot mic 
Your pooler could not make out what Biden said over the shouting in the room at the time, but would direct your attention to video of the event if you are curious how the president really feels about being asked about inflation from Fox's Peter Doocy.
