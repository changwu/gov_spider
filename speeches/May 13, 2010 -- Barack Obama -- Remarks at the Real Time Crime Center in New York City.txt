    Well, everybody, look, I know you folks are busy, but I just wanted to come by and say thank you. I was telling the mayor and the commissioner that the work that the NYPD does in coordination with State, local, and Federal officials when it comes to counterterrorism is a model for the country. It has been for some time. And I don't think I need to tell you that given the potential for attack everywhere in the country, we've got a lot to learn from what is taking place here.
Number one, you guys do a great job coordinating with other law enforcement. Number two, you are just professional and exhibit excellence at all times when carrying out your job. Number three, and what we saw in Times Square, is you know how to get the community involved, and raising community awareness is absolutely critical. And as a consequence, you have saved an awful lot of lives.
And so my main message to you is that the country is proud of you. I know your mayor and your commissioner are proud of you. Your President is proud of you. And we want to make sure that we continue to work with you to get the resources that are needed for you to continue to be effective and to make sure that Federal agencies are consistently working with you with--working on all cylinders, because we want to make sure that you are getting the support you need to protect this great city.
