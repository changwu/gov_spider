    Today, President Donald J. Trump declared that a major disaster exists in the State of Alaska and ordered Federal assistance to supplement State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by an earthquake on November 30, 2018.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in the Municipality of Anchorage, Matanuska-Susitna Borough, and Kenai Peninsula Borough.
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
Federal funding also is available to State, tribal, and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the earthquake in the Municipality of Anchorage, Matanuska-Susitna Borough, and Kenai Peninsula Borough.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures in all areas within the State.
Brock Long, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Timothy B. Manner as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas.
