    I've just finished a meeting with our Ambassador and General Odierno, members of ourâ€”some of the PRTs, Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Iraq, four folks who have been spending time in Iraq. We are having success in Iraq. And one of the main reasons why is we're implementing an innovative strategy that combines our military with civilian expertise to help people at the grassroots level build a society that will lay the foundations for peace.
And so it's been a fascinating discussion, and I come away with a couple of thoughts. One, America is fortunate to have courageous souls volunteer to help develop an ally in the war against extremists, to develop a democracy in a part of the world where a lot of people said a democracy could never flourish; and secondly, that we are implementing a strategy in the Provinces which is effective.
The good thing about our military and our civilians in the PRTs, they're constantly looking at ways to make sure that we remain effective. And I have asked the press corps to come in here so I could, on TV, thank you all for what you're doing and thank you for your service. We are fortunate to have citizens such as yourself.
Thank you.
