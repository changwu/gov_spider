    Let me begin with a few brief comments on the meeting between President Carter and King Hussein this morning.
They met this morning for about 2 hours, with advisers on both sides. A list of the participants will be posted at the conclusion of this briefing. They began their talks with a strategic overview of the entire area: the consequences for regional security of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan; the situation in Iran, the Arabian Peninsula and the gulf, and Lebanon, as well as the West Bank.
Each leader discussed the measures that his government is taking to achieve the common objective of helping to preserve the stability and independence of states in the area. They also shared their analyses of current efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. They agreed—as was apparent from their statements at the arrival ceremonies this morning—that the objective of both countries is a comprehensive peace.
Their discussions, as you know, will continue tomorrow morning, and the King will be meeting with Secretary Muskie tomorrow as well.
Let me say in characterization that it is the view of the President that these discussions were both very frank and extremely cordial and constructive.
