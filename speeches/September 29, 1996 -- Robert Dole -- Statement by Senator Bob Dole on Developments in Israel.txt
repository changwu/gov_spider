    Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole today released the following statement from Bal Harbour, Florida:
"Many Americans are deeply disturbed by the violence that has erupted in the streets of our democratic friend and ally, Israel. This violence is a painful reminder that too many differences have been glossed over in earlier stages of the peace process. The fact that the leaders of Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority will be joining the Prime Minister of Israel in Washington to discuss these problems face-to-face could be, and we hope will be, a step toward ending the violence. Neither the United States nor any other party can impose a solution. The role of the United States should, as always, be that of friend and facilitator.
-- Bob Dole
