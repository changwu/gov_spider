    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement today after the Senate voted to support the children's health care legislation that President Bush has threatened to veto:
"It is morally reprehensible that President Bush is threatening to veto health care for children. This effort to expand children's health insurance is an important step to delivering the truly universal health care we so desperately need.
"Instead of threatening a senseless veto of children's healthcare, it's time for President Bush to pick on someone his own size. We can only hope, for once, President Bush will let common sense prevail -- our kids and all Americans deserve health care."
