    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)Sponsor: (Obey (D), Wisconsin)
The Administration strongly supports passage of H.R. 3385, as passed by the House, without amendment. This legislation would permit the use of previously appropriated funds to help assure fair elections in Nicaragua. It is vital to U.S. efforts to promote democracy in that country. There will be no budget impact from this legislation.
The bill is intended, in part, to promote fair and widespread voter registration, which in Nicaragua will take place only in the month of October. Therefore, the Administration urges strong bipartisan support for rapid approval of the bill.
