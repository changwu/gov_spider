    Memorandum to the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
As we continue to wind down this Nation's participation in the Vietnam conflict, increasing numbers of our veterans are returning home and entering the labor market. They have done their part and now need our help in making the transition back into the civilian economy.
Education and employment are their most immediate priorities. As a responsible employer, the Government must continue to use every means available to meet the needs of those who have served their country.
I am resolved that no returning veteran will be turned away from lack of zeal on our part. Many Federal officials have done an exemplary job in employing veterans whenever possible, even though employment opportunities have diminished. I want you to ensure that all managers, supervisors, and personnel officials in your organization accept, as a personal challenge and obligation, the responsibility for extending maximum job opportunities to returning veterans.
Veterans preference granted by law provides opportunities for hiring returning veterans. The Veterans Readjustment Appointment which I authorized in March, 1970, 1 provides an excellent additional avenue. But we must pursue with skill and determination every conceivable approach including the splitting of full-time jobs.
1 By Executive Order 11521 of March 26, 1970.
The Chairman of the Civil Service Commission will continue to provide leadership and guidance on employment of the returning veterans within the Federal Government and the Secretary of Labor will continue to direct our efforts on their behalf. Those who have given so much of themselves will not be forgotten.
