    The Nation's Capital and our entire Nation today mourn the loss of the beloved first lady of Washington and American journalism, Katharine Graham. Her legacy and influence spanned many different arenas, from powerful publisher to quiet philanthropist, to accomplished businesswoman, to Pulitzer Prize winning author, to gracious and loyal friend. Presidents come and go, and Katharine Graham knew them all. When Laura and I moved to Washington, she was the first to welcome a new President to the Nation's Capital with a dinner at her home. Mrs. Graham became a legend in her own lifetime because she was a true leader and a true lady, steely yet shy, powerful yet humble, known for her integrity and always gracious and generous to others. Her life, chronicled in her Pulitzer Prize-winning autobiography, presents a tremendous example for our generation and generations to come. Laura and I send our prayers to her children and grandchildren, to her colleagues at the Washington Post Co., and to her many friends throughout Washington, America, and the world. She will be sorely missed.
