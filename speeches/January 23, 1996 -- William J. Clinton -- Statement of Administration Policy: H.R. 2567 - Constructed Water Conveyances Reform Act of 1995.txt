    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICYThis Statement Has Been Coordinated by OMB with the Appropriate Agencies
(House)(Condit (D)CA and 9 cosponsors)
The Administration has expressed its support for relief for agricultural conveyances. The Administration would support H.R. 2567 if it were narrowed to minimize potential impacts on water quality. Specifically, the bill should be limited to: (1) the arid west; (2) agricultural conveyances; and (3) conveyances that did not previously support wildlife. Equally important, the bill should be amended so that States would continue to be required to protect the other designated uses (e.g. fishing, swimming) of the conveyance, unless such protection would "unreasonably interfere" with the intended purposes of the conveyance system.
The Administration will work in the Senate to address these concerns.
