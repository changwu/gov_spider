    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Russian Federation extending the Agreement on Mutual Fisheries Relations of May 31, 1988, with annex, as amended and extended (the "Mutual Fisheries Agreement"). The present Agreement, which was effected by an exchange of notes in Moscow on July 28 and November 23, 1998, extends the Mutual Fisheries Agreement to December 31, 2003.
In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the Russian Federation, I urge that the Congress give favorable consideration to this Agreement at an early date.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
