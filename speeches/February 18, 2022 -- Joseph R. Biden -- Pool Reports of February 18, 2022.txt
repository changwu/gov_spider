POOL: Do you think that it is wise for President Zelensky to leave Ukraine if an invasion is as imminent as the US as it is?
POTUS: That's a judgment for him to make and a termination as to whether or not — I've spoken with Zelensky a dozen times, maybe more, I don't know, and in the pursuit of a diplomatic solution, it may not be — it may be the wise choice. That's his decision.
POOL: And do you have any indication about whether President Putin has made a decision on whether to invade? Do you feel confident that he definitely made that decision already?
POTUS: As of this moment, I'm convinced he's made the decision.
POOL: There seems to be a unanimity of spirit to do, between the United States and Europe, to do some sanctions or comprehensive sanctions, but is everyone on board with the exact same sanctions that you want to do?
POTUS: Yes, there will be some slight differences, but not — they'll be more add-ons than subtractions.
POOL: President Putin is going to oversee some nuclear drills this weekend. How do you see that happen? What's your reaction to that, sir? Thank you.
POTUS: Well, I don't think he is remotely contemplating nuclear, using nuclear weapons, but I do think it's — I think he is focused on trying to convince the world that he has the ability to change the dynamics in Europe in a way that he cannot. But I don't — how much of it is a cover for just doing exercises and more than that, I just can't — it's hard to read his mind.
POOL: Mr. President, to be clear, you are convinced that President Putin is going to invade Ukraine? Is that what you just said a few moments ago?
POTUS: Yes, I did. Yes.
POOL: So is diplomacy off the table then?
POTUS: No. Until he does, diplomacy is always a possibility.
POOL: What reason do you have to believe he's considering that option at all?
POTUS: We have a significant intelligence capability. Thank you.
