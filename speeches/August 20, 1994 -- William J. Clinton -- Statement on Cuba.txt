    Over the past 2 weeks, the Government of Cuba has taken actions to provoke a mass exodus to the United States. These actions have placed thousands of Cuban citizens at risk in small boats and rafts and have had a direct impact on our national interest.
I want to thank the Cuban-American community for their courageous restraint in not taking their own boats to Cuba to fuel the exodus and thank the officials of Florida, Governor Chiles, the congressional delegation, the people from Dade County, and others, who have worked so closely with us.
Yesterday I announced steps to counter Castro's efforts to export his problems by provoking an exodus. Today I'm announcing additional actions consistent with the Cuban Democracy Act to limit the ability of the Cuban Government to accumulate foreign exchange and to enable us to expand the flow of information to the Cuban people.
Specifically, cash remittances to Cuba will no longer be permitted. Family gift packages will be limited to medicine, food, and strictly humanitarian items and transfer of funds for humanitarian purposes will require specific authorization of the Treasury Department. Second, the only charter flights permitted between Miami and Havana will be those clearly designed to accommodate legal immigrants and travel consistent with the purposes of the Cuban Democracy Act. Third, the United States will use all appropriate means to increase and amplify its international broadcasts to Cuba.
The solution to Cuba's many problems is not an uncontrolled exodus; it is freedom and democracy for Cuba.
The United States will continue to bring before the United Nations and other international organizations evidence of human rights abuses, such as the sinking of the tugboat 13th of March. Meanwhile we will pursue this course with vigor and determination.
