    Michelle and I extend our warmest wishes to Muslim communities in the United States and around the world as they celebrate Eid al-Fitr. For Muslims, Ramadan has been a time of fasting, prayer, and spiritual renewal. These past 4 weeks have also been a time to serve the less fortunate, a reminder of the obligations that people of all faiths have to each other.
In the United States, Eid al-Fitr speaks to the truth that communities of faith—including Muslim Americans—enrich our national life, strengthen our democracy, and uphold our freedoms, including the freedom of religion. That is why the we stand with people of all faiths, in the United States and around the world, in protecting and advancing this universal human right.
On behalf of the American people, we congratulate Muslim Americans and Muslims around the world on this joyous day. Eid Mubarak.
