    President Reagan has urged the Justice Department to make a thorough and exhaustive investigation of allegations concerning fraud and bribery associated with defense contracts. The President received a briefing from Secretary of Defense Carlucci on Tuesday afternoon concerning the investigation. The FBI confirmed Tuesday that an investigation has been underway for some time regarding fraudulent activity within the Department of Defense contracting process.
At the President's direction, Senator Baker called the Attorney General this morning to discuss the President's conviction that the investigation by the Department of Justice and the FBI must be pursued thoroughly and conclusively. Fraud and abuse will not be tolerated. We trust the Bureau to leave no stone unturned in pursuing this investigation.
