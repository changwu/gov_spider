    Dear XXXXX@05:
Pursuant to section 1376(c)(2)(B) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 ("the Act") (Public Law 100 - 418; 102 Stat. 1221), I am hereby transmitting my report that finds that substantial progress has been made in telecommunications trade talks conducted under section 1375 of the Act with the European Community (EC) and Korea and contains the reasons why an extension of the negotiating period with the EC and Korea is necessary.
Sincerely,
George Bush
