    Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. announced the launch of four new campaign coalitions to promote President Trump's fight for economic empowerment, quality education, and law and order. The coalitions, 'Indian Voices for Trump,' 'Hindu Voices for Trump,' 'Sikhs for Trump,' and 'Muslim Voices for Trump,' will engage community members nationwide to fight against Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' socialist agenda and ensure prosperity and security for four more years.
"These four campaign coalitions represent groups that strongly support the values of President Trump and the Republican Party: freedom, democracy, and the American Dream," said Ashley Hayek, Trump 2020 Director of Coalitions. "As Joe Biden promises to impose high taxes, undermine family values, and make our streets less safe, we stand with President Trump and his mission to Make America Great Again."
