    On Memorial Day, the American people unite to pay tribute to the many brave men and women who have given their lives in the service of their country. We pause to reflect upon the courage and sacrifice of those who responded when their nation called, who left home and family to take up arms on distant shores to ensure to posterity the blessings of peace and freedom. We render our thanks and express our gratitude, for we have not forgotten what they did or the price they paid.
On this Memorial Day, a great American army is in the field in Vietnam, and other American forces stand guard on the frontiers of freedom throughout the world. These young men and women are responding just as bravely today as their forefathers did on previous occasions when the call to duty came. Their sense of purpose, their personal courage, their professionalism, and their loyalty are an inspiration to all.
For the heroism and sacrifice displayed by the American fighting man, past and present, we are indeed filled with pride and gratitude.
