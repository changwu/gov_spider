    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Hayes (D) IL and 88 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3042 because the bill's proposed programs duplicate programs already authorized under Chapters 1 and 2 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act and the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act, and are therefore unnecessary.
