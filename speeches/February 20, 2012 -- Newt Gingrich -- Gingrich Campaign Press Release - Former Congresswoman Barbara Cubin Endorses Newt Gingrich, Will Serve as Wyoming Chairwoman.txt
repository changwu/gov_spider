    Atlanta, GA â€” Former Wyoming Congresswoman Barbara Cubin today endorsed Newt Gingrich for president and agreed to serve as the Newt 2012 Wyoming Chairwoman.
"Newt can change Washington because he's done it before. He can balance the budget because he's done if before. And he can help the American people create millions of new jobs because he's done it before," said Congresswoman Cubin. "These challenging times call for bold solutions and courageous leadership that Newt has provided in the past and will do again. I believe Newt is the right person at the right time to lead America towards greater economic growth and prosperity, and I encourage my fellow Wyomingites to support him in the upcoming caucus."
"Barbara is a strong conservative and I'm honored to have her leading our campaign in Wyoming," said Newt Gingrich. "I look forward to working with Barbara as we continue to build a national team committed to bringing real change to Washington, DC. We need a bold Reagan conservative to defeat President Obama this fall, and Wyoming will play a critical role in helping nominate a bold conservative as our Republican nominee."
Cubin, the first woman from Wyoming elected to Congress, served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1994 to 2008. Before that, she served the people of Wyoming in both the Wyoming House of Representatives and the Wyoming Senate.
