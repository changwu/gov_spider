RICHARD LUGAR (R-Ind.)
Representatives

Since the first congressional delegation went to the People's Republic of China in 1972, there have been over 70 Members of Congress who have visited China.
The present delegation was scheduled to visit China last November, but the continuation of the congressional session forced postponement of the original timing.
The exchange relationship fulfills that part of the Shanghai Communiqu√© in which both sides pledged to foster broader understanding and engage in cultural and scientific exchanges.
