    Former Secretary of Education Rod Paige today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's plan to reform education:  
"When our students have the opportunity to succeed, America succeeds. Mitt Romney's education reform plan — one of the key pillars of his Plan for a Stronger Middle Class — will help ensure students receive the first-rate education they deserve and help prepare them for jobs in the global economy. As governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney helped expand school choice, encouraged teacher accountability, created more college opportunities for students, and presided over an education system that led the nation. That's the kind of leadership students and parents need in the White House."
