    The United States and Russia have established a joint commission to investigate unresolved cases of prisoners of war and missing in action dating from the Second World War, including the Korean and Vietnam conflicts. The creation of this commission underscores the commitment of both the United States and Russia to work together in a spirit of friendship to uncover the fate of missing servicemen on both sides. This effort symbolizes the determination of the administration to resolve outstanding issues from the cold war period and is another step in developing our new cooperative relationship with Russia.
Former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Malcolm Toon has been designated the President's representative and Chairman of the U.S. delegation to this commission. The commission also will include Senators John Kerry and Robert Smith and Congressmen Pete Peterson and John Miller. The Russian delegation will be chaired by Gen. Dmitri Volkogonov, a senior adviser to President Yeltsin. The first meeting of the joint commission will be held March 26 - 28 in Moscow.
