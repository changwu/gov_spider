    I am delighted that Congress has now approved the conference report on the Americans with Disabilities Act. I am looking forward with great pleasure to signing this important civil rights legislation. This is a great day in the history of our country because for the first time Americans with disabilities will enjoy full civil rights protection with respect to employment, transportation, places of public accommodation, public services, and communications. Further, it is proof that individual rights can be given full and necessary protection without undue regulatory burdens. In this month of the 214th anniversary of the independence of our nation, this legislation will serve as a declaration of independence for millions of persons with disabilities in this country.
