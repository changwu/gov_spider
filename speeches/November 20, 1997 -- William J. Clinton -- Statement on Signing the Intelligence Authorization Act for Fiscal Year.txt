    Today I have signed into law S. 858, the "Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998." The Act authorizes appropriations for the intelligence-related activities of the United States during fiscal year 1998.
This Act results from the hard work of many people in the Administration and in the Congress who are dedicated to both a strong national intelligence capability and effective congressional oversight.
I strongly endorse section 307, the basic objective of which is to ensure that, insofar as possible, the U.S. Government provides all relevant information to U.S. citizens (and their family members, as appropriate) who are the victims of violent crimes committed abroad. So that this provision cannot be construed to detract from my constitutional authority and responsibility to protect national security and other privileged information as I determine necessary, and so that the provision does not require the release of information that is properly classified, I direct that it be interpreted consistent with my constitutional authority and with applicable laws and executive orders.
