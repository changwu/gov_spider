    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Enclosed please find the blueprint for my program to provide immediate assistance to help certain Medicare beneficiaries buy prescription drugs. I look forward to working with the Congress to enact these principles into law and to working together on comprehensive Medicare reform.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
