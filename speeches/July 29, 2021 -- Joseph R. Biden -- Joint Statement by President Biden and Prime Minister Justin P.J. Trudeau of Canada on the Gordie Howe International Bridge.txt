    As the importance of infrastructure becomes clearer and clearer, our two countries have long been partnering on a once-in-a generation project of critical importance: the Gordie Howe International Bridge. By creating the first seamless highway-to-highway connection between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, Michigan—the location of one of North America's busiest trade corridors—this new crossing, currently under construction, will for decades serve to secure and spur bi-national economic growth. Canada is financing the project, and is working hand-in-hand with the State of Michigan (also co-owner of the Bridge), the Federal Highway Administration, a private-sector partner, and many other partners towards a scheduled completion by the end of 2024. As a top infrastructure priority for both our governments, we're committed to continuing our support to ensure the project's state-of-the-art ports of entry are fully funded so vehicles can begin crossing the architecturally stunning cable-stayed structure once completed for the benefit of our shared prosperity.
