    Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:) 
Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order (the "order") with respect to transnational criminal organizations that takes additional steps to deal with the national emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal organizations declared in Executive Order 13581 of July 24, 2011, in view of the evolution of these organizations as well as the increasing sophistication of their activities.
The authorities in Executive Order 13581 are delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and Secretary of State, and the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to implement the order. All executive departments and agencies are directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement the order.
I am enclosing a copy of the order I have issued.
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
