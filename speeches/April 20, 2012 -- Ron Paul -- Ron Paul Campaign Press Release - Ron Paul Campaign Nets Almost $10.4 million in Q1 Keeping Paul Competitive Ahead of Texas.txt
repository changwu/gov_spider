LAKE JACKSON, Texas — The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign announced today that it raised nearly $10.4 million in the first fundraising quarter of 2012, providing it with ample resources to sustain a 50-state race with establishment-choice Mitt Romney as well as compete decisively in Congressman Paul's home state of Texas.
For the fundraising quarter ending March 31, 2012, or Q1, total campaign contributions approached $10.4 million. In addition to the impressive eight-figure fundraising total for the quarter, the campaign is announcing that total contributions for the month of March alone exceeded $2.6 million. Other details include total cash on hand of nearly $1.8 million and zero debt, as is customary. Especially noteworthy is that these figures exclude the nearly $1.4 million raised during the campaign's Tax Day money bomb, or online fundraising event.
"Total contributions of $10.4 million in Q1, including details such as $1.8 million cash on hand and more money bomb cash in the pipeline, amounts to excellent news as these resources fuel our effective delegate-attainment strategy. These ample funds also will help us compete even harder in Texas, where Ron Paul is the only Texan, veteran, and authentic conservative running," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
"I want to thank Ron Paul's contributors, who are almost exclusively small-donation supporters and who continue putting their trust in Dr. Paul, his message, and his organization," added Mr. Benton.
