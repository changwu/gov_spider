    DERRY, N.H. â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday expressed concern about President Barack Obama's decision to dispatch U.S. special operations forces to Syria to help battle the Islamic State, a spokesman said.
"Sen. Sanders expressed concern about the United States being drawn into the quagmire of the Syrian civil war which could lead to perpetual warfare in that region," spokesman Michael Briggs said. "The senator believes that the crisis in Syria will be solved diplomatically, not militarily."
