    Harris to Launch "Iowa Teachers for Kamala" in Waukee on Wednesday
Today, 100 Iowa teachers are announcing their support of Senator Kamala Harris. Harris herself will join teachers from across Iowa for the launch of "Iowa Teachers for Kamala" at an event in Waukee on Wednesday, November 27. Harris has long received broad support from Iowa's teachers after releasing the first policy of her campaign to give Iowa teachers a $12,200 raise. Harris has highlighted the important role that educators play in raising our children at events in Iowa throughout her campaign.
"I am honored to have the support of teachers from across Iowa and grateful every day for the work they do to help raise our children," Harris said. "Conversations with Iowa's teachers helped inform my first policy of this campaign - the largest federal investment in teachers in our nation's history. Educators here in Iowa and across the country have made me a better candidate and I'm grateful to have them on my team.
These educators are from across Iowa, and teach everything from kids in pre-school to students in college. They include math teachers, special education teachers, choir teachers, teacher librarians, professors, and more. However, this diverse group of educators are united in their enthusiastic support of Harris and her plans to fight for education justice. All 100 have been invited to join Harris in person for the launch in Waukee.
"Senator Harris has centered the importance of public schools and teachers in her campaign like no other candidate," said Amy Johnson, a second grade teacher in the Keokuk Community School District. "Her plan to pay teachers what they deserve isn't just about giving teachers like me a raise, it's about so much more. It's about recognizing the value that teachers and educators have in our communities, and it's about recognizing those of us who work second, and even third or fourth jobs to make the ends meet, who pay out of pocket so our students have school supplies, or who took on student debt in order to work in a classroom, doing what we love. Kamala sees the challenges we face and I absolutely trust her to fight for us and to have our backs when she is president."
"The thing that impresses me most about Senator Harris is that she is really and truly for the people," said Tina Martinez, a first grade teacher in the Vinton-Shellsburg Community School District. "I've spent my whole life in public education. I know what it's like to work for over 30 years but still struggle to make ends meet, or to be able to afford health care. Nevertheless, I love my job â€“ and I know that Kamala will always fight for the middle class and for teachers like me because she truly means what she is saying. Every time I've seen her, I can tell that she is there for the people. We need someone with integrity who will fight for the American people. That person is Senator Kamala Harris."
