  A Proclamation

Bread, the staff of life, both gives and symbolizes sustenance. Until recent decades the American people baked their bread at home, and today many families enjoy this tradition, not simply for its wholesome nutrition but also for its rich association with the well-being and security of family life.
Baking bread at home provides a nutritious and delicious food and uses many products of American agriculture, such as wheat, rye, corn, dairy products, sugar, eggs, and other ingredients. Beside contributing to the physical needs of the family, baking bread at home can nourish its strength and unity as well, and teach and tell much about American traditions and values.
In recognition of the value of baking bread in the home, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 163, has designated November 1987 as "National Family Bread Baking Month" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this month.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of November 1987 as National Family Bread Baking Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twelfth.

RONALD REAGAN
