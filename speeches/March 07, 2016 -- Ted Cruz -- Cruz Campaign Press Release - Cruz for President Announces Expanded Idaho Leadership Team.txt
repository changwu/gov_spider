HOUSTON, Texas – Today, the Cruz for President campaign announced dozens of new Idaho leaders on the eve of the Gem State's primary election tomorrow. The additional Cruz leaders include Rep. Raul Labrador (R, ID-1), who becomes the co-chairman of the Idaho campaign with State Treasurer Ron Crane, as well as dozens of additional regional and county chairs. Ted Cruz held rallies over the weekend in Coeur d'Alene and Boise, drawing thousands of Idahoans.
"We are excited to have such a strong field of grassroots supporters, activists, elected officials, and volunteers in Idaho standing by our campaign heading into Election Day," said Cruz. "Republican voters in Idaho know that we are the only campaign that can beat Donald Trump because we are the only campaign that has repeatedly beaten Donald Trump. I am encouraged by the thousands of courageous conservatives who attended our Idaho events this past weekend and our grassroots army in the state."
"I am proud to join Ted Cruz as a co-chairman of his campaign, and I strongly urge all conservatives and liberty-loving voters in Idaho to vote for Senator Cruz in tomorrow's primary," said Rep. Labrador. "As a member and founder of the House Freedom Caucus and the former Western Chair for Sen. Rand Paul's presidential campaign, it is clear that the time is now to unite conservatives behind the best candidate our party can put forward to defeat Hillary Clinton in November. Along with our full leadership team, my fellow co-chair, State Treasurer Ron Crane, as well as our Idaho State Director Norm Semanko, we will be competitive in Idaho on Tuesday."
