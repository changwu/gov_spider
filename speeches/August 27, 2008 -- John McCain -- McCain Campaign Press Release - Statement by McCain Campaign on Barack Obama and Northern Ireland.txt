    ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, the McCain presidential campaign issued the following statement from Brian Rogers, McCain 2008 spokesman, regarding Barack Obama's statement questioning the necessity of the U.S. Special Envoy for Northern Ireland:
"Barack Obama, once again demonstrating his total lack of experience and profoundly poor judgment on matters of foreign policy, has issued a statement questioning 'whether a special U.S. envoy for Northern Ireland continues to be necessary.' The special U.S. envoy was first appointed by President Clinton and has been critical to fostering peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. John McCain is committed to maintaining the special U.S. envoy for Northern Ireland and that commitment has been enshrined in the 2008 Republican Platform. That Senator Obama would be willing to toss aside one of the signature diplomatic accomplishments of the Clinton administration and put the progress in Northern Ireland at risk is only further evidence that he is simply not ready to lead." 
Background:
In A Campaign Statement, Barack Obama Stated That He Would Review The Necessity Of A U.S. Special Envoy To Northern Ireland. "Barack Obama could abolish the post of US special envoy to Northern Ireland if he becomes president as he responds to the Taoiseach's call for a review of the relationship between Ireland and the US. Irish Voice publisher Niall O'Dowd, who supported Mrs Clinton in the Democratic primaries, said the statement was unclear but warned that any weakening of US input in the North would be 'completely unacceptable' to Irish-Americans. 'A special envoy continues to be vital and necessary,' he said. 'Wholehearted American support and involvement will also be vital in resolving the upcoming issues of policing and devolution.'"
