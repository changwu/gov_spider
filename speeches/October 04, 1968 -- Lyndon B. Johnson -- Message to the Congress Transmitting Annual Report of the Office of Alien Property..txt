    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit the Annual Report of the Office of Alien Property for Fiscal Year 1967.
Not all government agencies grow and expand. Some effectively perform their mission and decrease in size.
The Office of Alien Property is such an agency. As the property under its custody diminished, its independent status was terminated. Today only $64 million remain under the control of the Office, and its duties are performed by personnel of the Department of Justice.
I commend this report to your attention.
