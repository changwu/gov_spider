    Mr. Greeley and fellow Harvard men:
I need hardly say what a very real pleasure it has been to greet you this afternoon, but Mr. Greeley spoke of Harvard as winning the West. My pet theory has been that the very best thing that can happen to Harvard is to have the West win it, and I hail every Harvard club west of the Alleghany, even more than I do those east of there, for I feel that Harvard's mission in the country can be incalculably furthered if it has a sufficient amount of the Western blood that does things in it, and for that reason I am particularly pleased to greet the Harvard Club of Chicago again under as pleasant circumstances as I have ever had the pleasure of greeting them before. Good-bye and good luck to you.
