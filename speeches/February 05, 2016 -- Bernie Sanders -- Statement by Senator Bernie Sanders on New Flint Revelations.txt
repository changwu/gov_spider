    EXETER, N.H. â€” U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement on Friday after it was reported that Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder's administration knew a recent outbreak of Legionnaires' disease was potentially connected to the water crisis in Flint:
"The latest revelation about the public health crisis in Flint is horrifying. It is unacceptable that anyone on Gov. Snyder's team would not act swiftly at even the slightest chance that residents were becoming seriously ill from the drinking water in Flint. Because of the conduct by Gov. Snyder's administration and his refusal to take responsibility, families will suffer from lead poisoning for the rest of their lives. Children in Flint will be plagued with brain damage and other health problems.
"Not only should Gov. Snyder resign immediately, the Justice Department must hold everyone accountable who knew about this crisis and did nothing. The federal government needs to take every possible measure to ensure that the people of Flint get clean drinking water as soon as possible."
