So we're excited to announce she's just endorsed Marco!
Here's what she had to say:
Marco Rubio is a compelling leader who can unite the country around conservative principles that will improve the lives of all Americans. The stakes for our great country are too high — and the differences between the candidates too great — for me to remain neutral in this race. I wholeheartedly trust Marco to keep us safe and ensure a better tomorrow, and I look forward to campaigning with him later this week.
New Mexico doesn't vote until June 7, but Governor Martinez will be campaigning with Marco before then.
In fact, she'll be joining Marco for a rally in Jacksonville this Saturday, March 5. Go here to RSVP if you're in the area!
