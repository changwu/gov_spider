As First Lady, she chose not only to lead with her distinctive style and poise, but also to take a stand on tough issues, such as the prevention of recreational drug abuse.
For conservatives, she has been a powerful living link to her husband's legacy as one of the greatest modern presidents. Through her work with the Reagan Library, she has been active in extending the impact of his leadership and message to a new generation.
It was an honor to have met Mrs. Reagan when I spoke at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in 2011. She went out of her way to warmly welcome Jeanette and me. She will be sorely missed by those who knew her, and forever remembered by a grateful nation.
