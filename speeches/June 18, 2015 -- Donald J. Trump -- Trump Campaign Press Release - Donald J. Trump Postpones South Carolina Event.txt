(Bluffton, SC) June 18, 2015- Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump today announced that he is postponing his scheduled visit to the Lowcountry of South Carolina due to the "shockingly sad" events that occurred in Charleston.
"The tragic events that occurred on Wednesday evening should be our nation's primary focus for the foreseeable future," stated Mr. Trump. "This is a time for healing, not politics."
Mr. Trump, who announced his candidacy for President on Tuesday in New York, is in the midst of a multi-state tour that includes stops in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. He was scheduled to appear before a capacity crowd in the residential community of Sun City in Bluffton, South Carolina.
"I look forward to returning to South Carolina and continuing our discussion on how we can best move our country forward," said Trump. "Until that time our prayers and deepest condolences are with the people of Charleston and the families of those who have been torn apart by this senseless act of violence and hate."
The Trump campaign announced that the South Carolina event will be rescheduled in the near future.
