    Vice President Bush has made an outstanding selection of Senator Quayle as his running mate. Dan was first elected to the Senate as part of the Reagan-Bush team in 1980. He's a proven vote-getter. I've worked closely with Dan on a number of issues. He has been a leader in the Senate for a strong national defense, particularly the Strategic Defense Initiative, and proponent of innovative job creation programs. His talent, intellect, family, and energy will be valuable assets during the campaign, and I know he will be a great Vice President. I salute Vice President Bush's selection. George has made an excellent choice.
