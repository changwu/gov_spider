    AUSTIN â€” Mark Miner, RickPerry.org's national press secretary, made the following statement on Mitt Romney's jobs speech today:
"As Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney failed to create a pro-jobs environment and failed to institute many of the reforms he now claims to support."
"Among all the candidates for President, Gov. Rick Perry has the strongest record of creating a climate of job creation by limiting taxes, burdensome regulations and the size and scope of government. Gov. Perry's conservative leadership helped Texans create 40 percent of all the net new jobs created in America since June 2009. While President Obama has failed our economy, Gov. Perry has the strongesEditt pro-jobs record and best philosophy to get America working again."
