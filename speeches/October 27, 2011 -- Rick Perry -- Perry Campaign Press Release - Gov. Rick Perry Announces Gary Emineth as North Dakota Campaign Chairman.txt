    AUSTIN - Texas Gov. Rick Perry today named Gary Emineth as campaign chairman and Perry state network coordinator for the state of North Dakota. Emineth will take the lead in supporting the campaign's grassroots efforts throughout the state.
"I am honored to have the support of Gary and so many people across North Dakota who will help me share my vision to get America working again, and specifically get our nation on the path to energy independence," said Gov. Perry. "North Dakota's valuable energy resources will play an important role in our effort to grow American jobs as we eliminate the bureaucratic red tape from Washington that is strangling our ability to harness our own domestic energy. I look forward to running a solid campaign in this state that will set us on the path to victory."
Emineth is a GOP activist with extensive experience working for the North Dakota (ND) GOP, serving as the executive director from 1984-1989 and the finance director from 2006-2007. He also served as the ND GOP State Chairman and member of the Republican National Committee from 2007-2010, and has played a vital role in the election of GOP candidates across the state.
"I'm looking forward to being a part of Gov. Perry's campaign for president," said Emineth. "Rick Perry is the candidate with the record and experience our county needs, and I'm excited to help Gov. Perry bring his vision to get America working again to North Dakota."
