    I am pleased to announce that we have been able to reach an agreement with the United Kingdom today which will make possible a wide range of low fares.
Budget and standby fares will be available on scheduled flights between the United Kingdom and 14 United States gateway cities. These cities are: Anchorage, Alaska; Atlanta, (Ga.; Boston, Mass.; Chicago, Ill.; Dallas/Ft. Worth, Tex.; Detroit, Mich.; Houston, Tex.; Los Angeles, Calif.; Miami, Fla.; New York City, N.Y.; Philadelphia, Pa.; San Francisco, Calif.; Seattle, Wash.; and Washington/Baltimore.
This agreement also liberalizes charter rules and ensures charter rate freedom. All this will encourage air travel between the United States and the United Kingdom.
Taken together, these two agreements constitute a major step forward in implementing our key objective in international aviationâ€”to provide the traveling public with a wide choice of low fares on scheduled flights.
The agreement also demonstrates once again that we can work out difficulties with our most important aviation partner to the mutual benefit of airlines and consumers in both the United States and the United Kingdom.
