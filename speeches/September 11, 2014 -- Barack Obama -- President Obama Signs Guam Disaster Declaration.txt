    On September 10, the President declared a major disaster exists in the Territory of Guam and ordered federal aid to supplement territory and local recovery efforts in the area affected by Tropical Storm Halong during the period of July 28-31, 2014.
Federal funding is available to the territory and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by Tropical Storm Halong.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures for the Territory of Guam.
W. Craig Fugate, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Kenneth K. Suiso as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
FEMA said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
