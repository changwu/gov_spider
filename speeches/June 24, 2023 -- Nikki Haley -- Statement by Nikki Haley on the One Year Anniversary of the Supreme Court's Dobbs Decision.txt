    WASHINGTON D.C. â€“ Presidential candidate Nikki Haley released the following statement on the one-year anniversary of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision.
"The Dobbs decision was a victory for life and democracy. As a result, states have passed life-saving laws and helped promote a culture of life across the nation. The fight is far from over. There should be broad consensus at the federal level to end late-term abortion, make adoption easier, support pregnant mothers, and safeguard religious liberties. More must be done, and as president, I will never stop trying to save as many babies and support as many mothers as we can."
