Boston, MA â€“ Today, Romney for President launched its newest television ad, "Choice: Judgment." The ad highlights the very important choice voters will have to make when it comes to fighting crime in the United States. While Governors Romney and Huckabee both believe in protecting life and traditional marriage, they have very different crime records. In Massachusetts, Governor Romney fought for tougher penalties to combat methamphetamines and respected juries' decisions by not pardoning a single criminal. In Arkansas, Governor Huckabee granted 1,033 pardons and commutations, including 12 convicted murderers. This was more clemencies than the previous three governors combined. Governor Huckabee also reduced penalties for manufacturing methamphetamines.
The ad will begin airing tomorrow as part of the campaign's rotation in Iowa. Script and viewing links are below.

AD FACTS: Script For "Choice: Judgment" (TV:30):
GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: "I'm Mitt Romney and I approve this message." ANNOUNCER: "Two pro-life Governors. Both support a Constitutional amendment to protect traditional marriage."
- Governor Romney Has Been Recognized For His Pro-Life Leadership In Massachusetts. "Mitt Romney was a great Governor, who served with honor and distinction. But most importantly, he was a pro-life Governor. He vetoed a number of pro-abortion pieces of legislation and made many pro-life appointments. He was always there for us. He's a busy man these days and we are extra fortunate that he and his wife Ann could be with us. Governor, you have been an inspirational leader in many ways. And if I may say so, Mitt, you're looking very presidential. Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming our friend, Governor Mitt Romney, to the podium as our 2007 Mullins Award Winner for Outstanding Political Leadership." (Kevin Jourdain, Remarks, Agawam, MA, 5/10/07)
- Governor Romney Supports A Constitutional Amendment Defending Traditional Marriage. "While Romney is willing to generally leave it to states to decide how to set up health care coverage plans, he said it shouldn't be left to states to decide same-sex marriage issues. 'It's a status that lasts a lifetime. And so, if somebody is married in one state and they move to another state, that status travels with them. And so, if you have gay marriage in one state, whether you want it or not, you have gay marriage in all states,' Romney told reporters after speaking at a Greenville, S.C., restaurant." (Amy Lorentzen, "Iowa Gay Marriage Ruling Stirs 2008 Race," The Associated Press, 9/1/07)

ANNOUNCER: "The difference? Romney got tough on drugs like meth."
- Gov. Romney Worked To Prevent Methamphetamine Abuse From Becoming A Problem In Massachusetts. "As the use of the illicit drug methamphetamine continues to sweep through the Midwest and the West Coast, the Romney administration is taking steps to prevent the drug from becoming a crisis in Massachusetts. Legislation filed by Gov. Mitt Romney would heighten the penalties for the possession of methamphetamine as well as toughen penalties for the possession of the chemicals used to produce it. It also would allow the state to improve its tracking system of the sale of those chemicals." (Erik Arvidson, "Romney Acts To Boost Meth Penalties," The [Pittsfield, MA] Berkshire Eagle, 8/15/05)
- Gov. Romney's Legislation Included Treatment For Addicts And Tougher Penalties For Dealers. "The first step called for in the blueprint is the creation of a new council to bring together the 13 state agencies that provide substance-abuse services. Each receives a portion of the $250 million the state spends each year on treatment and services, but there is no coordination among them, Healey said. Gov. Mitt Romney yesterday signed an executive order creating the council, of which Healey will be chairwoman. Among other recommendations, the plan calls for passage of $9.1 million in supplemental spending to expand detox and treatment services, passage of a bill to crack down on the manufacture and distribution of methamphetamine, and real-time tracking of heroin overdoses to help identify regions with the greatest need." (Julie Mehegan, "State Tackles Drug Abuse," The [Pittsfield, MA] Berkshire Eagle, 5/16/05)
- The Legislation Toughened Sentencing For Meth Manufactures. "As with heroin, methamphetamine is cheap to produce and easy to purchase. The bill would criminalize the possession of 45 kinds of drugs considered 'precursor' drugs if the person has the intent to produce methamphetamine. The punishment would be either 2 1/2 years in jail or five years in prison." (Erik Arvidson, "Romney Acts To Boost Meth Penalties," The [Pittsfield, MA] Berkshire Eagle, 8/15/05)

ANNOUNCER: "He never pardoned a single criminal."
- As Governor, Romney Denied All Requests For Pardon And Commutation. "During the four years Romney was in office, 100 requests for commutations and 172 requests for pardons were filed in the state. All were denied. 'Governor Romney's view is that it would take a compelling set of circumstances to set aside the punishment and guilt resulting from a criminal trial,' said Romney aide Eric Fehrnstrom, who added he was not familiar with Circosta's case. 'The power to pardon should only be used in extraordinary circumstances.'" ("Romney Touts Record Of Never Granting Pardons," The Associated Press, 6/12/07)

ANNOUNCER: "And Mike Huckabee? He granted 1,033 pardons and commutations, including 12 convicted murderers. Huckabee granted more clemencies than the previous three governors combined."
- Huckabee Granted 1,033 Pardons And Commutations, More Than Twice As Many As His Three Predecessors COMBINED. "As governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee had a hand in twice as many pardons and commutations as his three predecessors combined. ... Huckabee granted 1,033 pardons and commutations in his 10 1/2 years as governor of Arkansas. The acts of clemency benefited the stepson of a staff member, murderers who worked at the governor's mansion, a rock star and inmates who received good words from their pastors. ... During his years as governor, Huckabee granted clemency an average of about once every four days. Huckabee's successor, Mike Beebe, has issued 40 so far this year, fewer than one a week. Bill Clinton, Frank White and [Jim Guy] Tucker granted 507 clemencies in the 17 1/2 years they served as governor." (Andrew DeMillo, "Huckabee Pardons Under Scrutiny," The Associated Press, 12/10/07)
- Huckabee Commuted 12 Sentences For Murderers. "During his tenure, Huckabee has been criticized for his use of the clemency powers. Through April, the total sentence commutations issued by Huckabee were 146, including 12 for murderers, according to records at the secretary of state's office. A clemency can be either a sentence commutation or a pardon for someone who has already discharged his sentence, such as in Richards' situation." (Seth Blomeley, "It's A Gas, Gas, Gas: Rocker Seeks Pardon For '75 Fordyce Arrest," Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, 7/19/06)

ANNOUNCER: "Even reduced penalties for manufacturing methamphetamine. On crime. The difference is judgment."
- Huckabee Supported A Measure To Reduce Mandatory Minimums For Methamphetamine Makers. "Methamphetamine makers could shorten their mandatory time in prison with good behavior under legislation approved Tuesday by the Arkansas House. The bill, by Sen. Jim Luker, D-Wynne, is part of a legislative package intended to help control the state's burgeoning prison population and is supported by state prison officials, the state prosecutors' association and Gov. Mike Huckabee." (Melissa Nelson, "Arkansas House Approves Bill To Reduce Mandatory Prison Time Of Meth Offenders," The Associated Press, 3/8/05)
- March 21, 2005: Huckabee Signed SB 387 Into Law. "Also Monday, Gov. Mike Huckabee signed into law legislation allowing imprisoned methamphetamine abusers serving time under the state's mandatory 70-percent rule to shorten their sentences with good behavior." (Melissa Nelson, "Senate OKs Higher Ed Funding Formulas," The Associated Press, 3/21/05)
