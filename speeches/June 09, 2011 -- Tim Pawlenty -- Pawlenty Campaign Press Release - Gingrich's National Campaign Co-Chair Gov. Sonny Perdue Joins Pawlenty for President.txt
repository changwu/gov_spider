    MINNEAPOLIS - Former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty's presidential campaign announced today that former Governor Sonny Perdue will join its national efforts. Until today, Gov. Perdue was Newt Gingrich's national campaign co-chair.
"Tim Pawlenty is a great man, he was a phenomenal governor, and he is the person I now believe stands the greatest chance of defeating President Obama. He is the only candidate who has laid out a real plan to grow the American economy, and his track record in Minnesota is proof he's the right man for the job," Perdue said.
"I am thrilled Governor Perdue is joining my campaign. He is revered among governors as a thoughtful, sincere man whose faith, character and passion for good policy is second to none. He's a dear friend and with his help we're going to continue to build momentum to win the nomination and ultimately the presidency," Pawlenty said.
