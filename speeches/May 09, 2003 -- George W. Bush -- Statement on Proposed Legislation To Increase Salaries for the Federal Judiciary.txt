    I am pleased to support legislation introduced in the Senate this week that would increase the annual salaries of Justices and judges of the United States. This bipartisan legislation, S. 1023, responds to the recommendation of the Chief Justice and the Judicial Conference that salary increases be enacted for the Judiciary.
