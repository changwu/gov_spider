(Senate)
(Sen. Merkley, D-OR, and 55 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S.Â 815 because the bill would establish lasting and comprehensive Federal protections against employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. This bipartisan legislation is necessary to ensure that strong Federal protections exist for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender workers no matter where they live. Workers should not fear being fired from their jobs, harassed at their workplaces, or otherwise denied the chance to earn a living for themselves and their families, simply because of sexual orientation or gender identity. This legislation would, for the first time in this Nation's history, make explicit in Federal law such guarantees, which are consistent with America's core values of fairness and equality. Passage of this bill is long overdue.
The Administration commends the Senate's bipartisan efforts and urges swift passage of the legislation.
