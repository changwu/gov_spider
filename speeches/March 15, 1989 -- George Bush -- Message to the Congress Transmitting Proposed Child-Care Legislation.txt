    To the Congress of the United States:
I am submitting the enclosed child care legislative proposals prepared by the Secretaries of the Treasury and Health and Human Services for consideration by the Congress. I urge the Congress to act promptly on these important proposals.
The proposals, entitled the "Working Family Child Care Assistance Act of 1989" and the "Head Start Amendments of 1989," are a key part of my commitment to assist parents in making critical decisions about their children's care.
George Bush
The White House,
