    Michelle and I are delighted to congratulate the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, her Majesty the Queen and the royal family, and all the people of the United Kingdom on the birth of the Royal Princess. On behalf of the American people, we wish the Duke and Duchess and their son George much joy and happiness on the occasion of the arrival of the newest member of their family.
