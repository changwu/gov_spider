    President Trump's re-election campaign is launching a new television ad this week touting the Great American Comeback amid four months of record-breaking job growth, including nearly 1.4 million jobs added in August. The President’s record on the economy stands in stark contrast to Joe Biden’s call to shut down the economy again if he is elected. While Joe Biden and the radical left threaten to kill countless American jobs and businesses, President Trump's administration is pioneering new ways to save American lives and prosperity.
'Great American Comeback' is part of a multi-state buy that will launch this week in North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, as well as on national cable.
