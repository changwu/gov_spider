    Welcome to tee-ball in Ghana. Yes, we're glad you're here. Thanks for coming. I am so honored to be here for—to witness the game between—I want to make sure I get this right—the Little Dragons and the Little Saints.
Yes, I appreciate the Secretary of State coming, Condoleezza Rice. Madam Secretary, thank you. I appreciate very much the Ambassador joining us. Madam Ambassador, thank you. And we got a Major League scout here—yes, Jimmie Lee Solomon from Major League Baseball. He's looking for some talent. Good to see you, Jimmie Lee.
Listen, thank you all for letting us come by. I'm very excited about watching this game. I do want to thank your coaches. Thanks for coaching. Thanks for teaching people the importance of teamwork. I like baseball a lot, so thanks for teaching them how to play baseball too.
And are you ready to start? Are you going to give me that ball? All right, come on over. This is the first ball. Ready? You want to put it on the tee? Play ball.
