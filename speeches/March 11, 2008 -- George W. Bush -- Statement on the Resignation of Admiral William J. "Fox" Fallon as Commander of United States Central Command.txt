    Admiral William Fallon has served our Nation with great distinction for 40 years. He is an outstanding sailor, and he made history as the first naval officer to serve as commander of Central Command.
From the Horn of Africa to the streets of Baghdad to the mountains of Afghanistan, the soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen of Central Command are vital to the global war on terror. During his tenure at CENTCOM, Admiral Fallon's job has been to help ensure that America's military forces are ready to meet the threats of an often troubled region of the world, and he deserves considerable credit for progress that has been made there, especially in Iraq and Afghanistan.
With service in Vietnam and as Vice Chief of Naval Operations, commander of Pacific Command, and many other positions, Admiral Fallon has served this country with honor, determination, and commitment. I thank his wife Mary, who knows that military service involves the whole family, and I wish them all the best as they begin the next chapter in their lives.
