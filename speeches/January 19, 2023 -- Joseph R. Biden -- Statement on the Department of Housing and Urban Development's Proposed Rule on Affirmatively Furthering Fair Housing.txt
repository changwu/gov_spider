    Fifty-five years after its passage and signing, we are still working to realize the Fair Housing Act's promise to end the legacy and persistence of discrimination and inequities in our housing system. That's why during my first week in office, I directed the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to implement the Fair Housing Act's requirement to affirmatively further fair housing.
Today Secretary Fudge and HUD put forward a proposed rule that takes meaningful steps to overcome patterns of segregation in housing and give every American family a fair shot. It restores and builds upon our work during the Obama-Biden administration to fully implement the Fair Housing Act. And, it sends a clear message to communities across the country that just saying they won't discriminate isn't enough. Communities must take action to aggressively combat and end racial discrimination in our housing system.
This is an important step forward to ensure every community does its part to expand equity in housing and to fulfill our promise of a nation of opportunity and equity for all.
