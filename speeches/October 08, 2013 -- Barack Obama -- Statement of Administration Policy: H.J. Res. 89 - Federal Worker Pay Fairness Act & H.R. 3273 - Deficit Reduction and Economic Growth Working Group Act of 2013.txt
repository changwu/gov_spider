(House)
(Rep. Rogers, R-KY: H.J. Res. 89)
(Rep. Sessions, R-TX: H.R. 3273)
The Administration strongly opposes House joint passage of H.J. Res. 89 and H.R. 3273, which does nothing to solve the immediate, pressing obligations the Congress has to open the Government and pay its bills. The House should allow a straight up or down vote on Senate-passed H.J. Res. 59 to reopen the Government, bring all the Nation's dedicated civil servants back to work, and provide the services middle-class Americans deserve. In addition, the House should pass a clean debt ceiling bill without drama or delay so that the United States can continue to pay its bills and fulfill the Nation's obligations. The President has been clear that he is open to discussing a broad range of measures to support the Nation's economy, create jobs, and further reduce the deficit once the Congress meets its responsibility to open the Government and pay its bills.
If the President were presented with H.J. Res. 89 and H.R. 3273, he would veto the legislation.
