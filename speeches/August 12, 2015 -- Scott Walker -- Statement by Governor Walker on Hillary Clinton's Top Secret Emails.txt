    Madison, Wis. â€“ Following reports that top-secret emails were found on Hillary Clinton's private server, Gov. Scott Walker released the below statement.
"This is a serious and potentially criminal offense that proves Hillary Clinton put her own personal convenience ahead of the safety and security of the American people. She cannot be trusted to keep America's secrets or its citizens safe, and therefore cannot be trusted to be commander in chief."
