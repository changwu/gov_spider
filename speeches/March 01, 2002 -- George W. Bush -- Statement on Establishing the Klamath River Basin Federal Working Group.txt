    A prolonged drought and complex Federal and State legal issues have made for difficult times in the Klamath River Basin. Today I am establishing the Klamath River Basin Federal Working Group to address concerns raised by farmers, ranchers, fishermen, tribes, and others affected by these difficult conditions. I have directed Secretary Norton, Secretary Veneman, Secretary Evans, and CEQ Chairman Connaughton to advise me of the immediate and long-term actions necessary to enhance water quality and quantity and to address the other complex economic and natural resource issues in the Klamath River Basin. I have directed the Working Group to begin their efforts immediately. I want to thank Senator Gordon Smith and Congressman Greg Walden for their commitment to working together to find a lasting solution that meets the needs of the Klamath River Basin.
