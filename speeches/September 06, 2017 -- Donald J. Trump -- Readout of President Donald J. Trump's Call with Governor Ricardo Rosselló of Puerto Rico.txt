    President Donald J. Trump spoke today with Governor Ricardo Rossell√≥ of Puerto Rico to express his support for the Governor and the people of Puerto Rico as the territory prepares for Hurricane Irma and to acknowledge Puerto Rico's experience in responding to hurricanes. The President confirmed that the Federal Government has been actively readying for the Hurricane Irma response even as the Government continues to support the States of Texas and Louisiana following Hurricane Harvey. FEMA will continue to coordinate with Puerto Rico's emergency management staff and will work with other Federal partners to help support the territory's efforts.
