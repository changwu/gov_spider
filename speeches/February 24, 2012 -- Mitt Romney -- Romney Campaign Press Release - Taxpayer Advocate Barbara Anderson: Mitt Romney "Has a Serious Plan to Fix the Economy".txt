    Citizens for Limited Taxation Executive Director Barbara Anderson made the following statement today on Mitt Romney's economic plan:
"This is a serious plan to fix the economy and to reassure businesses, especially the smaller job creators, that someone is on their side. As a taxpayer, though I'm always interested in having lower rates just to help us individual taxpayers deal with rising costs, the most important thing right now is having lower rates that will get the economy moving and protect or create taxpayer jobs.
"We've long wanted not just lower rates, but also simplification and stability; the Romney Plan moves us in that direction. We especially like repealing the alternative minimum tax and the death tax and focusing on permanent rather than temporary tax policy.Â  And we look forward to removing the vast complexity of the existing tax code, which is hard for any of us to rationally discuss.
"It's most important to me to get the budget under control to avoid more deficit spending, to start to reduce the national debt on my grandchildren. This can't happen until the economy turns around, and Governor Romney's plan is a strong first step in the right direction."
