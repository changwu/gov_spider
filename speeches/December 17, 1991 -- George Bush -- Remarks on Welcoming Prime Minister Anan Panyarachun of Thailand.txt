    May I simply say to the journalists from Thailand, particularly, what a joy it is for me to receive this Prime Minister, a friend of long-standing. The friendship goes back some 15 years. He was a most respected figure back then in the United Nations, and he's now a most respected figure on the world scene. So this is a joy today for us. Thank you all very much for coming.
