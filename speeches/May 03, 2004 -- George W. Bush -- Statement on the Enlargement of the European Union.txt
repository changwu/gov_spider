    I applaud the action by the European Union (EU) to welcome into their membership 10 new countries from Central Europe and the Mediterranean. This enlargement will bring opportunity and hope to millions of Europeans. Along with NATO's expansion, the EU's enlargement further unites the new and the established democracies of Europe and helps create a Europe whole, free, and at peace. We welcome the prospect of further enlargement of the EU to qualified countries, including Romania and Bulgaria, and we support Turkey's European Union aspirations.
This new European Union will more effectively play its essential role as a force for democracy, prosperity, and stability. This action strengthens the enduring partnership between the United States and Europe and marks a major advance for the common values and purposes of our transatlantic community.
