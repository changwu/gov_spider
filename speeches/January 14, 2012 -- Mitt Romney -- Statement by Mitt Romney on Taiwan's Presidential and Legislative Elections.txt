    Mitt Romney made the following statement on Taiwan's presidential and legislative elections:
"I congratulate the people of Taiwan on their successful elections. As Taiwan's citizens made their way to the polls, the strength and vibrancy of their democracy was clear. Taiwan sets an example of what is possible when a society embraces free and fair elections, civil rights and political liberties, and a dynamic free-market economy."
