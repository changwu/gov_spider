    Today former Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Almond announced his support for Gov. John Kasich for President and joined the Kasich for America Rhode Island leadership team.
Said Almond, "Like the rest of the nation, Rhode Islanders are looking for a leader who can deliver. From balancing the budget in Congress to helping Ohioans rebuild their economy and create over 417,000 new private sector jobs, John Kasich has an unrivaled record of results. As poll after poll demonstrates, he is the only Republican candidate who can unite the party and defeat Hillary Clinton in the fall. I'm proud to stand with him and his team."

As Governor from 1995-2003, Almond focused on creating a better climate for job creation and economic development. Under his leadership, Rhode Islanders created 40,000 new jobs and saw significant growth in the financial services, biotechnology and marine trade industries. Prior to his gubernatorial election, Almond served as a U.S. District Attorney for Rhode Island for 20 years under the Nixon and Reagan administrations. 
Said Kasich, "Governor Almond has tremendous experience and credibility in Rhode Island. It's truly an honor to receive his endorsement and welcome him to our state leadership team."
