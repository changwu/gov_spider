Democrats Abroad Chair Christine Schon Marques Endorses Barack Obama
Chicago, IL â€” Today Democrats Abroad Chair and superdelegate Christine Schon Marques endorsed Barack Obama for president, citing his unique ability to unite all Americans and restore our moral standing in the world.
"As a Democrat abroad, I've seen the repercussions of the Republican Administration every day, in the diminished reputation of the United States and in the lack of real leadership both at home and abroad, from the economy to the war in Iraq," said Schon Marques. "I'm proud to be a Democrat, and proud of both our candidates. Today I pledge my support to Senator Barack Obama because I believe that he will take our country in the right direction, he will restore America's reputation, he will honor the men and women who are bravely serving our country, and he will reach out to Americans across the country and around the world. I hope that voters overseas join me in registering today at www.VoteFromAbroad.org so that all our voices are heard this November."
