    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Studds (D) Massachusetts & 3 others)
While the administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 2020, it will work in the Senate to (1) lower the authorization level from $750,000 to $575,000 so that it conforms to the President's Budget; and (2) eliminate the provision authorizing $5,000,000 annually through fiscal year 1993 for Federal matching funds for the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.
