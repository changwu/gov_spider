Subject: Certifications for Major Narcotics Producing and Transit Countries
By virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 481(h)(2)(A)(i) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2291(h)(2)(A)(i) ("the Act"), I hereby determine and certify that the following major narcotics producing and/or major narcotics transit countries/dependent territory have cooperated fully with the United States, or taken adequate steps on their own, to control narcotics production, trafficking and money laundering:
The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, China, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, Laos, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Thailand, Venezuela.
By virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 481(h)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, 22 U.S.C. 2291(h)(2)(A)(ii), I hereby determine that it is in the vital national interests of the United States to certify the following country:
Lebanon.
Information on this country as required under Section 481(h)(2)(D), 22 U.S.C. 2291(h)(2)(D), of the Act is enclosed.
I have determined that the following major producing and/or major transit countries do not meet the standards set forth in Section 481(h)(2)(A) of the Act, 22 U.S.C. 2291(h)(2)(A):
Afghanistan, Burma, Iran and Syria.
In making these determinations, I have considered the factors set forth in Section 481(h)(3) of the Act, 22 U.S.C. 2291(h)(3), based on the information contained in the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report of 1992. Because the performance of these countries varies, I have attached an explanatory statement in each case.
You are hereby directed to report this determination to the Congress immediately and to publish it in the Federal Register.
George Bush
