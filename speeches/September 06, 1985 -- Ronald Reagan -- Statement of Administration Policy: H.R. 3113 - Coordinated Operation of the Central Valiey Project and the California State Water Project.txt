    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Miller (D) California)
The Administration opposes the bill because it does not Provide reimbursement to the Federal Government for the cost of meeting State water quality standards. The bill's failure toprovide such reimbursement would result in the loss of approximately $112 million in Federal receipts for salinity mitigation and water quality enhancement.
