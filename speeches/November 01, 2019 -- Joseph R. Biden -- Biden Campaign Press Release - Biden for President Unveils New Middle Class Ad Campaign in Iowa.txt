Watch "What I See""Donald Trump has spent his presidency enriching himself, cutting taxes for the wealthiest Americans and corporations, and turning his back on the hardworking families who built this country. Meanwhile, Joe Biden is putting forward a different vision for America where we rebuild an inclusive middle class and open the doors of opportunity to all Americans," said Greg Schultz, Campaign Manager, Biden for President. "With less than 100 days until the Iowa caucus, we are blanketing the state on the air and online to remind voters of the striking differences between Donald Trump's selfish and senseless actions and Joe Biden's inclusive economic vision for the middle class."
Last month, Biden for President's reserved $6 million worth of prime advertising space on television airwaves and on digital platforms in all four early states. Today's new integrated ad campaign will invest $4 million across broadcast and digital and run through the Iowa caucus on February 3. "Scranton Values" will air on broadcast, satellite, and cable television in the Des Moines and Cedar Rapid markets while "What I See," as well as rope line footage of Vice President Biden discussing shared middle class experiences with voters, will span digital platforms, including YouTube, Hulu, Facebook, and Instagram.
