    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report two new deferrals of funds totaling $12.6 million. The deferred funds were provided for water resources projects in the Corps of Engineers and the Department of the Interior. Only one of the deferrals-related to the Corps of Engineers' Meramec Park Lake 'project--is now in effect. This deferral will be maintained, at least until the completion of a review of Federal water resources projects currently in progress.
The details of each deferral are contained in the attached reports.
