(House)(Chrysler (R) Michigan)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2974, which is consistent with its commitment to protecting the rights of victims of crime. This bill builds upon the principles of the 1994 Crime Act, which recognized that vulnerable victims deserve special protection under the law.
As the Administration has stated previously, the legislation's goals could also be successfully achieved by directing the Sentencing Commission to increase the recommended penalty. The Commission should have the discretion to determine the extent to which the sentences would be increased.
