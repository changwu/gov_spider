    IN ACCORDANCE with the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act of 1973 and the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, I am transmitting an amendment to the fiscal year 1976 budget for the District of Columbia. The amendment also includes provisions affecting the transition quarter budget for the period July 1 through September 30, 1976.
This amendment includes a request from the District of Columbia government to extend the interim U.S. Treasury borrowing authority of Section 723 of the Home Rule Act of 1973 to capital projects not approved under the provisions of that act. The District government will shortly submit draft legislation to authorize such additional borrowing.
I urge that the Congress favorably consider an increase of $3 million in the Federal payment for the transition quarter, as authorized by Section 502 of the Home Rule Act, as amended, in order to support the District's extraordinary public safety needs during the Bicentennial summer 1976.
