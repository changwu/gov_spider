In town pool report #2
President Biden emerged from the Oval Office with a couple staffers at 12:32pm and got into the Beast. We are rolling to the Washington Hilton.
Of note: Pool spotted staff playing with first dog Commander near the residence. I can confirm Commander looks like he has grown quite a bit.

In town pool report #3 - arrival and awaiting POTUS remarks
The motorcade arrived at the Washington Hilton at 12:39p.m. Pool did not see President Biden enter the hotel.
We are now set up in a ballroom inside the hotel. There are hundreds of guests here packed together, some seated and some standing and mingling. Minimal mask usage.
The president is expected to speak shortly and his remarks will be streamed here: https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/

In town pool report #5 - Biden enters and correction
President Biden walked out at 12:57pm and shook some of the attendees' hands. He received loud cheers when he entered and stepped up to the podium.
Remarks streaming live on the White House website. https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/
Also, the last pool report should have been #4, not #5. Apologies.

In town pool report #7 -- Biden wraps at 1:30pm
Biden wrapped his remarks around 1:30pm.
Some color -
Biden received loud applause and a standing ovation during his remarks at the top of the speech on Russia. When the president said "Amazon, here we come," he also received loud cheers and a standing ovation. Biden also received a few standing ovations and loud applause when he talked about the need for the wealthy to "pay their fair share" in taxes. He also prompted laughs among the audience when he talked about "the last guy."
Also, another correction - I seem to also have duplicated pool report #3, so the correct number of this report should be #7. Apologies!

In town pool report #8 - leaving hotel
Motorcade is rolling back to the White House as of 1:42pm. Pool did not see President Biden get into the Beast.
Also, there's a protest taking place near the hotel, but your pooler could not make out what the demonstrators were shouting.



April 6, 202213:52

In town pool report #9 - Back at the White House
Motorcade arrived back at the White House at 1:48pm. Biden walked to the Oval Office accompanied by an aide who I believe was Cedric Richmond.

In town pool report #13 - Biden negative COVID test on Monday
The White House passed the following along:
"As a follow-up to an earlier briefing question, the President was last tested for COVID-19 on Monday, April 4th. He tested negative."
Also, your pooler spotted several lawmakers at this event including Sens. Portman, Peters, Carper, Majority Leader Hoyer, Reps. Peter Welch and Jackie Speier.

In town pool report #14 - event starting
Biden walked in the room around 4:25pm. He'll speak momentarily.
Some other color on attendees -
Majority Whip James Clyburn entered the room shortly after I sent the last pool note. He and Sen. Portman chatted for a few minutes before the event started.
Also at the event - Cedric Richmond, who was one of a handful of people masked. Your pooler also spotted Louisa Terrell. Senate Majority Leader Schumer entered the room just before the event began.



April 6, 202216:56

In town pool report #15 -color from room
Biden signed the bill at 4:38pm after concluding his remarks. He continues to speak and take photos with various guests.
Speaker Pelosi, Sen. Tillis, AOC, Rep. Rashida Tlaib were also among the lawmakers here. It looked like AOC mingled with POTUS briefly but a large crowd obstructed my view. Pool saw Biden take a photo with Rep. Tlaib.
Your pooler spotted Postmaster Louis DeJoy among the guests but has not seen him interact with Biden. We are still in the room.

As the event wound down, Biden was asked if he's worried about a resurgence of COVID-19.

One more note - I believe I caught a brief sighting of the first cat, Willow, being carried by a staffer as we exited the White House.
Enjoy your evening, all.
