    We welcome the Supreme Court's decision to grant a stay in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA, and our fight to defend reproductive freedom continues. The Court's announcement preserves access to mifepristoneâ€”a safe and effective medication that was approved by the FDA more than two decades ago.
Our Administration will not waver in our commitment to preserving access to essential medication and defending the FDA's ability to approve safe and effective drugs. Americans need to look no further than their medicine cabinet to see how many FDA-approved medications are at risk if lower court decisions disregarding the FDA's scientific judgment are allowed to stand.
The President and I will continue to fight to protect a woman's freedom to make decisions about her own body and access to reproductive health care, including medication abortion. No one should stand between a woman and her doctor.
