    In response to requests by Angolan President dos Santos, UNITA President Savimbi, and U.N. Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali, the President has instructed the Department of Defense to deploy three U.S. C - 130 aircraft to Angola for approximately 6 weeks. The aircraft will be used to support transportation of troops demobilized in accordance with the peace accords between UNITA and the Angolan Government and to support the elections that will take place September 29 - 30.
Since assuming office, the Bush administration has worked to achieve a peaceful resolution of the civil conflict in Angola in a fashion that would permit that war-torn country to move into an era of peace and multiparty democracy. The fighting has ended, and Angola is now firmly embarked on the first free elections in its history. Approximately 4 million citizens have already registered to vote for the first time in their lives. President Bush attaches high priority to ensuring that free and fair elections take place as scheduled and that all parties respect the outcome of the elections.
