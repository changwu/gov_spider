    WASHINGTON â€“ Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday will outline a vision for America which calls upon the country to finally implement President Franklin D. Roosevelt's "Second Bill of Rights," a program for economic and social justice advanced in 1944 but not yet achieved.
At a time of massive income and wealth inequality Sanders believes, as did Roosevelt, that all Americans should have a right to a job with a living wage; health care; education; social security; housing and freedom from unfair competition and monopolies.
The speech at The Institute of Politics and Public Service at Georgetown's McCourt School of Public Policy also will discuss foreign affairs and how the world community can defeat the Islamic State.
Here is the itinerary:
Thursday, November 19
2 p.m. Georgetown Speech, Georgetown University, Gaston Hall, 3rd Floor Healy Hall, Washington
The event will be live streamed here.
