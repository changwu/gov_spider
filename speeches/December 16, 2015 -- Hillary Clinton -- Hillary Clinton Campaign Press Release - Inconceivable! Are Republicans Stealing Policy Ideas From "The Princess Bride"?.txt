Lately, Ted Cruz has been talking a lot about how "The Princess Bride"?is his favorite movie—he even quotes his favorite lines and does impressions on the campaign trail. We know what you're thinking: 
You're not! This is a real thing that's happening. And during Tuesday night's undercard Republican debate, Lindsey Graham invoked Princess Buttercup in his arguments against Cruz. 
That's how we felt, too—especially since "The Princess Bride" has a lot of great messages about honor, "mawwaige," and not devoting your life to revenge.
But then we got to thinking: Maybe the Republicans DO take some of their policies from wacky misinterpretations of "The Princess Bride." Like their take on tax cuts for the rich: 
Their obsession with building walls and moats and bureaucracy to keep people out of America: 
Their refusal to support equal rights for LGBT people: 
Their insistence on calling themselves "pro-life" while refusing to take action to prevent gun violence: 
And their general commitment to making life even easier for those at the top while offering no real solutions on health care access, college affordability, or raising incomes for the middle class: 
But here's the good news: We don't have to let a single one of them become president! 
Here's what you can do to stop them: Help elect a president who'll fight harder than the Dread Pirate Roberts to make sure all Americans have a chance to get ahead, no matter what they look like, where they come from, or who they love. So ... what do you think?
