    President Bush will welcome Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek of the Czech Republic to the White House on February 27, 2008. The Czech Republic has been a world leader in support of democratic values and human rights in countries whose people most need such support, such as Belarus, Burma, and Cuba. The President was pleased to recognize this leadership role by traveling to Prague last June to address an international conference of freedom advocates from the world's most oppressive societies.
A valued NATO ally, the Czech Republic is contributing to the security and development of Afghanistan, and continues to contribute to securing freedom in Iraq, and has expressed interest in contributing to a missile defense system. President Bush looks forward to discussing these and other issues with Prime Minister Topolanek.
