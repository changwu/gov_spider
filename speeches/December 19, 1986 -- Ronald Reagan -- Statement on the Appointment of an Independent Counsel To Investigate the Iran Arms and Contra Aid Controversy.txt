    I have urged and now welcome the appointment of such a distinguished jurist as Lawrence Walsh to serve as Independent Counsel. With the appointment of an Independent Counsel and with the efforts of the Senate and House Select Committees and the Special Review Board I established, all of the facts will come before the American people at the earliest possible time. I have done everything in my power to make the facts known, and I welcome and support the addition of the Independent Counsel to this fact-finding process. Mr. Walsh has my promise of complete cooperation, and I have instructed all members of my administration to cooperate fully with the investigation in order to ensure full and prompt disclosure.
