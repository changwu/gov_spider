Dear Percy:
It is with great regret and reluctance that I accept your resignation as Director of the Bureau of the Budget, effective on or about March fifteenth. I know well the complicated and demanding nature of the post, and realize fully that after four years of such strenuous work you have a natural and intense desire for freedom to attend to your personal affairs.
I am proud, as I know you are, of the achievements of the Bureau of the Budget under your direction. You have devoted yourself tirelessly and selflessly to bringing about better fiscal standards and management throughout all departments of government.
It is especially difficult to keep the high degree of efficiency we all want in fiscal affairs in the face of ever increasing demands of the security establishment and changes in the domestic economy. You and the members of your Department have adjusted yourselves and your work admirably and understandingly to the requirements of these situations. I am grateful to you for your outstanding service.
I appreciate your willingness to continue to work, outside of government, to bring about an awareness of what we must do to insure the survival of our free enterprise system. I am even more grateful for your assurance that, when circumstances might indicate a renewed need for your services, I would be free to call upon you.
Mrs. Eisenhower joins me in the hope that you and Mrs. Brundage will enjoy to the fullest, for many years, the happiness and satisfactions that you so richly deserve.
With warm regard,
As ever,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
