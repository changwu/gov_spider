Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Subject: President's Report to Congress on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries under the FY 2002 Modification to the Annual Drug Certification Procedures
This report is submitted under section 591 of the Kenneth H. Ludden Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2002 (P.L. 107-115) (the "FY 2002 FOAA"). Pursuant to section 591 of the FY 2002 FOAA, I hereby identify the following countries as major drug-transit or major illicit drug producing countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Thailand, Venezuela, and Vietnam. I previously identified these same countries as major drug-transit or major illicit drug producing countries on November 1, 2001, pursuant to section 490(h) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (the "FAA").
Pursuant to section 591 of the FY 2002 FOAA, I hereby designate Afghanistan, Burma and Haiti as countries that failed demonstrably, during the previous 12 months, to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and to take the counternarcotics measures set forth in section 489(a) (1) of the FAA. I have attached a justification for each of the countries so designated, as required by section 591.
Pursuant to section 591(3), I hereby also determine that provision of United States assistance to Afghanistan and Haiti in FY 2002 under the FY 2002 FOAA is vital to the national interests of the United States.
You are hereby authorized and directed to transmit this report to the Congress and to publish it in the Federal Register.
George W. Bush
