Q. Good briefing, Mr. President?
The President. It was really interesting. Our Nation is fortunate to have so many dedicated men and women serve the country, and a lot of really good folks who work here. They've got one thing in mind, and that is how to serve America, how to provide the best information possible so that we can live in a peaceful world.
There are a lot of people in this world that really resent our country and resent what we stand for. The good folks in this building are doing everything they can to provide enough information for us to be able to protect our way of life and protect our people. And I'm really touched by being here. And I'm so grateful for the hospitality, Mr. Director.
Situation in Macedonia
Q. Mr. President, a quick question on Macedonia. What should the United States do about the fighting that is taking place?
The President. Well, we're going to work with our allies to bring peace to that region. We're very much involved through the NATO process, and we'll work with the Macedonian Government to help Macedonia protect its own borders.
Q. Should the U.S. be giving the Macedonian military assistance?
The President. We'll work with NATO to develop a strategy that will help Macedonia protect herself.
