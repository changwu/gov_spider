    One of the Bible verses I recall most from my childhood comes from the Book of John: "Let us not love in word or tongue, but in deed and truth." To know where Gov. Huntsman stands on the issue of life, you don't need a promise or pledge; simply look at his actions, in both his professional and personal life.

As governor, he signed landmark legislation to limit abortion and protect those who cannot protect themselves.
He signed HB 90 to make second-trimester abortions illegal and increase the penalty for performing an illegal abortion.
He signed HB 222 to allow women to learn about the pain an abortion will cause to their unborn child.
He signed HB 85 to require parental consent for minors to obtain an abortion.
Gov. Huntsman also supported a "trigger" bill that would prohibit abortions in Utah if Roe v. Wade were overturned.
As a husband and father, Jon - along with his wife Mary Kaye - are the proud parents of seven children, including two adopted girls from China and India.
On the issue of stem cells, Jon is a passionate supporter of research that has the potential to ease the suffering of millions. However, he opposes federal funding for new stem cell lines that would do harm to embryos.
Governor Huntsman has been a pro-life father and a pro-life governor, and he'd be a pro-life president.
