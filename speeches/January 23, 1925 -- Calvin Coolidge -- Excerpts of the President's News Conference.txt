    I don't know what I am going to put in my inaugural address. I suppose that will be a standard question from now until the address gets into the hands of the press. If any of you think of anything that ought to be covered in the address, I should be obliged to you if you will suggest the subject to me at any time.

I haven't any plans for speaking away from Washington after the first of March. I am going out speaking just as little as I can and keep the public peace. The pressure on me is great at all times. There were eight delegations in yesterday forenoon and asked me to make speeches, but it is very difficult for me to get out for that purpose.
