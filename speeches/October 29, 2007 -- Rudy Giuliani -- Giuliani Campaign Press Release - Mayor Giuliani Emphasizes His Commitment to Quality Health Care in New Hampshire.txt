    Mayor Rudy Giuliani will continue discussing his commitment to giving Americans increased control over, and access to, health care today at a roundtable discussion in Manchester, New Hampshire. Health care is an important issue for New Hampshire voters because per capita personal health care spending in the state increased an astounding 38% from 1999 through 2004. Mayor Giuliani's roundtable also comes as the campaign releases a new radio ad focusing on giving Americans the ability to choose their own healthcare without government mandates.
The radio ad which begins running in New Hampshire tomorrow emphasizes the need to find free-market solutions that facilitate consumer-driven health care and end failed big-government mandates and wasteful administrative bureaucracies. In New Hampshire, private health insurance is too expensive because it's over-regulated and over-mandated, with the average family premium for employer-based insurance coverage 10 percent higher than the national average.
Over the summer, Mayor Giuliani laid out his commitment to empowering all Americans with increased health care choices and affordability. The Mayor proposes reforming the tax code and the medical liability system, while providing American families with expanded low-cost insurance options and improving and expanding health savings accounts. The Mayor's proposed $15,000 tax exemption for American families and $7,500 tax exemption for single individuals who purchase health insurance on their own is aimed at benefiting New Hampshire residents. Currently, 49 percent of New Hampshire's small employers do not offer health insurance to their employees.
"You and I should be making the decisions about what kind of health care we get with our doctors, not with a government bureaucrat," says Mayor Giuliani in the radio ad. "Government has never been able to reduce costs. Government never increases quality. We have the best health care system in the world. We just have to make it better."
