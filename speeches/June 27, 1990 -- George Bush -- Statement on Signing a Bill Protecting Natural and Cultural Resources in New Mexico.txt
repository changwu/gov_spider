    I take great pleasure in signing into law S. 286, an Act to establish the Petroglyph National Monument and the Pecos National Historical Park in New Mexico, and to resolve various New Mexico land issues.
West of Albuquerque, New Mexico, the major landscape feature is the West Mesa, marked by a 17-mile long basalt escarpment and five volcanic cones. Within the area are an estimated 15,000 to 17,000 petroglyphs, which are designs carved or pecked into the rock. Establishment of the Petroglyph National Monument will provide an excellent opportunity to form a strong partnership among the Federal Government, the State of New Mexico, and the City of Albuquerque to ensure the protection of seriously threatened ancient Pueblo Indian and Spanish rock art. Cost sharing will be an important component of the success of this joint effort, and I look forward to a successful partnership.
S. 286 also will expand the existing 365-acre Pecos National Monument into the 5,865-acre Pecos National Historical Park. This will allow for expanded protection and recreation programs in an area rich in cultural resources.
I wholeheartedly support the measures contained in S. 286 because they will ensure the protection of rich natural and cultural resources within the State of New Mexico that are now seriously threatened.
