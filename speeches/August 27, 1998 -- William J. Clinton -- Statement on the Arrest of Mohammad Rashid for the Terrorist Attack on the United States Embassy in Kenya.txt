    Late last night, American law enforcement authorities brought to the United States Mohammad Rashid, a suspect in the bombing attack on the United States Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya. The suspect's involvement in the bombing was established as the result of a joint investigation by the Kenyan police and an FBI team. He is associated with Usama bin Ladin, the preeminent organizer and financier of international terrorism whose network we struck in Afghanistan and Sudan last week.
This arrest does not close this case. We will continue to pursue all those who helped plan, finance, and carry out the attacks on our Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which took the lives of 12 Americans and hundreds of Africans.
Let me express my gratitude to our law enforcement and intelligence agencies for a job very well done and to the Kenyan and Tanzanian authorities for their hard work and close cooperation with the FBI.
This is an important step forward in our struggle against terrorism, but there is a long road ahead. The enemies of peace and freedom undoubtedly will strike again. Our resolve must be for the long run. We have and we will continue to use all the tools at our disposalâ€”law enforcement, diplomacy, and when necessary, America's military might. No matter what it takes, how long it takes, or where it takes us, we will bring to justice those responsible for the murder and maiming of American citizens. We will defend our interests, our people, and our values.
