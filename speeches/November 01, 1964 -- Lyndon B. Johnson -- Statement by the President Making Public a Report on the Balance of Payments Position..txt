    I AM HAPPY to be able to make public a report from Secretary Dillon which shows that for the first time in 7 years we have been able to increase our total gold holdings. This is the result of outstanding work by American exporters and full cooperation by all agencies of the Government.
We have not yet finished the job of closing our dollar gap, but we have taken a long step forward. With the continued effort of both business and Government we can reach our goal.
