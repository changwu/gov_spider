    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with section 3 of Public Law 89-605, as amended by Public Law 91-242, I am transmitting a report by the Secretary of the Interior. This report recommends discontinuance of negotiations for a Federal-Interstate Compact and suggests repeal by Congress of Public Law 89-605 as amended by Public Law 91242, the Hudson River Basin Compact Act.
The report includes a letter of agreement signed by the Secretary of the Interior and the Governors of New Jersey and New York. This letter documents the agreement reached and explains the facts leading to the agreement.
I concur in the recommendations of the Secretary of the Interior. A draft bill repealing Public Law 89-605 as amended by Public Law 91-242 is enclosed for your consideration.
