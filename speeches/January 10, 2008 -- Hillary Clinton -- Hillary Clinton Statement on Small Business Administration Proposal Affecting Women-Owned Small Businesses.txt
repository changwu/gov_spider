    Senator Clinton statement on the Small Business Administration's (SBA) recent proposal concerning procurement contracts for women-owned small businesses:
"Women-owned businesses are among the fastest growing segments of the business community, and deserve fair treatment from the federal government. As president, I will ensure that women owned small businesses receive the federal contracts they deserve and that the SBA expands opportunities for women business owners.
"Unfortunately, President Bush's SBA recently proposed rules that would actually put up, rather than tear down, roadblocks to women entrepreneurs. As it stands, female entrepreneurs are not getting their fair share of federal contracts. Women own one-third of our nation's small businesses, but they receive only about 3% of federal contracts. There is no excuse for this chronic under-representation. I strongly urge the SBA to go back to the drawing board and draft rules genuinely designed to increase opportunities for women-owned small businesses."
