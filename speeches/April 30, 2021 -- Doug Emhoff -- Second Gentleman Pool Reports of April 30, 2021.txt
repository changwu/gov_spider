SGOTUS in North Carolina pool report #4
It's 10:56 a.m. EST and Mr. Emhoff and Sec. Buttigieg are speaking with union member representatives at Teamsters Union Hall in Raleigh, North Carolina about the American Jobs Plan.
They are talking about investing in more jobs, green infrastructure and promoting workers' rights to unionize.
They are also speaking about supporting frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
"Transit workers are frontline workers," Emhoff said. "They need to be treated as such."
"A lot of people weren't able to work on Zoom," Emhoff said. "It's been a tough year out there taking care of people like you all have."
Sec. Buttigieg spoke about investing in trade jobs, not higher-entry jobs, when investing in infrastructure.

SGOTUS in North Carolina pool report #7
It's 1:03 p.m. and Mr. Emhoff and Sec. Buttigieg have left North Carolina State University's campus in Raleigh, North Carolina.
Along with those reported in pool report #6, they were also joined by Rep. David Price of North Carolina's 4th congressional district, which covers other parts of the Raleigh metropolitan area, including Durham and Chapel Hill.
They went to the Additive Manufacturing Lab where NC State staff showed them objects produced with 3D printing technology.
They then went to the Pavement and Asphalt Testing Lab, where staff and students showed them the mixing process of a new pavement formulation that extends the lifetime of paved surfaces.
Finally, Emhoff and Buttigieg toured the Construction Facilities Lab where the development of construction materials and systems are researched to enhance infrastructure sustainability.
This was all a part of seeing research and development for infrastructure taking place at NC State. President Biden's American Jobs Plan calls for more funding in infrastructure R&D.
Emhoff and Buttigieg are now going to lunch before going to their final stop in Raleigh.

SGOTUS in North Carolina pool report #8
It's 2 p.m. and Mr. Emhoff and Sec. Buttigieg have arrived downtown at the Raleigh Union Station.
They're here with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Raleigh Mayor Mary-Ann Baldwin, Rep. David Price (NC-4), Rep. Deborah Ross (NC-2) and Amtrak President Stephen Gardner.
They're here to talk about the American Rescue Plan, which President Biden signed in March, as well as the administration's infrastructure proposal, the American Jobs Plan.
The Raleigh Union Station began operation in July 2018.
Also, I was sent a written statement from North Carolina League of Conservation Voters from their Director of Governmental Relations Dan Crawford:
"North Carolinians love traveling the Good Roads State from the Outer Banks to the Blue Ridge Parkway. President Biden's American Jobs Plan will make it easier and less expensive for us to explore our beautiful state in electric cars we can charge readily or in rail cars from Asheville to Wilmington and beyond. It's a jobs plan, a tourism plan, a health plan, an energy infrastructure plan, and a climate plan rolled into one."

SGOTUS in North Carolina pool report #9
Press conference in Raleigh, North Carolina, at the Raleigh Union Station downtown wrapped up at 2:43 p.m. EST.
Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Rep. David Price (NC-4), Rep. Barbara Ross (NC-2) and Raleigh Mayor Mary-Ann Baldwin spoke at the press conference.
They mostly talked about President Biden's initiative going forward with the American Jobs Plan to invest in infrastructure. Cooper, Price and Ross talked more from a North Carolina context. Baldwin spoke even more local from a Raleigh perspective. Price, Ross and Cooper emphasized the goal of expanding Amtrak rail from Raleigh directly to Richmond, Virginia. Here's some key quotes from each person below:
Emhoff

"We've got to work to rebuild our economy. We've to work to build a nation that is healthier, safer, fairer, and as the President said, more competitive on the world stage."

Buttigieg

"If you bike, walk, use a wheelchair, travel will be safer for you as transportation comes to be more centered around people and not only around cars."
"When we envision travel for the next 50 years, the train should be a common sense option. The rumble of rails. The freedom of looking out your train window should once again be known to be as all-American as the open road."
"What we just saw at NC State is a great example of how private sector, academic and public sector interact."

Cooper

"The backbone of our recovery will have to be our infrastructure. Governors across this country have been waiting a long time for an infrastructure bill."
"A comprehensive infrastructure bill is going to be critical for our state's recovery, and this country's recovery."
"High speed internet has to come to this state and across the country,"
"This is where the jobs are of the future," Cooper said referring to the climate portions of the American Jobs Plan.

Price

"Let's just say it's on to Richmond. Richmond is next," Price said. He said funds in the American Jobs Plan could be used to expand the rail system to Virginia much like federal funds were used in the past to connect the rail system from Charlotte, NC to Raleigh.
note: Price is Chairman of the House Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee

Ross

"The American Jobs Plan will meet these urgent needs and create millions of good jobs in the process, and none of these jobs can be outsourced. They are for our American workers. Everybody from that engineering PhD at NC State to the union worker to the high school graduate who can pave our roads."

Baldwin

"When we built Raleigh Union Station, we didn't build it for today. We built it for 20 years from now," Baldwin said, "but we also built it to bring equity, transportation and housing to this area."
"We need the American Jobs Plan because we want to be the city of the future."
