    Jeanette Galanis named Colorado State Director
Denver, Colorado – January 2, 2020 – Mike Bloomberg 2020 announced today that Jeannette Galanis will join the campaign as State Director and that several other notable Colorado political veterans had joined the effort to defeat Donald Trump in November.
"Mike Bloomberg has taken on and won on some of our country's toughest fights — be it on guns, climate, or public health — and our effort to defeat Donald Trump in Colorado and across the country will be no different," said Galanis. "I'm eager to start building an organization that will not only help us win in the March 3 primary, but also in November so that we can start rebuilding America."
Galanis joins the team after serving as the Director of Public Affairs for Denver Public Schools from 2018 to 2019. She has more than 15 years of professional political experience, including as a political consultant, as a member of the Obama Administration as Chief of Staff for the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration, as National Deputy Field Director for the AFL-CIO, and as National Field Director for Public Campaign.
"Jeannette has an outstanding history of building and running teams on some of the most important and high-profile campaigns across the country and in Colorado, and we're delighted to have her lead our efforts in the Centennial State to unseat President Donald Trump and to elect a proven leader to the White House," said Ray Rivera, who joined the campaign as a Senior Advisor last month.
Rivera previously worked as Vice President at Leadership for Educational Equity, as Deputy Associate Director for Policy Outreach at the White House Council on Environmental Quality, and as Colorado State Director and Western States Caucus Director for Obama for America in 2008.
