    To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
In the message to Congress at the opening of the present session I informed them that treaties had been entered into with the Delaware and Piankeshaw Indians for the purchase of their right to certain lands on the Ohio. I have since received another, entered into with the Sacs and Foxes, for a portion of country on both sides of the river Mississippi. These treaties, having been advised and consented to by the Senate, have accordingly been ratified, but as they involve conditions which require legislative provision, they are now submitted to both branches for consideration.
TH: JEFFERSON.
