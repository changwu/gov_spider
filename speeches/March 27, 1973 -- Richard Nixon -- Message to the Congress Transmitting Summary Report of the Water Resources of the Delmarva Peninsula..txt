    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to submit the enclosed report, "Water Resources of the Delmarva Peninsula, a Summary Report to the Congress," by E. M. Cushing, I. H. Kantrowitz, and K. R. Taylor, which was prepared in compliance with Public Law 89-618 (S. 2287), October 4, 1966.
The Delmarva study was made in response to the specific act cited above, which was sponsored by Senator J. Caleb Boggs of Delaware (S. 2287) and Secretary of the Interior Rogers C. B. Morton (H.R. 9922) who was a Representative from Maryland in 1966. Public Law 89618 authorized and directed the Secretary of the Interior to make a comprehensive investigation of the water resources of the Delmarva Peninsula. The principal objective of the study was to determine the availability of fresh-water supplies to meet future needs of the peninsula area. The summary report indicates that the amount of fresh water that can be developed perennially on the peninsula is about 1,500 million gallons per day. This amount is more than 10 times the use in 1970 and about six times the estimated use of water on the peninsula by the year 2010.
In addition to this summary report to the Congress, required by Public Law 89618, the Geological Survey plans to compile and publish in 1973 a more detailed report on the study for use by public and private agencies and individuals. That report will provide information for use in long-range planning, development, and management of water supplies.
