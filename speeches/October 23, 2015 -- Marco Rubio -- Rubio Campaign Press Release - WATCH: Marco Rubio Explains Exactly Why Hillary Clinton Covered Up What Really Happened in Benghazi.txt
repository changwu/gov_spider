We need to focus on this very carefully. Benghazi was a very dangerous city. The Red Cross had already pulled out of Benghazi at the time. The Brits had already pulled out of Benghazi at the time. Our own facility had already been attacked with a firebomb previously to that. And despite all of this, the State Department made a decision to leave that consulate in Benghazi open. I would say that, that right there is a red flag. They should have known that they shouldn't have been there.
But let's suppose they decide to stay there. If you decide you're going to stay there, then you have to ensure that you have sufficient security for that facility. Again, they failed to do that. The attackers breached it very quickly and happened to catch the Ambassador there and killed him, and of course, three other people lost their lives as well, as a result of that.
So they had insufficient security for the facility. In fact, they had outsourced the security to Libyan militias. And then, on top of that, there was no plan in place of extraction. In fact, if there was an attack, they did not have military assets nearby to respond quickly and save lives.
It was a massive incompetence at every level, and the buck stops at the top. If Hillary Clinton is going to go around taking credit for her time as Secretary of State, then she must take responsibilities for failures that happen at the State Department under her watch, and this was the costliest of all in terms of human lives and American lives.
