PAUL RYAN: "He can't run on the broken promises. He can't run on the trillion-dollar deficits each and every year. But he did come up with a new idea the other day. He's got a new idea for the second term, and here's what it is. In addition to all the borrowing and all the spending and all the money printing and all the regulating, he wants a new Cabinet position. He wants to create a new secretary of business. You know, we already have a secretary of business. It's actually called the secretary of commerce. That's what this agency does. Let me ask you a question. Can anybody name our current secretary of commerce? You know why? We don't have one. It's been vacant for over four months, and the president hasn't even proposed or put somebody in the job. We don't need another bureaucrat or another bureaucracy."
