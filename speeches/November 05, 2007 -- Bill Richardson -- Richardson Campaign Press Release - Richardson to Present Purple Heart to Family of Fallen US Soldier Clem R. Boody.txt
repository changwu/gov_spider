"I am deeply honored to present this medal to the family of Corporal Clem Robert Boody, and to recognize his contribution and sacrifice for our country," stated Governor Bill Richardson. "I'd also like to recognize the sacrifice of this family, like all POW/MIA families, who have held on to hope for so many years."
In 1954, the Secretary of the Army awarded Corporal Boody the Purple Heart posthumously for wounds received in action during the Korean conflict, the medal was never received by the family. The US Secretary of the Army Pete Geren provided the medal to Governor Richardson, for bringing Corporal Boody's remains from North Korea and for his efforts to secure the medal for the family.
In April, North Korean military leaders turned over the remains of six American soldiers, including those of Corporal Boody to a bipartisan delegation led by Governor Bill Richardson and former Veterans Affairs Secretary Anthony Principi.   Upon the request for help from the Boody family, Governor Richardson petitioned the Secretary of the Army to receive the medal the family had actively sought for five decades.
