    Let me thank all of you for coming here. And let me express my deepest appreciation for not only being here but the support that you are going to give us in the weeks ahead. We have less than 4 weeks to go before November 2, so we've got a lot of work to do, and we've got to do it fast and well, and November 2 will be a great victory for the American people.
I am honored to have on the platform here tonight a number of my very close, personal friends and very ardent and strong and effective supporters. Let me introduce them to you.
First, Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee and Mrs. Baker. And then, of course, your attorney general for the State of California, Evelle Younger. And we have two of my very close and very helpful friends from the United States Congress, Congressman Pete McCloskey, and another very good friend from the State of California, an outstanding Member of the House of Representatives, Don Clausen. And then there is a man who I have long admired, who I think will be an outstanding Member of the United States Senate, Dr. Hayakawa.
Now, just a minute to be serious. The reason we're going to. win on November 2 is that for the last 2 years, we have had good policies domestically, and we have had sound and effective policies internationally. We started from behind--and how many can remember just a few weeks ago, when the polls showed that we were 32 percent behind? I would much rather be a slow starter and a fast finisher.
I said in Kansas City, we don't concede a single State, we don't concede a single vote; that we were going to campaign from the snowy banks of Minnesota to the sandy plains of Georgia, and we are. California is one of the most crucial and critical States in this election. I am encouraged by the polls. We are behind, but we are going to win. Thank you for making it possible. Thank you for tonight.
