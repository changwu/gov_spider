    "With regards to Obamacare, he put that as a higher priority than our economy and as a result we have had forty straight months with unemployment above eight percent. The economy's not working; immigration is not working. This President has not been working in the right way for the American people. It's time for that to change." – Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "As you know, the Supreme Court is going to be dealing with whether or not Obamacare is constitutional. If it's not—if Obamacare is not deemed constitutional, then the first three and a half years of this President's term will have been wasted on something that does not help the American people. If it is deemed to stand, then I'll tell you one thing, we're going to have to have a president, and I'm that one, that's going to get rid of Obamacare and we're going to stop it on day one. What we're witnessing is a failure of the President's policies. He did not deal with immigration. With regards to Obamacare, he put that as a higher priority than our economy and as a result we have had forty straight months with unemployment above eight percent. The economy's not working; immigration is not working. This President has not been working in the right way for the American people. It's time for that to change."
