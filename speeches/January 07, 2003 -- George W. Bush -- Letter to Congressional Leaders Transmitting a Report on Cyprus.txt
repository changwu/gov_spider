    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with section 620C(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, I am providing a report prepared by my Administration on progress toward a negotiated solution of the Cyprus question covering the period October 1, 2002, through November 30, 2002. The previous submission covered events from August 1, 2002, through September 30, 2002. Particularly significant during this period was U.N. Secretary-General Annan's submission on November 11 to Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash of a proposed basis for a Cyprus agreement.
As in past reporting periods, U.S. officials provided diplomatic support to the process, including Secretary of State Powell, National Security Advisor Rice, Special Cyprus Coordinator Thomas G. Weston, and Ambassador to Cyprus Michael Klosson. The United States remains committed to the U.N. effort to find a just and lasting settlement to the Cyprus problem.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
