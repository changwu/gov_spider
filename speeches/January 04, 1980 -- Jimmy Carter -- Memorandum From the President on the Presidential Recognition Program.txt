    Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
Subject: Presidential Recognition Program
I am pleased to announce that ten individuals and one group have been selected to receive 1978 Presidential Management Improvement Awards. The names of the recipients are listed on the enclosure. Collectively, their achievements have saved the Government more than $50.5 million and have contributed significantly to advancements in science and technology, improving our national security, and providing better services to the public.
The winners were selected from a field of some 2,900 outstanding candidates. Since this program began two years ago, more than 4,200 employees and military members have been recognized for contributions which have saved the Government more than $479 million.
These gratifying results demonstrate my belief that Federal personnel are willing and able to contribute significantly to improving Government operations and services. Those serving in management positions can help provide the necessary motivation and incentive by listening to employee ideas and giving prompt recognition to exceptional performance.
I urge each of you to use our various awards programs to bring out the best in those who serve with you. So that I can continue to add my personal congratulations and thanks, I ask that you continue to provide me with the names of persons within your organization who contribute significantly to increasing productivity, improving services, conserving energy and other vital resources, eliminating paperwork, and developing and applying new and existing technology.
JIMMY CARTER
