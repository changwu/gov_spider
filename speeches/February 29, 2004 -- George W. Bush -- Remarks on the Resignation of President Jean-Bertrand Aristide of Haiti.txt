    President Aristide resigned. He has left his country. The Constitution of Haiti is working. There is an interim President, as per the Constitution, in place.
I have ordered the deployment of marines, as the leading element of an interim international force, to help bring order and stability to Haiti. I have done so in working with the international community.
This Government believes it essential that Haiti have a hopeful future. This is the beginning of a new chapter in the country's history. I would urge the people of Haiti to reject violence, to give this break from the past a chance to work. And the United States is prepared to help.
Thank you.
