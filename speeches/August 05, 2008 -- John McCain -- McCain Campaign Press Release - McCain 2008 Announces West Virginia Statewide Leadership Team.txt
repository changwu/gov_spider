    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced the West Virginia Statewide Leadership Team. This team of West Virginia leaders and grassroots activists will help organize and coordinate the campaign's grassroots efforts across the state and will communicate John McCain's message of greater national security, a stronger economy and meaningful government reform.
Each of West Virginia's 55 counties will have designated chairmen at the local level to serve as the points of contact for volunteers and supporters in each region and organize turnout efforts for Election Day.
John McCain's West Virginia campaign chairman and former Minority Leader Larry Swann said, "John McCain is a leader West Virginians can believe in. He will lead our nation forward with new policies to solve our nation's most pressing problems while preserving the rights and principles that are important to West Virginia. John McCain believes in lower taxes, more and better jobs, greater national security, and an energy policy that will move us away from our dependence on foreign oil."
"John McCain has the experience to be commander in chief on Day One. He doesn't need any on-the-job training. He has always put country first above his own self-interest. We are proud to support John McCain and we look forward to helping him to victory in November," Swann concluded.
