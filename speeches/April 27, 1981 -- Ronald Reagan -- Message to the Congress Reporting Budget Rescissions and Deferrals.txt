    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report six revisions to previously transmitted rescission proposals. Three of the revisions decrease the total amount proposed for rescission by $3.7 million. The other revisions to proposed rescissions make technical changes to appropriation language which do not affect the amounts proposed for rescission. In addition, I am reporting two new deferrals totaling $6.4 million and revisions to five previously reported deferrals.
The revisions to rescission proposals affect programs in the Departments of Agriculture and Energy, as well as ACTION and the National Science Foundation. The new deferrals and revisions to existing deferrals involve programs in the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Health and Human Services, and Transportation, as well as the Board for International Broadcasting and the International Communication Agency.
The details of each rescission proposal and deferral are contained in the attached reports.
