    President Bush is pleased to announce that he will host President Mwai Kibaki of Kenya for a State Visit on October 6, 2003. The visit will recognize Kenya's commitment to democracy, demonstrated by the government's historic transition last year. Kenya is at the forefront in fighting the global war on terror and is a leader in promoting regional stability through its mediation and peacekeeping efforts. President Bush looks forward to discussing with President Kibaki how the United States and Kenya can further strengthen our strategic partnership and broaden our cooperation on issues important to Africa and the world, including deepening trade relations and combating HIV/AIDS.
