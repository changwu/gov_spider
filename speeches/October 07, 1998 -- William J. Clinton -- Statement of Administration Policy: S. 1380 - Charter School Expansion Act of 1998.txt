    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Coats (R) IN and four others)
The Administration supports Senate passage of the pending manager's substitute for S. 1380. This substitute bill is consistent with the President's goal of encouraging the creation of more charter schools, while ensuring that these schools have the support, accountability, and flexibility needed to provide students and their families with more choices in public education.
