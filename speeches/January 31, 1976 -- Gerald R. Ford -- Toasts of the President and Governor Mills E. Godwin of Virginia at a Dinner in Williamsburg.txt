    Governor Godwin and distinguished citizens of the great Commonwealth of Virginia:
There is no way that I can adequately express my appreciation for the opportunity to participate in this wonderful day in the history of the Commonwealth. I have had a long experience with wonderful people from this State, people in private life as well as in public life. It has always been a great thrill to me to have lived in part in the Commonwealth and to have seen this great State grow and become a tremendous influence and have a great impact on our Union.
In coming down here I had the opportunity to do a little more reading about the great history of Virginia. And it is a thrill and it is an inspiration to have been a very small part of a great history of a great State--one of our Thirteen Colonies--of a growing, burgeoning, vitally important part of our 50 States. I thank you all for your hospitality, and I thank you, Governor Godwin, for your very generous comments. I wish you all the very best in our third century of a great history of a great Commonwealth in a great country.
