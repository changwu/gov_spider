    The National Organization for Women Political Action Committee (NOW PAC) is proud to endorse Senator Elizabeth Warren as the 46th President of the United States.
NOW PAC is the political arm of NOW, the largest grassroots feminist organization in the country.
The PAC evaluates federal candidates on their record and uncompromising dedication to the core issues of NOW: Constitutional Equality, Ending Violence Against Women, Economic Justice, LGBTQIA+ Justice, Racial Justice, and Reproductive Justice.
"Senator Warren has the most comprehensive, intersectional plans to tackle the issues important to NOW," said NOW PAC Chairwoman Toni Van Pelt. "Her campaign, her staff and her coalition of support shows her Administration will finally execute and pass these policies that NOW has worked toward for decades."
As NOW PAC has repeatedly called out, most candidates, debate moderators and the media only discuss the specific issues facing women through the lens of families and children and specific topics like reproductive health or pay equity.
"Warren understands that women have particular experiences with the economy, immigration, gun violence and climate changeâ€”and her policies and campaign reflect this," Van Pelt said. "And in particular, her campaign has repeatedly linked racial equity and gender equity to every issue."
