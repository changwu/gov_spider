    AUSTIN â€” Texas Gov. Rick Perry today issued the following statement on Vice President Joe Biden's comments regarding China's one child policy:
"China's one child policy has led to the great human tragedy of forced abortions throughout China, and Vice President Biden's refusal to 'second-guess' this horrendous policy demonstrates great moral indifference on the part of the Obama Administration. Americans value life, and we deserve leaders who will stand up against such inhumanity, not cast a blind eye."
