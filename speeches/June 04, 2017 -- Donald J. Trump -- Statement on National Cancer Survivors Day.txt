    On the first Sunday of June, communities across the United States celebrate National Cancer Survivors Day. This annual observance honors and celebrates the millions of Americans who have won their battles with cancer. These survivors provide hope to those currently fighting cancer and those who may one day fight their own battles.
Our Nation is proud of the scientific advances and medical ingenuity that have enabled more than 15 million Americans to beat cancer. Melania and I applaud the great advances made in science and medicine, and we reaffirm our Nation's commitment to defeating cancer and making survivorship a reality for all.
We join with all Americans in drawing inspiration from the perseverance of our Nation's cancer survivors. Their victories are our victories. We celebrate the success stories and we stand with those who are still on their journey to overcome cancer. With a reliance on personal faith and an enduring confidence, they can overcome any challenge.
We renew our sense of purpose in pursuit of a once inconceivable goal: ending cancer. The day will come when cancer can no longer evade the ingenuity of humankind. As we come closer to achieving this goal, we are heartened by the unbreakable spirit of all who battle cancer, and we proudly mark today as a celebration of life in their honor.
