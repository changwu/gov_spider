    I want to thank the voters of Connecticut who made it clear today: The answer is less Government spending, not more taxes. As I announced on March 20, the line-item spending cuts I am sending to Congress will eliminate some unneeded weapons systems made in Connecticut. Cutting spending is a tough call, especially in a State where the economy is hurting. In spite of this, we won an impressive victory today from people who understand that being President of the United States sometimes means making difficult decisions.
