    Michelle and I wish to express our deepest condolences on the passing of Mrs. Ann Nixon Cooper. From her beginnings in Shelbyville and Nashville, Tennessee, to her many years as a pillar of the Atlanta community, Ann lived a life of service. Whether it was helping to found the Girls Club for African American Youth, serving on the board of directors for the Gate City Nursery, working as a tutor at Ebenezer Baptist Church, or registering voters, Ann had a broad and lasting impact on her community. I also understand that as a wife, mother, and grandmother, Ann was a source of strength for her entire family and that she always put them first.
Over the course of her extraordinary 107 years, Ann saw both the brightest lights of our Nation's history and some of its darkest hours as well. It is especially meaningful for me that she lived to cast a vote on election day 2008, and it was a deep honor for me to mark her life in the speech I delivered that night. It was a life that captured the spirit of community and change and progress that is at the heart of the American experience, a life that inspired and will continue to inspire me in the years to come.
During this time of sadness, Michelle and I offer our deepest condolences to all who loved Ann Nixon Cooper. But even as we mourn her loss, we will also be rejoicing in all that she meant for her family, her community, and so many Americans.
