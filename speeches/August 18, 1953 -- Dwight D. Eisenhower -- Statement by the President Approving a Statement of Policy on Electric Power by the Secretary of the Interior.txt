    THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR is today announcing a policy governing the planning, generation, distribution, and disposal of electric power for which the Department of the Interior is the responsible agent under the law.
This policy is in accord with the principle that the states and local communities, private citizens and the Federal Government itself should cooperate in an effort actively to encourage the development of the natural resources of the country.
I fully approve of this policy, and the various Cabinet officers and agency heads who are directly concerned have expressed, after careful review of the problem, their full agreement. It is my hope and my considered belief that, translated into action, this policy will serve the best interests of all the people of the United States.
