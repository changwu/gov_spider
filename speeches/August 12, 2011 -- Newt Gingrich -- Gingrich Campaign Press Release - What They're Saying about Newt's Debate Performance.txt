    Consensus is that Newt Gingrich stole the show
in last night's Republican debate in Ames, IA
"The former House speaker was fired up and had a terrific debate. Substance on the issues has always been his forte and Newt showed that. He was also combative with the moderators, demanding they ask substantive questions. The audience responded very strongly to that. Gingrich showed a fire and passion that conservatives are longing for. He would utterly dismantle Barack Obama in a one-on-one debate. It was a terrific performance."
-Kevin Hall, IowaRepublican.com
"…his grasp of history and his ability to reference it in some of his answers is incredible…The best moment of the debate came when Gingrich took Fox News Anchor Chris Wallace to task. Doing so was risky, but Gingrich came off as the most serious candidate on the stage last night."
-Craig Robinson, IowaRepublican.com
"[Newt Gingrich] was forceful without looking undistinguished, aggressive without losing his self-dignity, informed, informative, and put leadership ahead of policy. This was the Gingrich of the 1994 Republican Revolution."
-Steve Deace, Host, Steve Deace Show in Iowa
"BEST PERFORMANCES: Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Both were humorous and forceful, Yepsen said."
-David Yepsen, former Des Moines Register columnist
"Newt Gingrich won the battle...most applause lines of any of the candidates. He said what Republicans feel....Bottom line: Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich were the winners."
-Frank Luntz, Pollster, (on Fox and Friends)
"Gingrich was simply head and shoulders above the rest. This is the Newt people have been waiting for; an articulate and forceful conservative who knows the world he lives in."
-Craig Shirley, Reagan biographer.
"Newt Gingrich was the biggest surprise…his attacks on the media put distance between his campaign's disastrous start – which the press has used to shape the narrative of his bid – and the experienced, shrewd politician we saw last night. His answers proved he understands how to get things done in Washington; Something voters might be more open to following the dysfunction around the debt crisis."
-Joe Trippi, Democratic Strategist
"I do think Newt had a good night, and I'm usually tough on Newt. He actually had the audience at one point booing Fox News in his favor."
-Joe Scarborough, Host, Morning Joe
"Gingrich looked in total command. He was authoritative and forceful, and he took on the media and President Obama. He appeared the real adult on the stage; the father figure or wise uncle."
-Mark McKinnon, The Daily Beast
Newt Gingrich really drove that home in the Iowa debate, catching the fire of the tea party's fierce urgency of now."
-Kathryn Lopez, National Review Online
"Newt Gingrich was the best and..Rick Santorum was a runner-up. They had a command of the issues as they saw them, and they made their arguments well for the most part."
-Jonah Goldberg, National Review Online (Goldberg File, no link)
"Gingrich: The winner. Wasn't even close. Showed why Obama would pee in his pants having to debate this man."
-Brent Bozell, President, Media Research Institute
"Oh how many times in the many years of these debates have I been waiting for a presidential candidate to do this. Thanks Newt!"
-Greg Henler, Townhall.com (on "gotcha" questions)
"Audience coming out of debate overwhelmingly say Gingrich came away winner. #gopdebate"
-Jo Ling Ken, NBC News, @JoNBCNews
"Gingrich & Romney did very well tonight. Both sounded presidential. Pawlenty diminished himself w/the Bachmann attacks.
"Gingrich's plain-talk ("that's just a dumb idea") and attacks on the media (which have merit) will earn him points. He did well.
-Paul Brandus, West Wing Report, @WestWingReport
"There's a difference between what you hear from the professional political class and the people out there on Twitter and so forth who thought that Newt Gingrich did phenomenally well. He planted a flag last night. I think he acquitted himself well in many respects."
-Michael Steele, Former RNC Chair on Morning Joe
