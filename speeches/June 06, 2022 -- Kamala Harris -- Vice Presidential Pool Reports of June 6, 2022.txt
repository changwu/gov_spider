VP travel pool report #2 - Background on reproductive rights roundtable
On Background from a White House Official 
Today, June 6, at 2:30 PM PT, Vice President Kamala Harris will host a roundtable with faith leaders to discuss the most urgent challenges facing our communities, from protecting reproductive rights, to addressing the epidemic of hate that is gripping our nation. The roundtable will take place at the LA County Federation of Labor.
Faith leaders play critical roles in their communities, and they are an important part of the coalition that is speaking out to unify our nation. During the conversation, participants will focus on reproductive health care in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's leaked opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that has put Roe v. Wade and access to safe reproductive health care in jeopardy. The Vice President will emphasize that the Administration will continue to fight for the health, safety, and well-being of women.
As the District Attorney of San Francisco, Attorney General of California, Senator from California, and now as Vice President, the Vice President has spent her career fighting for women. She continues to be a forceful advocate protecting women's reproductive rights across the country.

On May 11, 2022, the Vice President alsovirtually met with doctors and nurses on the frontlines about the impact that overturning Roe v. Wade would have on reproductive health care.
On September 9, 2021, the Vice President met with reproductive health providers and patientsat the White House to discuss the impact of Texas Senate Bill 8 and other restrictions on reproductive health.
As California Attorney General, she signed onto multiple amicus briefs to ensure women have full access to their reproductive health care.
The Biden-Harris Administration has made historic commitments to advancing gender equality, including standing up the White House's first-ever Gender Policy Council, dedicated to driving a whole-of-government effort that is advancing gender equity and equality, from championing women's access to high quality and equitable health care; to women's rights, equal opportunities and pay, equal protection, and safety from gender-based harassment and violence.

o The President and Vice President have continued to stand side by side with women to protect and defend the long-recognized, constitutional right to abortion.o In response to Texas's SB 8, the President and Vice President strongly denounced the law as an affront to a woman's constitutional rights under Roe v. Wade. The President and Vice President directed the Gender Policy Council and White House Counsel to lead a whole-of-government effort to protect women's rights across this country.o The Biden-Harris Administration is continuing to speak out as extremist Republican leaders are weaponizing the use of the law in states across the country to punish and control women.· Last week, Vice President Harris released a video about what is at stake with Roe v. Wade.

The Vice President will continue to work with Members of Congress, state advocates and legislators, stakeholders, and those on the frontlines of the fight to protect reproductive rights.

VP travel pool report #4 - Roundtable remarks
Pool was escorted into the room where Harris was seated at the center of the room at 2:24pm ET. The tables were positioned in a U-shape against the backdrop of 3 California and 3 US flags.
She thanked Sen. Padilla, Rep. Jimmy Gomez, Lt. Gov Kounalakis and Mayor Garcetti.
"I know that no matter the differences among us in society, there's so much more in common than what separates us. And I think most people, regardless of who they are would agree, we need faith in each other, in our nation, and in our future," she said.
Harris said she would talk about how certain communities are being targeted because of misinformation and "how hate manifests itself in violent acts, most of which are committed with the use of guns and what they're for that requires sensible laws."
She said they will also talk about the impending SCOTUS decision regarding Roe v Wade and the people who are going to be directly impacted by that decision and "how we uplift them."
A conversation that " requires us to also discuss whether we value the concept of self determination."
"It is simply about agreeing that a woman should be able to make a decision with her faith leader, with her family... And the government should not be making that decision."
She commented on the Louisiana abortion bill at the end of her remarks, noting that it takes away this right "with no exception."
"So the threat to all of these principles and priorities is very clear and imminent," she said.
Pool was ushered out at 2:33pm ET.

Our legacy at El Cholo lies in its commitment to quality ingredients, long family history, loyal employees (some with over 40 years) and our dear devoted clientele. Through prohibition, the LA Riots, true Hollywood glamour and into the the 2000's, El Cholo continues to bring back memories for our guests.
