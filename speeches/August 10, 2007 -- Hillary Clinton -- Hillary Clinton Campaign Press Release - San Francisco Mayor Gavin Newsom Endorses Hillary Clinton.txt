    Newsom named a National Co-Chair of Clinton Campaign
The Clinton Campaign announced the endorsement of San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom today, demonstrating Hillary's growing support in the Bay Area and throughout California. Mayor Newsom will join the campaign as a national co-chair.
The announcement came as the two toured the New Academy of Sciences, the nation's largest "green" building, and discussed their shared commitment to combating global warming and moving the nation toward energy independence.
"Hillary Clinton has been fighting for progressive values for decades and she has shown us all that she is ready to lead our country as we face enormous challenges," said Mayor Newsom. "Today's event highlights her commitment to the environment and energy independence, an issue that San Franciscans take very seriously. Whether it is health care, the environment or getting us out of this war, Senator Clinton has the experience to bring the change we need in this country."
"I am honored to receive the endorsement of Mayor Newsom, whose made San Francisco a leader in the fight to stop global warming and preserve our environment," said Clinton.
Clinton has proposed a Green Building Fund that would allocate $1 billion a year to states to improve energy efficiency in public buildings, such as schools, police stations firehouses and offices and create as many as 50,000 new jobs. She has also outlined plans for a $50 billion strategic energy fund that to fund energy technologies that will reduce America's oil dependence and greenhouse gas emissions while promoting new jobs and a cleaner environment.
Mayor Newsom has embraced brought fresh ideas and renewed energy to the City of San Francisco since he was elected in 2003. He has earned a reputation as an innovator on issues ranging from equality to homelessness. He has also championed important issues such as the environment, healthcare, and education.
Striving to undertake the issues that affect people globally, Mayor Newsom has elevated San Francisco's environmental stature. In 2004, he unveiled San Francisco's Climate Action Plan, which aims to reduce local greenhouse gas emissions by more than 2.5 million tons by 2012 and curb global warming through strict goals that exceed the United Nations Kyoto Protocols.
The Mayor has also set a course for San Francisco to have the cleanest public transportation fleet in the nation by 2007, as well as transition the city's entire taxi fleet to hybrid, alternative fuel, and green vehicles. In addition, San Francisco led 150 cities in signing the Urban Environmental Accords, which mandated the implementation of green building and public space improvements. Mayor Newsom has also committed to studying new alternative sources of energy that exist – such as tidal, wave, and wind power – because of San Francisco's unique placement at the gateway to the Golden Gate and Pacific Ocean.
Mayor Newsom joins other elected officials from the Bay Area in supporting Hillary, including Senator Dianne Feinstein, Rep. Ellen Tauscher, Assemblymembers SandrÃ© Swanson and Fiona Ma, as well as Sunnyvale Mayor Otto Lee. Other California supporters include Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez, Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, Rep. Jane Harman, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, and civil rights leader Dolores Huerta.
