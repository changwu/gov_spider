    Urbandale, Iowa — Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann issued the following statement in response to President Obama's jobs plan which includes $1.5 trillion in new taxes:
"Mr. President — you don't create jobs by increasing taxes on job creators. The President's plan to raise taxes on the American people is the wrong policy to create economic growth and jobs and shows he doesn't understand how to turn our economy around. Two businesses I will visit in Iowa today are examples of why the President's policies continue to dig us deeper into the hole toward another recession. Both fear the coming regulations, taxes and costs of Obamacare. And both face uncertainty in the tax code. The President's gimmicks and tax increases on the backs of small business and the middle class won't grow our economy. Only permanent fixes will. The President should allow for repatriation of American money overseas, truly reform the entire tax code so it is fairer and flatter on all Americans, and get rid of job killing regulations, including on the energy sector, which will create millions of jobs.
"If Warren Buffett believes he doesn't pay enough taxes, then he should write a check today to the Treasury, but he and the President shouldn't enact warfare on the millions of small businesses, on charities and on middle class America with increased tax burdens. The President is compromising the future of our children with his plan to continue spending and increase taxes, and he is ruining the American economy."
