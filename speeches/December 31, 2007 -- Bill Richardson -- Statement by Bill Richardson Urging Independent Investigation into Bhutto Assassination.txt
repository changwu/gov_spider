    Says Musharraf has lost all credibility
PERRY, IA-- New Mexico Governor and Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Richardson today reacted to revelations that a Pakistani police chief apparently blocked an autopsy on Benazir Bhutto and to a new video raising doubts about the official Pakistani explanation of her death. Governor Richardson has served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and has extensive diplomatic experience around the world, including in Pakistan and Southern Asia. Below is his statement:
"These reports raise even more questions about Musharraf's credibility. The way forward in Pakistan will require two steps: conducting an independent international investigation into the events surrounding Bhutto's assassination and having Musharraf step down and allow for free and fair elections. I stand with the Pakistan Peoples Party in its call for such an investigation.
"I am extremely disappointed both in President Bush and my fellow Presidential candidates who continue to back the failed dictator Musharraf. The Washington insiders have it tragically wrong. The longer that we back Musharraf, the more likely it is that the world will pay a horrible price. Every day that America is associated with his anti-democratic policies, the greater the likelihood that Pakistan will go the way of Iran.
"The choice between security and democracy is a false one.
"Stability in Pakistan will be achieved only via free and fair elections, and those cannot occur while Musharraf runs the nation. Those who cannot see that reality, those who choose a false and hollow security over human rights, and those who prefer short-term ease at the cost of long-term disaster plainly have not learned the lessons of history.
"Where is the leadership?"
