    The White House, March 9, 1921.
I very respectfully invite the attention of the Senate to the pending treaty which has been negotiated between the United States and the Republic of Colombia which is in the hands of your honorable body, with full information relating to its negotiation and its later modification and revision.
The early and favorable consideration of this treaty would be very helpful at the present time in promoting our friendly relationships. There have been many and long delays in dealing with this treaty until we have been made to seem unmindful, when in truth we have had no thought but to deal with this sister Republic in a most cordial consideration. I believe the revised treaty to be a fair expression of our just and friendly relationship with the Republic of Colombia, and I would rejoice to have our example in dealing with the Republic of Colombia to be made an assurance of that promptness and firmness and justice which shall invite added confidence in our Government and a new regard for our own Republic.
WARREN G. HARDING.
