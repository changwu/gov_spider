    Today in Iowa City, Pat Heiden, a member of the Johnson County Board of Supervisors, announced her endorsement of Senator Kamala Harris at Harris' town hall at the University of Iowa.
"I am thrilled to personally endorse Senator Harris for President of the United States. Why am I endorsing her? Because she is fierce. She is fearless. And she has a proven record as a determined fighter on behalf of all people," Heiden said.
"Senator Harris believes that health care is a right, not a privilege. She also advocates to increase access to mental health care. She supports a $15 an hour minimum wage, and equal pay for men and women," she continued. "Senator Harris has a long record of immigration work. She is a staunch advocate for women's health and rights. She supports a ban on assault weapons and the sale of high-capacity magazines. And she supports middle class tax breaks to address the high costs of child care, housing, and tuition."
"I am so honored to have Pat's support," Harris said. "In Johnson County Pat has been an extraordinary leader, particularly on the issue of affordable housing, something I hope to be her partner on. Her guidance in Johnson County will be invaluable to me, and I look forward to working together and am so lucky to have her on my team."
Heiden was elected to the Johnson County Board of Supervisors in November of 2018. Heiden joins other prominent Johnson County Democrats who have endorsed Senator Harris, including Iowa powerhouses Sue and Bob Dvorsky as well as Coralville City Councilwoman Meghann Foster.
