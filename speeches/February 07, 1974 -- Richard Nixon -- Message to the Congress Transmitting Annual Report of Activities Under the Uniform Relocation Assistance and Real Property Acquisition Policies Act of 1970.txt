    To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting today the third annual report of each Executive department and agency on their activities during fiscal year 1973 under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970.
In general, the agencies' reports indicate that the Uniform Act has been well received by those displaced by Federal and federally-assisted projects and by the affected communities. The assistance provided by the Uniform Act largely compensates persons for the disruptions and inconveniences resulting from public acquisition. The payments made to persons who relocate have had a generally favorable impact on the public, and the down payment assistance provisions of the Uniform Act have resulted in increased home ownership opportunities for some displaced persons.
The agencies' reports indicate that the primary criticism directed toward the Uniform Act has been expressed on behalf of displaced small businesses. Agencies are not able to deal with the problems of displaced businesses as successfully as they can deal with those of individuals displaced from their homes. This matter will be reviewed to determine possible solutions.
During the past year, I transferred responsibility for executive branch leadership in the implementation of the Uniform Act to the General Services Administration. The Administrator has recently reported to me concerning accomplishments under this program and has also outlined plans to assure continuation of programs initiated by the Office of Management and Budget and to further improve the administration of the Uniform Act. I endorse these efforts and include his report as an attachment to this transmittal.
