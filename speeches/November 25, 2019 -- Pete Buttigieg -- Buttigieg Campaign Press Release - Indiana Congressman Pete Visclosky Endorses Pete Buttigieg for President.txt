    SOUTH BEND, IN â€” Today, U.S. Rep. Pete Visclosky (D-Merrillville) announced his endorsement of Pete Buttigieg for President, citing his record of standing with working families and his vision for an economy that works for everyone.
"For decades, I've worked alongside the labor community to ensure that Hoosier families could get a fair shake. With labor rights under assault across the country, we need a leader who views fair wages and safe working conditions as key to the economic success of this nation," said Rep. Visclosky. "I've known Mayor Pete Buttigieg for nearly a decade. I've seen him stand with organized labor and have admired his successful record of creating economic opportunities for working families against great odds. It gives me great pride to endorse Pete Buttigieg for President of the United States. We deserve a president who has not only fought for our country but who will continue to fight for an economy that works for everyone. Pete has seen firsthand what corporate recklessness can do to American families and I'm confident he can usher in a new era of economic success."
