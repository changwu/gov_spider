    SIMI VALLEY, Calif. — Ted Cruz has consistently led the fight to secure our borders, which is of vital interest to our national security.
"We have got to get serious about securing the borders. And if you go and you talk with law enforcement — as you know, I represent Texas. We have got 1,200 miles of border with Mexico. When you go visit with law enforcement, when you visit with Border Patrol agents about what works, the number one most effective tool that works is boots on the ground," Cruz told CBS's Face the Nation.
That's why I filed legislation to triple the Border Patrol. I was very glad to see that Donald Trump agrees with that proposal.
The legislation I filed would also increase four-fold the fixed- wing and rotary-wing aircraft, so we use technology to monitor the border to supplement the boots on the ground. But then, beyond that, 40 percent of illegal immigration doesn't come across the border at all. It's visa overstays.
So, the legislation I introduced would put in place a strong biometric exit-entry system, so we can stop visa overstays. And, finally, we should put in place a robust E-Verify system, so you can't get a job without demonstrating you're here legally.
It's not that we don't know how to solve illegal immigration. What is missing is the political will to get it done. And, as president, I will get it done. We will secure the borders.
