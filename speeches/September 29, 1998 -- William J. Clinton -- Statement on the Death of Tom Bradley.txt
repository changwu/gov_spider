    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of Mayor Tom Bradley. The son of a sharecropper who became a police lieutenant, he rose to lead our Nation's second largest city for two decades. He was a builder, bringing a remarkably successful Olympic Games to Los Angeles, encouraging a thriving downtown and improving mass transit. Just as important, he built bridges across the lines that divide us, uniting people of many races and backgrounds in the most diverse city in America. He was a pioneer and a leader. Our thoughts and prayers are with Ethel and their family.
