    I commend the Congress for finishing work on the 2003 appropriations bills. This budget will provide valuable resources for priorities such as homeland security, military operations, and education, while adhering to the spending restraint set forth in my budget. I look forward to signing this legislation and to continuing a course of fiscal discipline.
