    The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attack in Dimona, Israel, today that killed one Israeli citizen and injured many others. We extend condolences to the family of the innocent victim killed in this brutal attack and wish those wounded a rapid recovery.
We also condemn those terrorist groups, including Hamas, which condone these horrific actions. We call upon the leaders of the Palestinian Authority, who condemned this attack, to redouble their efforts to act against terrorism.
