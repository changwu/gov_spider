    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Sen. Hatch (R) Utah and 7 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 151, which would revise and strengthen the nation's child pornography laws in light of the United States Supreme Court's decision in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition. Passage of the bill would be an important step in protecting children from abuse by ensuring effective child pornography prosecutions.
