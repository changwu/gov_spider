Verona, PA - Friday evening, during an appearance on Fox News Channel's "On the Record" with Greta Van Susteren, Republican Presidential Candidate Rick Santorum challenged former House Speaker Newt Gingrich to a "Lincoln-Douglas" style debate in Iowa. The debate challenge was issues after former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney refused to debate Gingrich in a Human Events/RedState debate in Washington, DC.
Senator Santorum said: "Newt's been campaigning on doing Lincoln-Douglas style debates and I think it's a great idea - Count me in. The voters deserve more than 60 second sound bites, they deserve substance and real solutions to the problems facing our nation. This will be a great opportunity for the people of Iowa to learn more about us, our records, and our vision for America. Newt and I have been friends for 20 years, so this will be fun. Game on."
Mike Biundo, Santorum Campaign Manager, said: "Speaker Gingrich is an ideas politician, but that doesn't mean all his ideas are good - an individual mandate for health care, amnesty for illegal immigrants, and Wall Street bailouts align closely with Barack Obama. Senator Santorum is a conviction candidate who has a record of consistent conservative successes, and he will put that record and his vision for a brighter America up against anyone."
