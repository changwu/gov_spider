Marco has emphasized that he can bring the exact opposite mindset and ideas to the presidency:

This election had better be about the future, not the past. It'd better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today, not simply the issues we once faced. This country is facing an economy that has been radically transformed.
If I'm our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton going to lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck? I was raised paycheck to paycheck. How is she going to lecture me about student loans? I owed over $100,000 just four years ago.
If I'm our nominee, we will be the party of the future.
