    Well, we better get down to business here. I'd like to thank all of you, first of all, for coming down on what turned out to be very short notice. But there's a lot of pressing business before we all leave Washington, and one of the major issues is certainly welfare reform.
As I said last year in the State of the Union Address, the principal issue in any welfare reform proposal is whether or not it'll help people become self-sufficient and lead a full life or keep them in a state of dependency. I feel strongly that we're on the right track in proposing the Low-Income Opportunity Act, which would allow States to test new ideas for reducing dependency. We also believe in the need to reform work requirements and to provide training and education, a greater opportunity through work. The GROW program would allow us to do that.
I know that all of you've been under some pressure to sign on the so-called welfare reform bills that would increase benefits and make welfare more attractive. And I commend you for your willingness to follow a responsible path to prevent increased dependency. And, Bob, I understand that your task force has worked diligently with members of the administration to come up with a proposal that we can all work together on. And, Hank, I'm most appreciative of what you offered as an alternative.
