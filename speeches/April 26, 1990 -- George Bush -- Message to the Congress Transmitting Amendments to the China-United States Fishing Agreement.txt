    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94 - 265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the People's Republic of China amending and extending the 1985 Agreement Concerning Fisheries off the Coasts of the United States, which was effected by exchange of notes at Washington, March 14 and 22, 1990. This agreement extends the 1985 agreement for an additional 2 years until July 1, 1992, and amends the port access procedures contained in the 1985 agreement. The exchange of notes, together with the present agreement, constitute a governing international fishery agreement within the meaning of section 201(c) of the act.
Because of the importance of our fisheries relations with the People's Republic of China, I urge that the Congress give favorable consideration to this agreement.
George Bush
The White House,
April 26, 1990.
