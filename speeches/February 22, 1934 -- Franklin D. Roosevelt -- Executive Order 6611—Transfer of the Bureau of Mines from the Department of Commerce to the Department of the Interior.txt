    Whereas section 16 of the act of March 3, 1933 (ch. 212, 47 Stat. 1517), provides for reorganizations witliin the executive branch of the Government, requires the President to investigate and determine what reorganizations are necessary to effectuate the purposes of the act, and authorizes the President to make such reorganizations by Executive order; and
Whereas after investigation I find and declare that the transfer of the Bureau of Mines and its functions from the Department of Commerce to the Department of the Interior is necessary to effectuate the purposes of said section 16;
Now, Therefore, by virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by the aforesaid section 16 of the act of March 3, 1933, it is ordered that the Bureau of Mines and all the functions thereof, together with its personnel, records, supplies, equipment, and property of every kind, unexpended balances of appropriations and/or allotments in Washington and elsewhere, be, and they are hereby, transferred from the Department of Commerce to the Department of the Interior, to be administered under the supervision of the Secretary of the Interior.
This order will become effective in accordance with the provisions of section 1 of title III of the act of March 20, 1933 (ch. 3, 48 Stat. 16): Provided, That in case it shall appear to the President that the interests of economy require that the transfer be delayed beyond the date this order becomes effective, he may, in his discretion, fix a later date therefor, and he may for like cause further defer such date from time to time.
