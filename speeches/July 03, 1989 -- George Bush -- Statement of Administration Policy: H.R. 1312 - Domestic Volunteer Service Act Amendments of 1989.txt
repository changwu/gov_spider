    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Owens (D) NY)
The Administration supports reauthorization of the volunteer programs administered by the ACTION agency and has proposed legislation (H.R. 2035) for this purpose.
The Administration does not object to House passage of H.R. 1312, but will work in the Senate to eliminate several objectionable provisions. These provisions interfere with ACTION'S administrative structure and management flexibility to administer the agency's programs effectively. The Administration will also seek to reduce the authorization level of $212.2 million for FY 1990 in H.R. 1312 to the $170.4 million level proposed in H.R. 2035.
