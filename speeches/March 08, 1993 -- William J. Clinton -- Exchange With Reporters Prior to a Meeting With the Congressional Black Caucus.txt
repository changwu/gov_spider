    Spending Cuts
Q. Mr. President, do you agree to the extra $50 billion in cuts that the House and Senate leaders want?
The President. I agree that we will have a budget resolution which will be roughly conforming to the reestimates of the CBO in general terms and that will still contain the investment strategy that I want to pursue.
