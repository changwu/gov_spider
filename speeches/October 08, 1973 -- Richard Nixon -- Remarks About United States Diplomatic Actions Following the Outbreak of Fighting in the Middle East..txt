    WE HAVE nothing to add to the official pronouncements that have been made-or announcements, I should say--with regard to the Mideast situation.
Last night, I had a rather long talk with Dr. Kissinger, shortly before midnight, getting the late reports. This morning, I was here around 7: 30 or so and studied all of the reports, both with regard to the military situation and the reaction to our diplomatic initiative.
Dr. Kissinger and I have been meeting for a good part of the morning here on particularly that diplomatic initiative, and having in mind the importance of getting strong support for the position that the United States will take.
It is very easy to think of this particular kind of a crisis simply in terms of a grandstand play, where the United States will go in and unilaterally make a move which then fails. I can assure you that Dr. Kissinger and his colleagues have been very busy and that we are developing support for a position which we hope and believe will be effective in stopping the fighting.
Doctor, would you like to add a word to that?
SECRETARY KISSINGER. No, I think you have summed up the situation, Mr. President. We have been in close contact, at the President's instruction, with all the permanent members of the Security Council, with the parties to the conflict. And we have been doing this since Saturday afternoon in order to bring an end to the fighting, and we will now see what develops at the Security Council session this afternoon. Our intention is to move forward with the broadest possible support that can be effected.
