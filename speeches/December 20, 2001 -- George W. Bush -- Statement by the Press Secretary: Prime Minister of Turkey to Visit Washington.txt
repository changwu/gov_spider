    President Bush will welcome Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit to Washington on January 16, 2002. This visit provides an opportunity to deepen United States cooperation with Turkey, a staunch NATO ally, on counterterrorism, Afghanistan, the Caucasus and Central Asia, Cyprus, NATO and the European Union, the Balkans, and implementation of Turkeys economic reforms. Turkey's strong offers of assistance during Operation Enduring Freedom have underscored the vibrancy of our strategic partnership.
