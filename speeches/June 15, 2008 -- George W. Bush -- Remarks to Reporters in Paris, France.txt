    Midwest Flooding/Father's Day
Laura and I had the joy of worshiping here in Paris.
My thoughts and prayers go out to those who are suffering from the floods in our country. I know there's a lot of people hurting right now, and I hope they're able to find some strength in knowing that there is love from a higher being.
I also want to wish all the fathers in America happy Father's Day. So, Dad, if you're listening, happy Father's Day.
Thank you all.
