    SANTA FE, NM -- Governor Bill Richardson today announced that Robert Becker, a seasoned political operative and Tom Reynolds, an experienced communications specialist, will be joining the campaign as the Iowa Statewide Director and Communications Director.
"We're excited to have Robert and Tom on board, they are both great additions to the team and our growing support in Iowa," stated Governor Richardson. "They know Iowa and Iowans and their combined political and campaign experience, within the state and nationally, will help our campaign immensely."
Becker has spent over 15 years in Democratic politics throughout the United States as a Campaign Manager and Senior Strategist working for Presidential, Gubernatorial, Mayoral, Congressional and Senate candidates. Becker ran Polk County for Senator Bill Bradley's Presidential campaign in 2000.
"Richardson's record is unbeatable," said Becker. "We are going to run a grassroots campaign that showcases the Governor and his real record of accomplishment directly to the voters of Iowa. The Governor recognizes the value of the Caucuses and will vigorously compete for people's support."
Reynolds most recently served as Press Secretary for Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA), where he assisted in managing the day-to-day activities of the communications office, message development and strategic communications planning. Â Before joining Harkin's staff, Reynolds worked as the Communications Director for Rep. Jane Harman (D-CA), helping raise her national media profile on intelligence and homeland security issues.
"Governor Richardson brings to the presidential contest unrivaled experience at a time when the country is looking for seasoned leadership," said Reynolds. "It is an honor to join his staff and I look forward to contributing to the campaign's strong effort in Iowa."
