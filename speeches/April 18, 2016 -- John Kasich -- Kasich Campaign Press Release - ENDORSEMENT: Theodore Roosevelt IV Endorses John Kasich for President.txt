    Today Theodore "Ted" Roosevelt IV, the great-grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt, endorsed Gov. John Kasich for President.
Earlier this month, Gov. Kasich visited Sagamore Hill, the home of President Roosevelt in Oyster Bay, New York. 
Said Roosevelt, "I have known Governor Kasich for years. In my opinion he is by far the best-qualified Republican candidate and the only one who could win the general election. I am honored to endorse him."

Ted Roosevelt is a retired U.S. Navy officer who served for two years in Vietnam as a Navy SEAL. He is also a leading conservationist voice in the Republican Party, serving as the Chair of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. Having previously served as a U.S. foreign service officer, he is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, Foreign Policy Association and Economic Club of New York. 
Said Kasich, "Ted is a passionate public servant in the tradition of his great-grandfather, and it's an honor for me to receive his endorsement today. We share the same desire to lift people from the shadows and leave a safer, more prosperous country for future generations. I'm grateful for his support."
