    Verona, PA - The Rick Santorum for President campaign is proud to announce that it has received the endorsement of over 200 national and state conservative leaders. This group of esteemed conservative leaders, activists, and elected officials includes: Gary Bauer, Dr. James Dobson, Michelle Malkin, Penny Nance, and Richard Viguerie.
Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said: "It is encouraging that conservatives are uniting behind Rick Santorum, the only candidate who can stop Mitt Romney and defeat Barack Obama. These leaders know that a strong, full-spectrum conservative is needed in this crucial election and Rick Santorum has been a consistent defender of conservatism in good times and in bad. They understand we cannot nominate a candidate who has also defended an individual healthcare mandate, supported cap-and-tax, or the Wall Street bailouts - we need a bold contrast with Barack Obama. Rick Santorum has been their champion, and that is why they are uniting behind his candidacy to serve as our next commander-in-chief."
