President Obama's latest executive actions targeting gun owners are just part of a long record of trying to weaken Americans' Second Amendment rights.

Here's what Marco had to say this morning on Fox News about the President's announcement: 
It undermines the Second Amendment and it will do nothing to keep people safe. Barack Obama is obsessed with undermining the Second Amendment, a pertinent protection our Constitution recognizes and defends for us. He is looking for anyway possible to undermine it. He has been doing this forever. Now this executive order is just one more way to make it harder for law-abiding people to buy weapons or to be able to protect their families. This is going to do nothing to prevent violence or crimes, because criminals don't buy guns that way. They buy from the black market.
The President's refusal to admit this is nothing new, Marco said:
It is part of a broader narrative that this president is obsessed with undermining the Constitution in general, but the Second Amendment in particular. He is obsessed with undermining it and he will do nothing, not this executive order or even the things he stands for related to this issue will do nothing to prevent gun violence and gun crimes in America, because criminals do not follow the law.
Marco has already pledged to reverse Obama's executive orders targeting gun rights on day one as President.
