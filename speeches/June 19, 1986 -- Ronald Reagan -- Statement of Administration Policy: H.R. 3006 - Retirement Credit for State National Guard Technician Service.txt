    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Montgomery (D) MS and Barnes (D) MD)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3006 because it would disrupt a long-standing compromise arrangement that allowed crediting of State National Guard technician service under civil service retirement only for those technicians who converted to the Federal technician program. This bill would, instead substitute an unrestricted retirement credit benefit that serves no Federal purpose.
