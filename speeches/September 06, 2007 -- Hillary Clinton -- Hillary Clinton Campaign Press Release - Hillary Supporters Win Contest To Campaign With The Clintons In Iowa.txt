    Georgia Man, Michigan Woman Star In New Web Video
The Clinton Campaign launched a web video today starring Hillary's millionth supporter Ron Wood of Georgia, and longtime supporter Michelle Smith of Michigan, who joined Hillary and President Clinton on the campaign trail in Iowa on Labor Day. Wood and Smith won a competition to join the Clintons on the road after signing up to support Hillary online.
"It's amazing, because all of my friends say that ‘you are the biggest Clinton supporter in the world. It's got to be fate. It's got to be karma that you were the one picked,'" Wood said.
Wood said he decided to contribute to Hillary's campaign after watching her strong performance in the CNN/YouTube debate in July.
"She was really nice and sweet," Wood said about campaigning with Hillary. "I asked if I was allowed to hug her and she said, ‘hug away.'"
Smith is a sixth grade teacher in the Harper Woods School District in Wayne County, Michigan, and has supported Hillary since she kicked off her campaign in late January.
"She talked to me a little bit about teaching, and how she remembers her sixth grade teacher," Smith said of her time with Hillary in Iowa. "It was fantastic to meet her and talk to her. She was very kind. I know I will be telling my grandchildren about this some day. I plan to make a scrapbook with all of my pictures and mementos. I look forward to the day that Senator Clinton is named the President of the United States."
"It's grassroots supporters like Ron and Michelle who make a difference in this campaign and in this country," Hillary Clinton said. "I'm delighted that they were able to join us for a glimpse of life on the campaign trail. With their help and millions like them, we can deliver the change this country needs."
