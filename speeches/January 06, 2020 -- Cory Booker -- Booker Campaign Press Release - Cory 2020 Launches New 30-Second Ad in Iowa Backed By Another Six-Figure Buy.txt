    "Rise" Highlights Cory's Record of Bringing People Together in Common Purpose
Newark, NJ â€” Backed by another six-figure buy, Cory 2020 will launch a new 30-second spot in Iowa today.
The ad, titled "Rise," highlights Cory's commitment to bringing people together to ignite our spirit of common purpose, and inspiring us to not only win this election, but to take on the biggest challenges in our country that are leaving so many people and so many communities behind.
Below is a transcript of the spot:
BOOKER: In Iowa and homes across America, we feel a common pain. And our spirit is tested by those who want to tear us apart. We face our generation's great choice -- whether to break into factions or rise in common purpose.
A spark that starts here in Iowa will ignite the nation. Join us, and we will rise together.
I'm Cory Booker and I approve this message.
