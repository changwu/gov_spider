    On Friday, December 9 at 11:45 AM ET, the White House will host a virtual town hall event on the importance of getting an updated COVID-19 vaccine this holiday season, especially for Americans ages 50 and older. The event will feature Chief Medical Advisor to the President and Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci, White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha, and AARP Chief Executive Officer Jo Ann Jenkins. Participants will hear from top experts about how to stay protected from COVID-19 and why getting the updated COVID-19 vaccine ahead of the holiday season is critical – especially for older Americans.
This event is part of the Biden Administration's six-week campaign to urge more Americans to get their updated COVID-19 vaccine before the end of the year. This event will be open press and livestreamed at www.whitehouse.gov/live. For media interested in covering the event in-person at the White House, RSVP HERE by Thursday 12/8 at 5:00 PM ET.
