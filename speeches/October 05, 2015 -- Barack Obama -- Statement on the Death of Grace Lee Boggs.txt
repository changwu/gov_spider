    Michelle and I were saddened to hear of the passing of author, philosopher, and activist Grace Lee Boggs. Grace dedicated her life to serving and advocating for the rights of others: from her community activism in Detroit, to her leadership in the civil rights movement, to her ideas that challenged us all to lead meaningful lives. As the child of Chinese immigrants and as a woman, Grace learned early on that the world needed changing, and she overcame barriers to do just that. She understood the power of community organizing at its core: the importance of bringing about change and getting people involved to shape their own destiny. Grace's passion for helping others and her work to rejuvenate communities that had fallen on hard times spanned her remarkable 100 years of life and will continue to inspire generations to come. Our thoughts and prayers are with Grace's family and friends and all those who loved her dearly.
