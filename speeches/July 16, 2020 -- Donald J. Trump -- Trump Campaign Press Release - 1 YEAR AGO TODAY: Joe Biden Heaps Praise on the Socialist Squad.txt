    Too weak to stand up to the radical left, Biden is taking orders from them.
One year ago today, Joe Biden called far-left Democrat Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) "brilliant," and the rest of the socialist squad "really smart." Now he's taking orders from her and Bernie Sanders, who once said, "I don't mind people calling me a communist."
Biden and Sanders released a "unity platform" starring AOC as a co-chair on climate policy. "I'm working with Bernie and his people," Biden said. AOC authored the Green New Deal, which Biden has embraced.
Sanders touts the fact that he forced Biden to move "a whole lot" to the left and thinks Biden would be "the most progressive president since FDR." Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, was also given a leadership role on the Biden-Sanders task force, and brags about "really push[ing]" Biden's "platform much further" to the left.
Biden is too weak to stand up to the radical left, so he's completely surrendered to them. He's a Trojan horse for the extreme, left-wing agenda.
That's why Biden is putting America last and illegal aliens first. It's why he's pledging to sacrifice hundreds of thousands of blue-collar energy jobs and end American energy production. It's why he pledging to raise taxes on middle-class families, shut down charter schools and take away school choice from parents and children. It's why he said he would "absolutely" cut funding for police.
As Biden bows to the far-left radicals running the Democrat party, it's clear your family won't be safe in Joe Biden's America, and neither will your paycheck.
