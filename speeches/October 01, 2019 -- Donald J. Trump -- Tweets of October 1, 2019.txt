'The congratulatory phone call with the Ukrainian President was PERFECT unless you heard Liddle' Adam Schiff's fraudulently made up version of the call. This is just another Fake News Media together with their partner the Democrat Party HOAX!Retweets: 19657Favorites: 79880

So if the so-called 'Whistleblower' has all second hand information and almost everything he has said about my 'perfect' call with the Ukrainian President is wrong (much to the embarrassment of Pelosi & Schiff) why aren't we entitled to interview & learn everything about....Retweets: 20466Favorites: 88926

As I predicted Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve have allowed the Dollar to get so strong especially relative to ALL other currencies that our manufacturers are being negatively affected.
