    I am extremely pleased that the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee has today voted to report the civil service reform act. Despite forecasts by some that this action would not come for some time, the committee has acted quickly and expeditiously. I feel that is a major accomplishment.
I congratulate Chairman Robert Nix, Vice Chairman Morris Udall, and the ranking minority member, Edward Derwinski, for their leadership in guiding the civil service reforms through the committee. I want to thank all members, both Democrats and Republicans, for the diligence and thoroughness with which they have worked.
The bill reported from committee carries forward the major thrust of my civil service reform proposal, though there were some amendments added by the committee that I opposed. I look forward to speedy House floor action on this legislation, which is so important to making our Government better serve the American people.
