    Wow! Thanks to your generous support, my campaign raised over $4 million dollars during the last fundraising quarter!
In fact, because of a last-minute flood of letters from supporters all over the country, we won't know the final tally until sometime next week.
Of course, now is no time for complacency. After all, I'm in this race to WIN!
Thanks to your support, I'm campaigning hard and will continue to do everything I can to raise more money and earn more voter support.
The good news is, the generous financial support from folks like you is helping me send a clear message to establishment politicians that the era of Big Government Republicanism is over.
That's because I'm the only candidate who can say that I predicted our country's current economic troubles and have spent my entire life defending the Constitution.
So again, thank you for all you have done. Together we can get this country back on track and put an end to out-of-control government!
For Liberty,

Ron Paul
