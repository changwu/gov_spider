    Laura and I are welcomeâ€”are pleased to welcome members of the Lantos family. Mrs. Lantos, thanks for joining us; and Members of Congress who care deeply about democracy in Burma. I'm going to sign a piece of legislation and a joint resolution that will continue some sanctions, impose new sanctions, and extend import restrictions on the Burmese regime. Our message is, the United States believes in democracy and freedom.
Not only will I sign the joint resolution, I'm also looking forward to signing the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008.
Thank you all for joining us. Thank you for your caring.
