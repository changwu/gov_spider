    The President met today with his National Security Council to discuss the situation in Iraq and our strategy to counter the threat posed by ISIL in Iraq and Syria. The President was briefed on the latest developments in Iraq and our support to the Iraqi security forces and local tribal fighters responding to the situation in Anbar province. The President reaffirmed the strong U.S. support for Prime Minister Al-Abadi's efforts, and welcomed the decision issued earlier today by the Iraqi Council of Ministers to accelerate the training and equipping of local tribes in coordination with Anbar authorities, expand recruitment into the Iraqi Army, train local police, and develop a consolidated plan to retake Ramadi with all associated forces acting under Iraqi command. The President reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to the Government of Iraq and the Iraqi people in the fight against ISIL.
