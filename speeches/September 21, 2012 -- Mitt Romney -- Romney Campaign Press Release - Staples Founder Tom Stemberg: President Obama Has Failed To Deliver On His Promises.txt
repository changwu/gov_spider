    Staples Founder Tom Stemberg today made the following statement on President Obama's comments about not being able to change Washington:  
"President Obama's recent comment that 'you can't change Washington from the inside' confirms what Americans already know: President Obama can't change Washington. After four years, including two in which his own party controlled Congress, he's failed to deliver on his campaign promises. His policies have not created the good, well-paying jobs Americans need, nor has his administration restored the fiscal responsibility to government that our children deserve.  And now the optimism that President Obama once so eloquently channeled has faded to lowered expectations. But America has never been about settling on the notion that it could be worse. Our country needs real leadership that recognizes this fact. In asking the American people to grant him more time, President Obama doesn't seem to know why he's asking for it."
