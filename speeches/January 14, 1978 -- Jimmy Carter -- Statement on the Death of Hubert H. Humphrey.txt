    From time to time, our Nation is blessed by the presence of men and women who bear the mark of greatness, who help us see a better vision of what we can become. Hubert Humphrey was such a man.
For 30 years, his voice was heard from one end of this country to the other-most often in defense of the oppressed, the hungry, the victims of poverty and discrimination. All of us will miss that voice.
It was as familiar to Americans as the voice of a member of the family. And, in a sense, Hubert Humphrey was a member of every family in America.
Hubert Humphrey was a fundamentally happy manâ€”a man who really did love his fellow human beings. In victory and in defeat, he set an example of generosity, sincerity, and hope.
The only thing more courageous than the way in which he led his life was the manner in which he left it.
In our laws and institutions, his memorials will endure. The most lasting of them will be in our hearts.
Rosalynn and I extend our deepest sympathy to Muriel Humphrey and her family.
