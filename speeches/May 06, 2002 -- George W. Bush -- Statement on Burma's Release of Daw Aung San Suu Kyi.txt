    The United States welcomes the release from house arrest of Burma's Nobel laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, whose party won an overwhelming victory in elections in 1990 but was never allowed to assume power. We hope her release will be "a new dawn" for Burma, as Daw Aung San Suu Kyi told her supporters earlier today, and lead to national reconciliation and a restoration of democracy. All parties should seize this opportunity to press ahead with the urgent work of restoring the rule of law and basic political and civil rights for all Burmese. Only a return to democracy and reintegration with the international community can bring the freedom and prosperity which the people of Burma both long for and deserve.
The United States will closely monitor the situation within Burma as this process unfolds. We will also consult with ASEAN, Japan, the European Union, and other partners on how the international community can most effectively encourage further progress toward restoration of democracy. I compliment U.N. Special Envoy Razali Ismail for his tireless efforts to promote reconciliation within Burma and for helping to facilitate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's release.
