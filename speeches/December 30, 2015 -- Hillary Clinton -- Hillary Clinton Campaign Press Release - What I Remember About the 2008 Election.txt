As we get closer to the Iowa caucus, I find myself thinking back to the 2008 presidential campaign.
I know what it's like to go into the primaries up.

And I know what it's like to come out of them down.
We cannot get complacent. Anything can happen in politics.
December 31 is the biggest fundraising deadline of this campaign to date, and if you're with me, I need you to step up to help make sure we win.
Everywhere I travel, there's an energy and enthusiasm that you may not read about in the papers—but I feel it on the ground.
Little girls in Iowa waving signs that say "I want to be president someday."

Grandparents in New Hampshire making seven, eight, nine hours of calls to voters.

And people on this team, just like you, doing everything you can to make sure we win.
We have just one day left to hit our $2 million year-end online fundraising goal. If you're with me, chip in $1 right now to help us get there—and make sure that this time, we win the nomination.
