    Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam made the following statement on the Supreme Court decision on President Obama's healthcare law:
"Today's Supreme Court decision to uphold President Obama's disastrous healthcare law means a future of higher costs, fewer choices, and less control over our health care decisions. It means a future where the fate of Medicare lies in the hands of fifteen unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats. And it means a future of increased government involvement in our personal lives. As Governor Romney has said many times, no matter what happens in court, we must dedicate ourselves to repealing this law, and he has promised to do just that, starting on day one of his administration. With Governor Romney's leadership, we can replace Obamacare with healthcare solutions that put patients and doctors, not bureaucrats, in charge of healthcare in America."
