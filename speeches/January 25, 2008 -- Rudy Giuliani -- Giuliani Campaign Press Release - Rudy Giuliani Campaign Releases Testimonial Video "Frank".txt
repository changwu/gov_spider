Siller is the brother of FDNY Firefighter Stephen Siller, who died on September 11th, 2001. In the video, Siller talks about his personal experience on September 11th and Mayor Giuliani's strong and decisive leadership during a time of crisis.

  
  
  

Script for "Frank":
FRANK SILLER: "I was for Rudy Giuliani long before 9-11, and I saw what he did to New York, for New York City."
CHYRON: Frank Siller
FRANK SILLER: "I saw what happened on 9/11. It affected my life drastically. I saw where he stepped up and became such a great leader. Told us all, 'Go out there. Don't sit in your homes. Go out and live. Don't let these guys kill us too.' You know, 'Don't live in fear.' And he brought not just New York together, but all of America together. And that's really why I support Rudy Giuliani."
RUDY GIULIANI: "I'm Rudy Giuliani and I approve this message."
About Frank Siller:
Stephen was on his way home to Staten Island, from Squad 1 in Brooklyn when he heard on his scanner that the Twin Towers had been hit. He turned around, drove back to his fire house, grabbed his gear and drove to the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel. Finding the tunnel closed to traffic, Stephen threw his gear on his back, ran through the tunnel to the Twin Towers to respond and in so doing, made the ultimate sacrifice.
