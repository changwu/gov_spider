    Republican presidential candidate and businessman Herman Cain today requested that Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan recuse herself from the upcoming Supreme Court hearing on Obamacare.
As a political appointee in President Obama's Justice Department, Justice Kagan strongly advocated for the government takeover of health care and during the bill's debate, then- Solicitor General Kagan actively supported a government-run system and sent a jubilant email to then-Justice Department colleague Laurence Tribe saying: ""I hear they have the votes, Larry!! Simply amazing."
"I request that Justice Kagan recuse herself immediately from hearing the Obamacare case," Cain said. "Members of the highest court in the land should be impartial, strictly follow the Constitution and should not carry water for former employers in the White House."
According to 28 USC 455, Supreme Court justices must recuse from "any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned" and if they have at any time "expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case in controversy" while he or she "served in governmental employment."
