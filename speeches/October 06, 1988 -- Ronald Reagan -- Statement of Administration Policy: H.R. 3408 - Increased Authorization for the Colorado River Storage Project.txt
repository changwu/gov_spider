    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Owens (D) Utah, Nielson (R) Utah, and Hansen (R) Utah)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3408 because a Senate amendment to the bill would prematurely implement an agreement concerning the management of certain lands adjacent to Utah's Strawberry Reservoir. This agreement would provide for a Federal payment of $15 million to the Strawberry Valley Water Users Association to settle a long-standing land management dispute. The Administration has not had the opportunity to establish the basis for, or the appropriateness of, the proposed cash payment and, therefore,' must oppose the bill. In addition, Section 3 of the bill raises additional concerns by purporting to bind the Administration to a spending schedule for FY 1990 included in non-statutory Committee report language.
