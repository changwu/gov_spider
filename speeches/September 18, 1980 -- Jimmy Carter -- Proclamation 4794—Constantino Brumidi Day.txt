  A Proclamation

On September 18, 1852, a noted Italian artist named Constantino Brumidi arrived in this country as a political exile.
He spent the remainder of his life embellishing the United States Capitol with magnificent works of art and truly earned the description "Michelangelo of the Capitol of the United States."
Mr. Brumidi's gratitude for the liberty this nation provided to him and his contributions to our national heritage are a source of inspiration for all of us.
In tribute to his achievements, the Congress of the United States of America, by House Joint Resolution 594, has requested the President to proclaim Thursday, September 18 as Constantino Brumidi Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Thursday, September 18, 1980, as Constantino Brumidi Day.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth.

JIMMY CARTER
