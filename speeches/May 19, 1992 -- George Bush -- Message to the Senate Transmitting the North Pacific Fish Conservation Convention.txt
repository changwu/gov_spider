    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Convention for the Conservation of Anadromous Stocks in the North Pacific Ocean, with Annex, which was signed by the United States of America on February 11, 1992, in Moscow. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
This Convention establishes a new organization, the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC), which will contribute significantly to the conservation of anadromous fishery resources and ecologically related species in the high seas area of the North Pacific Ocean. The Commission will serve as an effective forum for closer international coordination of North Pacific fishery enforcement activities on the high seas.
Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation, and the United States cooperated in the development of the Convention, which will enter into force following ratification, acceptance, or approval by all four of these signatory States. It is anticipated that the Convention will enter into force before the end of 1992 or by early 1993. It is important that the United States and the other concerned States ratify the Convention quickly so that we may operate under its beneficial framework as soon as possible.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Convention and give its advice and consent to ratification.
