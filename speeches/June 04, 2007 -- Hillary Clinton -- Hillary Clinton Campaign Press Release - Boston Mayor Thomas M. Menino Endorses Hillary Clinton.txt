    BOSTON -- On the heels of her strong showing in last night's New Hampshire debate, Senator Hillary Clinton today picked up the support of Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino.
"Senator Clinton is the most qualified candidate to lead our country and tackle the challenges we face at home and abroad," Menino said. "She has the experience and the toughness to hit the ground running on her first day in the Oval Office. I plan to do whatever I can to help her become the next President of the United States, including heading to New Hampshire to support her efforts in the nation's first primary."
Mayor Menino, currently serving his fourth term as the Mayor of Boston, is credited with working to provide every child with a quality education, create affordable housing, lower the crime rate, revitalize Boston's neighborhoods, and promote a healthy lifestyle for all city residents. As President of the United States Conference of Mayors from 2002-2003, he championed homeland security and housing availability.
The first Italian-American Mayor of Boston, Menino was elected to his first term in 1993, winning 64 percent of the vote and 18 of the city's 22 wards. He was re-elected for an historic fourth time in 2005. Prior to his election as Mayor, Menino served nine years as a District City Councilor from Boston's Hyde Park neighborhood.
"Mayor Menino is a strong and effective leader, and I am honored to have his support," said Senator Clinton.
