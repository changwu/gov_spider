Memorandum for: Honorable William T. Coleman, Jr., Secretary, Department of Transportation
Subject: Airline Safety
I have read with considerable concern news reports on the recent "near miss" incidents involving large passenger jets. It is of great importance that we maintain our excellent record in air safety. Therefore, I am requesting a report from you summarizing the circumstances surrounding these incidents and identifying the steps that are being taken to avoid similar problems in the future.
This matter merits immediate attention, particularly as we enter the holiday season when air travel will be heavy.
