    The President. Good morning.
The resolution before me, here on the desk, is the proclamation of thanksgiving, a joint resolution from the Senate and the House, already signed by the Speaker and by the Vice President, as President of the Senate. I am going to affix my signature to it, also, to simply take advantage of this opportunity to share in it.
[At this point, the President signed the joint resolution into law.]
This resolution pays tribute to the strength of America. It recognizes the principle of public service, which 53 men and women fulfilled in the highest tradition of their calling. It recognizes the devotion and bravery of professional soldiers, the memories of those eight men and the long line of those who have given everything to preserve everything. It reminds us that "greater glory hath no man than that he lay down his life for another." It salutes the unity of the nation when we're confronted with threats to our freedom. And finally, it expresses what we must all remember, that God watched over His servants during this difficult time of testing.
I call on, as this resolution does, all Americans to join this Thursday in raising thanks that our sons and daughters have returned. They have shown by their example that the spirit of our country can never be broken.
I won't sign it again; I just have. But it seemed like that would have been a goodâ€”
Reporter. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. I thank all of you. Nice to see you.
