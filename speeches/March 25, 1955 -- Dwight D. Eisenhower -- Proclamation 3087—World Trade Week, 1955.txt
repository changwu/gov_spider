  A Proclamation

Whereas it is the desire of the people of the United States of America to promote the growth and share the fruits of freedom and enterprise in peace and prosperity with their friends throughout the free world; and
Whereas a significant contribution to the development of a lasting peace can be made by the interchange of goods and services and freedom of travel, and the mutual understanding thus attained can become the basis of true international friendship; and
Whereas higher standards of living and better economic utilization of the world's resources can be promoted through an increased international exchange of goods, services, and capital; and
Whereas international trade is a keystone in promoting international stability and developing resources, culture, and security; and
Whereas the economic strength upon which the free world's common defense is based can be increased by international trade:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 22, 1955, as World Trade Week; and I request the appropriate officials of the Federal Government and of the several States, Territories, possessions, and municipalities of the United States to cooperate in the observance of that week.
I also urge business, labor, agricultural, educational, and civic groups, as well as people in the United States generally, to observe World Trade Week with gatherings, discussions, exhibits, ceremonies, and other appropriate activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 25th day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-ninth.

DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
