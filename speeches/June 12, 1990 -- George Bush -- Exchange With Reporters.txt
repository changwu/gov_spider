    The President's Birthday
The President. It's a vast improvement. [Laughter] Helen [Helen Thomas, United Press International], where's yours?
Q. I don't know what they're running for. [Laughter]
The President. No answers -- only those wearing hats get their question answered. [Laughter]
Q. Touche.
The President. One birthday question.
Q. Have you gotten a birthday card from the President of the Soviet Union?
The President. No, I have not -- that I'm aware of. But I've got to be careful; he may well have sent something.
German Membership in NATO
Q. Mr. President, have you seen his latest remarks where he's proposed associate membership for Germany in NATO and the Warsaw Pact?
The President. That matter was discussed here. So, I haven't seen any recent remarks, except I saw a proposal of some consideration, and of course, that has been discussed with the leaders in Eastern Europe. It's been discussed here, and our position is well-known to him, which is that a unified Germany should be in NATO with no conditions. But the more talking we do, the more convinced I am that they will see that what we're proposing is most stabilizing and is best for the Soviet Union as well as Western Europe and Eastern Europe. So, we'll keep on trying. But these ideas -- let them float them out there. And we'll listen, and we'll discuss them without rancor.
Thank you all very much.
