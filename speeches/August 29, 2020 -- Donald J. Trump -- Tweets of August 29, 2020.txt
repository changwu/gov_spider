If the incompetent Mayor of Portland, Ted Wheeler, doesn't get control of his city and stop the Anarchists, Agitators, Rioters and Looters, causing great danger to innocent people, we will go in and take care of matters the way they should have been taken care of 100 days ago!Retweets: 32938Favorites: 142447

Kenosha has been very quiet for the third night in a row or, since the National Guard has shown up. That's the way it works, it's all very simple. Portland, with a very ungifted mayor, should request help from the Federal Government. If lives are endangered, we're going in!Retweets: 26296Favorites: 118920

The Fake News doesn't want to report these numbers. The @latimes and others believed the Crooked Dems before the real numbers came out. Too bad we don't have honest reporting when it comes to "Trump". Phony sources, they say anything and think they get away with it.

About the only way a person is able to write a book on me is if they agree that it will contain as much bad "stuff" as possible, much of which is lies. It's like getting a job with CNN or MSDNC and saying that "President Trump is great." You have ZERO chance. FAKE NEWS!Retweets: 18462Favorites: 85619

Now that Biden's Polls are dropping fast, he has agreed to get out of his basement and start campaignin,"in ten days." Sadly, that is a very slow reaction time for a President. Our beloved USA needs a much faster, smarter, and tougher response than that. Get out there today, Joe!Retweets: 35920Favorites: 162142
