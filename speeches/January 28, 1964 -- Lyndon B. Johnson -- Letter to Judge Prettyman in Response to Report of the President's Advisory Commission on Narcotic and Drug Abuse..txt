    Dear Judge Prettyman:
I want to express to you--and through you to the other members of the Commission on Narcotic and Drug Abuse--my appreciation for the long and arduous attention you have devoted to one of the Nation's more difficult problems.
This Administration shall continue the concern which President Kennedy evidenced over the abuse of narcotics and other drugs, and I have directed the appropriate departments and agencies to review carefully the recommendations of the Commission and submit their comments and views in order that our efforts in this field can be strengthened and improved.
Our thanks go to the members of the Commission, and certainly we all look forward to the day when the human suffering and misery occasioned by the abuse of narcotics and other drugs will no longer require our attention.
Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Honorable E. Barrett Prettyman, Chairman, President's Advisory Commission on Narcotic and Drug Abuse]
