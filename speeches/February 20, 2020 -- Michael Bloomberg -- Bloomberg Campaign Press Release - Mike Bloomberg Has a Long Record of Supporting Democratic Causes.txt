    NEW YORK â€” As the mayor of one of the largest and most progressive cities in the country, who was re-elected three times, Mike Bloomberg has a strong record of supporting Democrats and Democratic causes across the country. Mike has also been supportive of candidates across the aisle who took a stand against the NRA and supported laws that would reduce senseless deaths from gun violence. He is an independent leader and thinker who will work with Democrats, Republicans or Independents when it comes to getting things done and making real progress for Americans.
In 2018, Mike spent more than $40 million on 24 races House Democratic races, which led to the successful effort to flip the House blue and in 2019 Mike donated an additional $10 million to defend vulnerable Democratic House members against Republican attacks over their support for the impeachment of Donald Trump.
Mike is not afraid of taking on the big fights and has a record of doing so, whether that's guns, climate, immigration, or LGBTQ rights, he has played an instrumental role in supporting and electing Democratic values across the country.
