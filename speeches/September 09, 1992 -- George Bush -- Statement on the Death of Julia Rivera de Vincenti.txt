    Barbara and I are deeply saddened by the loss of our close personal friend Julia Rivera de Vincenti. She was always an honest and loyal supporter, but much more than that, she was a true friend.
Julia served Puerto Rico with great distinction, and was universally admired. Julia's service did not stop with Puerto Rico. She also served this Nation with great distinction, including her service at the United Nations, where she helped carry forth the message of equity and hope to the entire world.
The Bush family considered Julia a part of our extended family. To her daughter Violeta, Barbara and I send our deepest condolences and prayers.
