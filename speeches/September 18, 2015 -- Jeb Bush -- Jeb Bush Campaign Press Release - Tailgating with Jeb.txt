    Want to catch a game with Jeb?
With the start of college football season, Jeb's taking his campaign to the field to build grassroots support ahead of the SEC primary in March.
Jeb tailgated at Herty Field in Athens, Georgia with College Republicans before the UGA Bulldogs vs. South Carolina Gamecocks game. It was the first of four SEC football games Jeb plans to attend this season and marks the roll out of his Southern Advisory Committee focused on winning early Southern primary states.
As a successful conservative governor from an SEC state, Jeb's looking forward to competing in the SEC primary and bringing some fun to the process.
The primaries may be an entire football season away, but now is the time to grow a grassroots network and organize in key states. To do that, we need the help of supporters like you.
Come meet Jeb on the field, learn how you can get involved and maybe even take a few selfies.
For SEC alums and students who are #AllinForJeb â€” help us organize for the SEC primary by recruiting Jeb supporters from your school.
