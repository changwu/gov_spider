Foreign pool report #1 - Background 
Re sending this since apparently it didn't go through
Good Morning to all,
I'll be your foreign pooler for the bilateral meeting between President Joe Biden and the Prime Minister of Israel, Naftali Bennett.
The meeting is scheduled to start at 11:30am.
This will be their 1st in-person meeting but they've already spoken on the phone. Joe Biden called the Israeli PM just 2 hours after Bennett took office (for context, POTUS waited about a month after his own inauguration to speak to then Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu)
At the end of June, POTUS met with then Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, just days before he left office.
This is PM Bennett's 1st official foreign trip since taking office in June. However, he did travel to Jordan for a then secret meeting with King Abdullah, which was later confirmed by the King himself.
On Tuesday before flying off to Washington PM Bennett said: "Joe Biden is a true friend of Israel. There is a new administration in the US and a new government in Israel, and I am bringing with me from Jerusalem a new spirit of cooperation," a sign that he is looking to turn the page on the tense relationship between his predecessor and Joe Biden.
PM Bennett arrived in Washington on Tuesday night.
On Wednesday, he met with Secretary of State Antony Blinken as well as Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. There are no other official meetings on his agenda.
Naftali Bennett is 49 years old. He is the son of American immigrants to Israel.
Bennett served in the Israeli armed forces for several years in 90s.
He made his fortune in Israel's high-tech industry.
He started his political career as Netanyahu's chief of Staff in 2006. He later served in different ministerial positions from 2013 to 2020 under then PM Benjamin Netanyahu.
From 2012-2018, he led the Jewish Home party, then the New RIght party. In 2020, Bennett became the leader of the right-wing Yamina alliance.
PM Bennet took took office on June 13, ousting longtime PM Benjamin Netanyahu after the country's fourth parliamentary election in 2 years. He brought together a ruling coalition of 8 parties, ranging from the far left to far right and includes for the first time a small Islamist faction representing Israel's Arab minority.
Bennett will be in office for 2 years, having agreed to a rotating government with Yair Lapid, who is set to take over as PM in 2023.
Priorities for the meeting:
-Both sides have indicated that Iran would be top of the agenda.
The Israeli PM is opposed to the JCPOA and US attempts to re-enter the nuclear agreement.
Bennett told a cabinet meeting a few days ago that this would be his message to Joe Biden: "This is the time to stop the Iranians, not to give them a lifeline in the form of re-entering an expired nuclear deal."
The Israeli PM is expected to present a plan to contain the Iranian threat, both regarding the nuclear issue and Iran's influence in the region, though he hasn't given more details about that plan.
-WH Press Sec statement also mentions the Israeli/Palestinian issue.
PM Bennett opposes the creation of a Palestinian state and has said there will not be any peace talks with the Palestinians. (FYI his coalition is made up both of parties that are opposed to Palestinian statehood and some who support it)
He has also said that he would continue expanding settlements in the West Bank.
Another point of contention, the Biden administration's plan to reopen a consulate for Palestinians in Jerusalem.
For context, the meeting comes as tensions have flared up again along the Israel/Gaza border in recent days about 3 months after the 11-day war between Israel and Hamas.
-Other topics that are set to be discussed: climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic.
