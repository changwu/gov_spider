    DES MOINES, IA â€” Today, Iowa State Representative Marti Anderson endorsed U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar for President. This is Klobuchar's second Iowa legislative endorsement in one week, after Representative Ruth Ann Gaines endorsed Senator Klobuchar on Thursday.
The endorsement comes as Klobuchar is set to speak at the Iowa Democratic Party's Hall of Fame.
"I am proud to endorse U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar for President of the United States. As a Social Worker and founding Director of the Iowa Attorney General's Crime Victim Assistance Division, I am encouraged by Klobuchar's unwavering determination to stand for fairness to offenders, victims, and community in our criminal justice system. I am inspired by her efforts to prioritize mental health care," said Representative Marti Anderson. "Democrats need to take back the White House in 2020 and I know that Senator Klobuchar is the best candidate to defeat President Trump and help us flip the Legislature in Iowa."
Earlier this week, Representative Ruth Ann Gaines endorsed Senator Klobuchar for President, citing Klobuchar's mental health policy and her "down to earth and approachable" nature.
