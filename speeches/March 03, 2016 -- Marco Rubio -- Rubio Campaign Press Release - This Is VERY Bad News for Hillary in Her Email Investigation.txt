The investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server just took a big step toward her being recommended for indictment: A key player just received immunity.
The Justice Department has granted immunity to a former State Department staffer, who worked on Hillary Clinton's private email server, as part of a criminal investigation into the possible mishandling of classified information, according to a senior law enforcement official.
The official said the FBI had secured the cooperation of Bryan Pagliano, who worked on Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign before setting up the server in her New York home in 2009.
As the FBI looks to wrap up its investigation in the coming months, agents are likely to want to interview Clinton and her senior aides about the decision to use a private server, how it was set up, and whether any of the participants knew they were sending classified information in emails, current and former officials said.

What else does Pagliano's cooperation mean? That we might finally get some serious answers about Hillary's mishandling of top secret information.
One thing remains certain: Hillary Clinton is disqualified from serving as President of the United States.
