    The President. Ladies and gentlemen, first let me—I want to thank this bipartisan congressional delegation from cattle-producing States for coming in. Cattle producers, by numbers, represent the largest single segment of America's agricultural economy. Cattle prices are at a 10-year low, and feed prices are at—are or have been recently at an all-time high. And we want to discuss some potential recommendations for action the Secretary of Agriculture might take, using traditional means at his disposal to help to deal with this situation and help these producers through this difficult time.
I want to thank the Members of Congress who requested this meeting and who brought this matter to our attention, and I'm looking forward to the meeting.
Q. How much traditional beef are you going to buy, Mr. President?
The President. The Secretary of Agriculture will have an announcement later, once we have time to talk through our options here.
Q. Can you act quickly?
Q. Will you call up the conservation reserve for more grazing nationwide?
The President. Well, we will issue an announcement after the meeting; the Secretary of Agriculture will.
Yes, we're going to act quickly. We won't fool around with it. Thank you very much.
