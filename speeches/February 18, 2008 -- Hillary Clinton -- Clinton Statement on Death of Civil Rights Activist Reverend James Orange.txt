    Hillary Clinton issued the following statement on the death of Rev. James Orange, a key figure in the civil rights movement:
"Reverend James Orange was a tireless leader in the civil rights movement who worked alongside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. for social justice and equal rights.
In 1965, Reverend Orange's imprisonment was the catalyst to the Selma to Montgomery, Alabama March for voting rights. Reverend Orange not only believed in Dr. King's philosophy for non-violence but also practiced it.
He will always be remembered as one of the drum majors of change."
