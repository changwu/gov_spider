    The United States and Peru signed an exchange of notes on extradition today. Secretary of State James A. Baker III signed on behalf of the United States. Guillermo Larco Cox, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, signed on behalf of Peru.
This exchange of notes will:
confirm our bilateral commitment to extradition;
confirm explicitly that narcotics trafficking and related drug offenses are incorporated by reference in the 1899 United States-Peru Extradition Treaty.
This agreement represents the mutual desire of our countries to try to enhance effective law enforcement cooperation and to recognize the importance of the return of fugitives to stand trial as part of this effort. The exchange of notes should lead to further discussions between the two Governments with respect to extradition and the return of fugitives generally.
