    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Poland to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).
The "Support for East European Democracy Act of 1989," P.L. 101 - 179, which I signed into law on November 28, 1989, amended Title V of the Trade Act of 1974 to allow Poland to be considered for GSP designation. I have carefully examined Poland under the criteria identified in sections 501 and 502 (b) and (c) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. In light of these criteria, and particularly Poland's ongoing political and economic reforms, I have determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits to Poland.
This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended.
Sincerely,
George Bush
