    On April 21, 1996 the Dole for President Campaign ("campaign") first learned through press reports of allegations concerning impermissible campaign contributions. According to those reports, employees of a certain corporation have alleged that a number of employees who contributed to the campaign were improperly reimbursed by the corporation.
The campaign has no information of the alleged activities other than the press reports. However, the campaign is concerned by those allegations and requests the Federal Election Commission to conduct an inquiry into their merits. Senator Dole and the campaign have made it clear that contributions will be raised in full compliance with the federal election laws. Your inquiry, therefore, will help determine if any person has acted improperly and will assist the campaign in evaluating what contributions, if any, need to be returned.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
signed
Douglas C. Wurth
General Counsel
