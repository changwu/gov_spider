    Las Vegas, NV -- The Obama campaign announced today that the Nevada organization is expanding significantly as it moves into the final three months before the Nevada caucuses. On a conference call this afternoon, national campaign manager David Plouffe announced that the campaign now has more than 50 field staff in the state and the opening of four new offices in North Las Vegas, Southwest Las Vegas, Carson City and Pahrump.
"We are focused on building a true precinct-level grassroots organization in each of the 1,754 precincts in Nevada. In order to organize in every precinct, we need to make the campaign and our staff accessible to every community," said David Plouffe. "The enthusiasm of our volunteers is one of the greatest assets of our campaign, and expanding our staff and offices is one more way we can capitalize on this energy and turn it into grassroots organization."
The campaign will hold office openings at the North Las Vegas and Carson City offices this Saturday, October 13th with prominent members of Obama's Nevada Steering Committee. Earlier in the day, volunteers will canvass the communities around the new offices as part of the campaign's national "Turn the Page in Iraq" day of action. Supporters will go door-to-door to remind their neighbors that Obama had the judgment and leadership to oppose the Iraq War five years ago, while others were voting for it.
