    Cory 2020 Campaign Manager Addisu Demissie: Cory Won Debate by Showing His Vision for Uniting Our Country to Make Real Change
Newark, NJ â€” Cory 2020 Campaign Manager Addisu Demissie issued the following statement on Cory Booker's performance in the third Democratic debate:
"For the third debate in a row, Cory won the night.
"And he didn't do it by tearing down other Democrats, but by bringing to the stage his longstanding, authentic vision of uniting our country to make real change.
"He showed viewers who he is and how he has challenged the field to join him in support of bold policies like gun licensing and taking on systemic racism in this country. He also threw a Dad joke in. But hey, that's Cory."
After an extended, contentious debate on health care, Cory brought the stage's focus back to the people who are hurting because of our broken health care system -- and fellow candidates nod along.
