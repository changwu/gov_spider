    "[T]his president has been outsourcing a good deal of American jobs himself by putting money into energy companies, solar and wind energy companies that end up making their products outside the United States. If there is an outsourcer-in-chief, it's the President of the United States, not the guy who's running to replace him." â€” Mitt Romney

GOV. MITT ROMNEY: "By the way, he likes to talk about outsourcing. He's run some interesting attack ads on me on that topic. You may have seen that and interestingly, an independent, unbiased fact-checking organization looked at his ads and looked at that attack and said it's false and misleading. But it is interesting that when it comes to outsourcing, that this president has been outsourcing a good deal of American jobs himself by putting money into energy companies, solar and wind energy companies that end up making their products outside the United States. If there is an outsourcer-in-chief, it's the President of the United States, not the guy who's running to replace him."
