    Well, thank you all very much, and good evening. Tonight we'll see an extraordinary performer celebrating an extraordinary American life. And it is my honor to welcome you all here.
I particularly want to welcome Dixie Carter. I want to thank the members of my Cabinet who are here. I want to thank the Members of the Congress who are here. I want to say to the students, thank you for coming, and thank you for taking interest in American literature. I want to thank your teachers, as well, and all the scholars who have studied the life and work of Mark Twain.
It's also my honor to introduce our host this evening. This performance helps mark the beginning of a series titled "A White House Salute to American Authors." Promoting American writers is one of Laura's, our First Lady's, projects as well as an enduring commitment in all her life.
All America has seen her love of learning and her love of literature. All of America has seen her grace and concern for children in a difficult time for our Nation. Our country is blessed by her calm and compassion, and I am blessed by her encouragement and her love.
Laura Bush.
