    Governor calls collapse of compromise bill "tragic breakdown"
SANTA FE, NM -- New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson tonight issued the following statement regarding the US Senate's failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation.
"The collapse of this important legislation demonstrates a tragic breakdown of lawmakers' ability to build compromise and the President's ability to work with Congress to get things done. It is also clear evidence of the ongoing disconnect between Washington and the American public.
Never in our history has the need for such legislation been greater- the issue is tearing the country apart, and the people want action. Yet some of the members of Congress refuse to join the majority of Democrats who put the best interests of the nation first, and instead continue to put politics ahead of progress.
We need an immigration plan that secures our borders, creates a tough but fair path to legalization for those already here, penalizes employers who knowingly hire illegal workers, makes families the priority, and engages Mexico to help work with us to solve this problem."
