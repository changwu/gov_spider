  A Proclamation

American Red Cross volunteers are among the millions of citizens who quietly serve their fellow man. Since the first settlement on our shores, a volunteer spirit has characterized the American way. This spirit has been reflected in the actions of the neighbor who is always ready to lend a hand.
The services performed by the Red Cross provide us with benefits that would otherwise cost billions of dollars. Last year, it was the volunteer who—giving freely of his or her time, energy, and talent—made it possible for the Red Cross to collect and provide the ill and injured with nearly six million units of blood. Volunteers established shelters to feed and attend to disaster victims, conducted thousands of courses to improve the quality of life by teaching nutrition, first aid, water safety, home nursing, and preparation for parenthood. The volunteer reached out to our young people, to members of the military, to veterans, and to the elderly and through personal contact eased their loneliness and fears.
For 102, years, the American Red Cross has been an essential ingredient of American life, helping us to learn, to grow, and to prosper. In accordance with this year's theme: "The Red Cross. We'll Help. Will You?" I urge all Americans to donate their time and financial resources in support of Red Cross activities. By giving of ourselves, we give the greatest gift one human being can give another—the gift of love.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American National Red Cross, do hereby designate March 1983 as Red Cross Month.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 20th day of Jan., in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.
