    In a call today with Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Vice President Biden urged President Yanukovych to take advantage of every opportunity, including offers of international support, to reduce tensions and build trust with the people of Ukraine in order to find a political solution to the crisis. This includes taking immediate steps such as pulling back riot police, releasing detained protesters, and establishing accountability for those responsible for beatings and attacks on journalists and protesters. Vice President Biden emphasized that the only viable path to peace and stability in Ukraine is through continued dialogue and genuine compromise to form a new government that can earn the confidence of the Ukrainian people.
