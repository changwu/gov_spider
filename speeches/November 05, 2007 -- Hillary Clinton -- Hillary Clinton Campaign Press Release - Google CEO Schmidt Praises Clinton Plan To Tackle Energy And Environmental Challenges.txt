    The following is a statement from Google CEO Dr. Eric Schmidt on Hillary Clinton's plan to address America's energy and environmental challenges.
"By emphasizing the connection between promoting a green efficient economy and job creation, Senator Clinton's plan seeks to harness the power of technology and innovation to address one of our most pressing global challenges. The 'energy innovation' market looks to have the kind of job generation potential that microprocessor did just 35 years ago. The goal of producing 5 million new jobs can be achieved by private sector investment and bipartisan support for increased research and development in efficiency and clean energy."
