    The White House today announced that Camille Johnston, Director of Communications for the First Lady, will be leaving the White House for a position in the private sector.
Statement from Mrs. Obama:
"Camille has become a trusted advisor to me and to the entire East Wing," said First Lady Michelle Obama. "From our first day in the White House when we opened the doors and greeted visitors, she has led a communications team that has developed creative and effective strategies for the Let's Move! campaign, our work on behalf of military families, arts and cultural events in the White House and our international agenda. Her dedication, calming presence and expertise have been invaluable. She will be missed, but we wish her all the best."
Statement from Camille Johnston:
"Being invited by Mrs. Obama to be a part of her East Wing team was a privilege for which I am incredibly grateful. It has been an honor and a pleasure to serve the First Lady and the President and to be a part of this historic Administration."
