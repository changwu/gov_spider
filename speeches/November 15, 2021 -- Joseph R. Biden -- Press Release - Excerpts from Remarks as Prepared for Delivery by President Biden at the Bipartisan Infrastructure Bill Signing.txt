    For too long, we've talked about having the best economy in the world. We've talked about asserting American leadership in the world with the best and safest roads, railways, ports, and airports. Here in Washington, we've heard countless speeches, promises, and white papers from the experts.
But today, we are finally getting it done. And my message to the American people is: America is moving again. And your life is going to change for the better.

Too often in Washington â€“ the reason we don't get things done is because we insist on getting everything we want. With this law, we focused on getting things done.
I ran for president because the only way to move our country forward is through compromise and consensus.
That's how our system works. That's American democracy. And I am signing a law that is truly consequential, because we made our democracy deliver for the people.
