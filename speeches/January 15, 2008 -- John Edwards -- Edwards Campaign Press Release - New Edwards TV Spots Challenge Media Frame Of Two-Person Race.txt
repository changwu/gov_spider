    Campaign announces additional new television spots in South Carolina showing voters why John Edwards is the only one...
Columbia, South Carolina â€“ Today, the John Edwards for president campaign began airing four new 10-second television spots in the Palmetto State that highlight how Senator Edwards differs from the other Democratic candidates and why he is better prepared to fight for the big change America needs.
In each spot, images of Senators Obama and Clinton appear on the screen while the narrator poses a question. In "Deal" the narrator asks "Which Democrat opposed NAFTA and other trade deals that send American jobs overseas?" In "Dime" the question is "Which Democrat has never taken a dime of campaign money from Washington lobbyists?" In "Ban" the narrator asks "Who's the only Democrat who would ban Washington lobbyists from the White House staff?" and in "Beats" the question is "Who's the only Democrat that beats all the Republicans in the recent CNN poll?"
After the narrator asks the question, an image of John Edwards appears on the screen, accompanied by the words "John Edwards is the only one."
Born to a working class family in South Carolina and raised in small, rural mill towns, Edwards has spent his life taking on powerful interests on behalf of hard-working families like the ones he grew up with. He has never taken a dime from Washington lobbyists or PACs, and has pledged that he will ban Washington lobbyists from serving in his Administration. As president, he will only support smart and safe trade deals, opposing trade deals that put the profits of multinational corporations ahead of the needs of hard-working families.
The ads begin airing one day after Edwards concluded his four-day "Bringing It Home" bus tour across South Carolina. Edwards is the only candidate in the race who was born in South Carolina and he is the only Democratic candidate to ever win in a "red" state. Edwards leads the Democratic field in both campaign stops and money raised in the Palmetto State, and his campaign boasts an impressive statewide grassroots organization strengthened by deep support from Edwards' 2004 campaign. Edwards will return to South Carolina on Saturday as part of his "America Rising: Coast to Coast" tour.
