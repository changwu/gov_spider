    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Walker (R) PA and 7 others)
The Administration has no objection to H.R. 655, if amended to delete section 10(b) which limits obligations for all energy supply research and development activities through FY 1998 to the level of actual FY 1995 obligations.
The Administration strongly opposes section 10(b), because it would hinder the Department of Energy's ability to manage wisely its contracts and activities in future years. Further, the provision may create an inappropriate incentive to over-obligate funds during the current fiscal year.
The Administration also believes that sections 5 and 6 pertaining to hydrogen program funding should be amended to provide the greatest possible certainty that the Department of Energy's program could qualify as a "non-actionable subsidy" under the terms of the World Trade Organization Subsidies Agreement.
