    Based on a petition submitted to me by the Governor of the State of Indiana, pursuant to Section 110(f) of the Clean Air Act, I hereby determine that a regional energy emergency exists in the State of Indiana of such severity that a temporary suspension of certain particulate and sulfur dioxide control regulations and regulations governing reserves of low sulfur coal under the Indiana Air Quality Implementation Plan may be necessary, and that other means of responding to the energy emergency may be inadequate. This determination shall be effective for not more than thirty (30) days, provided that the State of Indiana shall hold the public hearing required by Section 110(f) of the Clean Air Act within 1 week of this determination. If, during the period of suspension, I determine that a regional energy emergency no longer exists in Indiana, I will direct that the temporary suspension be terminated promptly. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency retains full authority to disapprove temporary suspensions of regulations in Indiana and to exercise his emergency powers authority under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act, when and if necessary.
I urge the Governor to act with due care if he suspends air pollution regulations under the authority provided by this determination, since such regulations are important to protect public health.
I also urge the Governor to implement fully all necessary energy conservation measures, including those power curtailment orders cited in the petition, so that the necessity for suspension of pollution control regulations can be minimized.
