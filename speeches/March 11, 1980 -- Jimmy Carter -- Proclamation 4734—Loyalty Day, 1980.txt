  A Proclamation

Our Nation was founded to secure and protect the basic human rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all our citizens. Today the United States is a leader in the world-wide struggle for basic human rights. In these times it is important that we never forget our historic commitment to freedom and justice for all people?because our first principles are the basis of our continuing loyalty to our Nation.
America was not created to promote a single race or religion or ideology, but to build a safe and sure home for the deepest values of humankind. The symbols of our loyalty, such as the flag, are the outward signs of our faith in these ideals.
In order to encourage the people of the United States to reflect on our democratic heritage, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved July 18, 1958 (72 Stat. 369), has designated May 1 of every year as Loyalty Day, and has requested the President to issue a proclamation inviting the American people to acknowledge that day with appropriate observances.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, call upon all Americans to observe Thursday, May 1, 1980, as Loyalty Day. I also ask the appropriate officials of the Government and all citizens to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.

JIMMY CARTER
