    On Thursday, U.S. Labor Secretary-designate Mayor Marty Walsh joined union presidents and labor leaders for a virtual conversation on the issues impacting America's workers.
Walsh thanked those present for all of their hard work to fight for workers' rights and shared his personal commitment to the labor movement as a former member of the Laborers Local 223, the same union that represented his father and many others in his family. Walsh also affirmed President-elect Biden's commitment to significantly increase union density, increase workers' power, and create millions of good-paying union jobs.
Secretary-designate Walsh and the labor leaders discussed the need to address urgent challenges facing America's working families, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the opioid epidemic, and the fight for equal pay.
The labor leaders thanked Walsh for his support of unions as Mayor of Boston and for standing with workers throughout his career. They also noted how proud they were to have a fellow union member as the nation's next Labor Secretary and committed to working in partnership with Walsh and the Administration to deliver for working families.
