    To the Congress of the United States:
I hereby transmit to you the Annual Report of the Railroad Retirement Board for fiscal year 1975.
The Report indicates that the Board paid retirement and survivor payments in excess of $3 billion to almost one million one hundred thousand individuals during the fiscal year, and that it made unemployment and sickness benefit payments totaling $67 million to over 137,000 claimants.
This Report also includes a summary of legislation enacted in 1974, which restructured the retirement and survivor program and substantially improved the financing of the railroad retirement system. In addition, it includes a description of the 1975 amendments to the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, which increased the daily rate of unemployment and sickness benefits payable to railroad workers and made other improvements in that program.
