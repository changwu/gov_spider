    My dear Mr. Secretary:
This annual observance throughout the country of Foreign Trade Week is an altogether fitting recognition of the vital role of foreign commerce in the economic life of the nation. Our own experience, no less than that of other nations, is living testimony to the fact that a healthy and vigorous flow of trade between nations is an indispensable requirement for general and lasting prosperity.
We have profited by that experience. For four years our Government has been engaged in a major effort to reopen the channels of trade. The trade agreements that we have concluded with seventeen foreign countries during this period attest to the progress that has been made. With patient persistence we are thus gradually building more secure foundations for our own national economic well-being. At the same time we are strengthening the foundations of enduring world peace, which is so essential to the continued progress of civilization and to the well-being of the people of every land.
Very sincerely yours,
The Honorable,
The Secretary of State,
Washington, D. C.
