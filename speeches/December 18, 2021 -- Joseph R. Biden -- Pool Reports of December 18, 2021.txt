Travel pool #1: Rolling
Good morning. The pool met up with POTUS motorcade near the Biden residence. We began rolling toward an undisclosed location at 7:02.
As a reminder, today is the anniversary of the deaths of Biden’s first wife and baby daughter in a car crash in 1972. Last year he visited the church where they were buried.

Travel pool #2: Church
We arrived at St. Joseph on the Brandywine Roman Catholic Church. Pool spotted Hunter Biden entering. We did not see POTUS. We’re holding on the sidewalk outside.

Travel pool #3: Church departure
POTUS stepped out of church at 7:55. He clasped hands with the priest, who was wearing purple robes, outside the front door. The pool spotted baby Beau toddling down the path leading away from the church until his father Hunter scooped him up.
It’s overcast and chilly, and the ground is wet from early morning rain.
POTUS walked around the church and turned toward the part of the cemetery where his wife Neilia, daughter Naomi and son Beau are buried.
At that point the pool loaded back into the bus. We rejoined the motorcade and were rolling at 8:10.
According to the White House, POTUS and FLOTUS were joined at church by:
