    Â South Dakota Senator John Thune today made the following statement on the disappointing GDP report:
"Earlier this week on the campaign trail, President Obama said we tried his economic plan and 'it worked.' Today we learned that the economy grew at a meager 1.5 percent this past quarter, well below what is needed to get Americans back to work. President Obama has run out of ideas and, given that he hasn't met with his Jobs Council in over six months, it doesn't seem he is interested in hearing new ones. Right now, the American people need leadership and the president is not providing it. It's time for a new president."
