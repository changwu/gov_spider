    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the untimely death of Tammy Wynette. For more than 30 years, Tammy Wynette defined the Nashville sound that helped to make American country western music popular all over the world. Her string of number one hits has* filled music halls, homes, and radio waves, and her trademark style has* filled our hearts and made her a legend. From the Mississippi cotton fields where she worked as a child, to the stage of the Grand Ole Opry where she presided as the First Lady of country music, Tammy Wynette was an American original, and we will miss her.
