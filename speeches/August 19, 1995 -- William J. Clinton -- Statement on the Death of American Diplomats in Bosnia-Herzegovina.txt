    I am deeply saddened by the deaths today of three dedicated Americans serving the cause of peace, near Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have confirmed reports that Ambassador Robert Frasure, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs; Dr. Joseph J. Kruzel, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for European and NATO Policy; and Air Force Colonel Samuel Nelson Drew, a member of the National Security Council staff, were killed this morning in a crash of their military vehicle on the way to Sarajevo. Two other members of the delegation were injured. These men were part of an American team searching for an end to the conflict there. That effort will continue.
In addition, one French soldier was killed and two were injured; the three were part of the team escorting the delegation.
I also want to thank the Government of France and the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) for their extraordinary efforts to care for the casualties.
My heartfelt sympathy is extended to the Frasure, Kruzel, and Drew families. In honor of their sacrifice, I have directed that our Nation's flags be lowered. Their loved ones were engaged in the greatest cause of allâ€”the search for peace. As the Scripture tells us, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God."
