In-Town Pool Report #4: Kudlow Gaggle
Larry Kudlow was in a hurry, but the NEC director stopped briefly for two questions in the White House driveway.
What about the unemployment numbers?
"Everybody knew we were gonna take a big hit. Okay, you see the stock market shrugged it off. This is gonna be a rough quarter coming up, and it's a big challenge..." Kudlow responded. "In some ironic sense, I don't think people were surprised. However, our job is to get the economic assistance out. That's our job, and if we get this bill signed today, get the engines going, get the checks in the mail, get the unemployment, get the small business--that's our job."
"I hate to see the numbers jump," he continued. "I don't think anybody is terribly surprised. We just gotta work on giving some relief. It's only going to be a few weeks, I hope."
How long until things get back to normal?
"It'll be weeks and months," he forecasted. "Not years, that's for sure."
Do let me know if you need the audio.
