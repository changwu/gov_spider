....it's powerful common sense Immigration Laws to stop illegals from coming through Mexico into the U.S. and removing them back to their country of origin. Until Mexico cleans up this ridiculous & massive migration we will be focusing on Border Security not Ports of Entry....Retweets: 20261Favorites: 87325
