    Today, Romney for President released a new web video, "Not Even Half." President Obama has given billions of taxpayer dollars to companies that later failed—including companies that were run by Democrat donors. This is just another example of President Obama's pattern of picking winners and losers and wasting taxpayer money.

"In a blow to the Obama administration's efforts to create green jobs, solar-cell maker Solyndra announced Wednesday that it will close its remaining Fremont factory, layoff its 1,100 employees and file for bankruptcy. The news marked an abrupt end for a company once considered among the most innovative in a fast-changing industry. The bankruptcy also represents a high-profile failure for a federal stimulus program that gives loan guarantees to green-tech manufacturers. Solyndra was the first company to win one of the guarantees, receiving $535 million in 2009 to build its second factory in Fremont less than a mile from the company's original plant." (David R.
