    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Pursuant to Section 102(d) of the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980, I am submitting this proposal for an allocation of the net revenues expected from the Act during fiscal year 1981.
The allocation which I propose is, of course, consistent with my recommendations on the budget for 1981. It also reflects congressional action on the 1981 budget.
As I stated when I signed the Act into law, expenditure of the funds raised by the windfall profit tax requires specific authorization and appropriation by the Congress through the normal legislative process. This provides both the Administration and the Congress with the flexibility needed from year to year to determine how these funds will be used in the best interests of the country.
At present our highest priorities are fighting inflation and disciplining public spending. In meeting these goals, spending for low income assistance, for transportation, and for energy objectives must continue. Although enactment of tax reductions for 1981 may be appropriate in the next Congress, it is impossible at this time to allocate funds between tax reductions and deficit reductions. The enclosed allocation shows these two purposes combined.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
