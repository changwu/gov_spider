    The President announced his intention today to nominate former Michigan Governor Jim Blanchard to be the U.S. Ambassador to Canada.
"Our relationship with Canada is absolutely vital," said the President. "They are our largest trading partner and one of our closest neighbors. That's why I am nominating an Ambassador in whom I place such a high degree of trust, my good friend Jim Blanchard. With a voice that will be clearly heard in both Ottawa and Washington, he will ensure that this important relationship continues to be productive for both countries."
