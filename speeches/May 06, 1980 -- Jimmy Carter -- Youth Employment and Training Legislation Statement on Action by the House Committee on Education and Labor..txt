    The enactment of major youth employment and education legislation this year is among my highest priorities.
The strong bill reported today from the House Committee on Education and Labor is consistent with my administration's specifications and budget proposals.
I want to congratulate Chairman Carl Perkins and Congressman Gus Hawkins, chairman of the Employment Opportunities Subcommittee, and Congressmen Bill Goodling and James Jeffords, ranking members of the key subcommittees, for their successful work on this measure.
I look forward to continuing to work closely with House and Senate leaders to enact and to fund this critical initiative.
