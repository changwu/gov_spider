Verona, PA - While the national media has continued their infatuation with the story they want to write (a Mitt v. Newt match-up) they have missed the real story: national conservative leaders and influential early-state social conservatives have begun to point to Rick Santorum's consistent, conviction conservative record and vision for America as the answer to Obama's failed Presidency.
During an appearance on Fox News' "Hannity," former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin said: "If voters start shifting gears and deciding they want ideological consistency, then they're going to start paying attention to say, Rick Santorum."
