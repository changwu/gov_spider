    Columbia, SC -- The top gospel music artists in the country, inspired by Barack Obama's candidacy for president, will embark on an "Embrace the Change" concert tour across South Carolina later this month.
The artists will headline the final days of the South Carolina campaign's "40 Days of Faith & Family" - a grassroots effort that shares with South Carolinians how Barack Obama's family values and faith have shaped his leadership and commitment to bringing all people together around his movement for fundamental change. Gospel stars include Grammy Award winners Mary Mary, Donnie McClurkin and Hezekiah Walker, Stellar Award winner Byron Cage, Dove Award winner Fred Hammond and the world's most famous gospel quartet the Mighty Clouds of Joy, among others. The tour will visit Charleston, Greenwood and Columbia, South Carolina. Holly Davis Carter and her company, Relev√© Entertainment, have spearheaded the creation of the events.
"This is another example of how Barack Obama is defying conventional wisdom about how politics is done and giving new meaning to meeting people at the grassroots level," National Religious Affairs Director Joshua DuBois said. "This concert tour is going to bring new people into the political process and engage people of faith in an unprecedented way."
"Bringing together artists of this caliber, on one stage, in support of one man, speaks volumes about the purpose of that man," Carter said. "And collectively, we embrace this change."
