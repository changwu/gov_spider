    Dear :
I transmit for the consideration of the Congress a report on "Economic Assistance: Programs and Administration," submitted to me on July 13, 1959, by the President's Committee to Study the United States Military Assistance Program. This report analyzes the objectives of economic assistance, reports on the operations of present programs, and makes recommendations for future programs and organizational arrangements.
I have transmitted copies of the report to the Executive Agencies concerned, so that the Committee's recommendations may be carefully considered and, where appropriate, taken into account during the formulation of next year's mutual security program.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
