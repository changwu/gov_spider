PAUL RYAN: "Well, the other side of the hope equation, which is farther from us, was the change equation. You know just a couple days ago on Univision, President Obama admitted that he can't change Washington from the inside. Why do we send presidents to the White House in the first place? We send presidents to change and fix the mess in Washington, and if this president has admitted that he can't change Washington, then you know what, we need to change presidents."
