    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee announced today that Misty Haungs has joined the growing campaign team in Delaware as the state political director based in Wilmington.
"Delaware voters respond to Rudy Giuliani's strong leadership and his conservative record of real results as Mayor of New York City," said the campaign's Deputy National Political Director, Rick Wiley. "Misty's expertise working at the grassroots level and her previous experience in Delaware are the perfect combination to help organize support for Mayor Giuliani."
Haungs will immediately begin serving the campaign in Delaware, having recently relocated from the campaign's New Hampshire office. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has visited Delaware twice since the beginning of the year.
