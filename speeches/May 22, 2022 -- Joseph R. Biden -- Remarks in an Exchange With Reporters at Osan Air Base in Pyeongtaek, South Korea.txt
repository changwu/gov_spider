    Monkeypox 
Q. Mr. President, quick question: What have your health advisers told you your level of concern should be about monkeypox and the cases that are in the United States and around the world?
The President. Well, they haven't told me the level of exposure yet, but it is something that everybody should be concerned about. We're working on it hard to figure out what we do and what vaccine, if any, may be available for it.
But it is a concern in the sense that if it were to spread, it's consequential. That's all they have told me.
Incoming Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia 
Q. Any message for the new Australian leader, the new Prime Minister that you'll be visiting with in Tokyo?
The President. Yes. I'm looking forward to seeing him, and the Quad matters.
Q. Have you spoken to him yet?
The President. I've called him and congratulated him, but that's it.
Thank you all very much.
