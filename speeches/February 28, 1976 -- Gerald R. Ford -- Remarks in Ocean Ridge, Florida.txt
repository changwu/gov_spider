    Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor, and all you wonderful permanent and transient residents of Ocean Ridge. It is great to have an opportunity to stop here for just a few minutes, shake hands, and see really some old and very dear friends of mine, and have an opportunity of making some new acquaintances.
I love the weather, but I like the people a lot more. I don't think that I ought to make a long political speech, and I know darn well you don't want me to. I think my record is clear, whether within the Congress or in the last 19 months as President.
We took on some tough jobs, whether at home or abroad, in a year a half, and the net result is we went through a very traumatic experience, and we are on the way up. The economy is getting better. Our situation worldwide is good. And so every one of us, young and old, should be darned proud of the United States, our country.
And I pledge to you that what we have tried to do for the last 19 months we will continue to do. It means freedom in its broadest context, freedom from the difficulties of any problems at home, freedom from any problems abroad.
With your help on March 9, and then your help on November 2, we can really go to town.
Thank you very, very much.
