    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Japan for the Protection of Migratory Birds and Birds in Danger of Extinction, and their Environment, signed at Tokyo on March 4, 1972. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report from the Department of State regarding the Convention.
This Convention, which marks the culmination of several years of intensive study and consultations between experts of both countries, is designed to provide for the protection of species of birds which are common to both countries or which migrate between them. Recognizing the importance of the preservation of the environment of birds and recognizing that island environments are particularly susceptible to disturbance, the Convention provides that each country will develop programs to preserve and enhance the environment of the birds which are protected under the Convention.
I believe that the Convention establishes an effective basis for cooperation in taking measures for the management and protection of the birds included under the Convention. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Convention and give its advice and consent to ratification.
