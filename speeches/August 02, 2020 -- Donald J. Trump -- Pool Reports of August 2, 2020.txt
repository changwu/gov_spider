 In-town pool report #1 
Good Sunday morning! Pool call time was moved to 7:00 a.m. and we have already loaded into vans (for destination unknown) on what's forecast to be a hot muggy day. Pooler was not Covid-tested this morning. Motorcade rolling at 8:25 a.m.
Apologies in advance as pooler is experiencing technical difficulties with her phone.

 In-town pool report #2 
After an uneventful drive in little traffic we pulled up to Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, VA at 9:05 a.m. Motorcade passed a lone protester on the side of the highway with a tombstone-shaped sign that read 156K. One man flashed a thumbs-up as we drove by, while another woman gave a middle-finger salute. Fewer than 10 protesters were gathered at the entrance of the club holding signs, one dressed in black as the grim reaper. Pool now headed to Lucia's Italian Restaurant nearby.

 In-town pool report #3 
Pool loaded back up in the vans and arrived at entrance of Trump National Golf Club about 1:00 p.m. The crowd grew considerably since this morning, with a few dozen (my estimate) protesters and supporters lining both sides of the street in front of the club. A couple Jeeps with "Trump National Rapid Response Team" signage and colorful flags circled the street. Several of the protesters signs were Covid-related, most supporters waved Trump 2020 campaign flags or American flags. Several neighbors, kids & dogs were out watching the spectacle as well. Loudoun County Sheriff's Office vehicles drove by the peaceful gathering a few times. Motorcade is rolling at 1:54 p.m.
