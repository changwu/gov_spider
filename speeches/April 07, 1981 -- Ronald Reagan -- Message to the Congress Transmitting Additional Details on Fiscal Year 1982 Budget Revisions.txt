    To the Congress of the United States:
On March 10, 1981, I forwarded to the Congress a fully revised 1982 Budget with specific proposals for fiscal year 1981 and 1982 and clearly stated targets for 1983 through 1986. I have already submitted to the Congress the supplemental budget requests, rescissions and deferrals for 1981 and budget amendments for 1982 necessary for the Congress to act upon my proposals.
My Budget Reform plan, first presented February 18th and submitted in detail on March 10th, was one of four parts of my comprehensive program for the Nation's economic recovery. The Budget plan called for substantial budget savings and a redirection of Federal Government activities. It included more than 200 proposals for spending reductions, user charges and off-budget savings that are necessary to put the Federal Government on a path toward fiscal responsibility.
We have already provided extensive information on the proposed budget savings. However, I want to be sure that the Congress and the American people fully understand the reasons for the planned budget savings. Accordingly, I have directed the Office of Management and Budget to compile a document to make available additional details on the specific savings proposals.
I hope that this information will be useful to the various committees and subcommittees of the Congress as they consider my proposals.
