GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE: "Senator McCain is embarking on a very important journey this week. He'll end up in Little Rock, Arkansas, on Friday, but he starts today in Alabama. And he's touring a lot of places this week on what's kind of called the forgotten places of America where people are living and struggling. And he'll be talking about how we can just be reminded that those folks are a part of this country too."
