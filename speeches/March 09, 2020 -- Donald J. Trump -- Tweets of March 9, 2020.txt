The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General, "The risk is low to the average American."Retweets: 25985Favorites: 90579

Cryin' Chuck Schumer said, "You will pay the price for this. You won't know what HIT YOU." That is far beyond simple rhetoric. That is a physical threat, or at least a threat that you better vote for us." Trouble ahead!Retweets: 20778Favorites: 80186

Elizabeth "Pocahontas" Warren singlehandedly destroyed the Bernie Sanders campaign by stripping voters away from his count on Super T. He lost states that he easily would have won if she had dropped out 3 days earlier. The DNC is doing it to Bernie again! Will he ever get angry?Retweets: 17974Favorites: 93534

"Trump has outmastered the Deep State. He's light years ahead of us." MSDNC. I disagree. We have a long way to go. There are still some very bad, sick people in our government - people who do not love our Country (In fact, they hate our Country!).Retweets: 23769Favorites: 85653

So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!Retweets: 83030Favorites: 291234
