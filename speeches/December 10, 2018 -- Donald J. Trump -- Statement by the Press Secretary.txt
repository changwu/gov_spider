    Since President Donald J. Trump's first day in office, he has remained resolute in his commitment to defend the American people from the threat of terrorism. In October, the President signed a comprehensive National Strategy for Counterterrorism, which details the Administration's approach to defeating ISIS and other extremist groups at home and abroad.
Today, President Trump has taken a decisive step to counter one of the gravest dimensions of the terrorist threat â€“ the prospect that ISIS and other extremist groups could attempt to use Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) against the United States. By approving the National Strategy for Countering WMD Terrorism, President Trump has emphasized the urgency of placing chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons beyond the reach of the world's most dangerous people. This strategy is the first-ever comprehensive, public description of the United States Government's approach to combating WMD terrorism.
The President's new strategy has three core elements. First, the United States will lead global efforts to close off terrorists' access to WMD and related materials. Second, the United States will apply consistent pressure against terrorist groups that seek to obtain and use these weapons, including by targeting terrorist WMD specialists and facilitators. Third, as an insurance policy, the United States will strengthen our defenses against WMD threats at home and abroad.
Taking these steps will reduce the likelihood of the most destructive weapons falling into the hands of the world's most dangerous terrorists, and reasserts the President's promise to do whatever is necessary to protect Americans.
