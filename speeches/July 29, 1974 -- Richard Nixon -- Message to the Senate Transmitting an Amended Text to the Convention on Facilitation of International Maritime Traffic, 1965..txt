    To the Senate of the United States:
I am transmitting herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to its acceptance, a copy of an amended text to Article VII of the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic, 1965. The amended text was adopted at a brief special conference in London in November 1973 and has been referred to the Contracting Governments for their acceptance. The report of the Department of State concerning the amended text is also transmitted for the information of the Senate.
The purpose of the amended text is to provide a "tacit amendment" procedure for approving changes in the Annex to the Convention. That Annex sets forth the implementing standards and recommended practices for simplifying and making as uniform as possible the documentary and other formalities required of ships on arriving at or clearing ports. These formalities relate to customs, immigration, public health and other requirements imposed on vessels engaged in international voyages.
I recommend that the Senate advise and consent to acceptance of the amended text, which is intended to expedite the making of desirable changes in the agreed formalities.
