Today, Biden for President is announcing a slate of 91 former and current elected officials and community leaders from Colorado, Tennessee, Utah, Florida, and Maryland that adds to a growing list of prominent national and local leaders supporting the campaign. Today's endorsements further build the campaign's momentum heading into Wednesday night's debate and represent continued enthusiasm in key early and battleground states.
"Each and every one of these leaders are trusted voices in their communities and I am proud to have earned their support," said Vice President Joe Biden. "Their endorsements are crucial to this campaign. I look forward to standing alongside them and speaking with voters in their communities about rebuilding the backbone of our country – the middle class – and unifying America."
