    Kentucky - The Hillary Clinton for President Campaign today named Jonathan Hurst as Kentucky State Director and Jamie Radice as Kentucky Communications Director.
"Hillary Clinton is the only candidate with the strength and experience to lead on day one," said Hurst, a Louisville native. "Hillary's message continues to resonate throughout the state and we are going to work hard to ensure Kentuckians stand with Hillary on May 20th."
Hurst, a veteran of Kentucky politics, was executive director of the Democratic House Caucus prior to joining the campaign.
Radice joins the Kentucky team after working for the Clinton campaign in both Texas and Tennessee.
"The people of Kentucky understand that Hillary spent her life fighting for the American people," said Radice. "Whether it's working to improve our nation's health care system or ensuring our veterans have the benefits they deserve; Hillary has proven time and time again she has a solid record of delivering results."
