    Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
It was with a sense of deep personal shock and moral outrage that I learned of the cowardly and senseless attack today on a group of innocent civilians. This brutal act of terrorism will surely be met with universal revulsion by all men of conscience. I know the pain and distress which you must be experiencing at this tragic moment, and I offer you the condolences and deep sympathy of myself, and all of the American people, who share your sorrow. Please give my personal sympathy to the families of the many who died and to those who were wounded. I am particularly distressed that an event such as this should occur just as you were preparing to depart on your mission of peace. I continue to look forward to talking to you soon and relaying to you in person the deep emotions which this event has aroused in this country. In the meantime, please accept, Mr. Prime Minister, my deepest and most heartfelt condolences.
JIMMY CARTER
