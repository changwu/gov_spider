    The Clinton campaign announced today the addition of veteran Nevada political strategist Ronni Council to its state political department. Council formerly served as the Nevada State Director for the Biden campaign and now joins the Clinton campaign as a Senior Advisor.
"With Senator Biden out of the race, I had to quickly re-think my choice for president," said Council. "After much consideration of the candidates' electability, experience, and the excitement surrounding their campaigns, I went back to the words of Joe Biden himself: â€˜When you caucus, you should close your eyes and imagine the person you're supporting is president at this very moment. Do you believe that person? Do you have confidence that person can handle any of these crises that you know exist?' It became clear to me very quickly Hillary Clinton was the only person I could imagine, right now, as my president."
A native of Las Vegas, Council's political involvement began a decade ago with the Nevada State Democratic Party. Since then, she has worked as a consultant and senior staffer for numerous local and statewide campaigns. Recently, she was the Director of Campaign Operations in Henderson Mayor Jim Gibson's bid for governor and worked on field operations for Clark County Commissioner Rory Reid's campaign. Her varied experience has given Council an extensive understanding of the key Nevada issues and constituencies.
"Ronni is a proven campaigner and a great asset to have on board, with deep connections to the community and Democratic activist networks," said Clinton Nevada Chair Rory Reid. "On a personal note, I'm also excited to have the opportunity to work with Ronni again and have her on our team. We look forward to harnessing her energy and knowledge as we mobilize voters across the state to caucus for Hillary."
