    President Bush will welcome Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker for a working visit on March 6, 2002. A founding member of NATO as well as the European Union, Luxembourg is a close ally of the United States and has taken significant steps to support the war against terrorism, particularly in financial and law enforcement areas. This visit is a further indication of President Bush's determination to work with our European allies to maintain a strong international coalition in the war against terrorism.
