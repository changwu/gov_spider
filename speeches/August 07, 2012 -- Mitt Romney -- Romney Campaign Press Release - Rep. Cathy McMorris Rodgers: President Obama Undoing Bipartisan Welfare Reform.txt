    Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers today made the following statement on President Obama's dismantling of bipartisan welfare reforms:
"Welfare reform is an example of bipartisanship at its finest, with Republicans and Democrats coming together to solve a problem that had plagued our country for decades. It was among the most significant reform efforts of our lifetime. Barack Obama opposed bipartisan welfare reform and now, as president, he is moving to undo one of its central components. By making an end run around Congress and taking this ill-advised, unilateral action, President Obama has shown that he doesn't have the popular support to gut welfare reform through the legislative process â€” and that he doesn't seem to care."
