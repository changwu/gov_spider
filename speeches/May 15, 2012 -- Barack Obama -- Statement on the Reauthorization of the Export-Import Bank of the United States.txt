    I'm pleased that Members of Congress from both parties have come together to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. This important step will help American businesses create jobs here at home and sell their products around the world, all at no cost to taxpayers.
Last year marked the highest level of financing in the Bank's 77-year history, as they supported thousands of U.S. companies, hundreds of thousands of jobs, and brought us closer to the goal I set of doubling our Nation's exports by the end of 2014. Over the last several months, I've met with business leaders here in Washington, visited workers at companies like Boeing, and urged Congress to reauthorize the Bank to keep building on this progress. And I'm glad to see it get done.
Now Congress needs to keep going. Last week, I proposed several commonsense ideas that will help small businesses, reward companies that bring jobs back to America, invest in clean energy and veterans, and help responsible homeowners save money on their mortgages. Congress should continue to do the right thing by acting on proposals we know will grow our economy and create jobs. In the meantime, I look forward to signing this bill into law.
