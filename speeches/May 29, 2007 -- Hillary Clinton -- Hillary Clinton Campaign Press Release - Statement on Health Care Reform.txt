    Clinton Campaign Policy Director Neera Tanden today released the following statement:
"We commend Senator Obama for entering the healthcare debate and supporting incentives to make healthcare more affordable; Senator Clinton has long fought to expand healthcare coverage and initiated the State Children's Health Insurance Program that now covers 6 million children and has led the fight in the Senate to pass health information technology.
"Senator Clinton believes that in addition to making healthcare more accessible, we have to achieve true universal healthcare so that every American has health care coverage."
