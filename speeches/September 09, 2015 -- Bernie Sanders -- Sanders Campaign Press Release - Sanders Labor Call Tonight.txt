    WASHINGTON â€“ Sen. Bernie Sanders will speak with thousands of union members in a telephone conference call at 8:30 p.m. on Wednesday. Sanders will be joined on the call by RoseAnn DeMoro, president of National Nurses United, Larry Hanley, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union and Larry Cohen, the former president of the Communications Workers of America.
"We have been getting strong support from rank-and-file union members across the country," Sanders said. "This call is a chance to thank them and to discuss ways to rebuild the disappearing American middle class."
Among the labor and jobs topics the senator is expected to discuss are job-killing trade deals like the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, his proposal to create jobs by investing $1 trillion in rebuilding crumbling roads and bridges, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020 and making it easier for workers to join unions.
