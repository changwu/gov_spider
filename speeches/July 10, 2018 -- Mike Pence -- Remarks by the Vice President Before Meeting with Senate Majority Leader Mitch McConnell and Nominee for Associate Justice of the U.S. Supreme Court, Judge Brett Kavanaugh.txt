    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, let me first thank the Senate Majority Leader for his outstanding leadership over the last year and a half of this administration. President Trump has actually seen -- confirmed more judges to the circuit courts of this country than any President in American history. And we're grateful to the Majority Leader and to Republicans in the Senate for their strong support.
And we look forward to working very closely with you, Leader, to advance the Senate's proper role in considering Judge Brett Kavanaugh as the President's nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States. As the President said last night, Judge Kavanaugh is a man of impeccable credentials and character. And we're very confident that working with you and reaching out to members of the Senate in both political parties, that members of the Senate and the American people they represent will see, as the President said last night, that Judge Brett Kavanaugh is quite simply the most qualified and the most deserving nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States.
And we're honored to be able to bring him here to the United States and begin the important work that the Senate will do in discharging its constitutional duties to consider this good man and the President's nominee to the Supreme Court.
