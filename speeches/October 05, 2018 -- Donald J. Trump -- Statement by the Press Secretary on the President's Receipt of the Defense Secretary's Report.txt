    Today, President Donald J. Trump received from Deputy Secretary of Defense Shanahan a report that fulfills the mandate of Executive Order 13806, "Assessing and Strengthening the Manufacturing and Defense Industrial Base and Supply Chain Resiliency of the United States."
This historic report is the culmination of the most comprehensive assessment of the manufacturing and defense industrial base in American history. For the first time since President Eisenhower, the President has directly engaged to protect the health and stability of the defense industrial base and its supply chains, which are essential to maintaining our economic and national security.
As a result of the President's leadership, the Secretaries of Defense, Commerce, Energy, and Labor are taking action to implement the report's recommendations for remedying the nearly 300 vulnerabilities it identified.
The Trump Administration is pursuing an aggressive agenda to rebuild our military through increased defense spending and modernization initiatives, while taking strong measures to revitalize American manufacturing. We are reducing burdensome regulations, implementing historic tax cuts, ending unfair trade deals, and much more. These policies represent the understanding, outlined in the 2017 National Security Strategy, that economic security truly is national security.
