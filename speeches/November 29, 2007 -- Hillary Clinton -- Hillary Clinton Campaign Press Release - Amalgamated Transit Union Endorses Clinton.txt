    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU). The ATU is the largest union of transit workers in North America and represents more than 180,000 members employed in the transit, school bus, intercity bus, paratransit and emergency medical transportation industries, as well as other clerical personnel and municipal employees.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to deliver the change that America's working families need," said International President Warren S. George. "She has a deep commitment to rebuilding the middle class and addressing the pocketbook issues that most matter to our members."
George said Clinton was the clear choice of ATU members, due to her strong record supporting working families and her detailed plans to rebuild the nation's infrastructure and promote economic fairness.
"I am honored to receive the support of the men and women of the Amalgamated Transit Union," Clinton said. "When I'm President, America's working families will again have an advocate in the White House."
Clinton has received strong support from major unions representing nearly 4 million working families nationwide. Her endorsements include the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union; International Associations of Machinists and Aerospace Workers; Transportation Communications Union; National Association of Letter Carriers; International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers; American Federation of Teachers; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; and the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers.
