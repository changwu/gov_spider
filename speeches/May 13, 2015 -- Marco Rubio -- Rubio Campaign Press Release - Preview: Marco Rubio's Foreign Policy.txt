May 13, 2015
Later today, Marco will be giving a major foreign policy address at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City. He'll outline his plan to ensure American leadership in the world in the 21st Century.
The Rubio Doctrine consists of 3 pillars:

American strength
The protection of the American economy in a globalized world
Moral clarity regarding America's core values

Here are some other previews of the speech:

Rubio, 43, argues that the government must "adequately fund our military," even in times of peace and stability.

"Russia, China, Iran or any other nation that attempts to block global commerce will know to expect a response from my administration," Rubio will say, according to excerpts of a speech he plans to deliver later on Wednesday at the Council on Foreign Relations.
In the excerpts of the speech, which is scheduled for 3.30 p.m. EDT, Rubio outlined a more aggressive approach to world affairs than Obama has pursued at a time when China is attempting to assert greater control over the South China Sea, a vital shipping route, and Iran has threatened commercial shipping in the Strait of Hormuz.

Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio will propose the U.S. use force to defend American economic interests, including the "disruption of economic activity" caused by one country invading another or by "disruptions" in American shipping.
