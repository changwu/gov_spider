    The Chinese New Year again joins Rosalynn and me in an expression of good wishes to our fellow citizens of Chinese ancestry.
It is a fine opportunity for all Americans to review with pride the accomplishments and vast cultural heritage of a very important segment of our population. Time-honored Chinese wisdom has given us inspiration, Chinese art has enriched our lives and individuals of Chinese origin have immeasurably contributed to the vitality and strength of our society.
For all these reasons this New Year observance makes it highly appropriate for us to salute all Chinese-Americans on whom so much of our national progress and development continues to depend.
