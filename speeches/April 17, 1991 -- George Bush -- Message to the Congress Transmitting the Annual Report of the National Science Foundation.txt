    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to send you the annual report of the National Science Foundation for Fiscal Year 1990. This report describes research supported by the Foundation in the mathematical, physical, biological, social, behavioral, and computer sciences; engineering; and education in those fields.
Achievements such as the ones described here are the basis for much of our Nation's strength -- its economic growth, national security, and the overall well-being of our people.
As we move into the 1990s, the Foundation will continue its efforts to expand our Nation's research achievements, our productivity, and our ability to remain competitive in world markets through innovation and discoveries.
I commend the Foundation's work to you.
George Bush
The White House,
April 17, 1991.
