    Theme Song Highlights Hillary's Record Delivering Change for Latinos
Corpus Christi, TX -- The Clinton campaign announced today a new Latino campaign theme song entitled "Hillary, Hillary Clinton" written and performed by Walter Suhr and the Mango Punch, and introduced by famed Tejano musician Johnny Canales who dedicates the song to "Nuestra Amiga" ("Our Friend") Hillary Clinton.

The lyrics of the song, as sung in Spanish (lyrics are below in English and Spanish), praises Clinton as the one candidate who can bring about the change Latino voters need to end the war in Iraq, achieve universal health care, bring about new and fair immigration laws, and better economic policies. The refrain is: "Hillary, Hillary Clinton, I will vote for her, for Clinton I will vote."
"I was thrilled to introduce this innovative and catchy theme song and dedicate it to a true friend of the Latino community – Hillary Clinton," said Johnny Canales. "While the rhythm and the lyrics are certainly entertaining, the message is very serious: Hillary is the only candidate who has been there for the Hispanic community in Texas, and she will fight for all of us and our families when she is in the White House."
The Hispanic campaign theme song will be used at rallies, gatherings, parties, and other campaign events all around Texas, where there is a deep-rooted connection with music, lyrics and political campaigns. The song is a compilation of a style of music called Mexican Cumbia combined with traditional Mexican music.
Lyrics to the song follow:
ENGLISH LANGUAGE (Translation)
Hillary, Hillary Clinton
(I will vote for her)
Dear Friends, I am Johnny Canales, and I want to dedicate this song
to our friend, Hillary Clinton - you got it! Take it away! Here it is!
Hillary, Hillary Clinton
We need a change, we have to improve
And there is only one candidate that can do it
She has the experience, her husband already lead
And with what they did together our people improved
Hillary, Hillary Clinton (I will vote for her, for her I will vote)
Hillary, Hillary Clinton (I will vote for her, for her I will vote)
A strong president, she can end the war
And give health care to all the people of this land
Fair immigration laws and a better economy
I don't have to think twice, for Hillary I will vote
Hillary, Hillary Clinton (for her I will vote)
Hillary, Hillary Clinton (for her I will vote)
For Clinton I will vote
