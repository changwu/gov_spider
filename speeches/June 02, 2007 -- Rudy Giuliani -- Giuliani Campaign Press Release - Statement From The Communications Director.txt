    Below is a statement from Giuliani Communications Director Katie Levinson regarding tonight's Democrat debate:
"Tonight the leading Democrats once again proved they are out of the mainstream on the important issues facing our country â€“ whether it's being in denial about the terrorists' war against us or calling for a massive tax increase. It couldn't be more clear that America needs a strong leader like Rudy Giuliani who understands we need to be on offense in the war on terror and provide tax relief to grow our economy."
