    To the Congress of the United States: 
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Albania (the "Treaty"), signed at Tirana on December 22, 2020. I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.
The Treaty would replace the extradition treaty between the United States and Albania, signed at Tirana on March 1, 1933. The Treaty follows generally the form and content of other extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States. It would replace an outmoded list of extraditable offenses with a modern "dual criminality" approach, which would enable extradition for such offenses as money laundering, cyber-related crimes, and other newer offenses not appearing on the list. The Treaty also contains a modernized "political offense" clause and provides that extradition shall not be refused based on the nationality of the person sought. Finally, the Treaty incorporates a series of procedural improvements to streamline and expedite the extradition process.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty, and give its advice and consent to ratification.
