    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 8/8/94)(House)(Brown (D) CA)
The Administration would support House passage of H.R. 4489 if section 117, concerning termination liability for Space Station contracts, were deleted. In addition, as the bill moves through the legislative process, changes will be sought to section 119, Limitation on Transfers to Russia; Title III, Revisions to the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act; and other provisions depending on further review of the bill.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 4489 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. Because section 117 would require NASA to pay contact termination costs, OMB's preliminary PAYGO estimate is that H.R. 4489 would increase the deficit by $750 million for FY 1995. Final scoring of this legislation may differ from this estimate.
