    On the second anniversary of the Beijing massacre, we recall the disappointment, heartbreak, anger, and frustration that we all felt as our hopes and those of the people of China were raised and then dashed on Tiananmen Square. The brutal and arbitrary use of deadly force against the peaceably demonstrating people of China can never be forgotten.
When the Beijing Spring was crushed, I was the first leader of the free nations to condemn the violence, impose sanctions, and urge that China return to the path of reform. Today, we maintain more sanctions against China for its human rights violations than any other nation. Our goal is to remain engaged over the long term with China in order to foster its return to a pattern of reform.
