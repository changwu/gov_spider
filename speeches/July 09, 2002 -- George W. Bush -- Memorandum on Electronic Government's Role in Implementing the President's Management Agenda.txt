    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Subject: Electronic Government's Role in Implementing the President's Management Agenda
My Administration's vision for Government reform is guided by three principles. Government should be citizen-centered, results-oriented, and market-based. These principles have been woven into the five Government-wide reform goals outlined in my Administration's Management Agenda: strategic management of human capital, budget and performance integration, competitive sourcing, expanded use of the internet and computer resources to provide Government services (Electronic-Government or E-Government), and improved financial management. Effective implementation of E-Government is important in making Government more responsive and cost-effective.
Our success depends on agencies working as a team across traditional boundaries to better serve the American people, focusing on citizens rather than individual agency needs. I thank agencies who have actively engaged in cross-agency teamwork, using E-Government to create more cost-effective and efficient ways to serve citizens, and I urge others to follow their lead.
