    Well, what about talking about the two we won? You know, there were three races today. We feel very good about it. Forbes spent four million bucks in Arizona. He bought — or tried to buy Arizona.
He ends up, I guess, Buchanan winning.
QUESTION: But, sir, if you're going to come in third, what does that do to your campaign? You've got to be extremely upset ...
DOLE: What are you so negative about? Did you have a bad day today? We won two out of three today. We're going to win in South Carolina, and, you know, I can't help it if Forbes spends $4 million to our $800,000 in Arizona.
QUESTION: (OFF MIKE) your strategy?
[audio gap]
QUESTION: Can we ask you what do you think about the results today — Arizona?
DOLE: Well, I like the Dakotas best, of course. But we won two out of three, and we're going to win three out of four this week. It's going to be we're back in the winning column. It feels good.
I've just spoken to the North Dakota victory party, and I'll call into South Dakota about 10:00, so ...
QUESTION: What happened in Arizona, Senator?
DOLE: Forbes spent $4 million. That's what happened. we spent $860,000. And what he does when he spends all that money, as he did in South Dakota, it doesn't help him. It seems to help Buchanan. it drives me down, but it doesn't drive him up. So I don't know how long — we can't match that kind of spending. But ...
QUESTION: How are you going to ...
DOLE: I don't know. I mean, if he wants to spend $100, $200 million, it's pretty hard to — we're going to reach our cap one of these days, if not very soon.
But his — he doesn't have any cap.
QUESTION: (OFF MIKE) South Carolina?
DOLE: Big time. Three out of four this week.
QUESTION: (OFF MIKE)
DOLE: I don't know. Well, I can't spend $4 million in Arizona mean, you ought to report what,s happening. This guy's trying to buy the election, and so far he hasn't had much success. He's gotten Delaware, and probably second in Arizona, and he spent $30-some million dollars. Thirty some million dollars.
(UNKNOWN): Thank you, Senator.
QUESTION: Are all the chips in South Carolina now, Senator?
DOLE: Not all of them.
QUESTION: How many?
DOLE: Oh, I don't know, I haven't counted them.
QUESTION: Is it a must win for you (OFF-MIKE)?
QUESTION: Could you withstand a loss there, Senator?
DOLE: Well, I'd rather not think about that.
QUESTION: But isn't South Carolina, isn't that a critical ...
DOLE: It's very important, big time. That's (OFF-MIKE) the gateway to the South. It's also right before those eight primaries Tuesday. It's going to be the big story on Sunday in all your papers, networks, whatever.
QUESTION: Is your day job getting in the way here? (OFF-MIKE) Is that interfering with the campaign?
DOLE: I don't think so.
QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)
DOLE: If I had $4 million in Arizona we'd have won all three.
(UNKNOWN): Thank you, Senator.
