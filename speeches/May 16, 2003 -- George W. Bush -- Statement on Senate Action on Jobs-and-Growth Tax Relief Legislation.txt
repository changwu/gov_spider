    I commend the Senate for its bipartisan passage of a jobs-and-growth package that includes all of the components of my original plan. By including a measure to completely abolish the double taxation of dividends, the Senate has demonstrated that they are committed to creating as many jobs as possible for American workers. The Senate bill also speeds income-tax rate cuts for individuals and families, increases the child credit, provides marriage penalty relief, and increases expensing for small businesses.
Jobs are on the line, and I look forward to working with the full Congress to pass a robust economic growth plan. I call on Congress to resolve their differences quickly so that I can sign a bill that will help create jobs, boost take-home pay, and spur economic growth.
