Wow just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons opened up an investigation on me for no reason & with no proof after I fired Lyin' James Comey a total sleaze!Retweets: 30589Favorites: 125463

...Funny thing about James Comey. Everybody wanted him fired Republican and Democrat alike. After the rigged & botched Crooked Hillary investigation where she was interviewed on July 4th Weekend not recorded or sworn in and where she said she didn't know anything (a lie)....Retweets: 21529Favorites: 89295

....the FBI was in complete turmoil (see N.Y. Post) because of Comey's poor leadership and the way he handled the Clinton mess (not to mention his usurpation of powers from the Justice Department). My firing of James Comey was a great day for America. He was a Crooked Cop......Retweets: 21913Favorites: 94976

.....who is being totally protected by his best friend Bob Mueller & the 13 Angry Democrats - leaking machines who have NO interest in going after the Real Collusion (and much more) by Crooked Hillary Clinton her Campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Just Watch!Retweets: 19477Favorites: 85444

I have been FAR tougher on Russia than Obama Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President. At the same time & as I have often said getting along with Russia is a good thing not a bad thing. I fully expect that someday we will have good relations with Russia again!Retweets: 20503Favorites: 100231

Lyin' James Comey Andrew McCabe Peter S and his lover agent Lisa Page & more all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President. Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!Retweets: 27269Favorites: 110175

Democrats should come back to Washington and work to end the Shutdown while at the same time ending the horrible humanitarian crisis at our Southern Border. I am in the White House waiting for you!Retweets: 24113Favorites: 102061

I just watched a Fake reporter from the Amazon Washington Post say the White House is 'chaotic there does not seem to be a strategy for this Shutdown. There is no plan.' The Fakes always like talking Chaos there is NONE. In fact there's almost nobody in the W.H. but me and...Retweets: 23082Favorites: 105970

....I do have a plan on the Shutdown. But to understand that plan you would have to understand the fact that I won the election and I promised safety and security for the American people. Part of that promise was a Wall at the Southern Border. Elections have consequences!Retweets: 41234Favorites: 182846

We have a massive Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border. We will be out for a long time unless the Democrats come back from their 'vacations' and get back to work. I am in the White House ready to sign!Retweets: 28316Favorites: 117777
