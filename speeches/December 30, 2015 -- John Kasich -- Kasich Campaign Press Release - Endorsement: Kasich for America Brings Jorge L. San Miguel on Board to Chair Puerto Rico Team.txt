    Today Kasich for America announced that Jorge L. San Miguel, Vice President of the Puerto Rico Republican Party, will serve as the chair for Governor Kasich's newly created Puerto Rico team.
Said San Miguel, "Governor Kasich is a true friend to Puerto Ricoâ€”he understands the importance of permanently resolving Puerto Rico's status issue and letting Puerto Ricans determine their own destiny as American citizens, in favor of statehood if they so choose in a federally binding process. In addition, his plans for balancing the federal budget, spurring job creation and strengthening the national defense are resonating with Puerto Rican voters, and I look forward to building a vibrant team in the months ahead."
San Miguel is currently second vice president of the Puerto Rico Republican Party. Before that, he served as Deputy Director for Federal Affairs, helping advance the cause of statehood for Puerto Rico in Congress. He is a recognized attorney specializing in energy and environmental law at the law firm of Ferraiuoli, LLC in San Juan, representing businesses in policymaking, regulatory, permitting and economic development matters. In 2012 he served on the Republican Party Platform Committee and its subcommittee on Energy, Agriculture and the Environment, under Co-Chairs Senator John Hoeven (R-ND) and Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn (R-TN).
"I'm delighted to welcome Mr. San Miguel to our team," said Gov. Kasich. "He brings a wealth of experience that will inform our efforts as we carry our message to Puerto Rican voters. I look forward to hearing his insights in order to move the ball forward on statehood for Puerto Rico, should the majority of Puerto Ricans choose this option, and resolve the status issue."
