    I join the American people in sending my best wishes to those abroad and here at home that are celebrating Bangladesh Independence Day. Thirty-nine years ago, the people of Bangladesh earned their independence, and since then, our two nations have shared a commitment to democratic values and created an enduring friendship. Here at home, those Americans that can trace their roots to Bangladesh continue to be active in all industries and are an important part of our communities. On this independence day, I wish them all the best.
