(House Rules)
(Rep. Gordon, D-Tennessee, and 101 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 5116, as reported by the House Science and Technology Committee. The Administration believes that the America COMPETES Act should be reauthorized this year so that the Nation can continue to build on the achievements of the original Act. The Administration believes that H.R. 5116 helps provide a valuable roadmap to guide Federal policies in innovation, competitiveness, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and training. These policies will be essential to promoting American ingenuity, supporting the workforce of today as well as the entrepreneurs and industries of tomorrow, and sustaining American leadership in innovation that previous generations worked so hard to attain. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to further refine the bill as it moves through the legislative process.
