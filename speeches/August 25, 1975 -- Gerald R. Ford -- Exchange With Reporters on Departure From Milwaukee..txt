    WELL, it has been a really great day with a wide variety of activities that I think have been very constructive. I leave Milwaukee with great memories, and I think a good dialog between the White House people, the Cabinet, and myself with the people of Milwaukee, and the opportunity to have this dialog, I am most appreciative of.
REPORTER. What happened at your meeting with Republican leaders in Wisconsin, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT. We talked about how we hope to increase the Republican contribution in the political arena in the State of Wisconsin. I think we can. We've got good leadership, we've got good people, and I think the Republican Party can be a stronger factor in the two-party system in the State of Wisconsin.
Q. Mr. President, how influential is this type of conference in making your decisions?
THE PRESIDENT. They are very helpful. We had 19 organizations representing a wide variety of political and sociological views. It is helpful not only to my Cabinet and my top administrative people but it is important to me to get the kind of questions they ask, the suggestions they make. Too often I think administrations in the past have listened only to the lobbyists in Washington. What we are trying to do with these various White House Conferences around the country is to get the American people from all walks of life to make constructive suggestions and recommendations. I can assure you we listen to them.
Q. Of all the suggestions today, what one particularly impressed you?
THE PRESIDENT. I don't think I ought to discriminate against those of one kind or praise others. They were all good, and we will make an honest effort to evaluate their recommendations and hopefully come up with some answers that will satisfy people not only in Milwaukee but elsewhere throughout the country.
Thank you very much, everybody. It's nice to see you all.
REPORTER. Thank you, Mr. President.
