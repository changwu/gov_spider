    The President has approved U.S. commercial space policy guidelines aimed at expanding private sector investment in space by the market-driven commercial space sector. These guidelines are the result of a 9-month interagency review of the commercial space sector conducted by the Vice President and the National Space Council.
The U.S. commercial space policy guidelines recognize that a robust commercial space sector has the potential to generate new technologies, markets, jobs, and other important economic benefits to the Nation. The guidelines contain new provisions and definitions of key concepts to provide for more effective implementation of the national space policy by U.S. Agencies.
