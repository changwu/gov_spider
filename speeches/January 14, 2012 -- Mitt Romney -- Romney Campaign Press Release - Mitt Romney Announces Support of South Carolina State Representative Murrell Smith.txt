    Mitt Romney today announced the support of South Carolina State Representative Murrell Smith.
"I'm proud to have Murrell's support," said Mitt Romney. "Like me, Murrell believes our country needs to empower, not hamper, small businesses and entrepreneurs to give our country lasting economic growth. I look forward to working with Murrell in the months to come to spread this message to all South Carolinians."
"President Obama's time in office has been a historic failure," said State Representative Murrell Smith. "Our country cannot afford four more years of the same policies of higher taxes, reckless spending, and a disastrous healthcare law. Mitt Romney is a conservative businessman who spent his life in the real economy. He knows how to turn our country around and create jobs for the middle class. I urge all South Carolinians that want to change the direction of the country to join me in supporting Mitt Romney."
