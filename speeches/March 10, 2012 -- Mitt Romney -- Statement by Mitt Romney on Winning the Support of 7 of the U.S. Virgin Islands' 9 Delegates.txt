    Mitt Romney made the following statement on winning the support of 7 of the U.S. Virgin Islands' 9 delegates:
"I am delighted to have won the support of 7 of the Virgin Islands' 9 National Convention Delegates.  The message from the people of the Virgin Islands is clear, and it's the same message I hear all over the country. They do not want to send a career politician to Washington. Rather, they want to send a career businessman. I've spent my life turning around failing businesses and helping to start new ones.  Our country badly needs a turnaround. Now, thanks to the backing of the good people of the Virgin Islands, we're one step closer to our goal of recapturing the White House and putting America back on track.
"In particular, I want to thank Senator Holland Redfield, USVI National Committeeman, Lilliana Belardo, USVI National Committeewoman, and Herb Schoenbohm, Chairman of the USVI Republican State Committee, for their support and for organizing today's caucus."
