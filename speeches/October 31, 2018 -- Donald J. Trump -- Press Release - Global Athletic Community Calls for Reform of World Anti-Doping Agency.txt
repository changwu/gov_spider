    Today, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), together with the United States Anti-Doping Agency, convened a meeting at the White House to discuss the urgent need to reform the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Representatives in attendance included Linda Helleland, WADA Vice President and Norway's Minister of Youth; fourteen members of the global athletic community; and Ministers of Sport and the leaders of National Anti-Doping Organizations from Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom. American Olympic athlete Katie Ledecky sent a video message of support to the attendees, all of whom were united in their call for widespread, athlete-centered reform of the WADA-led anti-doping system.
"This meeting of representatives of the global athletic community and international sports leadership gathered today to demonstrate a consensus on anti-doping, and to emphasize an international commitment to clean sport and fair play," said ONDCP Deputy Director James Carroll. "We are committed to ensuring there is a strong domestic and global anti-doping program in place. Young people around the world should have the opportunity to experience all the benefits that clean competition gives them. We are united in calling for the World Anti-Doping Agency to provide stronger leadership on behalf of clean competition."
