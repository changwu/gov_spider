    I am deeply outraged by the bomb explosion today at a shopping center in Manchester, England, which injured scores of innocent people, some very seriously. I join Prime Minister Major and Prime Minister Bruton in utterly condemning this brutal and cowardly act of terrorism. Such viciousness deserves universal condemnation. I wish the British Government every success in finding and bringing to justice those responsible.
On behalf of the American people, Hillary and I extend our deepest sympathies to the victims and their families. Our prayers are with them. We have known the shock and pain of terrorism in our country, the horror of the sudden shattering of daily life. The bombing today underscores the need for all of us to join together to fight terrorism and violence in all parts of the world.
Last week, historic talks aimed at finding a lasting settlement to the conflict in Northern Ireland began in Belfast. The people of Northern Ireland voted to send their representatives to those talks, expressing their deep desire for peace and their commitment to democratic means of resolving their differences. The men of violence have once again tried to dash their hopes. I want the people who have so much at stake in those talks to know that the United States will stand with them in their continuing search for peace.
