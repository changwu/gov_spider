    Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy
Good morning. We had a good dinner last night. I am pleased with the progress we're making onâ€”to, one, address the current crisis. I am pleased that we're discussing a way forward to make sure that such a crisis is unlikely to occur again. And I am pleased that the leaders reaffirmed the principles behind open markets and free trade. One of the dangers during a crisis such as this is that people will start implementing protectionist policies.
Obviously, you know, this crisis has not ended. There's some progress being made, but there's still a lot of more work to be done. And so we had a good, frank discussion last night. I look forward to the discussions today. And we'll see you after the meetings have ended.
Thank you.
