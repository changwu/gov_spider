    India and the United States share a passion for and demonstrated leadership in agricultural research, technology, and education. Working together, they can discover and launch innovative solutions for tackling challenges that confront not just the United States and India, but in countries around the world.
By co-hosting the Agriculture and Food Security Expo, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) demonstrate the potential of partnership. The exposition showcases the efforts of U.S. and Indian institutions, including universities, non-government organizations, and corporations, to develop tools and technologies that are revolutionizing the lives of Indian farmers. Farmers who use the technologies will be on-site to demonstrate and discuss their impact on daily life.
Through the President's initiative, Feed the Future, the United States is redoubling its commitment to solving global hunger and food security. The innovations showcased at the expo offer important insights on new tools and technologies that, when scaled, have the power to transform the agricultural landscape in India and abroad.
EXHIBITORS
The Central Institute of Agricultural Engineering (CIAE) has been working to create more compact, lighter versions of common farming tools – such as the sickle, groundnut decorticator, maize sheller, and twin wheel hoe – to enable female farmers to become more productive in their labor. For example, the weeder reduces labor by 25 percent than traditional hand hoeing. CIAE designed these tools based on anthropometric and strength capabilities of Indian farm women. More than 285 million women in India earn their livelihoods from agriculture.

Since 2008, Mahindra has partnered with USAID to extend its network to be more responsive to small rural farmers. Through that partnership, there has been a growth of Samriddhi farm centers across India. Mahindra is expanding its manufacturing base with a new plant in the United States which employs more than 200 people.
