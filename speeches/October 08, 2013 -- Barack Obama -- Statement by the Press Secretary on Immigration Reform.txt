    The enthusiastic demonstration of support for immigration reform this week has proven to Congress that the broad coalition behind commonsense solutions to our nation's broken immigration laws is as strong as it has ever been. It's time for the House of Representatives to reopen the government, pay their bills, and get back to the important work of moving the economy forward. More than 100 days ago, the Senate passed a strong bipartisan immigration reform bill that would reduce the deficit by over $800 billion and create jobs. House Democrats introduced a similar bill last week. It is time for House Republicans to put politics aside and join Democrats to fix our broken immigration system and make the economy stronger.
