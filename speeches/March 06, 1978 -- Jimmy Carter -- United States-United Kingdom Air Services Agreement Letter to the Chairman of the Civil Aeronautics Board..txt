    To Chairman Allred Kahn
I have examined your order (Docket 32183) dated February 28, 1978, which proposes to take certain actions regarding air fares and services between points in Texas and London.
The Board and I share the same commitment to low-priced, competitive air transportation, a principle embodied in Article 12, Section 2 of the US-UK Air Services Agreement of 1977 (Bermuda II). I agree with the Board that the action of the British government in rejecting low-fare tariffs filed by Braniff International Airways for its new Dallas/Ft. Worth-London route is inconsistent with Bermuda II.
I note, however, that negotiations with the British government concerning this matter began on February 10 and resume today for the period March 6 through March 17. I am confident that during these negotiations the British government will adopt a position consistent with Bermuda II, and I therefore request that you withdraw your order at this time. If a satisfactory resolution with the British is not reached by March 17, I will reconsider the need for unilateral action by the United States.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
[The Honorable Alfred Kahn, Chairman, Civil Aeronautics Board, Washington, D.C. 20428]
