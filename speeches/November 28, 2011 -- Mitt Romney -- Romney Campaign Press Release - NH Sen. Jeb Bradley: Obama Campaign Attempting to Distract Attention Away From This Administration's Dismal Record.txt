    New Hampshire Senate Majority Leader and Romney for President supporter Jeb Bradley made the following statement on the Democratic National Committee's misleading advertisement and press conference call:
"After three years in office, President Obama has failed to create jobs and turn around the economy. Instead, his policies continue to cripple the middle class and pile on staggering amounts of debt. As millions of Americans look for work, the Obama campaign and Democrats are attempting to distract attention away from this administration's dismal record. The attack they have launched against Mitt Romney shows just how worried they are about facing him in the general election."
