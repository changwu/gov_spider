    President Donald J. Trump is pleased to have reached a bipartisan compromise with Congressional Leadership on a two-year budget and debt ceiling deal. The agreement includes absolutely no poison pills. This compromise will continue the rebuilding of our great military and ensure our veterans receive the care they deserve. Both the House and the Senate should quickly move this deal to the President's desk for signature.
