    March is Red Cross Month. Every one of us knows the important work the Red Cross does--disaster relief, the distribution of blood, service to the Armed Forces, first aid in water safety instruction, and a wide variety of community health programs.
But the Red Cross can't do them alone. It needs help. This month, I hope .that you will become a Red Cross volunteer. Support your local chapter's membership enrollment drive, and take a few minutes to donate blood. It's easy. I know because I'm a 6-gallon donor myself, and I'm giving another pint this month.
As Honorary Chairman of the Red Cross, I urge you to help. For nearly 100 years, America has been counting on the Red Cross. This month the Red Cross is counting on you.
Every day some vital Red Cross service touches people's lives. It may be disaster relief, the collection of blood or first aid instruction. But the Red Cross is there.
March is Red Cross Month. As Honorary Chairman, I urge you all to support your local Red Cross chapter.
