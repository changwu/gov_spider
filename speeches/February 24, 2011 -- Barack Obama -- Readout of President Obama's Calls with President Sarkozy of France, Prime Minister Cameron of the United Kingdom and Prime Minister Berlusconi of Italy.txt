    The President spoke today, in separate calls, with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, Prime Minister David Cameron of the United Kingdom, and Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy to continue consultations on the situation in Libya and coordinate our urgent efforts to respond to developments and ensure that there is appropriate accountability. The President expressed his deep concern with the Libyan governmentâ€™s use of violence which violates international norms and every standard of human decency, and discussed appropriate and effective ways for the international community to immediately respond. The leaders affirmed their strong support for the universal rights of the Libyan people, including the right to peaceful assembly, free speech, and the ability of the Libyan people to determine their own destiny and agreed that these rights must be respected. The leaders discussed the range of options that both the United States and European countries are preparing to hold the Libyan government accountable for its actions, as well as planning for humanitarian assistance. The leaders agreed to maintain close consultations on this issue going forward.
