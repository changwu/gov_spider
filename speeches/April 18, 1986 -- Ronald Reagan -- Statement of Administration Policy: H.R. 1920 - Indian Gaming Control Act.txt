    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Udall (D) Arizona and three others)
The Administration urges that the House defer its consideration of H.R. 1920 pending completion of an Administration proposal concerning gaming on Indian reservations. H.R. 1920 is overly permissive and would not effectively regulate gaming on Indian reservations. For example, H.R. 1920 would:
— not specifically subject certain gaming (pari-mutuel or casino gambling) on Indian reservations to State regulation; and
— not allow traditional Secretarial oversight or review of gaming leases, management contracts or tribal gaming ordinances.
