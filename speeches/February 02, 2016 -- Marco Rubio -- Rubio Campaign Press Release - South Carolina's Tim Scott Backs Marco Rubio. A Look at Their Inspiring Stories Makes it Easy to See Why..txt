Senator Tim Scott, the stalwart South Carolina conservative who has become a national name thanks to his optimistic vision and focus on economic opportunity, has made his pick for President.

It's easy to see the parallels between Senator Scott and Marco: Both are optimistic, next generation conservatives.
But their shared story goes beyond that.

Marco has talked on the trail about growing up living paycheck to paycheck; Scott's mother working 16 hours a day to provide for him and his brother.

That background has made Scott a leading voice in crafting conservative solutions to challenge poverty because he knows it's not about where you start, it's about where you are going.
Earlier this year, he hosted the Kemp Poverty Forum to address this issue:

When it comes to politics, Scott has taken on the establishment, too.

In his first congressional race, he took on two political heirs — the sons of former South Carolina Governors and Senators. It would have been easy to wait, but Scott knew the moment demanded him.  Scott became the first black Republican in Congress from the South since Reconstruction.

Scott was appointed to the U.S. Senate in 2012 and won the seat outright in 2014, a remarkable climb from living in working poverty.
It's the same dream Marco's parents worked so hard to provide for him. With his incredible life story, it's pretty easy to see why Senator Scott believes in Marco — and why his support is a big deal.
