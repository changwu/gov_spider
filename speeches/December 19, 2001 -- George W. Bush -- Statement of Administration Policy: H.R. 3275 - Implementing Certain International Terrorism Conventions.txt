    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Smith (R) Texas)
The Administration supports rapid enactment of H.R. 3275, which would implement the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. These Conventions are both important to ensure that all nations have in place laws to enable full and effective international cooperation against terrorism. By enacting this legislation, the United States will be in a position to lead the cooperative effort against terrorist bombings and terrorist finances.
