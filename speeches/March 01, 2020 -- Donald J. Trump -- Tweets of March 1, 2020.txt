Sleepy Joe Biden's victory in the South Carolina Democrat Primary should be the end of Mini Mike Bloomberg's Joke of a campaign. After the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates, Mini Mike now has Biden split up his very few voters, taking many away!Retweets: 18523Favorites: 90623

Tom Steyer who, other than Mini Mike Bloomberg, spent more dollars for NOTHING than any candidate in history, quit the race today proclaiming how thrilled he was to be a part of the the Democrat Clown Show. Go away Tom and save whatever little money you have left!Retweets: 16502Favorites: 79939

I would find it hard to believe that failed presidential candidates Tom Steyer, or Mini Mike Bloombeg, would contribute to the Democrat Party, even against me, after the way they have been treated - laughed at & mocked. The real politicians ate them up and spit them out!Retweets: 18722Favorites: 91521

Mini Mike Bloomberg's consultants and so-called "advisors"(how did that advice work out? Don't ask!), are on the "gravy train" and all making a fortune for themselves pushing Mini hard, when they knew he never had what it takes. Don't pay them anymore Mike, they led you down....Retweets: 14719Favorites: 69573

Coronavirus: In addition to screening travelers "prior to boarding" from certain designated high risk countries, or areas within those countries, they will also be screened when they arrive in America. Thank you! @VP @SecAzar @CDCgov @CDCDirectorRetweets: 18025Favorites: 71404

A Poll in today's New York Post says that 77% of "U.S. adults have confidence in their government's ability to handle the Coronavirus (Number One), compared to other health threats." 64% for Zika, 58% for Ebola. Others way down on list. Our professionals are doing a great job!Retweets: 23042Favorites: 99929

People are disgusted and embarrassed by the Fake News Media, as headed by the @nytimes, @washingtonpost, @comcast & MSDNC, @ABC, @CBSNews and more. They no longer believe what they see and read, and for good reason. Fake News is, indeed, THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!Retweets: 35130Favorites: 120802
