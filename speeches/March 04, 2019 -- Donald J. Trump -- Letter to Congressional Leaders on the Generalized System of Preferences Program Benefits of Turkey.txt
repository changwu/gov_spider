    Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:) 
In accordance with section 502(f)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (Trade Act) (19 U.S.C. 2462(f)(2)), I am providing notice of my intent to terminate the designation of Turkey as a beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program.
I am taking this step because I have determined that Turkey should no longer be designated as a GSP beneficiary developing country based on its level of economic development as set forth in section 502(c)(4) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)(2)).
In particular, in the four and a half decades since Turkey's designation as a GSP beneficiary developing country, Turkey's economy has grown and diversified. Increases in Gross National Income per capita, declining poverty rates, and export diversification by trading partner and by sector are all evidence of Turkey's increased level of economic development. In addition, Turkey has graduated from other developed countries' GSP programs due to its increase in economic development or through reciprocal arrangements.
The United States remains committed to fair and reciprocal trade with Turkey.
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
