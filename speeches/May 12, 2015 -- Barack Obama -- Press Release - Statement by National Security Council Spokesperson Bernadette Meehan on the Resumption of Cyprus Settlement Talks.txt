    The United States welcomes the announcement that Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders will resume settlement talks on May 15. We reaffirm our full support for the UN-facilitated process under UN Special Adviser Espen Barth Eide, and we reiterate our willingness to assist the process in any way the parties find useful. We encourage the parties to reach a settlement as soon as possible to reunify the island as a bizonal, bicommunal federation, which would benefit all Cypriots as well as the wider region.
