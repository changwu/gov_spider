    To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting herewith the First Annual Report of the Federal Labor Relations Authority for the Fiscal Year ended September 30, 1979, in accordance with the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-454, Sec. 701) (5 U.S.C. 7104(e)).
As the independent agency set up to resolve union-management disputes in the Federal sector, the Authority oversees the creation of bargaining units, supervises elections, rules on the scope of negotiations, hears complaints of unfair labor practices, and interprets the labor-management statute. These activities have greatly enhanced the credibility and effectiveness of the Federal personnel system in resolving union-management disputes.
JIMMY CARTER
