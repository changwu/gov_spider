    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I have the pleasure to transmit and commend to the Congress "A Unified National Program for Floodplain Management." This report, prepared by the Water Resources Council, sets forth a program for managing the Nation's floodplains. The need for a comprehensive and coordinated management program is underscored by recent disastrous floods and the continued degradation of wetlands and other valuable floodplain environments.
I support the approach set out in the conceptual framework and the recommended Federal and State actions and I am confident that Federal, State and local governments working together within this framework can ensure the wise use and management of the Nation's floodplains. I am asking the Council to make the report available to all levels of government and to the public at large. By Executive Order, I have already directed the agencies of the Executive Branch to take action to implement the Federal role in a unified program for floodplain management. As the program develops, I will make further recommendations for Federal action to help State and local governments carry out their key roles.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
