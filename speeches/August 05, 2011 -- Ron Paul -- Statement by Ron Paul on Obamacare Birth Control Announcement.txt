    Obamacare to force health insurance plans to cover birth control, morning after pill
LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” Today, 2012 Republican presidential candidate Congressman Ron Paul commented on an announcement this week by the Health and Human Services department that under the Obama administration's new healthcare law, health insurance plans will be forced to provide coverage for birth control. See comments below.
"The Obama administration's decision to mandate coverage of birth control and morning-after pills is payback to Planned Parenthood and big pharmaceutical companies for their support of Obamacare.
"This mandate violates the conscience of millions of pro-life Americans.
"In Congress, I have introduced H.R. 1099, the Taxpayer Freedom of Conscience Act, which removes all federal funding for domestic and international family planning.
"As President, I plan to defund Obamacare and all federal programs that use tax money taken from the American people to promote abortion.
"I pledge also to veto any bill with funding for Planned Parenthood or any other international family planning regimes."
