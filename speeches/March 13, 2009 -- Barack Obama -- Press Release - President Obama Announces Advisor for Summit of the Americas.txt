    Today, the President is pleased to announce the appointment of Ambassador Jeffrey Davidow as White House Advisor for the Summit of the Americas.
As President Obama said on February 10 he will attend the Summit of the Americas to be held in Trinidad and Tobago on April 17-19. The President is looking forward to discussions with the leaders at the Summit and to promoting a partnership based on mutual respect that will be beneficial to the people of the Americas.
Ambassador Davidow will oversee preparations for the President's participation in the Summit and, in conjunction with the Department of State, will help manage Summit-related diplomacy in the region.
Ambassador Davidow has taken a leave of absence from his position as President of the Institute of the Americas at the University of California at San Diego in order to serve as Advisor for the Summit. A career Foreign Service Officer for 34 years, Ambassador Davidow was Assistant Secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs and ambassador to Mexico, Venezuela and Zambia, in addition to serving in several other posts in Latin America and Africa before retiring in 2003.
