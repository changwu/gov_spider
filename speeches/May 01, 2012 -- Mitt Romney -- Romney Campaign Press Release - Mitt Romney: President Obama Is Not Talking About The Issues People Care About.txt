CHARLIE ROSE: "What people worry about, David Brooks wrote in a column in The New York Times today, is that this will turn out into who can tear each other down the most and there will not be a fair airing of the issues that are of concern to most Americans—negative, negative, negative. And we saw that during the GOP primaries."
MITT ROMNEY:  "Yeah, I think what you've seen so far with the President and I won't rehearse all of the attacks, but you began with Romney wouldn't have gone after Osama bin Laden. These silly kinds of attacks, it's like, what has that got to do with getting our economy going? Of course, I would have taken out Osama bin Laden, but what's the right course for the economy? What should we do with taxes? What should we do with regulation? What should we do with trade overseas? What should we do with our energy policy? How about our labor policy? These are important issues people care about. The President's not talking about them. My campaign is. And I mean, yesterday, you just had a clip of me at a fishing dock talking about the attack on small business. We need to encourage small business."
