    As I have stated on numerous occasions, the entire resources of the Federal Government are available to assist our men in South Viet-Nam. Our soldiers, sailors, and airmen have a blank check for the equipment they need to assist the South Vietnamese. We seek no wider war, but so long as American men are in South Viet-Nam, they shall have the very best support that this country can give them. The speedy action by the Congress on this appropriation is a testament to the support our men have from the American people.
