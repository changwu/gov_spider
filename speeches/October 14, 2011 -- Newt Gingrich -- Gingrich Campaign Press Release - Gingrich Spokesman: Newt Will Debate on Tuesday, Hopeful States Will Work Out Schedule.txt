    Atlanta, GA - Newt 2012 spokesman R.C. Hammond released the following statement today regarding the Nevada caucus and New Hampshire primary:
"Newt will debate in Nevada on Tuesday and is hopeful a boycott will be unnecessary because states will work out a schedule. With five Tuesdays on the calendar in January, it is still very possible for Nevada and New Hampshire to work out an agreement that allows each of the five early states to hold a January contest. Holding the first five contests in January 2012 is fair to every candidate in the race and would protect each state's important role in the nominating process."
