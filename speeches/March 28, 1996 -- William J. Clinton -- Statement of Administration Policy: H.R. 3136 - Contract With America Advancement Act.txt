    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICYThis Statement Has Been Coordinated by OMB with the Appropriate Agencies
(House)(Archer (R) TX)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 3136, and urges the Congress to send it to the President immediately to prevent a default by the United States on its financial obligations.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
Some of the bill's non-debt limit provisions would affect direct spending; therefore, H.R. 3136 is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.
OMB's estimate of the bill's pay-as-vou-go effect is under development.
