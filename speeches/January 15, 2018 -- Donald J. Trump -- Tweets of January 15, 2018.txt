Statement by me last night in Florida: 'Honestly I don't think the Democrats want to make a deal. They talk about DACA but they don't want to help..We are ready willing and able to make a deal but they don't want to. They don't want security at the border they don't want.....Retweets: 22262Favorites: 94720

Senator Dicky Durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting. Deals can't get made when there is no trust! Durbin blew DACA and is hurting our Military.Retweets: 30428Favorites: 118168
