    This is Bidenomics in action: Our economy added more than 200,000 jobs last month, for a total of 13.2 million jobs since I took office. That's more jobs added in 2Â½ years than any President has ever created in a 4-year term. The unemployment rate has now remained below 4 percent for 17 months in a row, the longest stretch since the 1960s. The share of working-age Americans who have jobs is at the highest level in over 20 years. Inflation has come down by more than half. We are seeing stable and steady growth. That's Bidenomics: growing the economy by creating jobs, lowering costs for hard-working families, and making smart investments in America.
