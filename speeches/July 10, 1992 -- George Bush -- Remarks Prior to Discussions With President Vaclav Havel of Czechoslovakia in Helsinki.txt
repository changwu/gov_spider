    President Havel, I want to express my great admiration and respect for your courage and leadership. As negotiations move forward on the future of the federal state, I want to assure you that we respect the rights of the people of the two Republics to decide their future. We think it important that the process take place in accordance with democratic, constitutional procedures and in a civil way so that good relations are maintained among all the peoples of the region.
