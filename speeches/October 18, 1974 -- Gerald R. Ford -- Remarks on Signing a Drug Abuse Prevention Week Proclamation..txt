    I AM ABOUT to sign the Drug Abuse Prevention Week proclamation [4328], and I will sign it in the presence of these three very important members of the team that gives leadership to our effort in trying to handle the entry of drugs from outside of the country, the handling of those who abuse our laws as far as drugs are concerned, and the problem of trying to, through research, find answers to the drug problem in advance.
So, on this occasion, it is a privilege for me to sign this proclamation, which I hope will have an impact on our very sizable effort of about $750 million a year in meeting the challenge of the drug problem in the United States.
Thank you very much, gentlemen.
