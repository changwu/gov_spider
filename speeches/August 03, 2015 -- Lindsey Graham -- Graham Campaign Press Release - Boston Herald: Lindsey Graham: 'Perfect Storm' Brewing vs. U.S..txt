The United States faces the greatest risk of terrorist activity since 9/11 and national security will be a defining issue of the 2016 election, presidential hopeful Lindsey Graham told New Hampshire residents at a Town Hall-style gathering yesterday in Manchester.
The South Carolina senator — with Sen. John McCain by his side — gave a bleak assessment of the country's security status, and said the expanding reach of terrorist groups, defense cuts and the Iran nuclear deal create a recipe for domestic disaster.

"There's a feckless foreign policy that's called leading from behind," McCain said. "It's shameful."

When an audience member asked about growing cybersecurity threats, Graham referenced fellow candidate Donald Trump's decision to hand out the senator's phone number.
"I had the only cellphone in America they couldn't hack into," he said. "Donald Trump blew that."
Graham also referred to the business magnate in his opening remarks after McCain's introduction, drawing hearty applause after asking the audience, "Is John McCain a hero?"
"I think the poll is in, New Hampshire," he said.
