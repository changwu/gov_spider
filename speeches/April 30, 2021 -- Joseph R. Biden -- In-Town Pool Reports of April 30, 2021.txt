Pool Report 1/Bad weather call 
Good morning from the White House, where it's sunny but windy.
We have a bad weather call, meaning President Biden will now travel to Joint Base Andrews by motorcade, rather than in Marine One.
The press pool's gather time remains 11:40.

Pool Report 2/Still waiting
President Biden was scheduled to depart the White House at 12:05, but we are still waiting for him.
The motorcade is assembled on Pennsylvania Ave north of the White House, possibly because of the construction project on the South Lawn.
Pro-immigration reform protesters who loudly rallied this morning on H St seem to have disbanded. A pool member observed activists wearing shirts that accused Biden of not keeping his promises in his first 100 days.

Pool Report 3/Motorcade rolling
The motorcade began rolling toward Joint Base Andrews at 12:35. Our press pool van could not see President Biden emerge from the White House due to trees obstructing the view.

Pool Report 4/JBA
The motorcade passed through the gates of Joint Base Andrews at 12:53 after an uneventful ride.
President Biden walked up the steps of Air Force One at 12:59. Unlike a recent windy day, he did not fall. We could not see whether or not he spoke to the travel pool before boarding.
Press Secretary Jen Psaki will gaggle aboard Air Force One. Her remarks will be streamed live, so I won't be transcribing them for the pool. You can listen on the White House website here: https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/
