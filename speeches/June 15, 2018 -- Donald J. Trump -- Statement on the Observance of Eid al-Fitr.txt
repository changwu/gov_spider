    Melania and I wish Muslims across the United States and around the world a blessed Eid al-Fitr. Eid marks the end of a month of reflection and a return to daily life with a renewed sense of joy and love for our fellow man. It is a time to practice forgiveness and an opportunity to strengthen relationships within and among communities.
Today, as we reflect on the important place religion has in the story of America and in the lives of those who are faithful, we hope that the spirit of peace and good will that surrounds and infuses this Eid celebration continues throughout the year and around the world. We wish all Muslims a very happy Eid al-Fitr.
