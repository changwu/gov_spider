Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following statement upon the conclusion of Sunday evening's meeting between President Obama and Congressional Leadership regarding the nation's debt limit.
"I urge Speaker Boehner and Minority Leader McConnell to stand fast against attempts by President Obama and Congressional Democrats to use the debt limit vote as a vehicle to raise taxes," said Senator Santorum. "This is a real opportunity for our nation's leaders to come together, cut and cap government spending, and, most importantly, pass a Balanced Budget Amendment to our Constitution so that we never have to raise our nation's debt limit again."
