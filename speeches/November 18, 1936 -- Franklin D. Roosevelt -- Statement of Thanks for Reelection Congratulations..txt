    I desire once more to thank the American people for their messages of congratulation and good-will which I have received since Election Day.
These messages have poured in literally by the thousands-first at Hyde Park and latterly at Washington. They have long since assumed a total which has made it impossible for me to undertake personal acknowledgment, and their mounting number makes individual answer a physical impossibility. However, I do want to assure one and all of my heartfelt appreciation of the generous impulse which moved so many of my fellow citizens to send these messages.
