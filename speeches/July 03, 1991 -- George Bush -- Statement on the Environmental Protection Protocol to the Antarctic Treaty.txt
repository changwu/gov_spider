    Today, I am pleased to announce that the United States will sign an environmental protection protocol to the Antarctic treaty. The protection of the Antarctic environment is an important international responsibility, and I believe the environmental protection measures included in this protocol will ensure the protection of this natural resource for generations.
The new environmental measures will protect native species of Antarctic flora and fauna and will place needed limits on tourism, waste disposal, and marine pollution. I strongly support these measures which are based on a U.S. initiative.
I also support the restrictions on mineral activity in the Antarctic, as provided for in this protocol. The alternative to our proposal offered in Madrid for lifting or amending the ban addresses our concerns and provides effective protection for Antarctica without foreclosing the options of future generations.
