    On Monday, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary-designate Xavier Becerra, U.S. Surgeon General-designate Vivek Murthy, and COVID Coordinator Jeff Zients joined union leaders and organized labor for a virtual conversation on COVID-19 vaccinations.
Becerra, Murthy, and Zients thanked the leaders for how much the workers they represent have sacrificed during the pandemic and recognized the strain workers have faced throughout the pandemic, often having to unfairly balance the need to go to work and earn a paycheck with the risks of exposure to the virus. They emphasized the urgent need to get frontline workers the protection they need, including vaccinations, testing and PPE, and committed to an ongoing partnership between organized labor and the Biden-Harris Administration to help get working people the care they need. Becerra, Murthy, and Zients also thanked the leaders for being trusted voices advocating for vaccine utilization among their membership, and asked them to continue partnering with the administration to help get workers across the country vaccinated, as well as ensuring they have access to clear, consistent guidance based on science and facts.
The labor leaders thanked Becerra, Murthy, and Zients for their commitment to putting working people front-and-center in our federal COVID-19 response and to improving coordination and communication on how to protect frontline workers. They also expressed their desire for the Biden-Harris Administration to establish and enforce safety standards in workplaces, which Becerra, Zients, and Murthy agreed is a priority.
