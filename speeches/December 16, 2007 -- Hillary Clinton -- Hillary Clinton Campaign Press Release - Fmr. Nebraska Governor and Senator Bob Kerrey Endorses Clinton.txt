    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of former Nebraska Governor and Senator Bob Kerrey.
"At a time when our nation faces serious challenges, it will take a leader with Hillary Clinton's strength and experience to bring the real change we need," Kerrey said. "Hillary is tested and uniquely capable of restoring America's standing in the world."
Kerrey has been president of The New School in New York since 2001, overseeing unprecedented growth in undergraduate enrollment and curriculum offerings while remaining active in national affairs. He served on the 9/11 Commission that analyzed the U.S. response to the terrorist attacks and is co-chair of the National Commission for Quality Long-Term Care.
Prior to his current position, Kerrey represented Nebraska in the U.S. Senate from 1989 to 2001, and as Governor from 1983 to 1987.
Kerrey served as a Navy SEAL in Vietnam and was wounded in the line of duty, earning the Medal of Honor for his bravery and leadership.
"Bob is a leading voice on the most critical issues facing our nation, from education to national security to health care," Clinton said. "I am deeply honored to have his support and counsel as we take our message of change across America."
