    I congratulate the House of Representatives for passing the fair housing amendment of 1980 by a vote of 310-96. This is the most important civil rights bill to be considered by the Congress in more than a decade.
I would like to thank Representatives Donald Edwards, Robert Drinan, Peter Rodino, Thomas Railsback, and Hamilton Fish for their work on behalf of this measure. I particularly appreciate the efforts of Congressman Mike Synar, whose compromise amendment led to today's victory.
This bill provides the enforcement powers that the Nation's Fair Housing Act needs, and I hope the Senate will quickly approve it.
