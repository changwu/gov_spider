    Senator John F. Kennedy issued the following statement today on learning that Maryland's Governor, comptroller, and attorney general will stump the State in behalf of the Democratic ticket:
I am delighted to hear that Governor Tawes, Comptroller Goldstein, and Attorney General Sybert are going to campaign throughout the State of Maryland in behalf of myself and Senator Johnson and in behalf of the seven incumbent Democratic Congressmen from Maryland.
It is a tremendous contribution to the campaign to have the Governor and his top elected officials make these appearances in every county in Maryland.
Maryland's nine electoral votes are as critical as any in this election, and this energetic effort by Governor Tawes gives me great confidence that the Democratic ticket will carry Maryland in November.
I wish the Democratic caravan the best of luck and success on their journeys through the State, and send my best wishes and congratulations to all those aboard.
