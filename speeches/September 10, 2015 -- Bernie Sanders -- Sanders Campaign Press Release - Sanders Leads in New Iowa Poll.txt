    DES MOINES, Iowa â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders is the choice of 41 percent of likely Iowa Democratic Party caucus participants. Forty percent favor former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and 12 percent back Vice President Joseph Biden, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday.
"The more people in Iowa get to know about Bernie the more they like him and what he stands for. His ideas for rebuilding the American middle class and taking on the billionaire class are resonating here in Iowa and across the country," said Stephanie Schwinn, Bremer County Democratic Chair.
Sanders gained support since the last time Quinnipiac polled in Iowa. A survey released on July 2 had Clinton at 52 percent, Sanders with 33 percent and 7 percent for Biden.
