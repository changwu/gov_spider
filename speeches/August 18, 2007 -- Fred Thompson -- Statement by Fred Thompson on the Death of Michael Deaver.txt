    McLean, Va. - Former Senator Fred Thompson issued the following statement on the death of Michael Deaver this afternoon:
"It is often said that Michael Deaver was the 'director' of the Ronald Reagan presidency. And while his unparalleled gift for creating the powerful and poignant visual images of the Reagan era is a part of our history, it was his belief in the greatness and goodness of America that defined him.
Most of all, Mike Deaver was one of the kindest, most soft spoken, humble and cheerful men you could ever hope to meet. He was an American original and a gentleman in every sense of the word.
Jeri and I are deeply saddened by his passing, and we extend our sympathies to his family."
