    I bring the prayers and concerns of the people of this country to this town of Greensburg, Kansas. A lot of us have seen the pictures about what happened here, and the pictures don't do it justice. There is a lot of destruction. Fortunately, a lot of folks have basements here in this part of the world and lived to see another day. Unfortunately, too many died, and we offer our prayers and condolences to those who died.
I am struck by the strength of the character of the people who live here in the Plains—people who refuse to be—who refuse to have their spirit affected by this storm, as a matter of fact, who are willing to do what it takes to rebuild in a better way. America is blessed to have such people. And the people here will be—will find they're blessed to have neighbors who care, a total stranger who will come and help them.
Our role as government officials is to work with the State and local folks to get whatever help is appropriate here, whatever help is in the law to be here as quickly as possible. My mission is to—today, though, is to lift people's spirits as best as I possibly can; is to, hopefully, touch somebody's soul by representing our country and to let people know that while there was a dark day in the past, there's brighter days ahead.
And so I want to thank the Governor and I want to thank the Senators for being here. Most importantly, I want to thank the people of Greensburg and their neighbors for helping them out. God bless the people here. Thank you.
