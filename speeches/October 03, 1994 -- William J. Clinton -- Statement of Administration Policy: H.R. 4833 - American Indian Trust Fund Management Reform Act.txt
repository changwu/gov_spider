    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Richardson (D) NM and Faleomavaega (D) AS)
The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4833.
H.R. 4833 would, in part, establish within the Department of the Interior an Office of Special Trustee for American Indians. The Special Trustee would be a Senate-confirmed, presidential appointee. The Special Trustee would be required, within one year after appointment, to develop and submit to Congress a comprehensive strategic plan for the improvement of Indian trust fund management.
The Secretary of the Interior has assembled within the Department a team of high-level officials that has devoted a significant effort to developing a plan to address the scope of the trust fund problems and ways of resolving those problems. Thus, the Administration sees no need to create within the Department a Special Trustee.
The creation of this position wrongfully implies that the trust responsibility for these funds will rest in the Trustee rather than officials responsible to the Secretary of the Interior. In addition, improving trust fund management needs to begin now. It should not be delayed until the completion of yet another plan developed by an official who would have to be confirmed by the Senate.
