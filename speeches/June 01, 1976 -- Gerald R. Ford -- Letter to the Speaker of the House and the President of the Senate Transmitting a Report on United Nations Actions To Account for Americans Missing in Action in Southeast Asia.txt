    IN ACCORDANCE with Section 503 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1976, I am transmitting to you a report on "Actions Taken by the United Nations to Obtain an Accounting of Americans Missing in Action in Southeast Asia." To fulfill the requirements of this section the United States Mission to the United Nations conferred with the Secretary General and his staff on the question of what action has been taken concerning the missing in action. The information on which the enclosed report is based was obtained as a result of their joint staff effort.
