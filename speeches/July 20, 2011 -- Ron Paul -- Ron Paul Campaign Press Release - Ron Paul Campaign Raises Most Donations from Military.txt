LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” Today, it was confirmed that the campaign of 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul has raised more than any other current presidential candidate in donations from members of the military. Of those donors who indicated their occupation and employer, Paul topped the other contenders, a distinction he also achieved during his 2008 presidential run.
"Our fighting men and women take an oath to protect America, defend our Constitution and defend our borders," said Ron Paul 2012 Campaign Chairman, Jesse Benton. "They look at Ron Paul and see a leader who takes their oath seriously, and who will fight to ensure that we don't misrepresent that oath by sending them off to police the world, instead of defending our country."
