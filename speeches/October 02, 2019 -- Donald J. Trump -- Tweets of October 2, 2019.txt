I won the right to be a presidential candidate in California in a major Court decision handed down yesterday. It was filed against me by the Radical Left Governor of that State to tremendous Media hoopla. The VICTORY however was barely covered by the Fake News. No surprise!Retweets: 29163Favorites: 111996

Massive sections of The Wall are being built at our Southern Border. It is going up rapidly and built to the highest standards and specifications of the Border Patrol experts. It is actually an amazing structure! Our U.S. Military is doing a GREAT job.Retweets: 20816Favorites: 91835

Congressman Adam Schiff should resign for the Crime of after reading a transcript of my conversation with the President of Ukraine (it was perfect) fraudulently fabricating a statement of the President of the United States and reading it to Congress as though mine! He is sick!Retweets: 31106Favorites: 124808

All the Do Nothing Democrats are focused on is Impeaching the President for having a very good conversation with the Ukrainian President. I knew that many people were listening even have a transcript. They have been at this 'stuff' from the day I got elected. Bad for Country!Retweets: 19239Favorites: 80931

Now the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a Moot stuffed with alligators and snakes with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top at our Southern Border. I may be tough on Border Security but not that tough. The press has gone Crazy. Fake News!Retweets: 3830Favorites: 13831

All of this impeachment nonsense which is going nowhere is driving the Stock Market and your 401K's down. But that is exactly what the Democrats want to do. They are willing to hurt the Country with only the 2020 Election in mind!Retweets: 27300Favorites: 94215

Nancy Pelosi just said that she is interested in lowering prescription drug prices & working on the desperately needed USMCA. She is incapable of working on either. It is just camouflage for trying to win an election through impeachment. The Do Nothing Democrats are stuck in mud!Retweets: 22730Favorites: 81572

Adam Schiff should only be so lucky to have the brains honor and strength of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. For a lowlife like Schiff who completely fabricated my words and read them to Congress as though they were said by me to demean a First in Class at West Point is SAD!Retweets: 27153Favorites: 100327

The Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country not wasting everyone's time and energy on BULLSHIT which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016 223-306. Get a better candidate this time you'll need it!Retweets: 46798Favorites: 172404
