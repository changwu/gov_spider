Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) announced today the endorsement of Ben Lange, former conservative Republican congressional candidate from Iowa's 1st Congressional District.
Lange gained national attention in 2010 by winning a four-way Republican primary in IA-1 by 30 points, the largest margin of victory in modern times. Lange nearly pulled off one of the biggest political upsets of the 2010 midterms, falling a mere 4,200 votes short against Rep. Bruce Braley (D-IA) in a heavily Democratic district and without national Republican assistance. A lifelong Iowan, Lange was the first member of his family to graduate college and now owns his own legal practice in Iowa.
"Conservatives are hungry for a candidate with the ability to articulate conservative principles, apply those principles to the serious economic problems we now face, and ultimately lead a national conservative movement," said Ben Lange. "Senator Santorum has proven he can lead on the national stage, having fought for and won key battles for the conservative movement. As my fellow Iowans learn more about Sen. Santorum and all that he has achieved, I believe they will find the candidate they have been looking for. I look forward to working with the Senator and his campaign to win the Iowa Caucuses."
"I had the great opportunity to campaign for Ben and get to know him and his wonderful family last fall. The Lange Family epitomizes Iowa's principles of hard work and traditional family values. I am honored to have the support of this rising conservative star," said Senator Santorum.
