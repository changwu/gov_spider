    I am shocked and deeply saddened to learn of the death of Prime Minister Ohira. He was a great leader of his people, a good friend of the United States, and a friend I valued. I consider his death a great loss for Japan and for the world.
During the last year, Prime Minister Ohira and I met at bilateral summits here in Washington and in Tokyo, as well as at the Tokyo economic summit. He was one of the warmest people I have known, and I came to trust fully' in his judgment and counsel.
The close friendship and alliance between the United States and Japan to which he contributed so much will, of course, continue as before. But we will all miss a cherished friend and partner.
On behalf of the American people, and for ourselves, Rosalynn and I extend our deepest condolences to Mrs. Ohira and her family, and to the people of Japan.
