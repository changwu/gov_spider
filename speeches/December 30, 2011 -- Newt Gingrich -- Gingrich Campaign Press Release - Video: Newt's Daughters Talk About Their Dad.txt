    Kathy Gingrich Lubbers and Jackie Gingrich Cushman talk about their father, Newt Gingrich - what he taught them as a father and what kind a great president he would make for the country. Here's an overview of the video from ABC News:
"What I love most about my father," says Kathy "is that he is a lifelong learner, he's courageous, he's wise, he's fun."
Not missing a beat Jackie says "What I love most is that he's really fun, he's really smart, he has great experience, and he loves being with his family."
Kathy mentions at one point that their father wanted to be a zookeeper and had even donated animals to the Atlanta zoo. This prompts Jackie to talk about how her dad risked his life to save his dog when he was a teenager.
"When he was in high school he had a dog named Pride. Dad and Pride were out walking one day – it was winter and the pond was frozen – Pride got out on the pond and fell through the ice into the water." Newt tries to pull Pride out of the pond but ends up in the water himself. They both make it out of the water and Jackie says that this shows what an "incredible person" her father is. "It's a window into his heart. It shows you that a man who would risk his life to save his dog is an incredible person."
Jackie says her father has become a "more faithful person" touching on a thorny subject for the Gingrich campaign. "He talks very openly about having made some mistakes. Having sinned. Having asked for god forgiveness … I've watched him grow into a more faithful person."
