  A Proclamation

Whereas, satisfactory proof has been given to me by the Government of the Republic of Panama that no discriminating duties of tonnage or imposts are imposed or levied in the ports of that Republic upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States or upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in such vessels from the United States, or from any foreign country;
Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section four thousand two hundred and twenty-eight of the Revised Statutes of the United States, do hereby declare and proclaim that, the foreign discriminating duties of tonnage and imposts within the United States are suspended and discontinued so far as respects the vessels of the Republic of Panama, and the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported into the United States from the Republic of Panama, or from any other foreign country; the suspension to take effect on and after the date of this proclamation and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to citizens of the United States, and their cargoes, shall be continued, and no longer.
In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done at the city of Washington, the 15th day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and five, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and twenty-ninth.

THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
By the President:
FRANCIS B. LOOMIS,
Acting Secretary of State.
