(House Rules)
(Rep. Hensarling, R-TX, and 2 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 836, which would eliminate the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Emergency Homeowners Loan Program (EHLP). The Administration is committed to helping struggling American homeowners stay in their homes, and has taken many steps over the last two years to stabilize what was a rapidly-declining housing market. Over the next 30 months, the EHLP would provide loan assistance to as many as 30,000 distressed American homeowners at risk of foreclosure due to involuntary unemployment, underemployment, or a medical condition. The Administration believes that the EHLP is an important tool in helping these Americans struggling to stay in their homes.
If the President is presented with H.R. 836, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.
