    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic, signed at Buenos Aires on June 10, 1997.
In addition, I transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. As the report states, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.
The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content of extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.
Upon entry into force, this Treaty would enhance cooperation between the law enforcement authorities of both countries, and thereby make a significant contribution to international law enforcement efforts. The Treaty would supersede the Extradition Treaty Between the United States of America and the Republic of Argentina signed at Washington on January 21, 1972.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
