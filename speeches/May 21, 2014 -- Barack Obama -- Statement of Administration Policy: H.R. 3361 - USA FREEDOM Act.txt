(House)
(Rep. Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, and 152 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3361, the USA FREEDOM Act. The President called on Congress to enact important changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The Administration applauds and appreciates the strong bipartisan effort that led to the formulation of this bill, which heeds the President's call on this important issue.
The bill ensures our intelligence and law enforcement professionals have the authorities they need to protect the Nation, while further ensuring that individuals' privacy is appropriately protected when these authorities are employed. Among other provisions, the bill prohibits bulk collection through the use of Section 215, FISA pen registers, and National Security Letters. The President has called for a transition to end bulk collection under Section 215, and the Administration strongly supports this prohibition. Overall, the bill's significant reforms would provide the public greater confidence in our programs and the checks and balances in the system. The Administration supports swift House passage of the USA FREEDOM Act, and urges the Senate to follow suit.
