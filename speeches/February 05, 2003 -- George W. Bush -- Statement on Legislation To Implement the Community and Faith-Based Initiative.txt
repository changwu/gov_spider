    I applaud the Senate Finance Committee, under the leadership of Senators Grassley and Baucus, for moving quickly on a key component of bipartisan faith-based legislation sponsored by Senators Santorum and Lieberman. Today's action brings us one step closer to creating incentives for Americans to donate more to charities, many of which are facing tough financial times. We must also work to level the playing field for community and faith-based organizations that provide effective social services to our fellow citizens who are in need. I look forward to working closely with the Senate and House to improve the legislation to get a strong, bipartisan faith-based bill on my desk as soon as possible. Together, we can help encourage acts of compassion that can transform our Nation, one heart and one soul at a time.
