    Hillary and I were shocked and heartbroken to learn of the tragic shooting earlier today at the University of Arkansas on the first day of fall classes. While our understanding of the facts in this case is still developing, we know that two more lives were taken on a day that should have been filled with hope and promise for students and faculty. Federal law enforcement officials are assisting local authorities with the investigation.
Today's shooting strikes a particularly sad chord for Hillary and me, who both had the privilege of teaching at this wonderful institution. We send our heartfelt thoughts and prayers along with those of the American public to the families, the university, and the entire Fayetteville community as they work through this difficult time.
