Starting Monday our great Farmers can begin doing business again with Mexico and Canada. They have both taken the tariff penalties off of your great agricultural product. Please be sure that you are treated fairly. Any complaints should immediately go to @SecretarySonny Perdue!Retweets: 18326Favorites: 69287

The Failing New York Times (it will pass away when I leave office in 6 years) and others of the Fake News Media keep writing phony stories about how I didn't use many banks because they didn't want to do business with me. WRONG! It is because I didn't need money. Very oldRetweets: 20578Favorites: 101881

....fashioned but true. When you don't need or want money you don't need or want banks. Banks have always been available to me they want to make money. Fake Media only says this to disparage and always uses unnamed sources (because their sources don't even exist)......Retweets: 5585Favorites: 21903

The Mainstream Media has never been as corrupt and deranged as it is today. FAKE NEWS is actually the biggest story of all and is the true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE! That's why they refuse to cover the REAL Russia Hoax. But the American people are wise to what is going on.....Retweets: 8072Favorites: 26490

....Now the new big story is that Trump made a lot of money and buys everything for cash he doesn't need banks. But where did he get all of that cash? Could it be Russia? No I built a great business and don't need banks but if I did they would be there...and DeutscheBank......Retweets: 13959Favorites: 72571

.....was very good and highly professional to deal with - and if for any reason I didn't like them I would have gone elsewhere....there was always plenty of money around and banks to choose from. They would be very happy to take my money. Fake News!Retweets: 14015Favorites: 73999

Why are the Democrats not looking into all of the crimes committed by Crooked Hillary and the phony Russia Investigation? They would get back their credibility. Jerry Nadler Schiff would have a whole new future open to them. Perhaps they could even run for President!Retweets: 19822Favorites: 80370

On this Cuban Independence Day we stand by the people of Cuba in their quest for freedom democracy and prosperity. The Cuban regime must end its repression of Cubans & Venezuelans. The United States will not stand idly by as Cuba continues to subvert democracy in the Americas!Retweets: 16262Favorites: 65758

The Fake News put out a typically false statement without any knowledge that the United States was trying to set up a negotiation with Iran. This is a false report....Retweets: 18784Favorites: 80355
