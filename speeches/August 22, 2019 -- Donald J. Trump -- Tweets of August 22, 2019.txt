It was my honor to sign a Presidential Memorandum facilitating the cancellation of student loan debt for 25K of our most severely disabled Veterans. With today's order we express the everlasting love & loyalty of a truly grateful Nation. God bless our Vets & God Bless America! https://t.co/MMMsX3RDQMRetweets: 29884Favorites: 123170

Germany sells 30 year bonds offering negative yields. Germany competes with the USA. Our Federal Reserve does not allow us to do what we must do. They put us at a disadvantage against our competition. Strong Dollar No Inflation! They move like quicksand. Fight or go home!Retweets: 18051Favorites: 71933

The Economy is doing really well. The Federal Reserve can easily make it Record Setting! The question is being asked why are we paying much more in interest than Germany and certain other countries? Be early (for a change) not late. Let America win big rather than just win!Retweets: 19402Favorites: 78681
