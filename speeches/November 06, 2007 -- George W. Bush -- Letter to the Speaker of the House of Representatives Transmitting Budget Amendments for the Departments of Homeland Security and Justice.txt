    Dear Madam Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed amendments to my FY 2008 requests for the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice. These amendments, when combined with funding enacted earlier this year for the FBI (Public Law 110- 28), would provide $436 million to take important steps to enhance ongoing efforts for protecting the homeland. The amendments will enhance the security of the Government's civilian cyber networks and will further address emerging threats.
Overall, the discretionary budget authority proposed in my FY 2008 Budget would not be increased. The details of these amendments proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
