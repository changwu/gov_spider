    Today former Mississippi GOP Chairman and National Committeeman Clarke Reed announced his support for Gov. John Kasich's presidential campaign and joined Kasich for America's Mississippi leadership team.
Said Reed, "Now more than ever, America needs a leader who can bring people together around a conservative, results-oriented vision for the nation. There is no doubt in my mind that John Kasich is the best candidate for the job. He has a proven record of balancing budgets, enabling job creation and promoting a strong national defense. I'm proud to stand beside him as he brings his message to the people of Mississippi."

Reed, a resident of Greenville, Mississippi is one of the state's best-known political advisors. He served as Chair of the Mississippi Republican Party for ten years during a formative period in the state party's history.
Said Kasich, "Clarke Reed has deservedly earned a reputation as one of the Mississippi Republican Party's leading lights. He knows Mississippi voters better than just about anyone, and I'm grateful and honored to welcome him aboard."
