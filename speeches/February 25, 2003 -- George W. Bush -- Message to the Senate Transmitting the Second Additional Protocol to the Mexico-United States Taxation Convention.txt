    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification, the Second Additional Protocol that Modifies the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Mexican States for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, signed at Mexico City on November 26, 2002. I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State concerning the proposed Protocol.
The Convention, as amended by the proposed Protocol, would be similar to tax treaties between the United States and other developed nations. It would provide maximum rates of tax to be applied to various types of income and protection from double taxation of income. The Protocol was concluded in recognition of the importance of the United States economic relations with Mexico.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this Protocol, and that the Senate give its advice and consent to ratification.
