    On October 20, we commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Allied landing on Leyte Island's shores, a pivotal moment in the history of the War in the Pacific and in the human struggle for liberty. The Leyte landing is a central event in the long history of friendship between the peoples of the Philippines and the United States.
This year we are privileged that American, Filipino, and Australian veterans once again stand on the very beach where they fought for the liberation of the Philippines six decades ago. Many of those brave Allied soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice on these shores in the cause of freedom. Mac-Arthur, Osmena, Romulo, and all those heroes commemorated in bronze on Leyte's shores were tenacious and brave.
Veterans of the Leyte landing: Know that we will continue to recognize this date as a day to draw renewed inspiration from your courage and sacrifice in the cause of freedom. We will pass on to our children what your great generation has passed to us, a world where liberty is the right of all humankind, and where men and women will remain vigilant in its defense.
