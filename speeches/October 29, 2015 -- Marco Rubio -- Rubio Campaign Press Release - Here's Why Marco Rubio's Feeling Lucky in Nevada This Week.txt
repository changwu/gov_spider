Presidential candidate Marco Rubio is the latest to file for Nevada's Republican caucus.
Rubio campaign officials said they submitted the required $12,500 fee to the Nevada Republican Party on Tuesday.
The Florida senator's Nevada campaign chair, Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison, pointed to Rubio's years living in Las Vegas and said Rubio understands the challenges facing Nevadans. He said he looked forward to Rubio winning in the Nevada caucus in February.
Other Republican candidates who have filed for the Nevada caucus include Jeb Bush, John Kasich, Chris Christie, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
