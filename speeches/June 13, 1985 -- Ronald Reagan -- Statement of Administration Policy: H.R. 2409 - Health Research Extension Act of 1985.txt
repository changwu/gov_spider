    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Waxman (D) California and Madigan (R) Illinois)
The Administration strongly urges that H.R. 2409 be removed from the Suspension Calendar so that it can be amended to:
— delete the numerous mandates and detailed requirements in the bill (i.e., creating advisory boards, commissions, and panels, and requiring new research programs), which would severely limit NIH's flexibility to make decisions based on research priorities and scientific merit,
— delete the creation of unnecessary, expensive new institutes, such as for nursing, and
— reduce the bill's excessive authorization levels, which are $282 million or 13 percent over the House-passed budget resolution.
If H.R. 2409 were to reach the President's desk in its present form, disapproval would be recommended.
