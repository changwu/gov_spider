    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I have today, pursuant to section 673b(i) of title 10, United States Code, authorized the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service within the Department of the Navy, to extend for an additional 90 days the period of active duty of units and individual members not assigned to units organized to serve as units of the Selected Reserve ordered to active duty pursuant to section 673b(a) of title 10, United States Code and Executive Order No. 12727 of August 22, 1990. The continued need for units and members of the Selected Reserve to augment the active Armed Forces of the United States for the effective support and conduct of operational missions in and around the Arabian Peninsula necessitates this action.
A copy of the Executive order implementing this action is attached.
Sincerely,
George Bush
