    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Morella (R) Maryland and Brown (D) California)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 209, which will significantly facilitate the licensing of Government-owned inventions by Federal agencies.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 209 would affect receipts and direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary PAYGO estimate is being developed.
