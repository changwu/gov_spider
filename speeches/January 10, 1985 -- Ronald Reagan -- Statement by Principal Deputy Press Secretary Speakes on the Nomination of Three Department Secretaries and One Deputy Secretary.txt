    The President is today announcing his intention to nominate four distinguished members of the administration to new positions. The nominations are Donald P. Hodel to be Secretary of the Interior, John S. Herrington to be Secretary of Energy, William J. Bennett to be Secretary of Education, and Richard G. Darman to be Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. The nominations will be transmitted to the Senate at an early date.
The President believes these nominees will provide exceptionally strong leadership in the second term of his administration. They are men of proven ability who have served in key positions within the Government. They will make a strong team even stronger.
In conjunction with these nominations, the President has directed Mr. Hodel and Mr. Herrington, once confirmed, to commence a study of their respective departments and to propose reorganizational options to the President. These options should be designed to recognize the interrelationship of energy, natural resource, and defense policies. The President is committed to maximizing effective management and efficiency in the natural resource area.
The President has also directed Mr. Bennett, following confirmation, to conduct a study of the Education Department's functions to determine the proper organizational structure and role of the Federal Government in education.
