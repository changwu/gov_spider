    Thank you very, very much, Mr. Mayor and all of the wonderful people of Boynton Beach. Can I come back again?
It is just delightful to be here in this good weather but, more importantly, with all you good people, that is the best part of it. Thank you very, very much.
Now let me make one or two comments. The mere fact that all of you are here shows your chief interest and concern in what is good for America, and I thank you and congratulate you. What you should do is take that same enthusiasm and make certain that it is used to make a better America here at home and a Stronger America abroad.
We are all proud of what has been done by America. We have had our troubles the last 19 months since I have been President. We had inflation that was too high, unemployment that was too high, difficulties of one kind or another here at home. But, believe me, all the news is good, and it is going to get better.
And let me say that as I travel--not only here but abroad--I find that people respect America because we are free, because we are strong, because we are humane, because we are going to do things to help people have the same blessings, the same opportunities that we have.
We must stop aggression, we must be strong to make people respect us, our friends as well as our adversaries. I can assure you that this country is going to be strong at home and strong abroad for all of our betterment.
Now let me thank you for your coming out and wishing me well. May I ask a favor of you? I need your help March 9, and I hope and trust that what I have tried to do for the benefit of our country and 215 million Americans justifies your faith and your support. I would appreciate it very much. I can promise you that we will work at the job, and we will make a better and better America in the days ahead, with your support.
Thank you very, very much.
