    Dear Madam Attorney General:
A dispute recently has arisen over the scope of the current federal child pornography law. This dispute impelled the Senate to adopt a "sense of the Senate" resolution expressing its view that the law reaches broadly. I fully agree with the Senate about what the proper scope of the child pornography law should be.
I find all forms of child pornography offensive and harmful, as I know you do, and I want the federal government to lead aggressively in the attack against the scourge of child pornography. It represents an unacceptable exploitation of children and contributes to the degradation of our national life and to a societal climate that appears to condone child abuse.
This Administration supports the broadest possible protections against child pornography and exploitation. I understand that the Justice Department recently filed a brief in which the Department concluded that the current child pornography law is not as broad as it could be. Accordingly, the Justice Department should promptly prepare and submit any necessary legislation to ensure that federal law reaches all forms of child pornography, including the kinds of child pornography at issue in the Senate resolution.
Sincerely,
BILL CLINTON
