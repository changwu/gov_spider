    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Horn (R) CA and 5 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 930, which includes many desirable improvements in travel policy for Federal employees.
The Administration has concerns, however, with Section 2 as amended by the proposed manager's amendment. This section would unnecessarily remove the General Services Administration's discretion regarding the use of government travel cards by Federal agencies. The Administration will work with Congress to ensure that the legislation includes an appropriate level of flexibility for Federal agencies.
