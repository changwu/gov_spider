    Throughout a remarkable 39-year military career, General Shalikashvili has worked tirelessly to improve our Nation's security and promote world peace. A steward of freedom, his landmark endeavors include Joint Vision 2010; initiation of NATO's Partnership for Peace; NATO enlargementâ€”which includes his native Poland; ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention; and successful military operations in Bosnia, Haiti, and elsewhere in the world. A strong and thoughtful leader, his sound judgment and strategic vision have been instrumental in preparing our Armed Forces for the challenges of today and the 21st century. For a lifetime of dedicated service, our Nation gratefully honors General John Shalikashvili.
