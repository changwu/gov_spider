    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(McCollum (R) Florida and 16 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 46, which authorizes the President to award a Medal of Valor to a public safety officer for extraordinary valor above and beyond the call of duty. The Administration will work with the Senate to amend the provision requiring the Department of Justice to establish a new office to assist the Medal of Valor Review Board. The duties of the proposed new office can be accomplished by existing Justice Department offices.
