    I am pleased to announce the appointment of former U.S. Representative Dr. Howard Wolpe as Special Envoy of the President and Secretary of State for Burundi Peace Negotiations. He will work closely with Ambassador Richard Bogosian who continues to serve as the Rwanda/Burundi Special Coordinator working from Washington to coordinate implementation of overall policy toward these two countries.
Dr. Wolpe will lend U.S. influence and support to efforts aimed at bringing an end to the crisis in Burundi, which has claimed more than 100,000 lives in the last 2 1/2 years. Dr. Wolpe brings to this mission a wealth of experience gained during 14 years as a Member of Congress from Michigan, including 10 years as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, and recently as a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. Dr. Wolpe received his Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in political science, focusing on Africa.
