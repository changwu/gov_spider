    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Atkins (D) MA)
While the administration supports the extension of the Lowell Commission for seven years, the administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2035, solely because the bill's increased appropriations authorizations for land acquisition and development at Lowell National Historical Park, totalling $13.4 million, are relatively low priority items that cannot be justified in today's budgetary climate. Over $38 million of Federal funds have already been appropriated for land acquisition and development at the park. Remaining projects should be completed with State, local, or private funds.
