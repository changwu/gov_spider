Federal funding is available to the State and eligible local governments in the counties of Beckham, Blaine, Caddo, Canadian, Custer, Kingfisher, Kiowa, Logan, Noble, Osage, Pawnee, Payne, Roger Mills and Washita on a cost-sharing basis for the repair or replacement of public facilities damaged by the severe ice storm.
