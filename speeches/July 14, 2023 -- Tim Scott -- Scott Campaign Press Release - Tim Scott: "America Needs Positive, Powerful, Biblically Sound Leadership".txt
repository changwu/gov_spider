Tim Scott: The issues that I strongly support is, I believe America can do for anyone what she has done for me. We are living in a time where there is this pervasive force, the radical Left, parts of corporate America, that continue to force this culture of grievance on the American people. And along with the culture of grievance comes this drug of victimhood, the narcotic of despair. Folks actually have figured out that you can make a profit off of conflict. I want to stand in the gap and say the truth of my life disproves the lies of the radical forces that believe that we should be in constant conflict with each other.
America needs positive, powerful, biblically sound leadership to regain the high ground.
