Every year, his organization puts on CES, where the coolest products in tech are introduced:
 

So he's probably a good guy to listen to about who understands how the American economy is changing.
And guess what? Gary thinks the best candidate in the Presidential field is . . . Marco. Here's what he had to say:
For me, Sen. Rubio is the "Uber candidate." Not only has his determination and passion for conservative principles led him to be a popular and effective senator and trending presidential candidate, but he is also the only Republican candidate on the stage who fully realizes our economy is always evolving and creating new opportunities.
For Sen. Rubio, supporting disruptive innovators like Uber, Lyft and AirBnB is a win-win — these services create new jobs, allow average Americans to make money and lift our economy. Each year, more than 150,000 people come to Las Vegas for CES, to see the new job-creating innovations. Our trade show and our industry, indeed our nation's future, depend upon a free market welcoming innovation and allowing anyone a shot at the American Dream. Marco Rubio champions innovation and the American Dream.

More than any other candidate — Republican or Democrat — Marco has laid out a clear vision for unleashing American economic growth in the 21st century.
