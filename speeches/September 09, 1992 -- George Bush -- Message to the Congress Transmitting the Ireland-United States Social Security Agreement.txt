    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act, as amended by the Social Security Amendments of 1977 (Public Law 95 - 216, 42 U.S.C. 433(e)(1)), I transmit herewith the Agreement between the United States of America and Ireland on Social Security, which consists of two separate instruments: a principal agreement and an administrative arrangement. The agreement was signed at Washington on April 14, 1992.
The United States-Ireland agreement contains all provisions mandated by section 233 and other provisions that I deem appropriate to carry out the provisions of section 233, pursuant to section 233(c)(4). It is similar in objective to the social security agreements already in force with Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Such bilateral agreements provide for limited coordination between the United States and foreign social security systems to eliminate dual social security coverage and taxation, and to help prevent the loss of benefit protection that can occur when workers divide their careers between two countries.
I also transmit for the information of the Congress a report prepared by the Department of Health and Human Services explaining the key points of the agreement, along with a paragraph-by-paragraph explanation of the provisions of the principal agreement and the related administrative arrangement. Annexed to this report is the report required by section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act on the effect of the agreement on income and expenditures of the U.S. Social Security program and the number of individuals affected by the agreement. The Department of Health and Human Services has recommended the agreement and related documents to me.
I commend the United States-Ireland Social Security Agreement and related documents.
George Bush
The White House,
September 9, 1992.
