    Sioux City, Iowa â€” Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann issued the following statement in light of the Supreme Court decision to hear challenges to Obamacare:
"I am pleased that the Supreme Court has elected finally to hear challenges to Obamacare, and given that the central issue to be reviewed is an unprecedented expansion of the intended purpose of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, I urge the court to strike down the law and rule it unconstitutional. Furthermore, I call on President Obama and Congress to cease enforcement of the remaining provisions of Obamacare immediately until the Supreme Court rules on its constitutionality.
"It is not the business of government, at either the state or federal level, to tell individual Americans to purchase any product or service. That's why, as president, I will not rest until the bill is completely repealed. I will replace it with a health care system that allows Americans to purchase health care individually across state lines, allows them to purchase the plan of their choice, reforms malpractice lawsuits, lowers the cost of health care for all Americans, and provides tax breaks for those who provide free health care to those who cannot afford it. We can't settle for a Republican nominee who believes that an individual health care mandate, the main issue of controversy before the court, is constitutional and either advocated for it, implemented it, or used it to justify a forced health care decision in their state."
