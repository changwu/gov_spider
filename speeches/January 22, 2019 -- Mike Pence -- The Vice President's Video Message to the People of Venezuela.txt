    Vice President Mike Pence today released a video message to the people of Venezuela as they prepare to march on January 23 in an effort to restore democracy to Venezuela.
"Hola, I'm Mike Pence, Vice President of the United States.
On behalf of President Donald Trump and all the American people, let me express the unwavering support of the United States as you, the people of Venezuela, raise your voices in a call for freedom.
Nicolas Maduro is a dictator with no legitimate claim to power. He has never won the presidency in a free and fair election, and has maintained his grip of power by imprisoning anyone who dares to oppose him.
The United States joins with all freedom-loving nations in recognizing your National Assembly as the last vestige of democracy in your country, for it is the only body elected by you, the people. As such, the United States supports the courageous decision by Juan Guaid√≥, the President of the National Assembly, to assert that body's constitutional powers, declare Maduro a usurper, and call for the establishment of a transitional government.
As you make your voices heard tomorrow, on behalf of the American people, we say to all the good people of Venezuela: estamos con ustedes.
We are with you, we stand with you, and we will stay with you until democracy is restored and you reclaim your birthright of libertad.
Muchas gracias y vayan con Dios."
