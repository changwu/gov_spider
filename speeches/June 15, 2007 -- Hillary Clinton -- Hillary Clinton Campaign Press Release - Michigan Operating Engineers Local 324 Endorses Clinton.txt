    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Michigan-based International Union of Operating Engineers Local 324.
"Hillary Clinton understands what it is like to live paycheck to paycheck," said John M. Hamilton, Business Manager of Local 324 and General Vice President and Training Fund Co-Chair of the International Union. "She understands why health care and pensions need reform. She will fight for smart trade and Michigan manufacturing."
Hamilton said Clinton's record on labor issues and her strong presentation at an AFL-CIO forum in Detroit Saturday convinced him that she is the best candidate to be President.
"She is experienced and she is strong," Hamilton said. "She is our country's best hope."
IUOE 324's more than 13,000 members work across Michigan, building and refurbishing the state's roads, water and utility infrastructure and public buildings.
"I am honored to receive the support of Operating Engineers Local 324," Clinton said. "I will be a champion for America's working families who have been invisible to this administration."
