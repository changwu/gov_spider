    One year ago today, the Supreme Court took away a constitutional right from the American people, denying women across the Nation the right to choose. Overturning Roe v. Wade, which had been the law of the land for nearly half a century, has already had devastating consequences.
States have imposed extreme and dangerous abortion bans that put the health and lives of women in jeopardy, force women to travel hundreds of miles for care, and threaten to criminalize doctors for providing the health care that their patients need and that they are trained to provide.
Yet State bans are just the beginning. Congressional Republicans want to ban abortion nationwide, but go beyond that, by taking FDA-approved medication for terminating a pregnancy off the market, and make it harder to obtain contraception. Their agenda is extreme, dangerous, and out of step with the vast majority of Americans.
My administration will continue to protect access to reproductive health care and call on Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade in Federal law once and for all.
