    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Gaydos (D) PA and 145 others)
The administration strongly opposes H.R. 162, which would unnecessarily duplicate current Federal efforts regarding the evaluation and notification of workers of hazards in the workplace. H.R. 162 is likely to result in substantial litigation and in Federal and private sector tort liability. This legislation would impose enormous costs on employers, consumers, workers, and the Federal Government. If presented to the President in its current form, the President's Senior Advisers would recommend disapproval.
However, if Congress believes legislation in this area is necessary, the administration would urge adoption of an alternative to H.R. 162, proposed by Representatives Jeffords and Henry. This alternative would further strengthen the Department of Labor's Hazard Communication Standard, which has recently been extended to cover all industries where workers are exposed to hazardous chemicals, and other Occupational Safety and Hazards Administration health standards. This approach focuses on preventing workplace exposures before they occur, and would reach many more workers than the individual notification program established by H.R. 162. The substitute also includes interim risk notification provisions for federally-studied workers and proposes the establishment of a Commission to examine the effectiveness and impact of occupational risk notification and to make recommendations as to the appropriate Federal role.
