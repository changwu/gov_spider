    I thank the voters of Maine for their support. I'm committed to turning around America. And I'm heartened to have the support of so many good people in this great state.
We stand for conservative principles, liberty and prosperity. All of these are under threat. I'm in this race because I believe that America can be turned around, that we don't have to accept unemployment over 8 percent, a national debt that is as large as our entire economy, and a President who, even as his own policies fail, apologizes for America's past successes. We've had enough. It's time to reverse Barack Obama's legacy of domestic disarray and foreign-policy weakness.
I congratulate my fellow Republicans on a campaign well fought. We may have our differences, but we're united in our determination to bring Barack Obama's reign of failure to an end. I am the only candidate in the race who has never served a day in our broken federal government. The voters of Maine have sent a clear message that it is past time to send an outsider to the White House, a conservative with a lifetime of experience in the private sector, who can uproot Washington's culture of taxing and spending and borrowing and endless bureaucracy.
