    We made progress at the Seattle WTO trade meetings although significant differences remain. I remain optimistic that we can use the coming months to narrow our differences and launch a successful new round of global trade talks. A successful round will include bringing down barriers in agriculture, manufacturing, and services; keeping E-commerce tariff-free; and ensuring that trade will lift living conditions for working people everywhere while protecting the environment. And as I said in Seattle, a successful WTO must be more open and accessible to all citizens around the world.
I am determined to move forward on the path of free trade and economic growth while ensuring a human face is put on the global economy.
