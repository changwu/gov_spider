    Governor Bill Richardson signed into law today the Lynn and Erin Compassionate Use Act, which allows people who live with certain chronic, serious medical conditions to receive medical marijuana to relieve their suffering.
"This law will provide much-needed relief for New Mexicans suffering from debilitating diseases," said Governor Richardson. "It is the right thing to do,"
Senate Bill 523, sponsored by Senator Shannon Robinson, defines the serious medical conditions that will be covered, including HIV/AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, and multiple sclerosis. The bill also creates a panel of eight physicians and health care professionals who have expertise in these serious medical conditions that will supervise the program. Qualified patients must be under a doctor's care and supervision.
The bill requires the Department of Health to establish rules for considering applications, identifying licensure requirements for medical marijuana producers and production facilities, and developing a secure distribution system.
The bill was named in honor of Lynn Pierson and Erin Armstrong.
"I'm proud to sign legislation that makes patient care an important priority in this state," Richardson said. "It is time for Congress and the federal government to follow our lead and help those forced to endure painful, chronic diseases."
