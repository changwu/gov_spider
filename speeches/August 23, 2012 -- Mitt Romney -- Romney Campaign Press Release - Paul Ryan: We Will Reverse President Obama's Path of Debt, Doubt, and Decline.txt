PAUL RYAN: "First of all, President Obama has failed. His leadership has failed. The economy is failing because of his leadership - and you need to point that out. But in addition to that we have to show the country that we have a pro-growth plan to get people back to work to get this economy growing again. That we are offering specific solutions to get people back to work, to get this economy growing - and giving people a clear choice of two futures from which to choose from. We believe we owe the country an alternative to the path the President has put us on.  It's a nation in debt, in doubt, and decline."
