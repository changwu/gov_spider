HOUSTON, Texas â€” Today, the Cruz for President campaign announced that two key leaders in Georgia would be joining the Cruz campaign after being previously allied with Governor Scott Walker. The addition of Julianne Thompson and Rachel Little, along with Louie Hunter who previously announced his support for Cruz, means that all three of Walker's former state grassroots co-chairs will now be helping to organize the state for Cruz.
Thompson is one of Georgia's most active Republican leaders. She is the former co-chairman of the Atlanta Tea Party and co-founder of the Capitol Coalition of Conservative Leaders, Georgia's largest political coalition, and a former press secretary of the Georgia Republican Party.
Little is the immediate past Chairman of the Gwinnett County Republican Party and recently received the Georgia Republican Party Chairman of the Year Award. She was recognized as the Woman of the Year by the Conservative Republican Women of North Atlanta and served as Mitt Romney and Herman Cain's Georgia state co-chair in 2012.
Louie Hunter is a former Cobb County Commissioner and the Director of the Georgia Center-Right Coalition.
"We are encouraged and excited to see the caliber of support flowing to the Cruz campaign," said Cruz national political director Mark Campbell. "It's evidence that Cruz's record of being the only consistent conservative in the race is having a significant impact on the grassroots. Julianne, Rachel and Louie's experience, knowledge, and network will give our team a sizeable advantage in Georgia and we are thrilled to have them on board."
