    Memorandum for the Acting Director Office of Management and Budget
The Council on Competitiveness, established March 31, 1989, terminated on January 20, 1993.
Pending completion of a review, existing Executive orders on regulatory management will continue to apply. You are directed to request the agencies described in section 1(d) of Executive Order 12291 to assure that in publishing regulations, and subject to such exceptions as the Director or the Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget determines to be appropriate, all regulations must first be approved by an agency head or the designee of an agency head who, in either case, is a person appointed by me and confirmed by the Senate.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
