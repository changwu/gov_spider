    I am pleased that the delegations of the United States and the United Kingdom have come to an agreement on the issues involved in the negotiations over continuation of commercial air service between our two countries.
The signing of an agreement in principle means that disruption in air service on the North Atlantic, Pacific, and Caribbean routes has been avoided. The agreement ensures that international air service between Britain and the United States will continue to function in an atmosphere of healthy competition--an atmosphere which will benefit consumers and airlines alike.
I extend my personal appreciation to Special Ambassador Alan Boyd and to the members of the United States delegation.
Our new agreement should demonstrate to the world that the warm relations our two 'nations have enjoyed are as strong today as they have ever been.
