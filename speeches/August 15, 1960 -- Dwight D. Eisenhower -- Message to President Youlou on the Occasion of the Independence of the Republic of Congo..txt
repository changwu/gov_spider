    Dear Mr. President:
On the occasion of the independence of the Republic of Congo, I extend in my own name and on behalf of the United States most cordial greetings and felicitations to you and the people of Congo.
The United States has followed with great interest the progress of the Congo towards independence in harmony and friendship with France. It is with deep satisfaction that we welcome this historic event.
I recall with great pleasure and appreciation the thoughtful gift which you made to me last year in the name of the Community. This tangible token of affection of the Community and of yourself for the United States will long be remembered.
On this historic day, the Government and people of the United States look forward to close and friendly relations with the Government and people of Congo.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
