But how many ballots were fraudulently cast for the Dems? Did people vote after the election had ended? Did officials actually not allow OBSERVERS and Poll Watchers to look for an honest count?  https://t.co/3J198nhQQy Retweets: 14Favorites: 42

Andrew McCabe was exposed for who he is today in the U.S. Senate. He was totally destroyed - an ignorant fool. The great people of the FBI must make sure that he and his former boss, James Comey, pay the price for what they have done to the reputation of the FBI.Retweets: 61658Favorites: 293356

The Fake Pollsters at @ABC/@washingtonpost produced a possibly illegal suppression Poll just before the Election showing me down 17 points in Wisconsin when, in fact, on Election Day, the race was even - & we are now preparing to win the state.
