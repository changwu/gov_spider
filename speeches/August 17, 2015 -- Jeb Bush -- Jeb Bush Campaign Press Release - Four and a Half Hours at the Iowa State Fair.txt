"I'm trying to set the record for shaking the most hands for a presidential candidate at the state fair," Jeb said before wading into the crowd. From the looks of it, he may well have accomplished his goal.
This visit was no "show and go." For Jeb, this was an opportunity to make his case to Iowa voters and pave the way for victory in the caucuses.
