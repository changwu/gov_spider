    MANCHESTER, N.H. â€“ New Hampshire for Bernie announced today that the campaign knocked 36,682 doors over the past two weekends. In total, 167,978 doors have been knocked in New Hampshire by staff and volunteers since the launch of the campaign.
"The volunteers in New Hampshire understand that real change comes from the bottom up," said Sean Ward, Bernie 2020 New Hampshire Field Director. "Despite rain, snow and cold weather, our volunteers knocked almost 18,000 doors this weekend alone. This weekend's weather was miserable and these results are a testament to the hard work of our team as well as the dedicated volunteers."
The accomplishment comes on the heels of a visit to the Granite State from Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Ilhan Omar. The visit to New Hampshire focused on the importance of youth engagement, with events for students and young voters, including a rally at Nashua Community College. The rally exceeded 1,300 attendees -- the largest of any candidate in the race -- reflecting the growing grassroots support on the ground in New Hampshire.
