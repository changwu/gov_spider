    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Rules)Rep. Ford (D) Michigan and 27 others
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3700. The bill liberalizes student aid programs in various respects which would result in dramatically increased expenditures. It also creates many new programs, and reauthorizes and expands others which the Administration proposed for termination as low priority or duplicative. H.R. 3700 is seriously objectionable particularly at a time when extreme budget restraint is needed.
