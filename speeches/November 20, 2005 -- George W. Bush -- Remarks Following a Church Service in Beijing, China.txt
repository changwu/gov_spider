    The President. Pastor, Laura and I thank you very much for your hospitality. Our friend Luis Palau, from America, is here as well. And you gave a great sermon.
Pastor Ying Dufeng. Thank you.
The President. The spirit of the Lord is very strong inside your church. We thank you for carrying a message of love, like you did.
You know, it wasn't all that long ago that people were not allowed to worship openly in this society. My hope is that the Government of China will not fear the Christians who gather to worship openly. A healthy society is a society that welcomes all faiths and gives people a chance to express themselves through worship with the Almighty. So we welcomeâ€”we really thank you for letting us come by, and we ask for God's blessings on you and your church.
Thank you.
