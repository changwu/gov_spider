    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I am providing a report prepared by my Administration on progress toward a negotiated solution of the Cyprus question covering the period December 1, 2001, through January 31, 2002. The previous submission covered October 1 through November 30, 2001.
On January 16, Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash began direct talks on the island under the auspices of the United Nations. As in past reporting periods, Special Cyprus Coordinator Thomas G. Weston and U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Donald K. Bandler continued to provide diplomatic support to the process. The United States remains committed to the United Nations effort to find a just and lasting settlement to the Cyprus problem.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
