    LOS ANGELES - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement on Monday on the makeup of a key committee that will draft the party platform for this summer's Democratic National Convention:
"We believe that we will have the representation on the platform drafting committee to create a Democratic platform that reflects the views of millions of our supporters who want the party to address the needs of working families in this country and not just Wall Street, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry and other powerful special interests."
