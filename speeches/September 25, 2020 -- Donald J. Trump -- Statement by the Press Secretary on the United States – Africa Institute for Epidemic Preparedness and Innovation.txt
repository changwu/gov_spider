    Following President Donald J. Trump's remarks at the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Board of Advisors Meeting, Assistant to the President and National Security Advisor Robert C. O'Brien announced the intent to establish the United States â€“ Africa Institute for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation (the U.S.-Africa Institute). The U.S.-Africa Institute is a transformative partnership with leading HBCUs that will harness a whole-of-America effort to usher in a new era of equal partnership to deliver tangible results in preventing pandemics. The U.S.-Africa Institute will build the leadership and capacity of African health professionals, support African technological innovation, and create a data hub to support the rapid detection and mitigation of pandemics.
For years, the United States Government has relied on the extensive expertise of HBCUs to address health emergencies. HBCUs will serve as the principal partners of the United States Government in this historic effort, and will be at the forefront of our efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to disease outbreaks, including HIV and other health threats. The U.S.-Africa Institute will position our HBCUs, a uniquely American asset, in a position of leadership, complement longstanding United States investments and relationships, and usher in a new era of two-way partnership with the African continent. The United States has, over the past twenty years, made more health investments in Africa than any other nation, and continues to do so today. The United States' longstanding leadership in public health in Africa has generated extensive networks of labs, thousands of trained personnel, and has saved lives across the African continent.
President Trump is pleased to announce that our Nation's HBCUs are joining his Administration in this endeavor.
