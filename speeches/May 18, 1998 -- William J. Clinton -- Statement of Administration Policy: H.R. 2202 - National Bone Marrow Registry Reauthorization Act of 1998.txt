    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Young (R) FL and 212 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports enactment of H.R. 2202, which would reauthorize the Department of Health and Human Services' National Marrow Donor Program. This legislation is necessary to ensure continuation of the national program, which facilitates bone marrow transplantation by matching patients with donors and by maintaining a Registry of volunteers willing to donate marrow.
