    We are pleased that all parties to the Rock Island labor dispute have reached agreement. This is another positive step in the process initiated on September 20 to meet the threat of curtailed grain shipments in the Midwest.
We wish to thank both management and labor for their cooperative attitude. Special thanks should also be given to Chairman James Reynolds and Ida Klaus and Nicholas Zumas of the Emergency Board.
