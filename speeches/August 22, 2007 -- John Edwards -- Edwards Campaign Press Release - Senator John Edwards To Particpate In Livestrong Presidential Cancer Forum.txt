    Edwards' Detailed Plans to Lower Costs and Provide Universal Health Care Will Benefit Every American
Cedar Rapids, Iowa â€“ Senator John Edwards will join cancer survivor and seven consecutive Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong for the LiveStrong Democratic Presidential Cancer Forum on Monday, August 27 in Cedar Rapids. In July, Edwards and Armstrong rode together as part of the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa (RAGBRAI.)
"Elizabeth and I share Lance's commitment to unite people to fight cancer, invest in research and ensure access to screening and care for every American," Edwards said. "To me, this is not a political issue or a political event -- it is a chance to call attention to the important cause of cancer survivorship and the obligation we all have to help people living with cancer, patients, survivors and the families of those touched by cancer."
Edwards was the first and remains the only candidate with a plan for true, universal health care that includes an honest plan to pay for it. His plan will encourage people to stay healthy by offering primary and preventive services, like screening for cancer and heart disease. It will also cover long-term and chronic care for diseases such as cancer, diabetes and mental health. Edwards' plan is paid for by repealing the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.
