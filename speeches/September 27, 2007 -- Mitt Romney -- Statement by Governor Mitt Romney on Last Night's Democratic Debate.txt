Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement regarding last night's Democratic presidential debate:
"While the men and women of our military are serving and sacrificing for their country in Iraq, the leading Democratic presidential candidates have consistently called for a retreat. Yet, when asked last night if they could outline a path forward in Iraq under their leadership, Senators Clinton, Obama and Edwards fell silent. Clearly, the Democrats place a higher premium on cheap and shallow political attacks that appeal to the fringe element of their party than they do on outlining a plan. Instead of troop withdrawals, we need to be talking about how we achieve victory in Iraq. Changing Washington requires Democrats who are willing to put aside the partisanship and work toward solutions on our most pressing challenges."

The Associated Press: "The Leading Democratic White House Hopefuls Conceded Wednesday Night They Cannot Guarantee To Pull All U.S. Combat Troops From Iraq" By 2013. "The leading Democratic White House hopefuls conceded Wednesday night they cannot guarantee to pull all U.S. combat troops from Iraq by the end of the next presidential term in 2013. 'I think it's hard to project four years from now,' said Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois in the opening moments of a campaign debate in the nation's first primary state. 'It is very difficult to know what we're going to be inheriting,' added Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York. 'I cannot make that commitment,' said former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina."
