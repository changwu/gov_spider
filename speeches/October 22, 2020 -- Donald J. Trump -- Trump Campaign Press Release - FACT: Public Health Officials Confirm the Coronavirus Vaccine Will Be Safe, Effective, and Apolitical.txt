    Joe Biden is ignoring public health experts and undermining confidence in the coronavirus vaccine. 
While Joe Biden continues to politicize and question the coronavirus vaccine and call for a vaccine approval process that already exists, the development of a safe and effective vaccine is well underway with multiple vaccine candidates in their final stages of development.
For months the nation's public health experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, have confirmed that Operation Warp Speed is entirely free from political influence:


Dr. Anthony Fauci: "I would not hesitate for a moment to take the vaccine myself and recommend it to my family."

U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams: "When there's a COVID vaccine available, I and my family will be in line to get it."

NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins: "The safety and the effectiveness will be not compromised."

FDA Commissioner Dr. Hahn: "We will do our job to assess the safety and the efficacy of a vaccine candidate."

Dr. Deborah Birx: "When the American people... see that the vaccine is safe and effective... they will want to have that vaccine."
