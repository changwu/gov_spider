    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the results of the Louisiana primary.
"Ann and I thank all the voters of Louisiana who took part in today's primary and she joins me in congratulating Rick Santorum. We are very pleased with our second place showing, and because it exceeded 25% of the vote, it entitles us to pick up delegates and add to our lead. Every day that passes with President Obama in the White House is a missed opportunity for America to get back on the right path. I do not accept that our great country must endure chronic high unemployment with millions of people out of work and losing their dreams. It's time for all Americans to come together and help return our country to the conservative principles that made America free and prosperous, secure and respected around the world. I look forward to the contests to come, to being chosen in August as the Republican standard-bearer, and to defeating Barack Obama in November."
