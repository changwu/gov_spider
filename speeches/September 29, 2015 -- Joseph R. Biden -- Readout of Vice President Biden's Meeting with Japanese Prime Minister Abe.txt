    Today, Vice President Biden met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly meetings. The Vice President congratulated Prime Minister Abe on the passage of Japan's security legislation, and the two reaffirmed the strength of the alliance and the historic level of cooperation between our two countries. The two leaders discussed a range of regional and global issues, including maritime security, cyber issues, and regional relations. Vice President Biden and Prime Minister Abe discussed the Trans-Pacific Partnership and agreed that their negotiating teams would work closely together — and with other partners — with the goal of resolving the limited number of outstanding issues at the upcoming Ministers meeting in Atlanta.
