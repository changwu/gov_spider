    President Bush will host Spanish President Aznar for a meeting and luncheon on December 18, 2002. Spain was the first European country visited by the President after taking office, and he and President Aznar have remained in close contact since. Spain is a staunch ally in the war on terrorism and a valuable member of NATO. Spain also plays an important role, and shares many common interests with the United States in the Western Hemisphere.
