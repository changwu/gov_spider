There's no one who fights harder for American families than Hillary Clinton—and every family in Iowa needs to know that.
The Iowa caucus—the first contest in the 2016 election—is just nine days away, which means for Hillary supporters, it's all hands on deck. And if you want to help Hillary win Iowa on February 1, then here's your mission for the day:
Just share this video with someone you know in Iowa. And if you don't know someone in Iowa, share it anyway—I bet someone you know does.
Hillary has been fighting for the causes we care about her entire life.


And now it's time for us to fight for her.
Share the full video with your friends so they know Hillary will fight for them—and then let's go win Iowa.
