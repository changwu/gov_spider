    I leave Yugoslavia with strong impressions of a brave and dedicated country.
I have been moved by the dignity and courage of the Yugoslav peoples at this time of national sorrow over the passing of President Tito. Just as strongly, I have been impressed by the determination of Yugoslavia's leaders as they face the challenges of the present and plan for the future.
My talks with President Mijatovic and other Yugoslav leaders have reminded me once again of Yugoslavia's steadfast commitment to the policies which have become its hallmark: independence and nonalignment abroad; brotherhood, unity, and self-management at home.
We have reviewed our bilateral relations-which I am happy to affirm are excellent.
We have also had an opportunity to discuss a number of aspects of the current international scene. There, as we had to agree, the picture remains deeply troubled.
We have seen in Afghanistan a gross violation of the sovereignty of a nonaligned nation. In response, the United States and Yugoslavia clearly have different roles to play, but both our countries are committed to upholding the principles of respect for independence and sovereignty, non-intervention and peaceful resolution of disputesâ€”principles that are enshrined in the United Nations Charter and confirmed in the Helsinki Final Act.
As a leader and founder of the Nonaligned Movement, Yugoslavia plays a unique role in promoting the universal realization of these principles.
As I depart Yugoslavia, I want to express to you, Mr. President, and to your colleagues in the Presidency and Yugoslavia's other ruling bodies, and to the people of your great country, my sincere thanks for the hospitality you have shown us. Our visit has not only been useful, it has also been very enjoyable. We carry home to the United States many pleasant memories and reminders of the close friendship of our peoples.
Thank you and farewell.
