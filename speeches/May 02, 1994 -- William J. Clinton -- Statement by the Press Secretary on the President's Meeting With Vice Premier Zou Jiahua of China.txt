President Clinton met today in the Oval Office with Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua. The meeting, which lasted 40 minutes, provided both sides with an opportunity to exchange views on the current state of U.S.-China relations.
President Clinton told the Vice Premier that the United States wants to see a strong, stable, and prosperous China. The President emphasized that he wants to strengthen our bilateral relationship, but to accomplish that goal there needs to be progress on human rights as called for in last year's Executive order.
Vice Premier Zou was accompanied, among others, by Vice Foreign Minister Liu Hiaqui, Vice Minister Zeng Peiyan from the State Planning Commission, and Ambassador Li Daoyu.
