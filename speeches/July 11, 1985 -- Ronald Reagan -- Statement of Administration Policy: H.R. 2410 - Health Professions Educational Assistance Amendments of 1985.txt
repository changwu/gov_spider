    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
Revised(House)(Waxman (D) California)
The Administration strongly opposes enactment of H.R. 2410, because the bill continues large obsolete Federal training subsidies designed to meet health professions shortages of the 1960's â€” not the surpluses of the 1980's. The Administration's proposals (1) target health professions funds on needy students through improvements in the Health Professions Student Loan program and (2) continue the Health Education Assistance Loan program with new loan commitment levels totaling $300 million for fiscal years 1986-1988.
