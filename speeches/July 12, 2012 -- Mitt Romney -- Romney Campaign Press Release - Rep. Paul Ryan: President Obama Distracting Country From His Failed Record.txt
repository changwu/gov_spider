    "And he's run—this latest ad he's run against Mitt Romney—this outsourcing ad. It's already been labeled by the fact checkers as misleading, untrue and unfair. So he's going to divide this country. He's distorting these things to try and win this election. This is hardly the President we thought we were going to get in 2008. This is not the Barack Obama of 2008 and it's really kind of sad that we're at this juncture." — Rep. Paul Ryan

STEVE DOOCY, FOX NEWS: "And now once again, it's that class warfare thing where he wants to jack up taxes on the most successful people in the country: the small businesses, the job creators, even though he knows there is no chance it could pass."
REP. PAUL RYAN: "Even economists from the President's own party say that this is a really bad idea for job creation. So he even knows that raising taxes on successful small businesses is not good for job creation, yet he's pressing forward with this. As you mentioned, Steve, he wants to divide the country in order to distract the country to try and win the election."
DOOCY: "Because it polls well, Congressman. It polls well."
RYAN: "And he's run—this latest ad he's run against Mitt Romney—this outsourcing ad. It's already been labeled by the fact checkers as misleading, untrue and unfair.
