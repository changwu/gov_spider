    The President added five senior members to his administration today, announcing his intention to nominate Alan Blinder and Joseph Stiglitz as members of the Council of Economic Advisers, Kathryn Sullivan as Chief Scientist at the Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Arati Prabhakar as Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology at Commerce, and Marilynn Davis as the Assistant Secretary for Administration at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
"I am asking these people today to fill roles which are absolutely essential for the effective workings of this Government," said the President. "Providing sound economic advice, developing better models to understand environmental change, working to ensure an American edge in high technology, and finally bringing the operations of HUD under control are the kinds of actions that the American people need. The people that I am nominating will get the job done for them."
