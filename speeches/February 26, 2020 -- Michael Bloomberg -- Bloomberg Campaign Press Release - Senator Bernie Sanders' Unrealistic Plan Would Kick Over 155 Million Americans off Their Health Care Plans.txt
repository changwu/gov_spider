    NEW YORK â€” Tonight Senator Bernie Sanders once again doubled down on his unworkable Medicare for All proposal, which would force more than 155 million Americans off their private health insurance plan, replace them with a government plan, and increase taxes on middle class families.
Mike Bloomberg, on the other hand, has put forward a health plan that would lower costs, increase competition, and improve health outcomes. Mike's plan would ban surprise medical bills, cap out-of-network hospital charges, authorize the government to negotiate drug prices and cap out-of-pocket drug costs in Medicare. His plan includes a public option, which is a more popular alternative to Medicare for All, that would allow people to buy a government-administered health plan if they wanted to.
Mike's Record:

As mayor of New York City, Mike decreased the number of New Yorkers without health insurance by nearly 40% from 2001 to 2013.
Mike's focus on promoting public health increased life expectancy of New Yorkers by three years.
His policies helped cut teen smoking in half and cut heart disease by 31% in New York City.
