    Today Kasich for America announced that former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld has endorsed Governor John Kasich for President.
Governor Weld said: "I have known John Kasich for twenty years and he is a born executive. Being governor is the type of experience that prepares you to be President. John Kasich hasn't just talked about balancing budgets and growing jobs, he's actually done it. His tremendous record and results-oriented conservative leadership in Ohio is exactly what we need in the White House."

Weld served as Massachusetts governor from 1991-1997. Prior to his service as governor, Weld served as a U.S. Attorney for five years and as head of the U.S. Department of Justice's Criminal Division during President Reagan's administration.
Governor Kasich said: "I have known Governor Weld for many years and respect his long commitment to serving our country. It's an honor to have his support as we continue to grow our team and move deeper into the primary calendar."
