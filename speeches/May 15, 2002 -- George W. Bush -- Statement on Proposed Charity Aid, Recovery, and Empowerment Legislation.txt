    I was pleased to meet this morning with the leadership of the United Jewish Communities (UJC). We share a strong commitment to see passage of the CARE ("Charity Aid, Recovery, and Empowerment") Act. The UJC and more than 1,600 other organizations—ranging from America's Second Harvest to the YMCA—support this important piece of legislation, which will spur charitable giving and create a more level playing field for faith-based and community organizations.
America should stand by the charities that support people in need and in crisis. Giving to many charities—and particularly to social service organizations—is down, while the demands on them remain great. The Senate should pass the CARE Act, and the Congress should send me legislation that I can sign that will help support the vital work of thousands of faith-based and community-based charities across America.
