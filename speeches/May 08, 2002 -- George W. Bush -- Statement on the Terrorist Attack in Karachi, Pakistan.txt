    The United States deplores and condemns the terrorist murders carried out by a suicide bomber in Karachi, Pakistan, earlier today. Today's attack underscores the dangers all our citizens and societies continue to face from such attacks and strengthens our resolve to continue working together to fight terrorism at home and abroad.
On behalf of the American people, I extend my condolences to the families of the victims and the people of Pakistan and France, whose citizens were killed in this attack.
