    The President today made additional disaster assistance available to the State of Louisiana by authorizing an increase in the level of Federal funding for Public Assistance projects undertaken as a result of Hurricane Rita.
Under the President's major disaster declaration issued for the State of Louisiana on September 24, 2005, for Hurricane Rita, Federal funding was made available to State and local governments in multiple parishes for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct Federal assistance, at 75 percent Federal funding. For a 34-day period, assistance for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct Federal assistance was made available at 100 percent of the total eligible costs.
Under the President's order today, the Federal share for Public Assistance, including direct Federal assistance, for this disaster has been increased to 90 percent of the total eligible costs, except for assistance previously approved at 100 percent Federal funding. The President extended 100 percent funding for debris removal and emergency protective measures, previously funded through October 27, 2005, for 30 days through November 26, 2005.
The increase to 90 percent Federal share is retroactive to the date of the President's major disaster declaration for the State of Louisiana.
