    To the Senate of the United States:
I am transmitting, for the Senate's advice and consent to ratification, the Consular Convention Between the United States of America and the Mongolian People's Republic signed at Ulaanbaatar on August 2, 1990. I am also transmitting, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
The signing of this Convention is a significant step in the process of improving and broadening the relationship between the United States and Mongolia. There currently does not exist a bilateral agreement on consular relations between the two countries. The Convention sets forth clear obligations with respect to important matters such as notification to consular officers of the arrest and detention of nationals of their country and protection of the rights and interests of nationals of their country.
The people of the United States and Mongolia have begun to establish ties of friendship and cooperation. I welcome the opportunity through this Consular Convention to promote good relations between the two countries. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the convention and give its advice and consent to ratification.
George Bush
The White House,
September 13, 1991.
