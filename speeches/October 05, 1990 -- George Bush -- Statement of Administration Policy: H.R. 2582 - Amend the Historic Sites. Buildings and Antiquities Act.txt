    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Vento (D) MN)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2582. Under existing law, the Department of the Interior is currently undertaking the activities authorized by H.R. 2582. The National Park Service (NPS) is actively pursuing Civil War battlefield protection planning and also routinely reviews park boundaries as part of the general management plans for each park. Moreover, the Department recently extended and expanded under existing law the National Park System Advisory Board.
Finally, the composition of the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission raises constitutional concerns. Although the Commission plays a predominantly advisory role, its authority to accept and administer donations to the government is an executive function. The appointment, by Congress of members to a government commission which administers donations violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution.
