    I am delighted to extend warm greetings and congratulations to all those celebrating the Lunar New Year, the Year of the Tiger, 4684.
Our nation has been richly blessed by its citizens of Chinese, Korean, and Indo-Chinese ancestry. Their contributions, in every field of endeavor, are playing a major, constructive role in the development and preservation of America's greatness. With one of the most ancient, venerable, and rich cultural legacies, Asian Americans preserve the wisdom of their forefathers, while working for the goals we all share for this great land.
America's true strength lies with its people, and the diverse origins of our citizens form a major part of that national asset. Liberty is rooted in tolerance and appreciation for the customs and values of others. Asian Americans uphold that creed by safeguarding a noble past rich in moral and cultural treasures. This year, in which heaven smiles on the builders, let us work together to build a better society for all Americans.
Nancy and I wish you a happy and successful Year of the Tiger.
