    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of General James L. Day, USMC (Ret). Last January I awarded General Day our Nation's highest military honor, the Medal of Honor, for extraordinary heroism during the battle of Okinawa in 1945.
General Day's service did not end at Okinawa. He distinguished himself for courage and leadership in a career of service that spanned more than four decades. From World War II to Korea and Vietnam, he served his country with patriotism, dedication, and unsurpassed bravery. General Day's lifetime of achievements embodied the words Semper Fidelis.
We will miss this true hero, whose selfless conduct as a Marine and citizen set a shining example for all Americans. We are grateful for all he did to preserve the freedom that is our most sacred gift. Our thoughts and prayers go to his wife, Sally, his son, Jim, and the entire Day family.
