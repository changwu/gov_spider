    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, the Convention for the Conservation of Salmon in the North Atlantic Ocean which has been signed by the United States, European Community, Iceland, Norway and Canada. It will enter into force following ratification by not less than four Contracting Parties of which one must be the United States. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.
Work on this Convention was initiated in 1978 by the United States to develop a new organization to address Atlantic salmon conservation, restoration and management issues through international cooperation. The Convention will provide an effective forum for salmon producing states and salmon harvesting states to work together cooperatively in solving critical salmon conservation and management problems in the Atlantic region. It will focus attention on worldwide Atlantic salmon conservation and management programs and augment current domestic and international efforts to restore these valuable resources.
I recommend that the Senate give early consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
