    Today's news of improvement in achievement for students in high-poverty schools is welcome, but we must not rest until all students meet the challenging standards we set for them. That is why I urge Senators in both parties not only to support this week's vote to put 100,000 new, well-prepared teachers in the classroom but also to enact my "Education Accountability Act." This act will help move our education system forward by ensuring that States and school districts end social promotion, phase out the use of unqualified teachers, turn around low-performing schools, provide parents with report cards on schools, and implement effective discipline policies. While our education reform efforts are clearly headed in the right direction, we must take these important steps to close the gap between students and increase the pace of reform.
