    The tragic circumstances which make the Hostage Relief Act of 1980 so necessary have occurred all too often in recent years. In particular, the holding of 52 Americans in Tehran has made this legislation urgent.
I am pleased that speedy and thoughtful action on the part of both Houses of Congress has brought to my desk a bill which will go a long way toward alleviating some of the burdens faced by the families of those held hostage and will ensure that adequate medical treatment will be provided to hostages and to their loved ones when they return.
All those held captive in Iran and others in similar situations since November 4, 1979, irrespective of whether they are in the Armed Forces or are civilian Government employees, will receive the education and health benefits provided for in this bill. Additionally, all of the hostages will be excused from Federal taxes for the period of time spent in captivity.
With the enactment of this legislation, we take a small but extremely important step toward providing a measure of compensation for the severe hardships hostages and their families endure. I am extremely pleased to sign this bill into law.
