He shared details of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) regarding Iran's nuclear program agreed to among the P5+1, the European Union, and Iran. In discussing the details of the JCPOA, the President affirmed that it will verifiably prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon by cutting off all of the potential pathways to a bomb while ensuring the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program going forward.
