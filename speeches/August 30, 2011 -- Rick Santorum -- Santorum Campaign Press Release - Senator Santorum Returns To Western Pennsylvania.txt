    Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) will return to southwestern Pennsylvania with campaign stops in Hollidaysburg, Johnstown, and private events in Greensburg and Pittsburgh this Wednesday.
Senator Santorum said, "I am excited about returning to where this journey began over twenty years ago, with another upset win over an incumbent everyone said we could not beat. Since being written off by the national press, so much positive has happened to our campaign following the outpouring of support we received in Ames. The momentum is clearly building and I cannot wait to tell many old friends all we have accomplished so far, and how our vision for the country is catching on quickly with every speech and every event. Ultimately, I believe our message will move us forward toward victory in November 2012."
In addition to meeting privately with long-time supporters and activists, Senator Santorum will be holding the following events and availabilities open to the media. All times are local.
