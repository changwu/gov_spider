The mayors and mayors-elect discussed key initiatives around public safety and housing, as well as implementation of the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act which are leading to unprecedented job creation and an economy that is being rebuilt from the bottom up and middle out.
