    Manning, SC -- Speaking at the Clarendon County Courthouse in Manning, SC, Senator Barack Obama will deliver remarks today commemorating the struggle of the civil rights foot soldiers and calling on African Americans and all Americans to write the next chapter in the civil rights movement.
Roughly sixty years ago in Clarendon County, Reverend J.A. DeLaine, Harry and Eliza Briggs and others filed a lawsuit that challenged unequal education - a case that became part of Brown v. Board of Education.
Speaking in the Corridor of Shame, Obama will call for America to fix our broken schools, recruit an army of new teachers, and reform our education system to finally fulfill the legacy of Harry and Eliza Briggs.
