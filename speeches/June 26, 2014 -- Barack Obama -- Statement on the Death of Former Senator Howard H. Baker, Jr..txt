    Michelle and I were saddened to hear about the passing of Howard Baker. Howard was many things over the course of his career, from Senate Majority Leader to White House Chief of Staff to Ambassador. Yet it was his ability to broker compromise and his unofficial role as the "Great Conciliator" that won him admirers across party lines, over multiple generations, and beyond the State he called home. Over an 18-year Senate career, Howard fought for the people of Tennessee and helped lead America through difficult times. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Howard's wife Nancy and the entire Baker family.
