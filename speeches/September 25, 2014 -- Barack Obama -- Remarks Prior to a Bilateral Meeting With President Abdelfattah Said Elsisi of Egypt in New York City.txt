    Well, I want to welcome President Elsisi to New York and to the United States. And I'm very much looking forward to this opportunity to share ideas.
Obviously, the U.S.-Egyptian relationship has been an important cornerstone of our security policy and our policy in the Middle East for a very long time. This is our first opportunity, face to face, to discuss a wide range of issues, everything from the Palestinian-Israeli situation in Gaza to Libya, to the issues of ISIL, Iraq, and Syria.
And so I want to welcome the President here and his delegation, and I look forward to a constructive, productive conversation.
Okay. Thank you, everybody.
