    Today Jim Watt talked with me by telephone and delivered to me his letter of resignation. He feels that he has completed the principal objectives that he and I agreed upon when he became Secretary of the Interior. I respect his decision to leave the Government and thus have reluctantly accepted his resignation. He will continue in office until his successor is confirmed.
Jim has done an outstanding job as a member of my Cabinet and in his stewardship of the natural resources of the Nation. He has initiated a careful balance between the needs of people and the importance of protecting the environment. His dedication to public service and his accomplishments as Secretary of the Interior will long be remembered.
Nancy and I appreciate the contribution that Jim and Leilani have made to this administration, and we wish them well in their future endeavors.
