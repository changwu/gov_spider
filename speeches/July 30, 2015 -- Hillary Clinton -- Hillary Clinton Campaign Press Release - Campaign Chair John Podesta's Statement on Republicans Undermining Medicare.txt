    On the 50th anniversary of Medicare, Hillary for America Chair John Podesta released the following statement about Republican plans that undermine Medicare.
"Medicare may not make it to its own 65th birthday if Republicans get their way. Just listen to what the Republicans running for president have to say. Jeb Bush said, "We need to figure out a way to phase out this program." Marco Rubio said programs like Medicare "weakened us as a people." Rand Paul even dismissed Medicare as "socialized medicine." And far too many Republicans running for President back a reckless plan in Congress that would end the Medicare guarantee, forcing seniors to pay more.
"If there's a Republican president, they would join their colleagues in Congress to undermine Medicare and roll back its guarantee. That could mean higher premiums, more expensive prescription drugs, and thousands in new out-of-pocket costs for seniors.
"Hillary Clinton is committed to preserving, protecting and strengthening Medicare â€“ for today's seniors and for future generations. Seniors have paid into Medicare for a lifetime, and they've earned those benefits when they retire."
