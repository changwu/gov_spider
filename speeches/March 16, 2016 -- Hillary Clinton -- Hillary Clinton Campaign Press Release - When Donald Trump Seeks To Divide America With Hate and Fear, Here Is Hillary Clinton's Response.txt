Hillary Clinton has been calling out Donald Trump for his hateful, divisive rhetoric since the very beginning of this campaign.
She called him out for his racist comments on immigrants and denounced his proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the country. And as the violence at Trump's rallies escalates, Hillary continues to speak out—laying the blame exactly where it belongs.
It's no coincidence that his incendiary words have led to so much hateful action.
"What Trump has done is like a case of political arson," Hillary said. "You know, he has lit the fire—and then he throws his hands up and claims that he shouldn't be held responsible." 
And as if his offensive statements about so many different groups of Americans weren't bad enough on their own, he has taken his comments even further.

This behavior goes against everything America stands for—and as a nation, we have an obligation to reject his message.

As a candidate—and as president—Hillary will stand up to Trump and everyone who tries to divide us.
