    Due to the horrific tragedy that has just taken place in Orlando, Florida, Mr. Trump is postponing the rally scheduled to take place tomorrow in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. We will make it up in the near future. Mr. Trump will, however, deliver a major speech at St. Anselm's College tomorrow afternoon. He looks forward to returning to New Hampshire and discussing the serious threats facing all Americans and his solutions for making this country safe again.
