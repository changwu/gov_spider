    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Boucher (R) Virginia and 4 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5445. Although the Administration supports reform of civil RICO ("Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations"), it prefers the approach proposed by the Department of Justice, which constitutes a more thorough and comprehensive reform of civil RICO and is consistent with the intent of the original civil RICO statute.
