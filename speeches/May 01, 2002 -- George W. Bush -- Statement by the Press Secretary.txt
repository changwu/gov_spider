    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Maryland and ordered Federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the area struck by a tornado on April 28, 2002.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in a three county area. The counties include Calvert, Charles, and Dorchester.
Assistance can include disaster housing, grants, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
Joe M. Allbaugh, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), named Thomas P. Davies as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The Agency said that damage surveys are continuing in other areas, and additional assistance and counties may be added after the assessments are completed.
The Agency said that residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance tomorrow by calling 1-800-621-FEMA(3362), or 1-800-462-7585 (TTY) for the hearing and speech impaired. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. seven days a week until further notice.
