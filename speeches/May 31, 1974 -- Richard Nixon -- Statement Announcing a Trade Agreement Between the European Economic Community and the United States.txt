    I AM pleased to announce this morning that trade negotiators from the United States and the European Community, meeting in Brussels, have agreed on a formula for reducing Community import duties on a significant number and volume of American exports. These reductions are in compensation for changes which occurred when the European Community was enlarged to include Great Britain, Ireland, and Denmark.
The resolution of this important issue, following long and arduous negotiations over a period of several months, represents a major step toward improved Atlantic relationships. It also helps to clear the way for prompt Senate action on the Trade Reform Act.
For their efforts in negotiating this agreement, Sir Christopher Soames, Vice President of the European Communities Commission, and Ambassador William D. Eberle, the U.S. Special Representative for Trade Negotiations, both deserve the thanks of the entire Atlantic Community.
It is the hope of the United States that the spirit which prevailed during these negotiations will continue in the months and years ahead as we seek to resolve other important and sensitive issues.
