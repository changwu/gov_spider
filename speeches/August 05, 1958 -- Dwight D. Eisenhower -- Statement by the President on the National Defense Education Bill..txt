    ONE OF THE major objectives of this Congressional Session should be short-term emergency legislation in education. In January I recommended to the Congress a balanced four-year federal program in this field.
I have discussed with Secretary Flemming the bill recently approved by the House Education Committee, H. R. 13247. His statement relating to that bill, released today, is consistent with the views I expressed in a July seventh letter to Congressman Wainwright.
While the bill as reported by the Committee fulfills most of the objectives outlined in my January recommendations, I believe--as does Secretary Flemming--that it should be amended to limit the number of scholarships and to make sure no tax dollars are paid to any scholarship winner who does not need those dollars to finance his college education.
I am encouraged by reports that the House will soon consider this legislation, and I hope the Congress will complete action on this matter promptly, so the federal Government may undertake this emergency short-term program without delay.
