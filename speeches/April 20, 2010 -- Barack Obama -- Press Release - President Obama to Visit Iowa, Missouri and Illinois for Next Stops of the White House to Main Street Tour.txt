    Obama to discuss jobs and the economy with rural families and businesses
WASHINGTON, DC - The White House announced today that President Obama will travel to Iowa, Missouri and Illinois on April 27 and 28 for the next stops on the White House to Main Street Tour.
During the visit, President Obama will meet with workers, farmers, small business owners, and local leaders to share ideas for continuing to grow the economy and to put Americans back to work. President Obama will spend time in these areas to hear about the challenges rural Americans face and to listen to their ideas for working together to turn the economy around.
Additional details about the visit, including locations and press coverage details, will be announced in the coming days.
In December 2009, President Obama kicked off the White House to Main Street Tour in the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania. Since then, he has visited Lorain County, Ohio and Savannah, Georgia. In an effort to spend some time outside of Washington and talk to American families about what they are experiencing during these tough economic times, the President will regularly visit communities across the country and meet with members of the community and share ideas for rebuilding our economy for the long term.
