    To win the war on terrorism, we are staying on the offensive abroad and protecting Americans at home. I applaud Congress for passing the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill. These funds will help make Americans and their families even safer through stronger border enforcement, improved transportation security, and continued support for police, firefighters, and emergency-response teams. I look forward to signing this legislation.
