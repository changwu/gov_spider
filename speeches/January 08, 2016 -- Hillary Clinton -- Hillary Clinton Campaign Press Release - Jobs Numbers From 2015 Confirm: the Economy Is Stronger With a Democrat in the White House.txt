The White House just released a report showing job growth in 2015—and it confirms something Hillary Clinton has been saying for a while.


  275,000 new private-sector jobs in Dec ?
Lowest unemployment rate in more than 7 years ?

Even though Republicans don't like to admit it ...

We haven't seen this kind of growth since the last time we had a Democratic president in office.

But we still have a lot of work to do.


  "The unfinished business of this recovery is to make sure that we have not only a better economy but a better America." - @LaborSec— US Labor Department (@USDOL) January 8, 2016

We can't afford to let a Republican rip away the progress we've made. Hillary will defend that progress—and build an economy that works for everybody, not just those at the top.
