    Dear Mr. Speaker:
In accordance with provisions of the "1997 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from Natural Disasters, and for Overseas Peacekeeping Efforts, Including those in Bosnia" (Public Law 105-18), I hereby request and make available $22.5 million in emergency funding for the Department of the Interior's National Park Service.
These funds would allow for the repair and replacement of concession facilities at Yosemite National Park that were damaged in a 1997 flood.
The Congress required that certain prerequisites be met before these funds could be released. These requirements have been met and I designate the funds made available today as an emergency requirement consistent with the requirements of Public Law 105-18.
The details of this action are set forth in the attached letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
