    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies 
Subject: Return of Activated Military Members to Federal Civilian Employment
As we welcome home returning Federal civil servants who were called to active duty in the continuing Global War on Terrorism, we recognize the contributions they have made in the defense of freedom. Whether they served with the Reserve Forces or the Air and Army National Guard, each of them has my personal gratitude and the respect and admiration of a grateful Nation.
The Federal Government will continue to be the model for employer support to the Guard and Reserve. We are the guarantors of the rights of returning service members under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, and I am personally committed to providing each of them with our full support, recognition, and assistance. Accordingly, I hereby direct you to grant Federal employees under your authority who are returning from active duty 5 days of uncharged leave from their civilian duties, consistent with the provisions of Federal law.
We also are grateful for the extra efforts of the many Federal civilian employees who, in the absence of their fellow activated workers, have contributed to the War on Terror, and I urge you to recognize these Federal employees by appropriate means.
GEORGE W. BUSH
