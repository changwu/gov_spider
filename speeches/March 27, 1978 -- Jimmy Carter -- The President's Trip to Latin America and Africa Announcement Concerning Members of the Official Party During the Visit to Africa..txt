    Margaret Buckner Young and Jesse Hill, Jr., will be members of President Carter's official party on the Nigeria and Liberia portions of the President's trip to South America and Africa.
The President thought it would be appropriate that two such prominent black American leaders be members of the official party on the first state visit ever paid to black Africa by an American President. He thinks highly of Mrs. Young and Mr. Hill and asked that they join him on his trip.
Mrs. Young and Mr. Hill are expected to join the Carter traveling party in Rio de Janeiro Friday morning and remain with the party the rest of the trip.
Mrs. Young is the chairperson of the Whitney M. Young, Jr., Memorial Foundation. She is also an author. She is the widow of the late Whitney M. Young, Jr., a noted national black leader and the former head of the National Urban League (1961-1971).
Mrs. Young, a native of Campbellsville, Ky., has written four children's books: "First Book of American Negroes," "The Picture Life of Martin Luther King, Jr." The Picture Life of Thurgood Marshall," and "Black American Leaders."
She was recently appointed by the President to be a member of the Board of Visitors to the United States Military Academy.
Hill is the president and chief executive officer of the Atlanta Life Insurance Co. The insurance company is the largest stockholder life insurance company or financial institution controlled and managed by black Americans.
Mr. Hill, a native of St. Louis, Mo., is also the president of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce and is the holder of numerous civic positionsâ€”including memberships on the boards of directors of the National Urban Coalition, the National Urban League, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
