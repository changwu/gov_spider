THE RECENT devastation in Porto Rico makes the purpose of the Porto Rico Child Feeding Committee in sending the Christmas Ship to carry food to the children of the territory an especially timely and valuable expression of our thought and sympathetic concern. These children are fellow citizens of our country, with an especial claim upon the generosity of our people at this time.
