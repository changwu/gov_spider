(House Rules)
(Rep. Goodlatte, R-VA, and 32 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5063, the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2016, because the legislation is unnecessary and would harm the public interest. H.R. 5063 would prohibit the Federal Government from entering into settlement agreements that include payments directed to appropriate third parties. This legislation seeks to address a problem that does not exist â€“ the Federal Government does not create or use "slush funds." When the Federal Government settles a case with those who violate the law, it seeks to hold the defendants accountable and appropriately remedy the harms they have caused and to prevent the recurrence of those harms.
Because this legislation would interfere with the just and fair settlement of cases, if the President were presented with H.R. 5063, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.
