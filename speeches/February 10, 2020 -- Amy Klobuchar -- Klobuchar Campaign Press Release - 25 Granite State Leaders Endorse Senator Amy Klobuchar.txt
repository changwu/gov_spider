    MANCHESTER, NH â€” Today, 25 Granite State leaders representing all 10 counties across New Hampshire endorsed Senator Amy Klobuchar for President. The leaders, who include eight current and former State Representatives and multiple key community activists, show Klobuchar's surging grassroots support before Tuesday's primary.
"Granite State leaders are lining up behind Senator Amy Klobuchar because they know that she understands the daily struggles of Americans in their communities," said Amy For America New Hampshire State Director Scott Merrick. "These new endorsers, who come from a wide variety of towns across the state, recognize that Amy sees the obstacles that face urban and rural communities and will work hard to make life better for everyone. They know that Amy will win by bringing all Americans together, and govern by lifting all Americans up."
The endorsements follow a winning debate performance, a third place finish in two new polls, and raising $3 million in fundraising since Friday's Democratic debate. Yesterday, Klobuchar drew packed crowds in Manchester and Salem, and more than 1,100 people in Nashua.
