    (SANTA FE) Today outside the State Capitol Building First Lady Barbara Richardson hosted a ceremony to honor the victims of the Virginia Tech tragedy. New Mexico joined Virginia and more than a dozen other states as bells were rung simultaneously nationwide to remember the victims. First Lady Barbara Richardson offered the following remarks:
"Virginia Governor Tim Kaine has declared today a day of mourning and has asked states across America to stand with Virginia Tech to honor the victims of this tragedy. The Governor and I are honored to stand with Governor Kaine and his wife Anne. New Mexico is proud to stand with Virginia."  
"We stand with those who have lost loved ones and those who are on the road to recovery. We stand with those brave police officers, doctors, and educators who worked to bring students and teachers to safety. And we remain inspired by stories of teachers and students, who put themselves in harms way so that others might live."
"At 10am today bells in Virginia, New Mexico, and across America will ring in remembrance of each life tragically cut short. The bells will ring and we will remember."
First Lady Barbara Richardson was joined by Monsignor Jerome Martinez y Alire, Reverend Canon Dale Coleman, and Rabbi Marvin Schwab, who each offered prayers of remembrance. Rabbi Schwab also had special words to remember Holocaust survivor Virginia Tech Professor Liviu Librescu.
