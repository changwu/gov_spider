    
The Rubio campaign has recently received reports about false and disturbing anonymous calls to voters in South Carolina last night.
Here's what campaign senior advisor Joe Pounder had to say:
At last night's Clemson rally, a gentleman in the crowd fell ill and Marco brought the event to a close so medical personnel could respond. Unfortunately, while Marco was leading the crowd in prayer, some were writing scripts for anonymous phone calls using the incident to suggest Marco was leaving the race. These calls are false, malicious, and beneath the dignity of all South Carolinians.
Because of his track record in spreading such false rumors as he did in Iowa, Senator Cruz should immediately repudiate these calls. In the past 24 hours, Senator Cruz and his allies have flooded South Carolina with false and outrageous lies. Having realized he has run out of positions to flip flop on, Senator Cruz has settled on a strategy to steal elections through rumors and lies.

In South Carolina and seeing or hearing about any more dirty tricks by the Cruz campaign?
