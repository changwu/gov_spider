Pool Report 10 -- More comments from POTUS on ventilators
More Comments from POTUS >>
"When the virus struck our nation, governors raised fears that people who needed ventilators would not get the ventilators. ...we're preparing ventilator capacity for any and all scenarios. Initiatives like the dynamic ventilator reserve will help us to achieve that goal. We need ventilators but now we're pretty well stocked."
"Under the Defense Production Act the United States will produce or require more than 32,000 ventilators by the end of Mayo, and...listen to this one, 150,000 ventilators by the end of the year. So we're going to have more ventilators by the end of the year that we've ever even thought possible."
Said U.S. is receiving calls from Italy, France and Spain about ventilators.
POTUS later asked Rick Pollack of the American Hospital Association about ventilators:
POTUS: "We're also building a very high quality ventilator, because you have to make a decision, and I was told it makes a big difference the level of quality of ventilator, what is it? What is the difference? You find it makes a big difference? They're obviously more expensive. More detail, harder to build, but I hear they are more effective quite a bit...do you all consider that to be correct?
RICK Pollack said "there's a lot of different versions of them."
