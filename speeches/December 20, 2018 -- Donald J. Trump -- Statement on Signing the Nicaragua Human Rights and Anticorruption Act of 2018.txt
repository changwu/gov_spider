    Today, I have signed into law H.R. 1918, the "Nicaragua Human Rights and Anticorruption Act of 2018" (the "Act"). Section 6(c) of the Act, in conjunction with section 6(a), purports to require the Secretary of State to consult with certain congressional committees while preparing annual reports regarding the activities of the Nicaraguan Government. My Administration will treat section 6(c) as advisory. Mandatory consultation is not consistent with the Constitution's separation of powers. I hope that consultation will be possible while preparing the reports required by section 6(a), and I recognize the benefits of working with the Congress on the issues raised by the activities of the Nicaraguan Government. Nevertheless, the law must be executed, at all times, consistent with the separation of powers and the President's constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs.
