    Today I was pleased to sign the K-12 Cybersecurity Act into law to enhance the cybersecurity of our Nation's K-12 educational institutions. This law highlights the significance of protecting the sensitive information maintained by schools across the country, and my administration looks forward to providing important tools and guidance to help secure our school's information systems. I want to thank Congress for passing it with bipartisan support.
The global pandemic has impacted an entire generation of students and educators and underscores the importance of safeguarding their sensitive information, as well as for all Americans. This law is an important step forward to meeting the continuing threat posed by criminals, malicious actors, and adversaries in cyberspace. My administration is marshalling a whole-of-Nation effort to confront cyber threats. Recognizing how much work remains to be done and that maintaining strong cybersecurity practices is ongoing work, the advancements we have put in place during the first months of my administration will enable us to build back better, modernize our defenses, and protect our children, families, and communities.
