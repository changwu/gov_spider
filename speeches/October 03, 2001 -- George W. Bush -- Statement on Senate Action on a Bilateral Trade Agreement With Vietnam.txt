    Today's Senate action to establish a bilateral trade agreement with Vietnam is a significant step toward strengthening the ties between our two countries and promoting strength and stability in this important region. The agreement will provide American companies with access to a large and growing market and, through the reforms it promotes, it will help create a more prosperous and engaged Vietnam. The trade agreement also brings hope for improving human rights. I look forward to signing this legislation into law.
