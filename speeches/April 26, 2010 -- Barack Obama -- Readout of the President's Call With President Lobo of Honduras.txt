    Earlier today, President Obama spoke for the first time with Honduran President Porfirio "Pepe" Lobo. The President commended President Lobo for his leadership in his first months in office in promoting national reconciliation and restoring democratic and constitutional order in Honduras. The President took particular note of the Truth Commission agreed to as part of the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord and championed by President Lobo that is set to begin its work in the coming days.
President Obama expressed his concern with the human rights situation in Honduras, particularly the recent suspicious killings of a number of journalists and civic activists. The President welcomed President Lobo’s plan to fully and transparently investigate these cases as well as his commitment to improve the overall human rights situation.
The Presidents also discussed the importance of Honduras’ continued reintegration into Central America and into the broader inter-American system as President Lobo works to address the many challenges facing the Honduran people.
