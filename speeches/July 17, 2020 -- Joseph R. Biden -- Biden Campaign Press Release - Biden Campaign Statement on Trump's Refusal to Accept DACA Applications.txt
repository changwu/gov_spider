    Today, a Maryland court ruled that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) must start accepting new DACA applications or be held in contempt of court. In response, Biden for President Communications Director for Coalitions Pili Tobar issued the following statement:
"It's been almost a month since the Supreme Court ruled against the Trump Administration's attempt to end DACA, and yet the Administration has refused to take new applications for the program. Today's decision by a federal court in Maryland is yet another blow to their heartless attacks against DACA, Dreamers, and their families. If Donald Trump wants to talk about being a 'law and order' president, he should start by accepting the court's lawful ruling and dropping his xenophobia-driven efforts to go after Dreamers and immediately comply with the judge's order, restore the full DACA program, and start accepting applications right away."
