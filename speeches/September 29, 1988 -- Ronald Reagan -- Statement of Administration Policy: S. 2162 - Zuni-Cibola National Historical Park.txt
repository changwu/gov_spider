    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Bingaman (D) NM and Domenici (R) NM)
The Administration opposes enactment of S. 2162. It is the policy of the Administration to place higher priority on funding the operation and maintenance of existing park units than on establishing new units, except in the most extraordinary circumstances. Moreover, the addition of this new unit to the National Park System could create expectations for the expenditure of Federal funds that would be unfair to the Zuni Tribe.
