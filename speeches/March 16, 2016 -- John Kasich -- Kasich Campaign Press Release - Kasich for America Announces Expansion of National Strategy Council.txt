"Governor Kasich showed tonight how you defeat Donald Trump and bring our party together," said John Weaver, chief strategist of Kasich For America. "This is going to be a long road to the nomination in Cleveland, and we're thrilled to grow our team of advisers with some of the best minds in the Republican Party."
