    Memorandum for Honorable Robert C. Weaver, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
I have just received the attached report from the President's Committee on Urban Housing. In the report, the Committee recommends a pilot program, under existing authority, to stimulate private enterprise to build and manage low-income housing.
I would like you to institute immediately a project of the type recommended by the Commission so that the desirability of a large scale program along these lines can be determined as soon as possible.
