    DES MOINES, IOWA — Beto O'Rourke's Iowa campaign will host debate watch parties across the Hawkeye State for tomorrow night's Democratic debate in Houston, Texas — Beto's home state. The debate will be televised on ABC from 7 p.m. CT to 10 p.m. CT.
Polling in Texas has continually shown Beto running in the top two out of more than 20 candidates. A new Texas Lyceum Poll shows him leading in the state among women voters, Latinx voters, and young voters. A University of Texas at Tyler survey also found that Beto is beating President Trump by double digits in the general election. No other Democratic candidate's lead over Trump exceeded the margin of error.
