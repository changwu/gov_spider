    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revision)(House)(Reps. Gray (D) Pennsylvania and 104 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1460. The punitive measures proposed in the bill are far more likely to aggravate the political and economic plight of Black South Africans than to cause the South African Government to abolish the policy of apartheid. The Administration believes that the best way to achieve peaceful change in South Africa is to continue to encourage reforms through incentives rather than to take punitive actions.
