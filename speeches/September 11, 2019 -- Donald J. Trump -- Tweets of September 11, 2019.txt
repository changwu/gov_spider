Greg Murphy won big 62% to 37% in North Carolina 03 & the Fake News barely covered the race. The win was far bigger than anticipated - there was just nothing the Fakers could say to diminish or demean the scope of this victory. So we had TWO BIG VICTORIES tonight Greg & Dan!Retweets: 16192Favorites: 69571

The Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO or less and we should then start to refinance our debt. INTEREST COST COULD BE BROUGHT WAY DOWN while at the same time substantially lengthening the term. We have the great currency power and balance sheet.....Retweets: 14135Favorites: 59153

....The USA should always be paying the the lowest rate. No Inflation! It is only the na'vet' of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn't allow us to do what other countries are already doing. A once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of 'Boneheads.'Retweets: 10439Favorites: 45676
