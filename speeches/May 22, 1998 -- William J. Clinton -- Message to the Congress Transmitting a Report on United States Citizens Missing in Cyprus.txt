    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with Public Law 103-372, I hereby submit the enclosed "Report to Congress on the Investigation of the Whereabouts of the U.S. Citizens Who Have Been Missing from Cyprus Since 1974." The report was prepared by retired Ambassador Robert S. Dillon, with significant contribution by former State Department Associate Director of Security Edward L. Lee, II. Their intensive investigation centered on Cyprus, but it followed up leads in the United States, Turkey, Greece, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
The investigation led to the recovery of partial remains that were identified through DNA testing (done at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology DNA Identification Laboratory) and other evidence as being those of one of the missing Americans, Andreas Kassapis. The report concludes that Mr. Kassapis was killed shortly after his capture in August 1974. The report also concludes that, although their remains could not be recovered, the other four missing U.S. citizens in all likelihood did not survive the events in Cyprus in July and August 1974.
