    We need a president who works to find unity of purpose again in our country. At the Faith and Family Presidential Forum in South Carolina today Jeb spoke about what his faith means to him and his dedication to serving the country and helping those in need. When the Forum played one of the horrible Planned Parenthood videos, Jeb, in an emotional response, talked about his record of defunding Planned Parenthood as governor of Florida.
