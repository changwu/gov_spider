    Q. Mr. President, you got a deal with the Russians today?
The President. We just had a chance to introduce Mr. Kozyrev to this distinguished group of Members of Congress, Senate and House, and to some of our outstanding business leaders. They're talking reform, and what we're talking here today on is reform. We want to see a balanced budget amendment passed; business leaders are joining Members of Congress and trying to get this done.
And so this is a rather unique meeting. We feel that creation of jobs and the economic prosperity of the American people are better served by the discipline on the budgeting process that would be brought to bear by a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution; discipline the executive branch, discipline the legislative branch. And so I'm hopeful that these business leaders and their colleagues will help us carry this message to the Hill. In their own bailiwick, they've been out front strongly for this. And right around the table we have some of the leaders from the Congress, Democrat and Republican, who have been out front on this key question.
So we've got a lot of work to do, but I wanted it to resonate up on the Hill. This is a unique meeting to this Cabinet Room. And I'm very grateful to the business leaders that have taken the time to join these leaders in Congress who are out front on this key question.
So thank you all very much.
Q. Mr. President, is there -- --
The President. This is the end of the photo opportunity in which I prevailed with my speech. And no more questions. Thank you.
