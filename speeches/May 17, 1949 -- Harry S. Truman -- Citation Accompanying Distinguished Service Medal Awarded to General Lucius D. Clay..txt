    CITATION FOR DISTINGUISHED SERVICE MEDAL
(Second Oak Leaf Cluster)
AS UNITED STATES Military Governor in Germany and Commander-in-Chief of United States Forces in Europe, General Lucius D. Clay performed services of supreme value to his country and to humanity.
Previously distinguished for his outstanding work in helping to arm our forces, he added new and imperishable luster to his record by the manner in which he carried out his uniquely challenging task in Military Government in Germany. General Clay in this capacity proved himself not only a soldier in the finest tradition of our American arms, not only an administrator of rare skill, but a statesman of the highest order--firm, courageous, dedicated to the cause of peace. His entire administration was marked by a deep devotion to our democratic ideals of justice and freedom.
Conditions in Germany were such that he could not be spared from his task until May fifteenth of this year. He was released then only because his work had reached a milestone with the framing of a Constitution for Western Germany. His was an assignment of unexampled complexity and difficulty, and the completion of it represents an accomplishment of which his countrymen can be forever proud.
