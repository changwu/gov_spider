    Baltimore, MD —Today, former two-term Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer endorsed Governor Martin O'Malley for President and signed to serve as a national co-chair to the campaign.
"I'm endorsing Martin for President today because I believe he is the candidate that best represents the future of our Party," Governor Schweitzer said. "Martin and I worked closely together as Democratic Governors, and I saw firsthand how he didn't just talk about his progressive values—he actually put them into action. He skillfully led his state through the national recession, froze college tuition for four years in a row, raised the minimum wage, and was ahead of the curve on critical national issues like immigration. Martin and I don't agree on every issue, but he is the only candidate with a proven record of getting things done, and I believe he is the best candidate to take on Republicans in November 2016."
"The fight for the Democratic nomination is just getting started, and I'm grateful for Governor Schweitzer's support as we head into the next phase of this campaign," Governor O'Malley said. "He's a decisive and straight-talking public servant who understands the importance of actions, and not just words. We may not agree on every issue, but Governor Schweitzer knows the value of executive leadership, and the importance of fresh voices in our Party. I'm proud to have him on our team."
