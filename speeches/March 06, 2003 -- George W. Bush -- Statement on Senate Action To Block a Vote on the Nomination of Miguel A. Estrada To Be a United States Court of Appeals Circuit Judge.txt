    Miguel Estrada is a well-qualified nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals who has been waiting nearly 2 years for an up-or-down vote in the United States Senate. The decision today by 44 Senators to continue to filibuster and block a vote on this nomination is a disgrace.
The Senate has a responsibility to exercise its constitutional advice and consent function and hold an up-or-down vote on a judicial nominee within a reasonable time. Some Senators who once insisted that every appeals court nominee deserves a timely vote have now abandoned that principle for partisan politics. Their tactics are an injustice and unfair to the good man I have nominated and unfaithful to the Senate's own obligations.
These Senators are holding Miguel Estrada to a double standard. I will stand by Miguel Estrada's side until he is sworn in as a judge. I call on the Senate Democratic leadership to stop playing politics and permit a vote on Miguel Estrada's nomination. Let each Senator vote as he or she thinks best, but give the man a vote.
