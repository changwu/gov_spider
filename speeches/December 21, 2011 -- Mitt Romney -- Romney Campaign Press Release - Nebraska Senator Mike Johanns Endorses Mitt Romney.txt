    Mitt Romney today announced the endorsement of Nebraska Senator Mike Johanns.
"Senator Johanns has been a tireless servant for Nebraska and our country," said Mitt Romney. "In my campaign, I am fighting to grow our economy, lower spending, and reform how Washington works. Senator Johanns has been on the frontline of these fights both in Nebraska and in the Senate. With his help, we can put our country on a prosperous path once again."
Announcing his support, Senator Johanns said, "The only way we are going to reverse the failures of the last three years is if we have a president who understands the economy. Mitt Romney applied the principles he learned in the private sector to the challenges he faced leading the Olympics and as Governor. These same conservative principles can be used to fix our broken government."
