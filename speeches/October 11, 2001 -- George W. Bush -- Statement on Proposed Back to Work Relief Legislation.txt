    I commend Senators Allen and Warner and others for introducing my "Back to Work Relief Package." I look forward to continuing to work with members of both parties to enact this important relief for dislocated workers across America as soon as possible. This proposal will help get workers who lost their jobs because of the September 11 attacks back to work again.
