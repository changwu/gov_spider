    We are of course extremely gratified by the Israeli Cabinet's approval of the plan, which is a tribute to the remarkable diplomatic achievement of the President's personal emissary, Ambassador Philip Habib. It sets the stage for implementation of the plan, which we expect to start as early as this weekend. We urge the parties to make every effort to clear up the remaining matters so that implementation can go forward as soon as possible.
