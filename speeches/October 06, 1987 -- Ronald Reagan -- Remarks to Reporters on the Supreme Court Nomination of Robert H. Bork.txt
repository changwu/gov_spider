    The President. Well, thank you all for coming down this morning. As you know, the Senate Judiciary Committee will act on my nomination of Judge Bork to the Supreme Court. His opponents have made this a political contest by using tactics and distortions that I think are deplorable. And I could say more in that same tone, but time is of the essence.
Robert Bork is, without question, one of the most qualified candidates for the Supreme Court that we've ever had, and I am going to continue to do everything I can to get him confirmed. Our work is cut out for us, and we have a lot to do before the floor vote. We simply have to work together on this.
And that's a pause, and the meeting will start in a short time.
Q. Mr. President, are you saying you are not going to withdraw this nomination until there's a vote on the Senate floor?
The President. I am saying I am not going to withdraw this nomination.
Q. Under any circumstances?
The President. No.
Q. Sir, you say it's political, but a number of Republicans have also come out against Mr. Bork, including a member of the Republican leadership, Senator Chafee.
The President. Well, Chris [Chris Wallace, NBC News], I'm not going to take any more questions. We've got a meeting to get to, and I have a hunch that subject will be discussed in this meeting. [Laughter]
