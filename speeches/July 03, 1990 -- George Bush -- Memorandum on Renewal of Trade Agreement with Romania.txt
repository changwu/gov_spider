    Presidential Determination No. 90-28
Memorandum for the United States Trade Representative
Pursuant to my authority under subsection 405(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2435(b)(1)), I have determined that actual or foreseeable reductions in United States tariffs and nontariff trade barriers resulting from multilateral negotiations are satisfactorily reciprocated by Romania. I have further found that a satisfactory balance of concessions in trade and services has been maintained during the life of the Agreement on Trade Relations between the United States of America and Romania.
These determinations and findings shall be published in the Federal Register.
