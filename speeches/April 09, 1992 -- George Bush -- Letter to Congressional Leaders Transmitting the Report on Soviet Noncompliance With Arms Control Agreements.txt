    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Enclosed are classified and unclassified copies of the annual Report on Soviet Noncompliance with Arms Control Agreements.
Last year the Soviet Union ended and we have every reason to hope that this will lead to a new era of compliance with arms control agreements. The report I am forwarding covers actions taken in 1991 by the former Soviet Union, not the newly independent states which have succeeded it. We have already seen an improvement in the willingness of these new governments to adhere to arms control obligations.
For our part, the United States will continue to expect scrupulous compliance with all arms control obligations. Such compliance is especially important as we build new and better relations and as conventional and nuclear forces are dismantled.
Sincerely,
George Bush
