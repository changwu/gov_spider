VP pool report #1 — in position for VP’s virtual round table
Pool was collected from the stakeout just after 3:40pm, and we’re currently waiting in the South Auditorium ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris’ virtual round table with Guatemalan community leaders, scheduled for 4:00pm.
Passing along some background from WH:
The Vice President will participate in a virtual roundtable with representatives from Guatemalan community based organizations. This convening will be hosted by the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City and will underscore the importance of placing the Guatemalan people at the center of solutions to root causes of migration.
We'll be in the room for VP's opening remarks/brief gaggle. Will send along color and remarks as soon as possible.

"Finally, you will be able to tell me what has been working and what not has been working," VP stated. "I want to learn what has worked and what has not, from your perspective, and what might work and what not has been tried?" ———> she specifically asked for input on past and current US policies
"I want to hear about you. I want to hear about your work... this is part of what I'd like to learn from you today"
