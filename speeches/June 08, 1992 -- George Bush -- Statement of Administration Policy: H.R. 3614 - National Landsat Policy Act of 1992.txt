    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Brown (D) California)
Recognizing the value of the Landsat program, in February 1992, the President renewed the United States' commitment to seek to maintain continuity of Landsat-type data. The President's National Space Policy Directive 5 specifies that NASA and the Department of Defense will be responsible for developing, launching, and operating Landsat 7. They will also be responsible for defining alternatives for maintaining data continuity beyond Landsat 7.
H.R. 3614, as reported by the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, complements the President's policies and program management structure, and the Administration does not object to House passage.
The Administration will work in the Senate, however, to have sections 201(e) and 202(c) deleted. Section 201(e) would require the establishment of a Landsat Advisory Council, which is unnecessary in light of existing bodies which can perform this role. Section 202(c) would require certification to Congress if a firm, fixed-price contract is not used to procure Landsat 7. The type of contract should be left to the discretion of the program managers without going through a certification to Congress.
The Administration will also work in the Senate to have section 11, the "Buy American" provision, modified. The following sentence should be added to section 11(b): "This provision shall not apply to Government procurements which are subject to an international agreement to which the United States is a party."
