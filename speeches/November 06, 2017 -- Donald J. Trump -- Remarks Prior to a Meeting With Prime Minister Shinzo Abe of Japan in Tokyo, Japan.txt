    Prime Minister Abe. So, over lunch, we had an in-depth discussion to cover various challenges of the international community, including the issue of North Korea.
So to build on the discussion that we had over lunch, I very much look forward to continuing our discussion, namely on the global affairs as well as our economic issues, and also our bilateral issues.
President Trump. Well, thank you very much. It was indeed a good meeting, and mostly pertaining to trade, North Korea, and a couple of other subjects that we lightly touched on.
We're making tremendous progress, I believe, on trade in particular, bringing the deficits down and having a very fair and equal trade. And I look forward to finishing up the discussions.
A lot of great work and great friendships have been built, and they will continue to be built. Thank you very much. Thank you.
