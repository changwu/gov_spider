    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. Garcia, D-TX, and 62 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of the Protect Older Job Applicants (POJA) Act of 2021. The legislation would amend the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) of 1967, which prohibits, among other actions, age-based discrimination in hiring, to specifically prohibit employers from limiting, segregating, or classifying job applicants on the basis of age.
The POJA Act of 2021 provides a critical clarification to support older Americans during recruitment and hiring, ensuring the ADEA's nondiscrimination protections extend fully to older job applicants.
Workplace age discrimination, including at the application stage, prevents people from fully accessing the American dream and limits the contributions that they can make to our shared prosperity. Ensuring equitable access to employment is a priority for the Administration. The Administration supports this legislation that protects older job applicants.
