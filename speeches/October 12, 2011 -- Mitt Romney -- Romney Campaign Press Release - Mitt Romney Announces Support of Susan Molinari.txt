    Mitt Romney today announced the support of former New York Congresswoman Susan Molinari.
"I am honored to have the support of Susan Molinari," said Mitt Romney. "She understands that voters in New York and across America are tired of Obama's failed and expensive policies. I am glad to have her help in my efforts to defeat President Obama, restore economic growth, and create jobs."
Announcing her support, Susan Molinari said, "Obama's big government spending has failed to get Americans back to work. Mitt Romney understands what it will take to improve our economy. His sound economic plan is based on his real world experience as a successful businessman. As Governor of Massachusetts, he reined in spending and balanced the budget without raising taxes. Washington needs this kind of principled and pragmatic leadership."
