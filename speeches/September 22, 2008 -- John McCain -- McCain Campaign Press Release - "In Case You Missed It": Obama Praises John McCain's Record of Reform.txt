ARLINGTON, VA -- At today's speech in Green Bay, WI, Barack Obama spent much of his time attacking John McCain's reform credentials. Yet, two years ago before he was running for president, Barack Obama was saying something quite different when he praised John McCain's reform record: 
Barack Obama: "There Is One Person Who's Been Consistent On Reform Issues, And That's Been John McCain." "I have asked them to prepare a list of additional proposals, additional reforms that they think will strengthen what we already have. And I will make a presentation to Democratic leadership and the caucus about some of those proposals, because I want -- and I know Joe Lieberman wants -- the strongest possible bill. And so they're in the process of doing that now. The second thing I want to mention is, you know, I know that, as I've said before, the Republicans seem to have found religion on this thing. And I'm glad about it. There is one person who's been consistent on reform issues, and that's been John McCain."(Barack Obama, Press Conference, 2/1/06)
