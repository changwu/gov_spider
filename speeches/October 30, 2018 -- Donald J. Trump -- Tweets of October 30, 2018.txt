CNN and others in the Fake News Business keep purposely and inaccurately reporting that I said the 'Media is the Enemy of the People.' Wrong! I said that the 'Fake News (Media) is the Enemy of the People' a very big difference. When you give out false information - not good!Retweets: 34185Favorites: 122099

Check out tweets from last two days. I refer to Fake News Media when mentioning Enemy of the People - but dishonest reporters use only the word 'Media.' The people of our Great Country are angry and disillusioned at receiving so much Fake News. They get it and fully understand!Retweets: 25535Favorites: 93493
