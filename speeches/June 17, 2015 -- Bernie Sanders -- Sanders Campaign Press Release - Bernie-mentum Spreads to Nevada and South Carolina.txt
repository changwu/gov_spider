    Bigger Halls Booked as Crowd Expectations Rise
BURLINGTON, Vt. – Responding to swelling interest, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign moved town meetings set for this weekend to much bigger spaces in Las Vegas and Charleston, South Carolina. The campaign also made contingency plans to accommodate the thousands of people who have indicated they plan to see Sanders on Saturday in Denver.
"The more people get to know about Bernie and what he stands for the more they want to be part of his political revolution," said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. "I think there's just a hunger out in the country for someone to speak to the issues that really affect the lives of middle income and working families," he added.
The events are free and open to the public, which makes turnout projections difficult to calculate precisely, but Weaver said the campaign changed the event sites in Nevada and South Carolina based on indications that much bigger crowds of people plan to attend than were initially anticipated.
Here is the itinerary for this weekend with new locations in Nevada and South Carolina:
Friday, June 19
