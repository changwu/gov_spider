    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Reps. Coburn (R) OK, Waxman (D) CA and 195 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 4807, which would reauthorize appropriations for and amend the programs contained in the Ryan White CARE Act. Since its enactment in 1990, the Ryan White CARE Act has served as a lifeline in providing health care to hundreds of thousands of individuals living with HIV and AIDS in the United States. This year, the Administration requested a $125 million increase in funding for Ryan White CARE Act programs, which represents more than a 340 percent increase in funding for these programs since the beginning of this Administration. The Administration applauds the bipartisan action on H.R. 4807 and urges its swift passage.
While the Administration supports H.R. 4807, it has a few concerns with the legislation and looks forward to working with Congress to address these during Conference action. Specifically, while the Administration supports the expansion of the existing grant program for HIV testing of pregnant women and newborns under section 212, the Administration is concerned about the bill's provision that could establish financial incentives for States to enact mandatory HIV testing laws. In addition, H.R. 4807 authorizes prevention-focused activities, such as partner notification and data collection and surveillance, that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is already carrying out under existing authorities.
The Administration commends the bipartisan efforts of the Commerce Committee in developing this important piece of legislation.
