    "It's now clear. John Kasich is the only Republican who can stop Donald Trump." â€“ Trent Duffy, national spokesman Kasich for America.
A new Quinnipiac University poll published this morning shows Senator Marco Rubio losing to Donald Trump by a whopping 16 points in Florida, previewing a certain death knell for his campaign.
Senator Rubio's stunning weakness in Florida makes it clear that John Kasich is the only Republican who can stop Donald Trump and win the White House in November.
An independent analysis published yesterday by The Washington Post shows that John Kasich defeating Trump in Ohio is likely the only way to stop him. Recent polls show Governor Kasich in a statistical tie with Donald Trump in Ohio and defeating him by a wide-margin in a head-to-head matchup in Ohio.
Just yesterday, Senator Rubio said, "[b]y the time you get to March 15, now you're in some big states like Ohio and Florida that award all their delegates at once. That's where you have to start winning states."
Today, it's become increasingly clear that Marco Rubio can't win in Florida or Ohio. He's down 16 points in Florida and 18 points in Ohio.
