    George Calls Hillary Most Electable
Pennsylvania Superdelegate Bill George announced his support for Hillary Clinton today.
George said Clinton was the best equipped to beat Sen. John McCain in a general election and deliver real solutions to the challenges facing the working families of Pennsylvania and the nation.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to jumpstart the economy and rebuild the middle class," George said. "Working families in Pennsylvania overwhelmingly favored her in last week's primary, and I feel that she is our strongest candidate to carry Pennsylvania in November and win back the White House."
George has been a DNC member since 1996 and is President of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO.
