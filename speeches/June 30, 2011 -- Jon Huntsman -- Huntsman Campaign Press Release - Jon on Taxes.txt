    Many candidates are promising they'd deliver tax relief in order to spur economic growth. Jon's actually done it.
As governor, Jon signed into law the largest tax cut in Utah history. He implemented a tax reform plan that the Cato Institute called "very Reaganesque," which included a flat tax on income. He lowered the sales tax. All told, Jon returned $400 million to the pockets of families and businesses - an accomplishment that earned him the "Taxpayer Advocate" award from the Utah Taxpayers Association.
He also streamlined regulations, reduced waste and embarked on trade missions to open up global markets for Utah businesses. Jon led, and the jobs soon followed. During Gov. Huntsman's tenure, Utah added jobs at a faster rate than every other state in the nation. It was named the best-managed state by Pew Center. And because of Jon's pro-growth, business-friendly policies, Utah's economy expanded at more than triple the national rate and was named the best state for business by Forbes. 

America needs a dose of the same medicine. Today, our nation has the second highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. We have convoluted and confusing regulations. This chokes off investment and stymies growth. That is why Jon has called for bold and sweeping changes to America's tax and regulatory structure.
Just this week, Jon visited Nelson Laboratories in Salt Lake City, which credits its success to Jon's policies as governor. The company managed to grow even through the recession, and now employs 398 workers.
Nelson Labs is a Utah success story. Under Jon's leadership, we can build similar success stories all across this great country.
