    Today marks the one-year anniversary of the horrific al-Shabaab terrorist attack at the Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, which killed 67 innocent people and wounded some 200 others. We extend our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of those killed or injured. The United States and Kenya stand together in the fight against al-Shabaab and like-minded terrorist groups. As a strong and enduring partner, we will continue to support the Kenyan people in their efforts to improve their security and confront terrorism. These cowardly acts of our adversaries will not shake our resolve.
