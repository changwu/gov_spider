    Presidential Determination No. 94-7
Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of Defense
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 552(c)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2348a(c)(2) (the "Act"), I hereby determine that:
(1) as a result of an unforeseen emergency, the provision of assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act in amounts in excess of funds otherwise available for such assistance is important to the national interests of the United States; and
(2) such unforeseen emergency requires the immediate provision of assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act.
I therefore direct the drawdown of commodities and services from the inventory and resources of the Department of Defense of an aggregate value not to exceed $ 13.5 million to maintain Egypt's military readiness and security in view of the dedication of Egyptian resources to the United Nations Operations in Somalia (UNOSOM II).
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to report this determination to the Congress and to arrange for its publication in the Federal Register.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
