    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2007 Budget amendments for International Assistance Programs. The total discretionary budget authority in my FY 2007 Budget would not be increased by these requests.
The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
