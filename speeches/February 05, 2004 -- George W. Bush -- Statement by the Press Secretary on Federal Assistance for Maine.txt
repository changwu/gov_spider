    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Maine and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms, flooding, snow melt, and ice jams on December 10, 2003, through December 31, 2003.
Federal funding is available to the State and eligible local governments in the counties of Franklin, Kennebec, Oxford, Piscataquis, Somerset, and Waldo on a cost-sharing basis for the repair or replacement of public facilities damaged by the severe storms, flooding, snow melt, and ice jams. Federal funding is also available on a cost-share basis for hazard mitigation measures.
Representing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Michael D. Brown, and Under Secretary for Emergency Preparedness and Response, Department of Homeland Security, named James N. Russo as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The Agency said that additional designations may be made later if requested by the State and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
