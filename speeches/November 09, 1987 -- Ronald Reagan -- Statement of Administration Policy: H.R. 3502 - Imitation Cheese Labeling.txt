    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Stenholm (D) Texas and four others)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3502. The current labeling standard for meat food products was developed after an exhaustive public comment process. It provides complete and accurate information to consumers. Absent evidence of widespread dissatisfaction with the current standard, consumer deception, or market disruption, it is inadvisable to mandate by statute a different labeling standard.
