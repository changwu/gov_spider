    I AM pleased with the action of the House and Senate conferees who reported out a strong meat inspection bill today. This bill will help guarantee to every American family that the meat on their table and in their stores and supermarkets will be safe and fit for human consumption.
As early as 1964 I urged an airtight meat inspection bill and the one passed today is a significant step forward and another victory for the American consumer.
