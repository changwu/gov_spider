    On September 30, 1990, consistent with the authority provided me under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701, et seq.), I issued Executive Order No. 12730. In that order, I declared a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States in light of the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.). Because the Export Administration Act has not been renewed by the Congress, the national emergency declared on September 30, 1990, and extended on September 26, 1991, must continue in effect beyond September 30, 1992. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency in order to deal with the threat posed by the unrestricted access of foreign parties to United States goods, technology, and technical data and by the existence of certain boycott practices of foreign nations.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.
George Bush
