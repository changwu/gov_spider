    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today released its slate of delegates and alternate delegates for the New York State Republican Party primary on February 5. This slate demonstrates the overwhelming support for the Mayor from Republican Party leaders across the state.
"Rudy's support is broad and deep here at home, as demonstrated by this list of distinguished leaders from every corner of New York. We look forward to delivering New York for our favorite son, not just on February 5th, but also in November as we elect him as our next President of the United States," said Bill Powers, Co-Chairman of Rudy's New York State Campaign.
"As delegates, we want the entire nation to know that we believe in Rudy because we know firsthand what he can do in office," said Guy Molinari, Co-Chairman of Rudy's New York State Campaign. "Rudy is a proven leader who will deliver real results for all Americans, just like he did for us in New York. This team will continue to work every day to ensure Rudy's victory here at home, and to make sure all Americans see the proven and tested leader that we know in Rudy."
The list of delegates and alternate delegates was submitted on Monday to the State Board of Elections in Albany. It includes an array of elected and political leaders, as well as community leaders, from throughout the state.
