While celebrating the Supreme Court's marriage equality decision this June, something occurred to Clara in West Branch, Iowa: The rainbow Hillary logo would look beautiful on a quilt.

Clara saw an opportunity to bring together a community of quilters and Hillary supporters. So she put out a call on Facebook—and within hours, she was assembling a team to help her with her project.
The first nine people who showed up had never held a needle, but the group quickly formed a close-knit community. They'd meet twice a week to work on the quilt—and as they stitched, they'd read an excerpt from Hard Choices and discuss what a Hillary presidency would mean for the future of our country.
"This is a supporter quilt," says Clara. "It's kind of a way to say to Hillary: ?We've got your back.'"

As the patchwork came together, word of the quilt spread. People from across Iowa added their names to the quilt. National and local media did stories about the quilters—and before long, Hillary was there to meet the team.
And of course, sign her own name.

A few months later, Hillary's husband added his signature, too.

The quilt now lives at Clara's home in West Branch, making appearances at organizing events, town halls, and house parties.

Clara has big dreams for the future of the quilt. She's hoping it'll end up in a presidential library ... or 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
(Sew good.)
