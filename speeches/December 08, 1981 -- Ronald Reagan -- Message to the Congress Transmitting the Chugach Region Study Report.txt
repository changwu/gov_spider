    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 1430 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), I hereby transmit the Chugach Region Study. The participants to the study failed to agree upon a settlement of the land claims of Chugach Natives, Incorporated. However, the Chugach Natives, Incorporated, may elect to satisfy their land entitlements pursuant to existing law under Section 1429 of ANILCA, or pursuant to land exchanges in accordance with a federal proposal dated November 13, 1981.
