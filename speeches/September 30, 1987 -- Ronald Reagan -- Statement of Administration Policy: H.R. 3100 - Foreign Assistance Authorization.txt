    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. Fascell (D) Florida)
If H.R. 3100 is presented to the President, his senior advisers will recommend veto.
The bill authorizes appropriations below the levels requested by the administration for several important foreign assistance programs, and attaches numerous earmarks, ceilings, limitations and other constraints to the implementation of the administration's foreign assistance programs. The combination of the funding shortfalls and extensive restrictions impedes continuation of existing programs and the ability to respond to changing foreign policy challenges.
In particular, these restrictions:

— Restrain our ability to carry out normal foreign assistance relationships with security assistance recipients that also wish independently to support the Nicaraguan Democratic Resistance. These restrictions also raise constitutional problems.
— Earmark assistance for particular countries and programs in excess of the administration's request while at the same time authorizing a total amount for the earmarked program which is far less than requested. The result will mean substantial cuts in assistance for countries with which the United States shares significant foreign policy and humanitarian interests.
— Contain numerous examples of micro-management of the foreign assistance program, compounding an already complex administration of foreign assistance activities and adding inevitable delay and inefficiencies in the provision of assistance.
— Contain provisions which will cause serious harm to our bilateral relations with strategically important allies and friends. 
The bill intrudes substantially upon the President's ability to carry out his foreign assistance program and, particularly in the context of a two-year authorization, to respond to new circumstances, and therefore leaves the administration with no choice but to oppose its passage.
