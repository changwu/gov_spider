    From Kevin Sheekey, Bloomberg 2020 Campaign Manager:
"Last night, on CNN, when pressed on whether he would disclose more information on his health, Sen. Sanders responded, "I don't think we will, no." This morning, his campaign is spreading an absolute lie that Mike had heart attacks. It's completely false.
"The truth is: After a positive stress test in his doctor's office at Johns Hopkins University in 2000, Mike had two coronary stents placed. He quickly told the FAA, consistent with the rules for any pilot, and this information has been public for years. The Bloomberg 2020 campaign released more information about his outstanding health soon after he entered the race.
"Here's what we know about Sen. Sanders: In October 2019, he had a medical incident in Las Vegas. He didn't tell the public for days and the full details have never been released. Now his campaign staff is spreading lies about Mike Bloomberg.
"Facts matter. This isn't the way to defeat Donald Trump in November."
