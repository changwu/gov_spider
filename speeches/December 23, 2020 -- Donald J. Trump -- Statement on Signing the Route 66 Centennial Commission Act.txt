    Today, I have signed into law S. 1014, the "Route 66 Centennial Commission Act" (the "Act"). The Act provides for a Commission made up of individuals appointed by the President, in certain cases based on the recommendations of Members of Congress, with responsibility to conduct a study on ways to honor the centennial anniversary of Route 66 and to provide recommendations exclusively to the Congress. To avoid concerns regarding the separation of powers, my Administration will consider this Commission to be located in the legislative branch. I also expect that the General Services Administration (GSA) will be able to fulfill the intent of section 7(d) that the GSA provide to the Commission, on request and on a reimbursable basis, the administrative support services necessary for the Commission to carry out the Act. Consistent with the separation of powers, however, a directive from a legislative branch entity cannot be understood as binding on an executive branch entity like the GSA.
