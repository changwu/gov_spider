    I am pleased to nominate General Michael E. Ryan to be Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force. General Ryan currently serves as Commander, U.S. Air Forces Europe, and Commander, Allied Air Forces Central Europe. He brings to the job of Chief of Staff broad operational and joint experience as well as proven leadership ability and a deep concern for the men and women of the U.S. Air Force.
During his distinguished career, General Ryan served a combat tour in the Vietnam war and commanded a fighter squadron and fighter wing. As Commander, Allied Air Forces Southern Europe, he directed the highly successful airstrikes in Bosnia that convinced the warring factions they could not achieve their aims through military means, which contributed to our efforts to convene the negotiations that resulted in the Dayton accords.
General Ryan assumes the post of Chief of Staff as the U.S. Air Force proudly celebrates 50 years of dedicated service to our Nation in war and peace. With General Ryan as Chief of Staff, I am confident that the Air Force will continue its tradition of excellence as it enters the 21st century.
