    Hey, listen, it's great to be back in Findlay. We want to come down and shake a few hands, but thanks for this welcome. We've had a great trip across, all the way from Columbus through Marysville, Arlington. Here we are in Findlay, and on we go. But I'll tell you something: This is a great part of the United States. Do not let Bill Clinton tell you that this is a nation in decline. We are the best in the entire world. We can solve every problem we've got.
Here's a guy that's got a good idea. He's saying, "Clean House!" Let's clean House in the Capitol, and let's get this country going forward again. Clean the House. That's exactly right. Those guys have been in control of the House for 38 years, and it's time to clean House, get rid of them and get a good team in like your Representatives right here from Findlay. We need more.
It's been a wonderful day. By the way, don't vote for a man that's going to raise your taxes and raise spending all at the same time. Do not put Governor Clinton in that White House.
One last word, and then we'll come down, Barbara and I, down to say hello down there. But one last word. I see these young people here today, and I take great pride in the fact that they go to bed at night with a lot less fear of nuclear weapons. Bill Clinton says foreign affairs don't mean anything. I say world peace means an awful lot.
Now let's get this country moving by less taxes and less spending, less regulation, more emphasis on strengthening the American family and less emphasis on spending and taxing, like Clinton and Gore want.
Thank you all very, very much.
