Clinton's vision would mandate workers show proof of insurance to get a job

McLean, VA - Senator Fred Thompson has a new video message today at www.Fred08.com calling Hillary Clinton's new health insurance proposal "enough to make you sick."
On Tuesday, September 18th, the Associated Press reported, "[Hillary Clinton] said she could envision a day when 'you have to show proof to your employer that you're insured as a part of the job interview -- like when your kid goes to school and has to show proof of vaccination,' but said such details would be worked out through negotiations with Congress."
In his video message, Thompson asks, "What is it that makes liberals think the best way to help somebody is to punish them?"
Thompson continues, "I understand Hillary Clinton has just acknowledged that her new health care plan could require somebody to actually prove they've got insurance before they can get a job. You know, a job - the thing that would help you get health care. That kind of mindset is that the government knows best and if you don't agree, then you're just going to have to pay for it, one way or the other. The best way to improve the best health care in the world, which is what we've got right here in the United States, is to expand choice, not punishment.
"To some Democrats, choice to them is like a cross is to a vampire - they don't like to see it coming down the road. Hillary says, don't worry about it - the punishment - because the exact punitive measures they'd come up with would be worked out by congress. That's a thought scary enough to make you sick."
