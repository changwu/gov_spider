    Kristine Gebbie, the first National AIDS Policy Coordinator, served ably and with dedication as a member of our administration. With her help, the Federal Government finally began exercising real leadership in response to this terrible epidemic. Working together, we boosted funding for the Ryan White Care Act, increased resources for prevention and research, sped the research and approval process for new drugs, and required every Federal employee to receive comprehensive workplace education. While more needs to be done—and more will be done—to fight AIDS, Kristine Gebbie's service as the Nation's first AIDS Policy Coordinator gave this vitally important battle a lift when one was desperately needed and long overdue.
