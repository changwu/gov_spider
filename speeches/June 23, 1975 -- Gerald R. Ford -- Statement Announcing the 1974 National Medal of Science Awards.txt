    It is with great pleasure that I announce the thirteen 1974 recipients of the National Medal of Science. This medal is the Nation's highest award for distinguished achievements in science, mathematics, and engineering development.
An examination of the winners' accomplishments demonstrates the importance of science and engineering to the Nation. Our. understanding of the universe and of man, mankind's ability to utilize research to improve health, and new technological advances in communication, transportation, and industry are all illustrated by the roles of the distinguished scientists and engineers who will receive this medal.
The National Medal of Science was established by the 86th Congress in 1959 to be awarded to individuals deserving of special recognition by reason of their outstanding contributions to knowledge in the physical, biological, mathematical, or engineering sciences. Since 1962, the medal has been awarded to 89 distinguished scientists and engineers.
During the past year, the President's Committee on the National Medal of Science received 204 nominations of distinguished and able individuals from the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering, from various professional societies, from colleges and universities, and from individual members of these organizations. I was assisted in the selection of recipients by this Committee chaired through 1974 by Dr. Charles P. Slichter.
I look forward to meeting with these distinguished Americans at the White House in the near future.
