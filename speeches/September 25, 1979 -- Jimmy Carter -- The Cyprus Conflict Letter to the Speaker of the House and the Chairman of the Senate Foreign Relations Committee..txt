    To Speaker Tip O'Neill (To Chairman Frank Church)
In accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-384, I am submitting the following report on progress made during the past 60 days toward the conclusion of a negotiated solution of the Cyprus problem.
In my last Cyprus report to the Congress, dated July 25, I noted that UN Secretary General Waldheim and his staff were seeking to bring the two parties back to the conference table. Unfortunately, the recess in the intercommunal talks continues, largely because the two sides still have major differences both with regard to their approach to this negotiation and to the content of a final settlement of the Cyprus problem.
The UN Secretary General, through his staff, is continuing to consult informally with the parties. He has had some success in creating a foundation on which the talks might resume. We are giving strong and continued support to this effort. We have frequently discussed the situation on Cyprus in a frank manner with all parties, reminding them that negotiation is preferable to stalemate, and that their broad interests would be served by a return to the conference table. Other interested third parties have made similar points to them.
Despite the difficulties, we continue to believe that a way can be found to end the present impasse and to permit the two sides to commence a serious negotiation of the Cyprus problem.
This Administration will continue to strive for progress in that direction. In pursuit of this goal, we shall remain in close touch with the United Nations, the parties to the Cyprus dispute, and our close European allies.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
