    On behalf of the people of the United States, I offer sympathy and condolences to the families of those murdered and to those injured by the terrorists in Colombia. I condemn these heinous acts. The terrorists in Colombia have made their goals clear: to kill the aspirations of the Colombian people for a free, prosperous, and democratic state. Through violence against innocents, the terrorists seek the destruction of the democratically elected Government of Colombia. The United States stands with the people of Colombia in their struggle against terror, and we support President Uribe's efforts to bring the murderers to justice.
