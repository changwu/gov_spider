    "Four years ago in Orlando, Candidate Obama claimed he had a plan to help the middle class. But, after years of disappointing progress, it's clear middle-class families aren't better off under President Obama: wages are lower, household costs are higher, and the next generation will be forced to pay off a skyrocketing national debt. As president, Mitt Romney will deliver a new direction and new pro-growth policies that get all Americans back to work." — Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
During A 2008 Campaign Speech In Orlando, Candidate Obama Claimed Flat Wages And More Debt Cause "Our Economy As A Whole" To Suffer:
Candidate Obama, In Orlando Exactly Four Years Ago: "When Wages Are Flat, Prices Are Rising, And More And More Americans Are Mired In Debt, Our Economy As A Whole Suffers." OBAMA: "That's the truth at the heart of your Opportunity Compact - that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street and a struggling Main Street. That when wages are flat, prices are rising, and more and more Americans are mired in debt, our economy as a whole suffers. Our competitiveness as a nation suffers. Our children's future suffers." (Senator Barack Obama, Remarks, Orlando, FL, 8/2/08)

Average Weekly Wages Declined In 2011, "One Of Only Five Declines Since The Category Was Created In 1978." "Unemployment ebbs and flows, but one measure of the nation's economic health, average weekly wages, rarely dips. Until now. In the latest demonstration of the struggling economy that threatens President Obama's reelection, average weekly wages fell in 2011, one of only five declines since the category was created in 1978 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics."
