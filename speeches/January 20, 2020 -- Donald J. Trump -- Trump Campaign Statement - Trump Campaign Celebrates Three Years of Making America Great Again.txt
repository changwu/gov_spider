    On the third anniversary of President Trump's Inauguration, Lara Trump, Senior Advisor to Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. issued the following statement.
"As President Donald Trump took the oath of office three years ago today, our country joined him on a bold and incredible journey to Make America Great Again. Today, we celebrate the amazing progress Americans have made under President Trump's innovative and tireless leadership that has produced: record-low unemployment, rising wages, new trade deals, and a strong and growing economy; a revitalized military defending American interests in the world; a more just nation thanks to criminal justice reform and proper care for our veterans; and so much more.
The Democrats have stopped at nothing to obstruct and try to diminish President Trump's accomplishments--but we have his back, just as he's always fighting for us. Today, as we celebrate the third anniversary of his inauguration, we are redoubling our efforts to ensure that we Keep America Great with four more years of President Donald Trump!"
