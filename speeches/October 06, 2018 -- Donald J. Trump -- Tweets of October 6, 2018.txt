Women for Kavanaugh and many others who support this very good man are gathering all over Capital Hill in preparation for a 3-5 P.M. VOTE. It is a beautiful thing to see - and they are not paid professional protesters who are handed expensive signs. Big day for America!Retweets: 15505Favorites: 56869

I have asked Steve Daines our great Republican Senator from Montana to attend his daughter Annie's wedding rather than coming to today's vote. Steve was ready to do whatever he had to but we had the necessary number. To the Daines Family congratulations-have a wonderful day!Retweets: 28008Favorites: 156497

I applaud and congratulate the U.S. Senate for confirming our GREAT NOMINEE Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. Later today I will sign his Commission of Appointment and he will be officially sworn in. Very exciting!Retweets: 62475Favorites: 262765

The crowd in front of the U.S. Supreme Court is tiny looks like about 200 people (& most are onlookers) - that wouldn't even fill the first couple of rows of our Kansas Rally or any of our Rallies for that matter! The Fake News Media tries to make it look sooo big & it's not!Retweets: 37880Favorites: 162935
