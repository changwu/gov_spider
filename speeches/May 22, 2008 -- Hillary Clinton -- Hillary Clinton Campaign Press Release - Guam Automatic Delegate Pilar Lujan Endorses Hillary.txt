    Guam Democratic Party Chair and automatic delegate Pilar Lujan announced her support for Hillary Clinton today.
"After taking a close look at the candidates in this race, I was more impressed by Senator Clinton's ability to meet the challenges of the presidency: end the war, re-invigorate the economy, and provide universal health care," said Lujan. "When she becomes the first woman president, she will think of the people of Guam and their aspirations."
Lujan was elected as the Guam Democratic Party Chair on May 3, 2008. She is a former Guam Senator, served as Guam Democratic Party Chair from 1995-1997, and is the current President of the Government of Guam Association of Retired Persons. She is also a longtime educator.
