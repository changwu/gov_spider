    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed requests for FY 2003 budget amendments for the Departments of Health and Human Services and Transportation, and for International Assistance Programs.
These amendments continue my commitment to provide necessary resources to enhance transportation security, to assist Israel and the people of the West Bank and Gaza, and to fight the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS among developing countries.
The details of these requests are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with her comments and observations.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
