There exists a power vacuum in the Middle East created by America failing to provide leadership in the regions of the world that needs it most. As Commander-in-Chief, I will restore American leadership around the world and implement a real strategy to protect our nation and put radical Islam in a box. This will require regional partnerships, a sustained effort and rebuilding our own military and intelligence capabilities which are being degraded by severe budget cuts. As president, these will be my priorities.
