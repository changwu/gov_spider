    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revised - LA)
(House)(Dingell (D) MI, Waxman (D) CA, and Wyden (D) OR)
The major provisions of H.R. 5150 are intended to establish uniform regulation of clinical laboratories and assure the quality of clinical testing. While the Administration believes it could accomplish these goals administratively — and published a proposed rule on August 5, 1988, in the Federal Register to do so — the Administration would not object to enactment of the bill. As reported by the Energy and Commerce Committee, H.R. 5150 is compatible with the proposed rule, and affords the Secretary of Health and Human Services considerable flexibility in carrying out regulatory reform of clinical laboratories.
