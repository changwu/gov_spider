The president's plan to strengthen our nation's infrastructure — including modernizing roads, bridges, tunnels and airports — represents an outstanding opportunity for Americans to build their career while building a stronger foundation for our nation.

I joined President Trump last week at the operating engineers' union training facility in Richfield, Ohio. Their apprenticeship programs are impressive.
