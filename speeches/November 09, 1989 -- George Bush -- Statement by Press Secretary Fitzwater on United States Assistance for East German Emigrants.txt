    The United States is responding urgently to a request from the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany for assistance in accommodating the continuing influx of East Germans into the Federal Republic. The commander of U.S. Air Forces, Europe, has offered temporary housing for up to 6 months in 3 facilities. Processing has begun at a U.S. Air Force contingency hospital at Donaueschingen in the Black Forest.
Additionally, the commander, U.S. Army, Europe, headquartered in Heidelberg, has inventoried all available facilities and established a task force, which is in direct contact with the Federal Government in Bonn. The President has instructed all U.S. military authorities in the Federal Republic, as well as our Embassy in Bonn, to make available to the FRG all possible assistance.
The President salutes the Federal Republic for opening its doors to so many seeking to resettle in the West, and pledges our full support and assistance.
