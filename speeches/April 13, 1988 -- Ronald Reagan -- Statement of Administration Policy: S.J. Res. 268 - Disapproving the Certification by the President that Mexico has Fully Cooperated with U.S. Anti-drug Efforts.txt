    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Sen. Wilson (R) California and nine others)
The Administration opposes S.J. Res. 268 and, if it is presented to the President, his senior advisers would recommend a veto.
On February 28, 1988, the President certified that certain major narcotics producing and/or major narcotics transit countries, including Mexico, have cooperated fully with the United States, or taken adequate steps on their own to control narcotics production, trafficking, and money laundering.
Disapproval of the President's certification would be seen as a hostile act, thus jeopardizing many joint U.S.-Mexico efforts, including our fight against drugs. In addition, decertification would result in requiring the United States to vote against Mexico for future loans requested from international development banks, which would inhibit Mexico's economic growth and development.
