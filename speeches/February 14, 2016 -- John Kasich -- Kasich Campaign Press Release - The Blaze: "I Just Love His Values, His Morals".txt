    SMAULDIN, S.C. — In his quest to win over South Carolinians, Ohio Gov. John Kasich scored big Saturday afternoon — at least in the Upstate — with his secret weapon, former Clemson University quarterback Tajh Boyd.
"From a personal level, I feel like he's the most approachable person that we have running right now as a candidate," Boyd told TheBlaze in an interview prior to Kasich's presidential campaign rally Saturday. "I just love his values, his morals. In New Hampshire he talked about not necessarily the government changing things, but we the people, our hearts changing things, and that's something I can agree with. I think [South Carolinians] can agree with."
Boyd continued to commend South Carolina for "coming together" throughout multiple tragedies and hardships in the past year, including massive, deadly flooding and the Charleston church massacre.
"I think that's who [Kasich] is," Boyd said of the unification. "I think that's what he wanted for Ohio; I think that's what he'd want for South Carolina. I think that he would be an unbelievable candidate."
Because of his popularity, Boyd coming out to support Kasich could make a big difference to South Carolina voters.
