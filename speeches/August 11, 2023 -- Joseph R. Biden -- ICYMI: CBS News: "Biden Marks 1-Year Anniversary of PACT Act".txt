    Yesterday, CBS News marked the one-year anniversary of the signing of the PACT Act into law by President Biden, enacting the most significant expansion of benefits and services for toxic exposed veterans in more than 30 years. Named in honor of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson, a decorated combat medic who died from a rare form of lung cancer, this historic legislation is delivering timely benefits and services to veterans—across all generations—who have been impacted by toxic exposures while serving our country.
On the anniversary yesterday, the President joined veterans and their families at the George E. Wahlen Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. He discussed how this historic, bipartisan legislation has delivered lifesaving health care and benefits to more than 340,000 veterans and survivors.
Ed O'Keefe shared the story of Sargent Dan Nevins, Iraq war veteran who was diagnosed with colon cancer, who signed up for the PACT Act, saying: "Should I succumb to this disease, my family will be taken care of, and that is powerful. And it's a testimony to our nation standing behind our warriors."
In the past year, the Administration has helped veterans in every state and territory receive the services and care they deserve.
