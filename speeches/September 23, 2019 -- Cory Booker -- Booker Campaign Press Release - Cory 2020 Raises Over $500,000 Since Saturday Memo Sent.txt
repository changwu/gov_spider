    Cory 2020 is nearly 30% toward $1.7 million goal after Day 2 of critical 10 day period
In Saturday memo, campaign warned it will not be able to build organization necessary to win without a change in fundraising trajectory by Sept. 30
Newark, NJ â€” As of 9am ET this morning, Cory 2020 has raised $508,629 since alerting supporters in an urgent memo on Saturday morning that the campaign did not see a legitimate long-term path forward in the presidential race without a fundraising surge before September 30th. Saturday and Sunday marked the biggest online fundraising weekend of the campaign to-date.
"We're lifted by the influx of support for Cory's campaign for president -- even from individuals who haven't made up their minds who to support in this race but who believe Cory's voice is vital," said Cory 2020 Campaign Manager Addisu Demissie. "We still have a long way to go over the next 8 days to reach our $1.7 million goal -- but the past two days have shown the power of people rallying together to take on tough challenges. It's the same spirit that will beat Donald Trump and change this country."
The campaign had raised over $470,000 as of day-end yesterday, but crossed the $500,000 threshold thanks to overnight and morning donations from supporters.
