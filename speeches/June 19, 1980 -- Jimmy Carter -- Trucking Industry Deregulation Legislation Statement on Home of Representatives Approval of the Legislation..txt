    The House of Representatives took a major step today in the fight against inflation by passing comprehensive legislation to reform economic regulation of the trucking industry. By increasing competition and ending irrational regulatory restrictions, the bill will save shippers and consumers billions of dollars each year and conserve hundreds of millions of gallons of fuel.
I commend the bipartisan efforts of Chairmen Harold Johnson and James Howard, and ranking minority members William Harsha and Bud Shuster in achieving the rapid passage of this important measure. I urge the House and Senate to resolve any differences promptly so that the benefits of this legislation can take effect as soon as possible.
