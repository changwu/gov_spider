VP Travel Pool #5 Rolling to DMZ
Motorcade rolling to the DMZ at 2:17 pm. It's supposed to be an hour to 90 min drive.
FYI we just received a briefing on what to expect and were told we would not have cell service/wifi for a while, so I won't be able to send pool reports for a bit. We are also getting on AF2 right after to head back to DC, so will try my best to capture it all and send when possible in that window before departure.

VP Travel Pool #6 a. DMZ arrival
VP's motorcade arrived at the DMZ at 3:06 pm. Pool set up immediately after in the dining facility here for VP's meet and greet with service members.
Some potential news: Harris told one of the service members she was going to the Philippines later this year. Double checking with her staff.
She walked into the room at 3:23 pm with a big hello to service members, some of whom had brought their young kids to meet the VP. She asked one of the service members from GA if he had texted his family to see how they were doing with the hurricane. She handed challenger coins as she shook hands.
She asked another service member why he was hiding in the back and shook his hand. She asked a few of them, "tell me about you" as she shook their hands.
She asked one of the little girls to shake her hand for a challenger coin but she was too shy so she gave it to her mother and explained what it was.
VP said she was here to reinforce the relationships the US has. "Every morning I start our reading the PDB and it's about hot spots," she said, adding she frequently talks to the president about their priorities and the troops abroad.
"You make our commitments real, so know how grateful and thankful we are. I know it's not always easy, but it makes a huge difference in the lives of many people you might never meet."
VP signed one of the bricks on the walls of the facility 3:34 and said "honored to be part of the tradition."
The brick had been marked with a white piece of paper around it and sharpie resting on the table below.
Pool spotted several photos of Trump's visit to the DMZ all around the dining facility.
Moving to next stop in a bus at 3:36 pm.
(Btw I seem to have cell service for now, so will keep sending while I can)
On background from a White House official: 
Today, as part of her trip to the Republic of Korea (ROK), the Vice President will visit the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Nearly 70 years since the Korean Armistice, the visit will underscore the strength of the U.S.-ROK Alliance, and the United States' commitment to stand beside the ROK in the face of any threats posed by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
While at the DMZ, Vice President Harris will meet with U.S. service members at the Camp Bonifas Dining Facility, visit Observation Post (OP) Ouellette, and tour T2 Conference Row. She will receive operation briefings while on site.
The DMZ is approximately 160 miles long and 2.5 miles wide. It was established to serve as a buffer zone between the ROK and DPRK under the Korean Armistice Agreement of 1953.

VP Travel Pool #6b DMZ observation
Pool took a bus up a steep hill to the observation deck. We were given a blue arm band with "Press" written on it.
Harris got to the post at 3:49 pm and used the binoculars to look at out to the NK side as she was briefed on the area with the US and South Korean flags in the backdrop.
The briefer told her about the two villages that fall within the DMZ. Harris asked for the population of the villages. When the briefer responded, Harris laughed and said, "When's the last time you took a census? Babies get born, things change."
Another briefer then pointed VP to the demarcation line/border. The briefer also pointed to the various guard posts in the area.
"It's so close," she said. "It's 50m away," the briefer responded.
Harris also talked to the briefers about space at one point, bringing up images from the Webb telescope. "it's the most humbling thing you have ever seen, galaxies we didn't know existed, so when we think we've seen everythingâ€¦" she said with a laugh.
Harris then went down the steps from the post and met with another group of service members, who were lined up and wearing helmets and more of their combat kits.
Pool was moved away at 4:06 pm.

VP Travel Pool #6c Harris T2/ shouted q
VP entered the T2 conference room, in one of the blue buildings, at 4:15 pm.
As she walked in, she looked at the pool on the other side and said, "So the press is on the North Korean side, right?"
The center table in the conference room is divided at the center based on the border. We are on the other side of the table.
"You stole part of my speech," her briefer in the room said. They both laughed. He briefed her on some of the history of the room, the negotiations that took place in the room, and how the communication happens between both sides at the DMZ.
Harris nodded her head as she listened.
"I hope you understand our function now," he said, as he wrapped up.
Harris asked a few questions, including what is the process for preparing for high level talks and the average delayed response from the other side. Briefer said some responses on routine items take as little as 30 mins.
"We also have a megaphone," he said. "So it's high tech," she responded.
"This is historic," she said as she started walking out. "We've stepped into history."
She then took a question from pool responding to NK's nuclear tests (quote below) before going out to look at the building that operates as the main part of the North Korean side of the DMZ behind the blue buildings on conference row.
Pool spotted a guard in a hazmat suit peering out of a building. Another guard came out, also in a hazmat suit, and after a few mins, they closed the curtains.
"It is clearly a provocation and it is meant we believe to destabilize the region and we're taking it seriously, and everyone should," she said.
"And that is one of the reasons why the visit that I have made to Korea, to the Republic of Korea is important because it is a statement about the strength of our alliance and our dedication, the United states's dedication, to this alliance both in terms of security, American stability for the region and for the Indo-pacific as a whole."
Pool now getting in place for Harris remarks.

VP Travel Pool #7 Harris DMZ remarks
VP Harris walked out to the podium at 4:57 pm, with helicopters in the background. She put on her sunglasses for the remarks.
Otter here
https://otter.ai/u/SrCajFtTO2KzSZzZOn_6lXaFzvU
Pool was rushed to helicopters to get to air base. Didn't see Harris take off. We will be wheels up shortly.
Opening:
"Here you see at the DMZ US soldiers serving shoulder to shoulder with soldiers from the Republic of Korea.
They are training together they are committed to working in solidarity around a shared purpose and goal, which is to maintain the security and the stability of this region of the world.
I cannot state enough that commitment of the United States to the defense of the Republic of Korea is ironclad."
On nuclear threat:
"With regard to the threats posed by the DPRK as I told President noon, we are aligned on this issue."
"The DPRK has the ballistic missile launch program, apparently, including just yesterday and are destabilizing the peace and security of this region. Our shared goal, the United States and the Republic of Korea is a complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."
" And we are reminded that the alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea stands ready to address any contingency. The commitment of the United States to the defense of the Republic of Korea I will report is iron clad."
"The DMZ also reminds us of the dramatically different hat that the two sides from those early days. Over the past seven decades. It has been clear in the south, we see a thriving democracy, innovation, economic prosperityâ€¦ In the north, we see a brutal dictatorship, rampant human rights violations and an unlawful weapons program that threatens peace and stability. The United States and the world seek a stable and peaceful Korean peninsula where the DPRK is no longer a threat. We will continue to work alongside our partners here and everywhere as is necessary to maintain stability and peace in this region."
