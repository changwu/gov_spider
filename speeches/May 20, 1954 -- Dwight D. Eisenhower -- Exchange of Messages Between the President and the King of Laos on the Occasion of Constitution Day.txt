His Majesty Sisavang Vong
King of Laos
Luang Prabang, Laos
To Your Majesty and to the people of Laos on the occasion of Constitution Day, I am delighted to send the best wishes of the people of the United States.
It is our fervent hope that your sovereignty and independence will be strengthened and preserved. I am convinced that the forces of freedom, working in unison, will repulse the Communist imperialism that would enslave your Kingdom and your people.
In this crucial struggle of all free men against those who would reduce Laos to the status of a satellite of world Communism, I know that Your Majesty and the people of Laos will continue to provide an heroic and inspiring example for all.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
