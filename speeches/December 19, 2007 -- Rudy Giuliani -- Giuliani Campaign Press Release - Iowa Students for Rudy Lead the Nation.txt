    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced the leadership of the National Students for Rudy coalition. Over 115 Students for Rudy chapters have been organized at colleges and universities across the country, with thousands of members actively campaigning for Mayor Giuliani.
With over 450 members, the University of Iowa's Students for Rudy Chapter has grown to the largest chapter in the country. Given the success in Iowa City, University of Iowa Students for Rudy Chairman Jimmy Centers has been named National Co-Chair of Students for Rudy.
"Students have great respect for Mayor Giuliani because of his tested leadership in times of crisis and his vision for America," said Centers. "We are excited to have many students returning to campus for caucus night as well as others who will volunteer for Rudy in their home precincts around the state."
"Rudy Giuliani is a unique candidate that has been able to motivate young voters unlike any other Republican candidate," said Rick Wiley, Giuliani's Deputy National Political Director. "These students are invaluable to our grassroots organization and we have been impressed with the support that has been generated at schools across the country."
