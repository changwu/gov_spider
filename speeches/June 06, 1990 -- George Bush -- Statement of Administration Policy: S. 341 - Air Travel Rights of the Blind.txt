    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Hollings (D) South Carolina and 32 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of S. 341. Since Committee consideration of this issue, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a rule allowing only passengers able to perform the basic safety functions necessary in emergency evacuations to sit in the exit rows of an aircraft. The rule applies neutrally to all persons, based solely on their ability to perform these functions. The rule does not discriminate against anyone, rather it maximizes the likelihood that people sitting in exit rows will be able to perform important safety functions quickly and efficiently.
