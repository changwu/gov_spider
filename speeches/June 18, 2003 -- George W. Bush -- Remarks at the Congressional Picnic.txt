    The President. Listen, thank you all for coming. Laura and I and Dick and Lynne are so happy you all are here. And we're really happy it's not raining. [Laughter]
Audience member. [Inaudible]
The President. I bet you are.
First, we're so thrilled that Dennis Edwards and the Temptations Review has joined us tonight. We expect to see some serious rug-cutting or, in this case, grass-cutting. [Laughter]
We do want to thank the families who are here. We're so grateful for the wives and husbands of the Members of the Senate and the Congress for being so patient with your loved ones and for supporting them in their service to the United States of America. We want to thank the sons and daughters as well for understanding your dad and your mom are serving something greater than themselves in life.
I want to thank all the Members of Congress from both political parties for doing such a fine job on behalf of the United States of America. You know what I know: We're blessed to live in a great country. And one of the things that makes us great is we've got tremendous values. We believe in freedom, respect for others, personal responsibility. And today is a day for us all to come together and to celebrate those fantastic values and for us—for Laura and me and for Dick and Lynne—to thank you on behalf of a grateful nation for serving our country so well.
May God bless you and your families, and may God continue to bless the United States of America.
Enjoy yourselves.
