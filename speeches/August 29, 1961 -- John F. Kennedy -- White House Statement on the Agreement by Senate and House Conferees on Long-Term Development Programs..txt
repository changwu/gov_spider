    THE COMPROMISE which the Senate-House conferees have worked out is wholly satisfactory. It gives the United States government authority to make commitments for long-term development programs with reasonable assurance that these commitments will be met. In providing five years of substantial authorization, the conferees have recognized the magnitude of the need in the developing countries. In ensuring specific authority to enter into commitments with these countries the conferees have recognized the necessity for this government to give assurance that assistance will be forthcoming over a period of years.
The agreement reached by the conferees today is an important decision both for the United States and the Free World.
