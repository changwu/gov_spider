    I am pleased that today the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) elected Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard as their new chair for the 106th Congress. Representative Roybal-Allard has already established a record of distinction, serving her constituents in the 33d District of California and as a national leader in the areas of education, financial services, homeownership, and women's and children's rights.
I commend outgoing CHC Chair Xavier Becerra for his outstanding leadership of the caucus, and I am confident that Representative Roybal-Allard will be an excellent advocate for the caucus and the entire Latino community. I look forward to working with Chairwoman Roybal-Allard and the entire Congressional Hispanic Caucus during the 106th Congress.
