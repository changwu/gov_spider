Wayne Grudem is one of America's most legendary evangelical theologians.
So it's big news that Grudem, a professor of theology and biblical studies at Phoenix Seminary, is backing Marco for President.
Big gets for Rubio: Wayne Grudem and Rick Warren. That's the @EricTeetsel magic right there.

Grudem is already serving on Marco's Religious Liberty Advisory Board, alongside a number of other prominent Christian leaders.
Now he's also offering his personal support:
[Grudem] directed The Christian Post to a statement he issued last week in support of Fla. Sen. Rubio, calling him "a reliable, thoughtful, articulate conservative who seems to me more knowledgeable than any other candidate on the important issues facing the nation."
"Rubio is a winsome, likable candidate who has the best chance of soundly defeating Hillary Clinton. He is equally fluent in Spanish and English, which will be a huge asset with Hispanic voters in the general election," stated Grudem.
"He does not come across as harsh but as reasonable and thoughtful in his defense of conservative positions. And his own words about his personal faith seem to me, as an Evangelical, to indicate a genuine belief in Christ as his own Savior and Lord."

Team Marco is honored to welcome Grudem aboard!
