    Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Lisa Monaco called President Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi of Yemen today to commend recent steps taken to reform Yemen's economy, enable the Yemeni government to better address the needs of its citizens, and to reinforce U.S. support for Yemen's political transition and our partnership against al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). In support of Yemen's courageous efforts, Ms. Monaco highlighted the U.S. contribution of $30 million to Yemen's Social Welfare Fund and a broader commitment to working with Yemen and the international community to support Yemen's economic reform and development. She also praised President Hadi's continued leadership in bringing together all parties to peacefully participate in Yemen's political transition process, as envisioned in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Initiative and recommendations of the National Dialogue. Ms. Monaco made clear that the United States, in partnership with the international community, will stand firmly behind President Hadi, the Yemeni government, and the people of Yemen against any attempts to derail the transition process through violence. Finally, Ms. Monaco offered condolences for the brutal murder of 18 Yemeni soldiers by AQAP in Hadramawt on August 8 and underscored the United States' continued commitment to partner with the Yemeni government in combating AQAP.
