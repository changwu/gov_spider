    President Bush will welcome Portuguese Prime Minister Durao Barroso to the White House on June 6, 2003 for a meeting and working luncheon. Portugal has stood from the first hour among America's closest allies in the war on terrorism and the effort to bring peace and democracy to Iraq, and was host of the March 16 "Atlantic Summit" in the Azores. Portugal is a valuable founding member of NATO with a deep-rooted commitment to transatlantic cooperation.
