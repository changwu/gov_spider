North Korea fired off some small weapons which disturbed some of my people and others but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me & also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual & worse. Perhaps that's sending me a signal?Retweets: 21619Favorites: 102530
