    Today, the President signed an Executive Order which takes note of Côte d'Ivoire's extraordinary progress since the end of its civil war in 2011, in particular its successful October 2015 presidential election and improvements managing the flow of arms and combating illicit trafficking of natural resources. The United States congratulates the people of Côte d'Ivoire for their resilience and commitment to a future of peace, democracy, and inclusive prosperity. Accordingly, the President has terminated the national emergency declared with respect to Côte d'Ivoire pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act in Executive Order 13396 of February 10, 2006 and lifted the economic sanctions imposed pursuant to that Order and related regulations.
Côte d'Ivoire has taken important steps to strengthen its governing and economic institutions and reconcile the differences that led to war. Challenges remain as the country continues to tackle difficult land reform issues and works to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are felt throughout the Ivoirian population. Côte d'Ivoire and its people are ready to overcome these challenges, and the United States will remain a steadfast partner as the Ivoirian people continue the vital work of national reconciliation and security sector reform. The United States celebrates this milestone with Côte d'Ivoire and looks forward to welcoming many more achievements as the country retakes its place as an economic engine and vibrant democracy in West Africa.
