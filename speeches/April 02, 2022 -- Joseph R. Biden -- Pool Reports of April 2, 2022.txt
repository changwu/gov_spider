Out-of-town pool report #1 - gathering soon
Good morning from Wilmington.
Pool will be headed this morning to the Port of Wilmington for a commissioning commemoration ceremony for the USS Delaware, a nuclear-powered, fast attack submarine. Both POTUS and FLOTUS are expected to speak.
FLOTUS is the sub's official "sponsor." >https://www.ussdelawarecommissioning.org/about-the-boat/boats-sponsor/<
The commissioning committee is expecting an audience of 5,000 for the invitation-only event.
The ceremony begins at 11 a.m.. It will be livestreamed.
Upon christening, vessels officially become a U.S. ship "for all purposes of law and tradition." The USS Delaware became the first Navy vessel to be commissioned while underwater after the original commissioning ceremony was canceled in 2020 because of the pandemic.
Here's some information from the Navy on the submarine.
USS Delaware (SSN 791) is a Virginia-class attack submarine.
The Virginia-class, also known as the VA-class or 774-class, is a class of nuclear-powered fast attack submarines in service with the U.S. Navy. The submarines are designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions. They were conceived as a less expensive alternative to the Seawolf-class attack submarines, designed during the Cold War era, and are replacing older Los Angeles-class submarines, 29 of which have already been decommissioned.

Out-of-town report #5 - POTUS & FLOTUS speak
POTUS, wearing his sunglasses, began speaking at 11:50 a.m.
He said it's always a good day when he can celebrate Delaware.
He spoke about 3 minutes before introducing FLOTUS.
FLOTUS was dressed all in red, including gloves.
"Delaware is family," she said, recalling her pride at getting to be the sub's sponsor.
In 2018, she said, she christened the sub in a shower of champagne.
She said the sub will uphold the state's motto of liberty and independence.
She told the crew she is "proud and humbled to be your shipmate for life."
She finished speaking at about noon."Man our ship and bring her to life," she told the crew.
Sailors, holding a hand over their hearts, jogged past the stage and onto the sub.
Two planes flew overhead as the sub made a variety of noises.
The crew saluted and the audience clapped.
Sen. Carper had been the keynote speaker. He welcomed Jill Biden "and your plus one."
Carper warned adversaries of the US:"Don't mess with the USS Delaware."
After introducing the sub to the Delawareans in the audience, Carper said he wanted to introduce Delaware to the sub's crew. His description included this fun fact: There are nearly 300 chickens for every person in DE.
"Long may she sail," Carper said of the sub as he wrapped up his remarks.
