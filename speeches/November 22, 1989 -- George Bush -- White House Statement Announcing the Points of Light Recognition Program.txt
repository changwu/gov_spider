    The White House today begins a practice of recognizing daily Points of Light. Points of Light are individuals, institutions, and initiatives across the country exemplifying the President's commitment to making community service central to the life and work of every American. Each day the White House will recognize one individual or institution who has successfully addressed our most dire social problems by engaging in community service.
As there are millions of Americans who would be worthy recipients, it is impossible to select the best exemplars of community service or to recognize each example individually. However, the entire Points of Light Recognition Program is intended by the President as a national tribute of the highest order to every single American who makes a difference in the life of someone in need.
