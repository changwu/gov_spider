    Verona, PA - Once again we find out that the picture that former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney paints isn't quite reality.
Under Romney, About 222,000 More Residents Left Massachusetts Then Moved There, Making The State A National Leader In Exporting Population. "Sum said Massachusetts' unemployment rate fell mostly because people looking for work moved out of the state, and thus were no longer counted on the Massachusetts rolls. In all, he said 222,000 more residents left Massachusetts than moved there during Mr. Romney's time in office, making the state 'a national leader in exporting our population.'"

"Just One State Had A Bigger Drop In Its Labor Force During The Same Period, According To Sum - That Was Louisiana, Which Was Hit By Hurricane Katrina In 2005."(Jia Lynn Yang, "As Massachusetts Governor, Romney Had An Unremarkable Record On Jobs," The Washington Post, 2/7/12)
Northeastern University Professor Andrew Sum: "The Fact The Unemployment Rate Went Down Had Nothing To Do With The Policies Of His Administration." (Seth McLaughlin, "Critics Hit Romney Job-Creation Record," The Washington Times, 2/26/12)
According To A Northeastern University Labor Scholar, Unemployment Went Down In Massachusetts Because People Left The Labor Force Or Even The State. Professor Andrew Sum: "We had one of the three worst job-creation rates in the country under his administration. The unemployment rate largely went down for one reason, because people withdrew from the labor force and left the state."
