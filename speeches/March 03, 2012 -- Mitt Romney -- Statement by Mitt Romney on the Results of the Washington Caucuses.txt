    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the results of the Washington caucuses:
"I'm heartened to have won the Washington caucuses, and I thank the voters for their support. Every day that passes with Barack Obama in the White House is a day in which America's recovery from the economic crisis is delayed. Unemployment here in Washington was recently as high as 10.2 percent. It's wonderful that it has declined to 8.3 percent. But that is still an unacceptable level, bringing hardship and suffering and sleepless nights to too many American homes. I believe in an America in which everyone seeking work can find it.
"I'm in this race because I believe that America can be turned around, that we don't have to accept unemployment over 8 percent as a new normal. I don't believe we have to accept a national debt that is as large as our entire economy. I don't believe we have to accept taxes and regulations that cripple economic growth. We don't have to accept a national health care scheme that will impose the will of Washington bureaucrats on every American healthy or ill. And we don't have to accept a President who divides our country even as he misgoverns it.
"Once again, I congratulate my fellow Republicans on a campaign well waged. We may differ from one another in background and experience. But we are united in our love of this country, and in our belief that with proper leadership America can do much better. The voters of Washington have sent a signal that they do not want a Washington insider in the White House. They want a conservative businessman who understands the private sector and knows how to get the federal government out of the way so that the economy can once again grow vigorously. With the support of Washington's voters, I look forward with optimism to the primaries and caucuses to come."
