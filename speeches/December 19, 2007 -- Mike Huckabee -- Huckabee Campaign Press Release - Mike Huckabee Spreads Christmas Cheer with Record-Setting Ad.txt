    Little Rock, AR â€“ A new television advertisement called "What Really Matters" featuring former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee has already received more than a half million viewer hits in less than 36 hours, setting a campaign record.
The 30-second ad began running in New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Iowa yesterday. It is featured on the Huckabee presidential campaign Web-site (www.mikehuckabee.com) and has been widely viewed on YouTube.
In the new ad, Governor Huckabee asks: "Are you about worn out by all the television commercials you've been seeing, mostly about politics? Well, I don't blame you."
He then states: "At this time of year, sometimes it's nice to pull aside from all of that and just remember that what really matters is the celebration of the birth of Christ and being with our family and friends. And I hope that you and your friends will have a magnificent Christmas season."
Huckabee closes the ad with: "And on behalf of all of us, God Bless and Merry Christmas. I'm Mike Huckabee and I approved this message."
The ad, which has been characterized as a "video Christmas card," was the second-most viewed video on YouTube today, receiving 669,200 views in 48 hours. Already, "What Really Matters" has outpaced another popular campaign ad featuring Huckabee with actor Chuck Norris. That ad, "Chuck Norris Approved," has had 1,200,868 views since its release in November.
