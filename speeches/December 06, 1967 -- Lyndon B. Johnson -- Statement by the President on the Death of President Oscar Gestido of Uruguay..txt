    IN THE DEATH of President Oscar Gestido Uruguay has lost its great leader, and the hemisphere a distinguished statesman.
His long record of public service to his country earned him a special place in the hearts of his fellow citizens. In the hours of fundamental change in the structure of the Uruguayan Government, they turned to him to direct their destinies.
Those of us who had the privilege to work with him at the meeting of Presidents at Punta del Este last April appreciated the way he conducted that historic conference. His leadership helped to assure its success as a milestone in inter-American relations.
On behalf of the United States Government and people I extend deepest sympathy to the family of the late President and the Uruguayan nation.
At the same time I express my best wishes to President Jorge Pacheco Areco for success in carrying forward the objectives which he and President Gestido shared.
