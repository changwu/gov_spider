    Today, as Vice President Mike Pence continues his damage control tour on behalf of the Trump Administration after their historic failure to prepare and combat the COVID-19 pandemic, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield released the following statement:
"At our core, our ability to unite in times of crisis is what defines us as Americans. Thanks to the bold leadership of Governor Walz – who reached across the aisle and united the nation's only divided state legislature – Minnesota is launching one of the most innovative public-private partnerships our country has seen to combat the COVID-19 crisis.
"While Vice President Pence tours the country attempting to paper over the Trump Administration's delayed, insufficient response to this pandemic by passing the buck to governors and posing for photos at the finish line, Vice President Biden stands firmly with Minnesotans — and Americans across the country — in listening to public health experts and following the science so we can keep Americans safe and get our economy back on track. That's the type of leadership our families deserve."
