    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Montgomery (D) Mississippi and 174 others)
The administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 1085. However, the administration intends to work with the Senate to have the bill amended, as proposed in the President's 1988 Budget, to: (1) shift funding responsibility for the basic benefit from VA to DOD, and (2) restructure the basic benefit to offer progressively higher benefits for longer terms of service. These two modifications are needed to ensure that the educational enlistment benefits of the New GI Bill will be productive for the armed services.
