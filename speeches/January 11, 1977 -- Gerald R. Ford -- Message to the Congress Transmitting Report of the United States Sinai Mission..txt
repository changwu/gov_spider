    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit herewith the Second Report of the United States Sinai Support Mission. This report, following that which I forwarded on April 30, 1976, describes the manner in which the Mission is carrying out its responsibility for operating the early warning system in the Sinai, as specified in the Basic Agreement between Egypt and Israel and its Annex signed on September 4, 1975. This report is provided to the Congress in conformity with Section 4 of Public Law 94-110 of October 13, 1975.
The Report includes a summary of the operations of the early warning system since its inauguration on February 22, 1976, and a description of the Mission's permanent base camp facilities which were officially dedicated on July 4.
With the completion of major construction activity, it has been possible to reduce somewhat the number of Americans working in the Sinai in accordance with the wishes of the Congress. The United States Sinai Support Mission will continue to analyze carefully all aspects of the Sinai operation to identify ways whereby the numbers might be further reduced.
The proposal to establish an American-manned early warning system in the Sinai was made at the request of the Governments of Egypt and Israel. With the concurrence of the Congress, we accepted this undertaking because the United States strongly seeks the achievement of peace and stability in the Middle East.
The United States Sinai Support Mission plays an important role in support of the Basic Agreement. Both sides have recently reaffirmed their confidence in the manner in which the United States has been carrying out its responsibilities in the Sinai, and as long as it continues to enjoy this support, the United States role will represent a meaningful contribution to the prospects for attaining a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.
