    "Joe Biden today continued his despicable politicization of the coronavirus crisis, while being completely unburdened by the responsibility of leadership. While President Trump led the nation in the unprecedented battle against the Chinese virus, Biden sat in his basement and suggested nothing that President Trump had not already done or was not already doing. When President Trump restricted travel from China in January, Biden opposed it, so we know we would be in worse position today if he had been president at the time. Every step of the way, Biden offered nothing but partisan sniping, while the President was marshaling the government and private sector to create the equipment we needed, including testing, masks, goggles, gloves, gowns, and ventilators. Worse, Biden has actively tried to frighten people away from taking the life-saving vaccine when it is ready, preferring instead to score political points at the cost of people's lives. President Trump wants people to be careful and take precautions, but he knows that we cannot let the virus drive us back into another society-wide shutdown. The President will continue to open the country, while Biden is the candidate of lockdowns. Another lockdown of six, twelve, or eighteen months would devastate working people and cause its own health problems unassociated with the virus itself. Joe Biden is a risk America can't afford to take."
