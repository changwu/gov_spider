    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 9/27/91)(House)(Edwards (D) CA and Hyde (R) IL)
The Administration supports reauthorization of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and has no objection to House passage of H.R. 3350. The Administration, however, is concerned that the appropriation authorizations in the bill are insufficient and the two-year extension of the Commission's termination date is too brief.
H.R. 3350 would authorize appropriations of $6 million for each of FYs 1992 and 1993 for the Commission. These levels are significantly below the $10.8 million requested for the Commission in the President's FY 1992 Budget and less than the amounts in the FY 1992 House and Senate appropriations bills. The two-year extension of the Commission's termination date is well below the 10-year extension previously endorsed by the Administration.
The Administration will work to address its concerns during the House/Senate conference.
