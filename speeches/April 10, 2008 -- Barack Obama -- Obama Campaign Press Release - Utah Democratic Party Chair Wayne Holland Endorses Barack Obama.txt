    Chicago, IL - Utah Democratic Party Chair and Democratic superdelegate Wayne Holland today endorsed Barack Obama, citing his ability to energize the Democratic Party and plan to strengthen the economy.
"Sen. Obama has helped to energize our State Party," said Holland. "Obama was clearly the choice of Utah Democrats on Feb. 5 and is the choice of the majority of Utah Democratic candidates to head the ticket in November. While it is not only important for me to reflect the sentiment of our Party, I also have a responsibility to endorse the candidate whom I believe will help unite the many voices of our 'big tent' Utah Party and help us build for the future."
"Sen. Obama shares Utahns' concern for building strong communities and re-building our economy ravaged by Republican policies â€” across the country as well as Utah. The headlines yesterday said 'Utah bankruptcies up 44% from a year ago.' This alone should be a wake-up call for every Utahn. We need a president with a ground-level view of the everyday struggles of Americans, and Obama's experience as a community activist and lawmaker fits that requirement."
Senator Obama won the Utah primary on February 5 with 57 percent of the vote.
Wayne Holland is the Utah Democratic Party Chair. Mr. Holland is a labor negotiator for the United Steelworkers Union.
