    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Line Item Veto Act, I hereby cancel the dollar amounts of discretionary budget authority, as specified in the attached reports, contained in the "Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998" (Public Law 105-66; H.R. 2169). I have determined that the cancellation of these amounts will reduce the Federal budget deficit, will not impair any essential Government functions, and will not harm the national interest.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
