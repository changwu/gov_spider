    I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 4995, the Department of Defense Appropriation Act, 1982. This legislation is a significant step in this administration's commitment to enhancing the defense posture of the United States and of maintaining our responsibilities to the nations of the free world. This is just a beginning, and in the years ahead we will need to sustain the effort mandated by the American people and supported by the Congress so that we will succeed in strengthening the nation's defense.
In addition to containing funds for essential strategic programs of the Department of Defense, the legislation provides funds to support the military and civilian personnel of the Department of Defense. I would like to express my appreciation for the strong bipartisan support that this legislation received and wish to personally thank the dedicated members of the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House who supported my budget requests and did so much to see that this legislation was enacted.
Finally, I would like to take the opportunity to commend the dedicated men and women of the Armed Forces and to express, on behalf of the American people, the gratitude of us all for the dedication and sacrifice they exhibit in the defense of our Nation.
