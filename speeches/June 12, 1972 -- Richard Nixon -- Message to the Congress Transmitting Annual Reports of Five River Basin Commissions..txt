    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit herewith the annual reports of the five river basin commissions established under the Water Resources Planning Act of 1965. These reports are from commissions that have been set up in the Pacific Northwest River Basins, the Souris-Red-Rainy River Basins, the Great Lakes Basin, the New England River Basins, and the Ohio River Basin and reflect the accomplishments of each commission during Fiscal Year 1971.
The primary responsibility of each commission is to develop plans for the best use of its water and related land resources, and to recommend priorities for implementing its plans. These commissions, though comprised of State and Federal members, are established at the initiation of the Governors of the States involved within the commission areas. They are unique in that they are neither wholly Federal nor State, but rather jointly financed partnerships working to develop the resources of their respective regions.
The commissions provide an opportunity for all interested persons, especially the residents of the river basins, to contribute to water resource planning. This has become particularly important in recent years because the wise use of our natural heritage is a critical public concern.
The substantial number of programs which these commissions have already begun will help to meet both existing and emerging problems of water and land use within their regions. They are also making studies that will promote effective solutions, with full recognition of the need both to preserve and to enhance the environment.
