The Daily Nonpareil: "The senator encouraged Americans to 'take responsibility for yourself' and reject 'today's cultural victimhood.' He said Republicans have to decide between 'grievance or greatness.'"
The Des Moines Register: "Scott said his goal is to present and champion conservative policies in a way that can draw others in rather than drive them away. 'I think you'll find you can have the same conservative policies, with the optimism that can persuade others to join the team, so our policies are the law of the land, rather than something we're yelling about from the outside looking in," he said. "That's what I offer, is a unique life story that reinforces: conservatism works.'"
KETV: "I thought the crowd responded very well to him," said an Iowa voter.
