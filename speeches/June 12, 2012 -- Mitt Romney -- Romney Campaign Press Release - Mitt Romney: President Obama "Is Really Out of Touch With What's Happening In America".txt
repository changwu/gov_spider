MITT ROMNEY: "Well, he's had a number of very revealing comments that show just how far out of touch he is with what's happening in the country. Yesterday, he said among other things, that he didn't realize that Obamacare is having any impact on small business. I'd acquaint him with a survey done by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that asked small businesses how Obamacare is affecting them, 75 percent, three quarters of them said it was less likely for them to hire people because of Obamacare. And then, of course, his comment that the private sector is doing fine at a time when instead you've seen growth of our economy below 2 percent for the first quarter and you have about 15 percent of Americans out of work or stopped looking for work or underemployed. The president is really out of touch with what's happening across America."
