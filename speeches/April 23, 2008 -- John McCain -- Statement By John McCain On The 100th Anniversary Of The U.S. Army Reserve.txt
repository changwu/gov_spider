    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain today issued the following statement on the 100th anniversary of the formation of the U.S. Army Reserve:
"Today marks the 100th anniversary of the formation of the U.S. Army Reserve. Throughout the past century, the citizen soldiers of our Army Reserve have answered their nation's call to service time again, from World War I to the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 9/11, nearly 193,000 Army Reserve men and women have been mobilized to serve side-by-side with active duty members around the globe. These Reservists - some of the greatest patriots among us - play a critical role in keeping our nation safe and strong.
"America's commitment to our Reserves must reflect the expanded role that those forces increasingly play in our nation's defense. That is why I am fighting to ensure that Reservist benefits are increased, beginning with passage of the Graham-Burr-McCain enhanced GI Bill. I will also work to ensure that our Reserve Forces are provided adequate modern equipment, access to training and full-time support personnel to perform their many missions and to maintain their readiness. We must also make every effort to assist the many families who face great strain as their loved ones serve overseas, and the employers whose support is critical for the men and women of our Reserves.
"For 100 years, the Army Reserve has proudly served our country with honor, and we must act today to ensure that our Reservists are prepared for the next 100 years."
