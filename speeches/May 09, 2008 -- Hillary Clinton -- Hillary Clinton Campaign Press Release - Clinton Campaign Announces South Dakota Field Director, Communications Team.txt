    The Clinton campaign today named Matt Tepper as South Dakota field director and Ben Kobren and Brendan Gilfillan as West and East River communications directors. The campaign previously announced that South Dakota native Geoff Wetrosky would serve as state director.
"Millions of votes have been cast in this primary, and now it is South Dakota's turn," Wetrosky said. "As she discussed in her visit yesterday, Hillary Clinton has real proposals to turn our economy around, help deal with skyrocketing energy prices and end the war in Iraq. There is tremendous grassroots energy and support here in South Dakota, and we hope to harness that excitement to ensure that South Dakota Democrats turn out for Hillary on June 3."
Tepper previously worked on the Clinton campaign in New Hampshire, Missouri, Texas and Pennsylvania.
Gilfillan served as the campaign's New Jersey communications director and also worked in Indiana, Pennsylvania and Iowa. Kobren, who worked in Hillary's Senate office, has worked in Indiana, Ohio, California and Nevada.
