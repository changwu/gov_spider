    "The enthusiasm for President Trump among Republicans is through the roof and record-breaking. The President received more New Hampshire primary votes than any incumbent president running for re-election - of either party - over the past four decades. His vote percentage will also show historic strength when the numbers are final, likely beating the last three incumbent presidents - Clinton, Bush, and Obama - who were successfully re-elected. The intensity of Trump supporters is incredible. On the Democrat side, the alleged excitement was overhyped, probably because their cast of candidates is so uninspiring. We still don't know who the opponent will be in November, but we do know President Trump will crush whoever it is."
- Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager
