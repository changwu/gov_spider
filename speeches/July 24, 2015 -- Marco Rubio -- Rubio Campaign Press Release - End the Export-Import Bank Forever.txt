The Bank is a relic of the New Deal that selects winners and losers with taxpayer dollars, and it should not be reauthorized under any circumstance. I am deeply disappointed that the Senate appears to be on the path to bring Ex-Im back to life.
Our nation faces big challenges, like the need to save and reform entitlements, update our outdated higher education system, and put in place a simple tax code that makes America competitive. Resurrecting the Export-Import Bank would be a missed opportunity to move America toward 21st century policies that grow wages for all Americans, not just the politically-connected.
