    On May 9, the European Community will celebrate Schuman Day. This year the occasion is particularly momentous, as it marks the 40th anniversary of the 1950 Declaration which initiated the European Coal and Steel Community and started a chain of events in European integration which has led to the strong and vibrant European Community of today. The early efforts were led by European statesmen of vision: Robert Schuman, Jean Monnet, Konrad Adenauer, Alcide de Gasperi, and Paul-Henri Spaak, among others. They foresaw clearly the need for a more integrated Europe that would reach beyond a customs union to an entity that would integrate Europe politically and economically.
From those difficult post-war days, Americans have shared that dream and encouraged it. President Eisenhower and Secretaries Marshall and Acheson, strong supporters of European integration, foresaw that our transatlantic alliance would preserve the peace in Europe and that the example of Western economic prosperity and multi-party democracy would lead to change in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The United States is proud of the role its support and presence in Europe have played in furthering European integration.
Today, we continue to support European unity. The vision of cooperation that took form 40 years ago has become a reality. It has led to a Europe that is economically strong and committed to democratic principles and an outward-looking international trading system, and we celebrate these successes with our European allies. The transatlantic partnership, today as in 1950, is a beacon of hope to societies in transition in Eastern and Central Europe and elsewhere.
We salute the European Community on this significant anniversary.
