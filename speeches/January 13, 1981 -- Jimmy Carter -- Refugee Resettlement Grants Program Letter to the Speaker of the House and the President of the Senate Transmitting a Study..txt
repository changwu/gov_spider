    Sir:
In accordance with Section 412(b) (1) (B) of the Refugee Act of 1980 (Public Law 96-212), I have determined that the administration of the Reception and Placement Grants, awarded to resettlement agencies for the performance of certain initial services for refugees coming to the United States, should be retained by the Department of State.
The details of this determination are set forth in the enclosed study prepared by the U.S. Coordinator for Refugee Affairs. I concur with his comments and observations.
Respectfully,
JIMMY CARTER
