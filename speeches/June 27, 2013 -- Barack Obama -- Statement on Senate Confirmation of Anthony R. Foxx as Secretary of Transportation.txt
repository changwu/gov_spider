    I am pleased that the Senate today voted unanimously to confirm Anthony Foxx as the next Secretary of Transportation. Anthony knows firsthand that investing in our roads, bridges, and transit systems is vital to creating good jobs and ensuring American businesses can grow and compete in a 21st-century global economy.
I welcome Anthony to my team, and I look forward to working with him as we aim to modernize the infrastructure that powers our economy.
