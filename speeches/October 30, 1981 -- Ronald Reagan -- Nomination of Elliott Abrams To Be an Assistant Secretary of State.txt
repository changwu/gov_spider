    The President today announced his intention to nominate Elliott Abrams to be Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs. He would succeed Patricia M. Derian. Mr. Abrams will resign his current position as Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations effective upon his assumption of this new position.
In making today's announcement, the President said "the promotion of liberty has always been a central element of our Nation's foreign policy. In my administration, human rights considerations are important in all aspects of our foreign policy. We will speak up against the enemies of freedom, and we will try to help its friends. We will encourage those who seek freedom, not least by telling the simple truth about their efforts and the efforts of those who seek to oppress them.
As Assistant Secretary for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, Elliott Abrams will have a key role in this effort. He will give policy advice on human rights issues not only within the State Department but also to the U.S. International Communication Agency and other government agencies. In so doing, he will help this administration remind both Americans and our friends abroad that liberty is our Nation's greatest strength and our deepest wish for all mankind."

He was special counsel to Senator Daniel Moynihan (D-N.Y.) in 1977-79. In 1973-75 he was an attorney with the firm of Breed, Abbott and Morgan of Boston, Mass.
