    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with 31 U.S.C. ยง 1105(a), I am transmitting my 1997 Budget to Congress.
This budget provides a thematic overview of my priorities as we continue to discuss how to balance the budget over the next seven years. It also includes the Administration's new economic assumptions.
Because of the uncertainty over 1996 appropriations as well as possible changes in mandatory programs and tax policy, the Office of Management and Budget was not able to provide, by today, all of the material normally contained in the President's budget submission. I anticipate transmitting that material to Congress the week of March 18, 1996.
William J. Clinton
