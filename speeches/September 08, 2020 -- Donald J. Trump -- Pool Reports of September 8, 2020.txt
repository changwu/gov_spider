 Travel pool 1 — Leaving White House 
Hello everyone. We're rolling away from the White House at 11:21 and we're motorcading to JBA. We spotted POTUS in the backseat of the presidential limo. (In case you're wondering, the press office says he's been driving to JBA because of construction on the South Lawn.)
POTUS is flying to Florida to give a speech in Jupiter, and then to North Carolina for a campaign event in Winston-Salem.
There are no pooled events on the schedule at this point, just public remarks.

 Travel pool 2 — JBA 
We rolled up to the plane at JBA at 11:45. We're on the smaller jet today.
Trump gaggled on the tarmac. He started by saying the job numbers are great and a vaccine is coming. Then he took a couple questions.
Trump said he's considering spending money on his own campaign.
"If I have to, I will."
"Whatever it takes, we have to win."
"Joe doesn't have the strength, he doesn't have the mental capability."
We spotted Stephen Miller, Robert O'Brien, Lindsey Graham, Mark Meadows.
No cell service on small plane, will send fuller remarks when possible.
We'll be wheels up for Palm Beach International shortly.

 Pool report 3 — Landing at PBI 
We landed at Palm Beach International at 1:59. POTUS walked down the steps at 2:09. Half the sky is bright blue, the other half is ominous dark gray clouds.
Ron DeSantis, wearing a mask, was at the bottom of the stairs to greet POTUS.
After getting off the plane, we noticed McEntee, Kushner, Scavino and Jason Miller were on board as well.
We're rolling to the event in Jupiter at 2:12. It's about 30 minute drive.
POTUS came back to talk off the record for about six minutes.
Here's some extended quotes from POTUS at JBA before boarding the flight. Thanks to Tina Nguyen for the transcription assistance.
"We're going to Florida, we're going to North Carolina, we're doing a double stop, we'll be doing some triples along the way but right now we're sort of in the earlier stages. The poll numbers you saw were very good, they were really getting good despite all of the disinformation campaigns that the Democrats run. Pure disinformation. So we're doing very well, and we'll have a good trip today and I'll see you during the trip."
"Whether it's ventilators or whether its vaccines, which we will see very soon, or therapeutics, we've done a great job. But the press was fake, and we have to spend a lot of money."
"We have much more money than we had last time, going into the last two months. I think double or triple. But if we needed any more, I would put it up personally like I did in the primaries last time. In the 2016 primaries, I put up a lot of money. If I have to, I'll do it here. But we don't have to, because we have double and maybe even triple than what we had a number of years ago, 4 years ago."
Q: How much are you talking about putting into your campaign now?
"Whatever it takes, we have to win. This is the most important election in the history of our country. We have a radical left group going around. These people, there's something wrong with them, there really is, there's something wrong with them. And Joe doesn't have the strength, he doesn't have the mental capability to control these people."
"I don't think the Democrats have the courage to control these people. They're afraid to even talk about law and order, they can't even say the words law and order. All we want is law and order."
"The suburbs are coming big to us, because the suburbs are next. If you elected this guy, the suburbs would be overwhelmed with violence and crime. So that's where we are. This is the most important election in the history of our country. So that's it. We'll see you in Florida."

 Pool report 5 —Jupiter arrival 
It was a smooth ride to the event. A lot of people waved American flags, and some Trump flags too. I spotted one sign that said "I vape & I vote." There were a handful of boats with flags as we crossed the Loxahatchee River.
A couple blocks from the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse and Museum, there were dense crowds on both sides of the road, most with flags supporting POTUS. There were a few signs supporting Laura Loomer for Congress too.
We arrived at the event at 2:49. The remarks will be broadcast. Right now the speakers are blasting the Doors at high volume.
