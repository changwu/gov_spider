    EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy will promote U.S. climate and environmental goals by leading the U.S. delegation to the Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, which will take place November 1-5 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Administrator McCarthy will also meet with key counterparts while in Dubai.
The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is a global agreement to protect the stratospheric ozone layer through measures to control production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances. The Montreal Protocol has achieved universal ratification and is considered by many to be the most successful multilateral environmental treaty to date. The upcoming meeting will include discussions on a Montreal Protocol amendment to address emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, potent greenhouse gases that are replacing ozone-depleting substances and are rapidly becoming a major contributor to global climate change. The U.S. delegation also includes representatives from the White House, Department of State, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of Agriculture.
