    Yesterday's verdict in San Francisco underscores the danger to public safety when our Nation fails to enforce its laws.  Kate Steinle was killed by an illegal immigrant and convicted felon who had been deported from the United States five times.  He, and countless other criminal illegal immigrants like him, should never be allowed to threaten our citizens.
It's more important now than ever for Congress to secure our borders and provide the resources, including more ICE officers, needed to deport criminal illegal aliens and to finally stop sanctuary city policies that cause needless loss of innocent life.  Politicians who fail to address these needs share responsibility for preventable crimes committed against innocent Americans.
Had San Francisco enforced our Nation's immigration laws, the Steinle family would be celebrating this holiday with all of their loved ones.
