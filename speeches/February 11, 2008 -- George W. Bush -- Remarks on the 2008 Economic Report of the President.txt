    The President. I want to thank members of my economic team for submitting this Economic Report of the President. I'm about to sign it. And so I want to—Eddie, thank you for your good work, you and your team.
Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Edward P. Lazear. My pleasure.
The President. This report indicates that our economy is structurally sound for the long term and that we're dealing with uncertainties in the short term. And therefore, what should we do about it? Well, I am so pleased that the Congress and the administration worked closely together to pass a robust progrowth package to deal with the uncertainty. That package is about 160 billion-plus dollars. What that means is, it means that money will be going directly to America: workers and families and individuals. It also means that there is incentives for American businesses.
I'll be signing this bill soon. But if you're a taxpayer or if you're a—got income up to—earned income—I mean, credited income up to $3,000, you can expect money back. And if you're a businessowner, you're going to get some incentives to invest. And so you ought to be planning upon it—on investing now.
And so I really want to thank the Congress for getting this bill done, and I'm looking forward to signing it. It's going to help deal with the uncertainties in this economy.
Thank you all very much.
