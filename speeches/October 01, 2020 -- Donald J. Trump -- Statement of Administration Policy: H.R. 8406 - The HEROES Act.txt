    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Lowey, D-NY, and ten cosponsors)
The Administration opposes H.R. 8406. As with the original HEROES Act (H.R. 6800), which faced bipartisan opposition in the House in May, this bill is filled with longstanding partisan proposals that would do nothing to enhance our Nation's ability to deal with the public health and economic challenges we face. Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, the Administration has worked tirelessly to mobilize our Nation's vast resources to combat the virus and help people and businesses that are suffering. The Administration is ready to continue working with Congress to support the American people in our fight against the coronavirus, but unfortunately, H.R. 8406 would not build on the progress we have already made.
On four separate occasions, the President has worked with Congress in a bipartisan manner to respond to the outbreak by enacting legislation of unprecedented size and breadth. President Trump has signed legislation that includes almost $2.5 trillion in spending to improve public health, support small businesses, and bridge the gap for individuals and families as they deal with the challenges presented by the coronavirus. The Administration will continue its efforts to reach a bipartisan agreement to provide additional funding to support our public health response to the coronavirus and to continue the Nation's economic recovery, along with liability protection for universities, schools, and businesses. Unfortunately, H.R. 8406 prioritizes ideological objectives at the expense of real progress to help Americans through these challenging times. As a result, the Administration cannot support H.R. 8406.
If H.R. 8406 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.
