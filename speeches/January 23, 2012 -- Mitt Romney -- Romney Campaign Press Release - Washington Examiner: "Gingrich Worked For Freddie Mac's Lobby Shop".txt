"Gingrich Worked For Freddie Mac's Lobby Shop"

[Gingrich's] Freddie Mac work gives off a whiff of lobbying, according to the contract he just released.
Specifically, the Freddie Mac executive who hired Gingrich was not the CEO, nor the VP for operations, or the VP for communications, but Craig Thomas, the VP for Public Policy -- that is, the head of Freddie Mac's lobbying operations. Thomas was a registered lobbyist at the time.
So, Gingrich may or may not have made lobbying contacts on Freddie's behalf, but it appears he was being paid to aid Freddie Mac's lobbying agenda.
