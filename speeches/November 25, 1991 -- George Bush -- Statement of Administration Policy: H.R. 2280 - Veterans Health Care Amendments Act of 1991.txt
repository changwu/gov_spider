    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Note: Revised from previous SAP sent on 11/22/91)(House)(Montgomery (D) and 37 others)
The Administration has no objection to the substantive provisions of H.R. 2280.
SCORING FOR THE PURPOSE OF PAY-AS-YOU-GO
H.R. 2280 contains a number of provisions subject to the pay-as- you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). Preliminary scoring estimates of this bill are still under development. If H.R. 2280 were enacted, final Office of Management and Budget estimates would be published five days after enactment, as required under OBRA. The cumulative effect of all enacted legislation on the pay-as-you-go requirement will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to Congress.
