    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Turkey on the Enforcement of Penal Judgments which was signed in Ankara on June 7, 1979.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the Report of the Department of State with respect to the treaty.
The treaty would permit citizens of either nation who have been convicted in the courts of the other country to serve their sentences in their home country; in each case the consent of the offender would be required.
This treaty is significant because it represents an attempt to resolve a situation which has inflicted substantial hardships on a number of citizens of each country and has caused concern to both governments. It also represents a significant element in the modernization of our relations with Turkey in the field of international judicial cooperation.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this treaty.
