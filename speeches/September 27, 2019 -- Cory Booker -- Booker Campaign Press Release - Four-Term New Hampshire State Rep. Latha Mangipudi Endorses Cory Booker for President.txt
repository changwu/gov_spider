    Booker earns field-leading 84th New Hampshire endorsement
Manchester, NH â€” New Hampshire State Representative Latha Mangipudi (Nashua), a four-term legislator and a leader in New Hampshire's Indian-American community, today endorsed Cory Booker for president.
Yesterday in New Hampshire, Booker joined Mangipudi in lighting Diyas, a symbolic way of ringing in the Indian holiday Dasara, a celebration that runs from September 29th--October 8th and focuses on family, renewal, spirituality and prosperity. The week of celebration culminates at the beginning of Diwali, the Hindu new year. View a photo here.
"Cory Booker's consistent message that together, we can and will rise, resonates with my core values," said State Rep. Latha Mangipudi. "He is running to unite us as Americans, heal our country after years of division under our current administration, defend immigrants and vulnerable communities, and deliver justice and opportunity for all. He is the right choice for Nashua, the right choice for New Hampshire, and the best choice for us all. I hope you join me in supporting him in this race."
Mangipudi represents Nashua Ward 8 and is serving in her fourth term. Mangipudi works as a licensed language and speech pathologist and has been active for nearly two decades in Democratic politics, first as an activist and now as the first Indian American elected official in New Hampshire.
Mangipudi hosted Booker at her home in February during his first campaign swing in New Hampshire as a presidential candidate. She is the latest state elected official to back Booker in the 2020 primary. Booker has earned a total of 84 Granite State endorsements -- more than any other 2020 candidate -- including three state senators, 14 state representatives and the state's longest-serving mayor.
This endorsement comes on the heels of Booker's latest visit to New Hampshire and amidst Booker's urgent, week-long push to raise $1.7 million by September 30.
