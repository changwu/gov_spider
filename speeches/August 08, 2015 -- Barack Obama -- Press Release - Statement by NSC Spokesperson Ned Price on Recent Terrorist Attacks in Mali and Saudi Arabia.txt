    The United States strongly condemns the recent deplorable terrorist attacks in Mali and Saudi Arabia. Terrorists attacked a hotel in Sévaré, Mali, killing several Malian and foreign citizens. In Saudi Arabia, a terrorist bomber attacked a mosque in Abha, taking the lives of 15 Saudi servicemen while they were at prayer. We extend our deepest condolences to the families of the victims, and wish for the speedy recovery of the wounded. We express solidarity with the governments whose citizens were among the victims. That the victims came from different nations and faiths highlights the common cause that the United States and its partners must continue to make in the global effort to confront and defeat terrorists who have no regard for human life and diversity. The United States will continue to support our partners in Mali and Saudi Arabia as they combat this terrorist scourge.
