    I am disappointed that the Republican leadership has again prevented the Congress from even voting on whether to raise the minimum wage and give 10 million Americans an immediate pay increase. With every day that the Republican leadership continues to stall, the value of the minimum wage continues to fall closer and closer to a 40-year low. Some of America's greatest working heroes are the parents who are trying to raise their kids, working full time at the minimum wage. If we value work and we value families, we ought to raise the value of the minimum wage. With the 5-year anniversary of the last minimum wage increase next Monday, now is the time to put politics aside, raise the minimum wage, and help lift the lives of millions of America's workers.
