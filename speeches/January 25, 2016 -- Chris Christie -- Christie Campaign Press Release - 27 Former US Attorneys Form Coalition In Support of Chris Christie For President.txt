MORRISTOWN, NJ - Today, 27 former US Attorneys announced their support for Chris Christie for President of the United States. Governor Christie served alongside these national security and law enforcement experts when he was US Attorney in New Jersey immediately following September 11, 2001 and spent six years prosecuting and convicting terrorists.
"As a former US Attorney, who understands the demands and experience the job requires, I know Governor Christie will be ready on day one to lead in the dark and dangerous times this country is now facing," said former Associate Attorney General Kevin O'Connor. "Background and experience is an important qualifier for our next commander-in-chief and that is why I wholeheartedly support Governor Christie for president."
"I had the privilege of serving with Governor Christie when he was United States Attorney for New Jersey, and I know he has the integrity, strength, and courage to successfully handle the complex challenges facing our country," said former Virginia U.S. Attorney John Brownlee. "The choice in this election is clear. We need to elect a leader with a proven national security and law enforcement record and that leader is Chris Christie."
"As leaders who understand the importance of protecting our homeland first, I am honored to receive the support of these US Attorneys," said Governor Christie. "My time serving with these individuals as US Attorney under President Bush has significantly influenced the way I lead and having their support going into the first votes will be invaluable in making clear the important choice Americans have in this election."
