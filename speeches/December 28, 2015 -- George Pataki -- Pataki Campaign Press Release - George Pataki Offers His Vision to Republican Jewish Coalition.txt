At the Republican Jewish Coalition 2015 Presidential Candidates Forum, Pataki was among those with whom he had a lengthy and productive relationship.
Pataki repeatedly implored the crowd to ignore his standing in the polls and look at his record. Pataki was introduced by RJC member Earl Mack.
Pataki began with a tribute to his friends in the room. "Without you, we don't win elections."
He spoke about a variety of issues, starting with foreign policy.
Pataki cited the Garland, Texas, attacks that were foiled as well as the successful Chattanooga murders of Marines, Fort Hood and the Boston Marathon bombings. He linked the common thread as radical jihad. Anyone verbally shouting "jihad" is not engaging in protected speech. It is "yelling fire in a crowded theater" and must be stopped.
Pataki summoned the ghost of Admiral James B. Stockdale in asking the question of why he was in the race. He cited his electability and his experience. He won three times as a Republican governor in liberal New York. He got a plurality of the Puerto Rican and Dominican vote, even though those two constituencies have been in direct conflict with each other.
