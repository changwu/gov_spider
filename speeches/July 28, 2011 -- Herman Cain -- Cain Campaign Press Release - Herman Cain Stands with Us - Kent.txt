Kent is a small business owner who "turns steers into steaks" (vegetarians, cover your eyes!) and whose carne asada is his delicious trademark. Kent, like so many of America's job creators, feels that this economy is "in the tank" and that the federal government only makes things worse with sky-high taxes and regulations that cripple businesses.
