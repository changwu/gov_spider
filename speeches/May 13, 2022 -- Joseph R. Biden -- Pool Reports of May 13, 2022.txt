Travel pool report 1 - JBA
Greetings from JBA, where it's 73 degrees and overcast.
The president's motorcade arrived on the tarmac at 6:27pm. He emerged and chatted briefly with the greeter. He did not respond to shouted questions and boarded Air Force One moments later, en route to Wilmington for the weekend.
We are wheels up shortly to DANG.



May 13, 202219:15

Travel pool report 2 - DANG arrival
Air Force One was wheels up from JBA at 6:40pm and landed at DANG at 7:00pm.
POTUS deplaned at 7:08, removing his mask as he came down the stairs. He shook hands with the two greeters and chatted with them briefly.
The president appeared to respond to a shouted question about the baby formula shortage, saying "ten minutes." It's unclear whether he heard or understood the question.
Motorcade is rolling at 7:12pm.



May 13, 202219:34

Travel pool report 3 - Travel/photo lid
The motorcade arrived at the Biden residence at 7:24pm. We have a travel/photo lid.
To clarify the president's response to the shouted question at DANG from the previous report: The question about the baby formula shortage was along the lines of "How long do parents have to wait?" It's likely POTUS only heard the first part and responded "ten minutes."

Foreign Pool Report #1: Background info ahead of US-ASEAN Special Summit
Good afternoon,
President Biden's speech this afternoon at the State Department will be covered by the in-town travel pool, with his remarks scheduled to be streamed from 3:30pm at whitehouse.gov/live. Some background information on the event for reference:
President Biden participates in the US-ASEAN Special Summit today commemorating 45 years of relations between the United States and the bloc of Southeast Asian nations. This is the second Special Summit since February 2016 when it was convened in Sunnylands, and the first time it has been held in Washington, DC.
This is also the first time since 2017 that a US president has met the ASEAN leaders in person since President Trump participated in the meeting in Manila of that year. President Biden joined the most recent US-ASEAN Summit in October 2021 when the meeting was held virtually.
Cambodia, this year's ASEAN chair, announced that the leaders will seek "to intensify cooperation in various areas, including COVID-19 response and global health security, climate change, sustainable development, maritime cooperation, human capital development, education and people-to-people ties, as well as connectivity and economic engagement."
From the US side, a senior administration official in a teleconference on Wednesday said it would "focus on efforts to promote respect for human rights, the rule of law, and good governance." In addition, there would be a broad discussion of Ukraine and Russia, and that Burma would also be a subject of intense deliberation.
Burma is one of two nations from the 10-member organization whose leader is not in attendance. The country's nominal prime minister, General Min Aung Hlaing, was not invited after having seized power in a military coup in February 2021. The US has voiced support for the ASEAN Five-Point Consensus on the situation in Burma which was reached in April of last year but has seen little progress since.
The outgoing Philippines President Duterte is skipping the summit, as his successor was just elected on May 9 and will take office at the end of June.
ASEAN Fun Facts
- Total collective population of over 662 million people
- Combined GDP of $3.2 trillion, making it the fifth largest economy in the world
- Goods and services trade with the US totaled about $362 billion in 2020.
