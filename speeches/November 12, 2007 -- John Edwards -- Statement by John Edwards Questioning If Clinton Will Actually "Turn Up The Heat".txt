    Chapel Hill, North Carolina – Today, Senator John Edwards released the following statement:
"The war in Iraq isn't even history yet, but the Bush Administration is repeating the march to war with Iran – and they're getting help from a person who should know a lot better – Senator Clinton.
"On Saturday at the Iowa Jefferson Jackson dinner, Senator Clinton unveiled her new campaign slogan to 'turn up the heat' on the Republicans.
"Well, somebody will have to tell me how you 'turn up the heat' by voting with Bush, Cheney and the neocons on their path to war with Iran. Because I don't believe that's turning up the heat – I think that's giving them exactly what they want.
"Senator Clinton had her chance to stand up and she chose not to use it. Our nation needs leaders who have the strength and backbone to fight the president on his march to war with Iran – not quicken the pace."
