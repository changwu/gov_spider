    Mitt Romney made the following statement on winning the majority of the national delegates selected at Wyoming's County Conventions:
"I am delighted to have won the support of seven of the twelve national delegates selected at Wyoming's County Conventions.Â  Our campaign is on the move and today's victories in the island territories bring us one step closer to defeating President Obama and restoring American's promise. I am grateful to our extraordinary supporters in Wyoming and look forward to sharing my message of more jobs, less debt and smaller government with voters across the nation."
