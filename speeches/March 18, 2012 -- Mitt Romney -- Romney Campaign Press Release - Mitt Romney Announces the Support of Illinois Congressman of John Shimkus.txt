    Mitt Romney today announced the endorsement of Illinois Congressman John Shimkus.
"I'm honored to have John's support," said Mitt Romney. "John is a conservative leader in Illinois and shares my vision of restoring America's promise through pro-growth policies that will empower small businesses and create jobs. If I'm elected, I look forward to working with him to put these plans into action."
Announcing his endorsement, Congressman Shimkus said, "America is in the midst of an economic crisis. After three years of President Obama, Illinois voters realize that we must elect someone who understands how to get middle class Americans back to work at good paying long term jobs. Mitt Romney has spent his career in the private sector, and he knows how to get our economy growing again.Â  There is simply no candidate in the race who has a better understanding of what it will take to get our country back to work. That is why I am proud to support Mitt Romney and urge my fellow conservatives to join me."
