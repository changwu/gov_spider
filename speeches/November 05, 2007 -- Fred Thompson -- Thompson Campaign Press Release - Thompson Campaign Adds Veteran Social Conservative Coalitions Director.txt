McLean, VA - Today the Fred Thompson campaign announced the addition of Shannon Royce, an experienced social conservative coalitions director and former Executive Director of The Arlington Group, who will be joining the Thompson Campaign to serve as Grassroots and Special Projects Director.
Shannon Royce most recently served as Executive Director of the Arlington Group where she managed a coalition of over 70 organizations advocating on numerous pro-family initiatives. In that capacity, she coordinated coalition efforts on behalf of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito. A former Legislative Assistant to Senator Slade Gorton and Legislative Counsel to Senator Charles Grassley, Royce also served as Director of Government Relations for the Southern Baptist Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission from 1999-2003. Shannon is a graduate of Hardin Simmons University, and received a law degree from George Washington University.
"I have watched Senator Thompson for months and have been struck by his consistent record as a conservative," said Shannon Royce. "His record is solid and his views are based on a deeply philosophical approach to the issues. I have had the privilege of working with some of the greatest leaders in the pro-family movement. I am now turning my attention to work with a man who can lead our nation. "
"We are blessed that Shannon has joined our team," said Randy Enwright, National Political Director. "She is a lawyer and a seasoned political operative with a vast network of connections. Shannon is well known and highly respected in Evangelical Christian circles and has been on the front lines of all key battles important to social conservatives. She is an important addition to our operation and will make a tangible impact."
