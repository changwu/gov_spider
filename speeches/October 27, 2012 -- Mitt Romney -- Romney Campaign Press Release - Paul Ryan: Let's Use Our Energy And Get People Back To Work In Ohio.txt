PAUL RYAN: "So it's not enough for us to simply complain about the broken promises or to simply highlight the fact that President Obama can't run on his record, so he's trying to distort ours. He's trying to distract people to win by default. This is why we're offering specific solutions, specific ideas, and how to create 12 million jobs, how to get people back to work, how to confront our problems before they get out of our control. Number one, and here in Ohio, here in this part of Ohio, we have so much energy in this country, let's use that energy in this country and put people back to work. Let's use our coal. Let's use our natural gas. Let's use our oil. Let's use our renewables. If we do this, that means American energy dollars go to American jobs, that helps manufacturers, that brings down our price of energy."
