    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-265; 16 U.S.C. 1801), I transmit herewith a governing international fishery agreement between the United States and Denmark and the Faroe Islands, signed at Washington on September 5, 1979.
This agreement is one of a series to be negotiated in accordance with that legislation. I urge that the Congress give favorable consideration to this agreement at an early date. Since 60 calendar days of continuous session, as required by the legislation, may not be available, I recommend that the Congress consider issuance of a joint resolution to bring this agreement into force.
