    DeSantis picks up nine new endorsements in the Granite State for a total of 70 endorsements
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. â€“ Ron DeSantis received nine new endorsements from New Hampshire officials today, including State Rep. Jordan Ulrey (R-Hudson) who switched his endorsement from Donald Trump to Ron DeSantis.
The full list of new endorsements:
State Representative and Salem Selectman Joe Sweeney - SalemSchool Board Member Jared Talbot - GoffstownFormer State Rep. Bill Ohm - NashuaFormer State Rep. Marc Abear - MeredithFormer State Sen. Harold French - CanterburyFormer State Rep. Tim Baxter - SeabrookFormer State Rep. Melissa Blasek - MerrimackFormer State Rep. Michael Yakubovich - Hooksett
With these additional nine endorsements, DeSantis now boasts support from 70 New Hampshire officials.
Rep. Jordan Ulrey, a fixture in the New Hampshire state Legislature, serving his ninth term, previously announced his endorsement of Trump in April but has since flipped because of DeSantis' platform to slash the DC bureaucracy, limit government, and bring down costs for New Hampshire families.
"I am proud to endorse Ron DeSantis for president," said Rep. Ulrey.
"He is the conservative candidate our party needs to put the focus back on the issues and unify us with a shared vision of reversing our nation's decline, which starts with sending Joe Biden back to his basement. From limiting government to slaying the bureaucratic state in D.C. to bringing energy prices down for families, Ron DeSantis is the candidate who will get things done for New Hampshire families and the American people."
DeSantis has visited the state four times since announcing his candidacy. His most recent visit came last week when he rolled out his Declaration of Economic Independence, and he will be back later this month.
