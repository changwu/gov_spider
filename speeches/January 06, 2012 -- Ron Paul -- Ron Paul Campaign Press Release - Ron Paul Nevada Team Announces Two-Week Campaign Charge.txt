HENDERSON, Nevada - The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign announced today roughly two weeks of campaign activities in Nevada, demonstrating the broad reach of its campaign as well as the organizational muscle for which the campaign is known.
The activities will be conducted by the Nevada operations staff based in the Henderson and Reno offices, as the candidate is not scheduled to attend. The activities include voter outreach events, straw poll participation, phone banking, campaign materials distribution, voter registration, interfacing with the Republican Party, and outreach to key population segments.
"The Ron Paul campaign is serious about a competitive showing in the February 4th Nevada Caucus. These events will energize voters and other stakeholders to ensure that our seriousness translates into tangible results," said Ron Paul 2012 Nevada Chairman Carl Bunce.
