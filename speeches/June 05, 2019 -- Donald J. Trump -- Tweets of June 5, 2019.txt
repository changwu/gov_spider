Can you imagine Cryin' Chuck Schumer saying out loud for all to hear that I am bluffing with respect to putting Tariffs on Mexico. What a Creep. He would rather have our Country fail with drugs & Immigration than give Republicans a win. But he gave Mexico bad advice no bluff!Retweets: 24513Favorites: 93681

Washed up psycho @BetteMidler was forced to apologize for a statement she attributed to me that turned out to be totally fabricated by her in order to make 'your great president' look really bad. She got caught just like the Fake News Media gets caught. A sick scammer!Retweets: 30618Favorites: 131679

Plagiarism charge against Sleepy Joe Biden on his ridiculous Climate Change Plan is a big problem but the Corrupt Media will save him. His other problem is that he is drawing flies not people to his Rallies. Nobody is showing up I mean nobody. You can't win without people!Retweets: 22903Favorites: 104382

I kept hearing that there would be 'massive' rallies against me in the UK but it was quite the opposite. The big crowds which the Corrupt Media hates to show were those that gathered in support of the USA and me. They were big & enthusiastic as opposed to the organized flops!Retweets: 24995Favorites: 116646

If the totally Corrupt Media was less corrupt I would be up by 15 points in the polls based on our tremendous success with the economy maybe Best Ever! If the Corrup Media was actually fair I would be up by 25 points. Nevertheless despite the Fake News we're doing great!Retweets: 2656Favorites: 11364

.@FLOTUS Melania and I send our deepest condolences to President Reuven Rivlin and the entire State of Israel upon the passing of Mrs. Nechama Rivlin.

Could not have been treated more warmly in the United Kingdom by the Royal Family or the people. Our relationship has never been better and I see a very big Trade Deal down the road. 'This trip has been an incredible success for the President.' @IngrahamAngleRetweets: 21740Favorites: 113592

House Democrats fresh off a Republican victory against them (in Federal Court) on the Wall keep asking people to come and testify regarding the No Collusion Witch Hunt. They are very unhappy with the Mueller Report especially with his corrective letter & now want a Do Over!Retweets: 14282Favorites: 60628

'House Republicans support the President on Tariffs with Mexico all the way & that makes any measure the President takes on the Border totally Veto proof. Why wouldn't you as Republicans support him when that will allow our President to make a better deal.' Thank you @GOPLeaderRetweets: 17252Favorites: 71555

Immigration discussions at the White House with representatives of Mexico have ended for the day. Progress is being made but not nearly enough! Border arrests for May are at 133000 because of Mexico & the Democrats in Congress refusing to budge on immigration reform. Further...Retweets: 22382Favorites: 95431

....talks with Mexico will resume tomorrow with the understanding that if no agreement is reached Tariffs at the 5% level will begin on Monday with monthly increases as per schedule. The higher the Tariffs go the higher the number of companies that will move back to the USA!Retweets: 21028Favorites: 94444
