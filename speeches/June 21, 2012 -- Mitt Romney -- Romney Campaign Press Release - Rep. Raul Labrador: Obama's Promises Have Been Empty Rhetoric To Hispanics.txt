    Idaho Congressman Raul Labrador made the following statement on Mitt Romney's remarks at NALEO:
"President Obama's promises have proven to be nothing more than empty rhetoric for the Hispanic community. Governor Romney will put an end to the failed policies of this administration by creating a competitive environment to foster job creation and reduce the burdensome regulations stifling economic growth. These are the kinds of policies that bring good jobs to our communities and provide a better future to all Americans."
