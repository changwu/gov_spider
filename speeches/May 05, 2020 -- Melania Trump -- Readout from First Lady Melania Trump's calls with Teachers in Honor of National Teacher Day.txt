    In recognition of National Teacher Day and Teacher Appreciation Week, First Lady Melania Trump held a series of telephone calls with teachers and educators from across America. Mrs. Trump spoke with elementary, middle and high school educators, both public and private. During the calls, the First Lady expressed her heartfelt appreciation and gratitude for all that educators are doing for students during these unprecedented times.
As schools across the country are closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, the First Lady and the educators touched on a variety of topics including distance learning methods, resources schools have made available for low-income families, parent-teacher relationships, and the biggest challenges they have faced with distance learning.
Additionally, the First Lady was happy to hear the many ways school faculty, families, and local governments have been coming together to provide innovative solutions to the new challenges the education community has been facing. For example, at a school in Florida, bus drivers and the IT department have come up with a laptop delivery and technical support program, and a teacher in Michigan shared a lesson plan pick-up and drop-off plan for her students who do not have access to a computer or printer.
"The determination that educators everywhere are showing in order to support their students during these challenging times is truly remarkable and continues to inspire me," said First Lady Melania Trump. "The coronavirus pandemic has shown the importance for all of us to come together to try new and innovative ways to provide the world's best education for each and every one of our great students. Thank you to our amazing teachers and Happy National Teacher Day."
