    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
H.R. 998 – Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome (SCRUB) Act(Rep. Smith, R-MO, and three cosponsors)
H.R. 1004 – Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017(Rep. Walberg, R-MI, and eight cosponsors)
H.R. 1009 – OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act(Rep. Mitchell, R-MI, and four cosponsors)
The Administration is committed to reducing regulatory burden on all Americans. On January 30, 2017, President Trump signed Executive Order 13771, Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, which provides for repeal of two regulations for every new one issued. This historic step accelerates the retrospective review process to make common-sense reforms to regulations across the Federal Government. Legislation is helpful where it amends agencies' regulatory processes to ensure they are transparent, and appropriately balance costs and benefits.
Each of these bills would address different aspects of the regulatory process. The SCRUB Act, H.R. 998, addresses the numerous outdated, duplicative, and otherwise unnecessary regulations that have accumulated throughout government. The Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017, H.R. 1004, would restrict the use of agency funds to advocate on behalf of regulations, and the OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act, H.R. 1009, would codify specific executive branch regulatory review procedures.
The Administration supports the SCRUB Act, the Regulatory Integrity Act, and the OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on technical and other amendments to these bills.
The Administration appreciates the efforts of the Congress to rationalize the regulatory system and looks forward to continuing to work together to reform the regulatory process.
