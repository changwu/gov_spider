    I want to commend Speaker Tip O'Neill, Congressmen James Corman and Charles Rangel, and the other Members of the House of Representatives for the passage this evening of my cash assistance reform proposal.
This is a crucial step forward in the Nation's 10-year effort to provide vitally needed reform of the welfare system. When enacted, this proposal will
—lift 2 million families above the poverty line, —provide added income for 1.6 million elderly Americans by providing cash payments instead of food stamp eligibility,
—tighten and streamline administrative requirements resulting in savings of hundreds of millions of dollars, and,
—provide fiscal relief for States with the heaviest welfare costs. I look forward to speedy House consideration of the companion jobs legislation, which is critically important to our reform program, and to Senate action on my entire welfare reform package.
Even in this period of necessary fiscal stringency, we must not fail to do what we can for those who are most in need.
