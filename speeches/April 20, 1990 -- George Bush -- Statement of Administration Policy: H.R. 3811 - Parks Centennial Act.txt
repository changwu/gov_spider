    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Pashayan (R) CA and 4 others)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3811, which provides for celebrating the centennials of National Park System units. The Administration will, however, seek amendments in the Senate to:

—  Clarify that the roles of the centennial commissions are purely advisory. This clarification would ensure that section 2(b) does not violate the Appointments Clause of the Constitution.
—  Amend section 7 to authorize, instead of require, the President to issue commemorative proclamations.
—  Eliminate the earmarking and automatic appropriation of excess receipts from the sale of the centennial histories of park units (section 6).
—  Modify section 5 to authorize, rather than require, the Secretary of the Interior to contract for the preparation of centennial histories. It is not clear that each of the 355 units of the National Park System will warrant the preparation of such a history.
