    Memorandum for the Secretary of the Treasury
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Constitution and under section 8(a)(4) of the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967, as amended (22 U.S.C. 1978(a)(4)), I decided on April 11, 1994, to prohibit the bringing or importation into the United States of fish and wildlife products of Taiwan. I hereby direct you, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, to prohibit the importation of fish or wildlife, as defined in 16 U.S.C. 3371 and 50 CFR 10.12, and their parts and products, of Taiwan to which, but for these prohibitions, the import declaration requirements in 50 CFR 14.61 would apply. These prohibitions do not apply to those articles described in 50 CFR 14.62, which are excepted from the import declaration requirements. The prohibited articles include but are not limited to: (a) reptile leather shoes, handbags, and other reptile leather articles and products; (b) jewelry made from coral, mussel shells, and bone; (c) edible frogs' legs; (d) live goldfish and tropical fish for the aquarium trade; and (e) bird feathers, down, and specimens. These import prohibitions shall apply to fish or wildlife and their parts and products as described above that are exported to the United States after 10 days from the date of the publication of this memorandum and shall remain in effect until such time as I determine.
You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
THE WHITE HOUSE,
Washington, August 2, 1994.
