    To the voters who gave us their overwhelming support today, Barbara and I say thank you. We are especially grateful to those who have given so much of their time and energy to our cause. Because of your efforts, we are winners again tonight.
As a party and a Nation, let us turn our attention to our future. We must focus on the complex task of job creation in this country. Congress must act on my economic stimulus plan. We need action on housing, crime, health care, education, and a host of other issues. The voters of eight States have declared their support for my proposals on behalf of jobs, family, and peace. I pledge to them my best efforts to focus the Presidency on these challenges and to provide a more secure future for all Americans.
