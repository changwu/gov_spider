    The President today met with his counterterrorism and homeland security teams as part of the Administration's regular review of threats posed by ISIL, al-Qa'ida, and other terrorist groups to the United States, U.S. persons overseas, and to our allies and partners. Noting the recent spate of heinous attacks in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia, the President directed his team to ensure we remain vigilant and best postured to defend against such attacks in the Homeland. He stressed the imperative of continuing to increase battlefield pressure on ISIL and other terrorist groups as well as making further progress against terrorist efforts to recruit, radicalize and mobilize individuals to violence. Additionally, the President's team updated him on security preparations and U.S. support to the Government of Brazil as athletes and spectators from around the world travel to Rio de Janeiro for the upcoming Olympic Games. In this context, the President also was briefed on our efforts to protect against the spread of Zika.
