WH Pool Report 1 - Good morning!
Welcome to this brisk morning at the White House. Clear skies and a chilling wind greet your pooler. The pool has been tested for COVID-19.
No public events on the schedule. Should be a quiet one here, though I'll let you know if anything changes. Anything's possible.
Feel free to toss any questions my way. Cheers.

WH pool report 2 - Medal of Freedom event
A White House aide confirms on background news first reported by our friends at CNN: Trump will be awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to golfers Annika Sorenstam and Gary Player, as well as Olympic athlete Babe Zaharias, at the White House today.
No more info beyond that but will keep everyone updated if there are changes. Still all quiet here in the briefing room.

Kayleigh exited at 5:19 pm the briefing room after delivering a statement on the violence at the Capitol yesterday. She took no questions, despite our yells-- to be clear, your pooler does not consider what just happened a "briefing."
