    The United States is prepared to send to the Soviet Union this month a team of private and public sector experts in the field of food distribution and marketing. The team's mission will be to assess the problems of food distribution, and provide technical assistance to central, republic, and local authorities in the Soviet Union.
The team will identify ways to strengthen and support market forces in the Soviet Union's food marketing system, consider alternatives to assist vulnerable populations, and recommend measures to improve the availability of food to the Soviet people.
The team will include experts from the U.S. private sector, universities, private voluntary organizations, and the U.S. Government. Team members will work closely with Soviet Government officials, as well as officials of the republic governments.
