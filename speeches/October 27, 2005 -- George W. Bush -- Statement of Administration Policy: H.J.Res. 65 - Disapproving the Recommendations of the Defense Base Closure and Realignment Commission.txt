    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. LaHood (R) IL)
The Administration strongly opposes H.J.Res. 65, which would disapprove the recommendations of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) Commission. This legislation would prevent BRAC implementation and attendant mission improvements, thereby costing taxpayers more money over the long-term. It would harm U.S. national security interests by preventing improvements designed to address the new demands of war against extremists and other 21st century needs. If H.J.Res. 65 were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that the President veto the bill.
Current basing arrangements are primarily designed for the Cold War, and the military must transform to meet the new demands. Implementation of these recommendations is critical to secure funds for readiness, modernization, and quality-of-life priority programs and to allow the Department to transform its base infrastructure to match changing mission requirements for the Global War on Terror. This process is important to making sure the United States continues to have the best-trained, best-equipped, and best military in the world to address the threats of this day and age.
