    Miss Barbara Davis may be appointed to a suitable position in the Department of Commerce without regard to the provisions of the civil service rules.
Miss Davis is a daughter of the late Dr. William H. Davis, who at the time of his death, January 8, 1929, was chief statistician in the Bureau of the Census. This order is issued upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Commerce, who believes it to be an appropriate expression of appreciation of meritorious service rendered by her father. The Civil Service Commission cannot concur, its recommendations for waivers being limited to those cases where the needs of the service cannot be met by the usual procedure under the civil service rules.
