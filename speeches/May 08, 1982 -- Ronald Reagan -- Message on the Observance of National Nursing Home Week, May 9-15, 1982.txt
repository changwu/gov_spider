    In observing National Nursing Home Week, we call to mind the special needs of the frail and elderly men and women who live in nursing homes and acknowledge that we all can play a part in meeting those needs.
We often forget that nursing home residents need more than medical care. They also have special social and human needs. Friends and relatives and dedicated staff members can do a great deal. But varied social contacts add to health and contentment, and we all can contribute as members of our communities by volunteering our time or other help.
As we observe National Nursing Home Week, please join me in honoring those who live in nursing homes and in working to assure them the quality of care and compassion they so richly deserve.
