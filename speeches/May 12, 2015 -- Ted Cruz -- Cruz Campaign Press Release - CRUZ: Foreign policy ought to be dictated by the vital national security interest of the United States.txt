HOUSTON, Texas — Today, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, appeared on the Kelly File where he discussed his approach to America's foreign policy and more. In particular, Sen. Cruz said:
"I think foreign policy ought to be dictated by the vital national security interest of the United States.
"If and when military action is required, number one, we should be reluctant to use military power — America always has been. You know it is worth noting the biggest country Reagan ever invaded was Grenada.
"But if and when we're required to use military force, it should be with a clearly defined objective. It should be with overwhelming force, and then we should get the heck out. It is not the job of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines to transform foreign nations into democratic utopias. It's [their] job to hunt down and kill terrorists who want to murder Americans before they can carry out jihad."
