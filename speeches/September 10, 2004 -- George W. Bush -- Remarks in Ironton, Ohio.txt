    The President. Thank you all. I'm glad you all are here. Thanks for coming out. I want to introduce you—you know your Senator, Mike DeWine. This is my friend Senator Zell Miller from Georgia. One Republican, one Democrat, all united to making this country a better place for everybody.
Thank you all for coming out to say hello. We're here to ask for the vote in Ironton, Ohio, and I appreciate you giving me a chance.
We've got plans to make this world a safer place, a stronger place, and a better place for every American. I'm here to ask for your help. I'd like to—I'd like your support, I appreciate your prayers. May God bless you, and may God continue to bless our great country. Thanks for coming out to say hello. I appreciate you. Thank you all.
Thank you, Mayor. I appreciate you coming.
Mayor John W. Elam. President Bush, it is certainly an honor to have you here. We're looking forward to 4 more years.
The President. Thank you, sir.
Mayor Elam. I have a proclamation here that I know will take awhile to read. And I would also like to present you with a key to the city of Ironton.
The President. Oh, yes. Thanks for coming out. God bless.
