    The American maritime industry plays an important role in our Nation's economy and security. Under Secretary Pena's leadership, we have made significant progress implementing a program that enhances the competitiveness of American shipyards in the international commercial market. But our work is not complete.
Congress still must act to ensure a maritime presence in the United States' vast international trade. It must act to ensure that a fleet of U.S.flag merchant ships, crewed by skilled American seafarers, stands ready to serve our country's economic and military sealift needs. The administration looks forward to working with the next Congress to enact legislation that achieves these important goals.
