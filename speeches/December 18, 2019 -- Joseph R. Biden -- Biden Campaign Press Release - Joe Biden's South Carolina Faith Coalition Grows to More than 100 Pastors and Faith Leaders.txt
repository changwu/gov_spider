    Today, Biden for President is announcing 62 South Carolina pastors and faith leaders are endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States. The latest endorsements join 43 previously announced faith leaders, growing Biden's faith coalition to 105 pastors and faith leaders from every region of the state.
"A faith coalition this broad is unprecedented and isn't limited to one denomination," said Rev. Michael McClain, South Carolina Faith Outreach Director, Biden for President. "South Carolina pastors and faith leaders are uniting around Joe Biden in record numbers because the very soul of our nation is at stake in this election and they know he is the only one who can restore it. In Joe Biden they see a leader who cares first about the least of these."
"Our faith coalition will be critical to our campaign in the final 80 days before election day," said Kendall Corley, South Carolina State Director, Biden for President. "Grassroots organizing in South Carolina often starts in the faith community. This unprecedented number of pastors and faith leaders supporting Joe Biden will undoubtedly give us a strong advantage on the ground."
