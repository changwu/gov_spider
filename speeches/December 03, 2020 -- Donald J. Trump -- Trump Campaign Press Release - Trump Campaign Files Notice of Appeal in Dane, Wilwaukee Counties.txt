    This afternoon the Trump campaign, at the direction of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, filed "Notices of Appeal" from the presidential recount in both Dane and Milwaukee Counties.
Following established practice, the campaign also formally requested that Wisconsin Supreme Court Patience D. Roggensack "appoint a circuit judge, who shall be a reserve judge if available, to hear the appeal."
The campaign also requested an expedited schedule for a scheduling conference for the appointed judge to set a schedule for further steps including, but not limited to dates for filing the complaint, filing for an answer, submitting evidence, hearings, and other necessary steps.
"As the Supreme Court directed, we have filed an appeal in Dane and Milwaukee Counties as we work to ensure only legal votes count in Wisconsin. We fully expect to be back in front of the state's highest court very soon," said Jim Troupis, Wisconsin counsel for the campaign. "We will continue fighting on behalf of Wisconsinites and the American people to defend their right to a free and fair election."
