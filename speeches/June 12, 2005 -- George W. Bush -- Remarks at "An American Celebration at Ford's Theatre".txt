    The President. Jeff, thanks for the warm introduction. I like a good, long introduction. [Laughter] Say, listen, if you're ever looking for work, Laura is looking for some new material. [Laughter]
We've had a wonderful time this evening. Thank you all very much. I particularly want to thank the entertainers tonight: Debbie Allen and Geena Davis, Hilary Duff, Josh Gracin, Denyce Graves, Jesse McCartney. Thanks for dedicating a song to Laura, Jesse.
The First Lady. Thank you very much, Jesse.
The President. Pendragons—how about the Pendragons—and Julie Roberts. Thank you all so very much for being here.
I also want to thank our gala chair, Catherine Reynolds, as well as the general cochairs who are here, Karyn Frist, Landra Reid, Abby Blunt, and Debbie Dingell. Laura and I thank the Ford's Theatre Society and to the producing director, Paul Tetreault.
Since we moved to Washington, Laura and I have been guests of Ford's Theatre a number of times, and we appreciate the vital work it is doing. As a working stage, Ford's Theatre provides an important venue for the arts right here in the heart of our Nation's Capital.
I'm really grateful to the members of the Armed Services who participated in tonight's celebration. Our military is defending America and advancing the cause of freedom and peace around the world. We are privileged to be citizens of a country served by our brave troops, and we thank them for their service.
We appreciate the military families who are with us tonight. It's not easy being left behind when a loved one goes to war. By loving and supporting a man or woman in uniform, our military families also serve our Nation, and America is grateful to all of them for their support and sacrifice.
Once again, we thank all the entertainers and the supporters of the Ford's Theatre who have made this evening one to remember. May God bless you all, and may God continue to bless the United States.
