    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to submit to the Congress the Seventh Annual Report of the National Science Board entitled, "Science Indicators 1974." It has been prepared in accordance with Section 4(g) of the National Science Foundation Act, as amended by Public Law 90-407.
This report is a part of a continuing effort by the National Science Board to develop a statistical and comparative picture of the status of American science and technology. On balance, the data in this report and other evidence indicate that the nation's research and development enterprise continues to be productive and competitive. The report also shows the unfortunate fact that inflation, and the recent recession have affected adversely the level of effort and the resources that are devoted to the nation's research and development activities-much the same as other programs have been affected. Fortunately, we are making solid progress in correcting these problems and the prospects for the future are very good.
The nation's research and development efforts are important to the growth of our economy, the future welfare of our citizens, and the maintenance of a strong defense. The nation must also have a strong effort in basic research to provide the new knowledge which is essential for scientific and technological progress. My 1977 Budget now before the Congress reflects my views on the importance of science and technology in achieving our national objectives.
I commend this report to your attention.
GERALD R. FORD
The White House,
