    Two months ago, with thousands of U.S. troops standing guard against aggression halfway around the world, I called on the Nation to pray and to ask for God's blessing and guidance as we approached a pivotal moment in our history. And Americans filled churches, synagogues, and houses of worship in record numbers. These prayers, and the support of countless Americans of all faiths, creeds, and walks of life, inspired the hearts and souls of the men and women in the service of our country.
Now the liberation of Kuwait is complete. Offensive operations in the Gulf region have ceased, and American troops are coming home. As they return, and with the hope that a safer, more peaceful world may finally be at hand, it is right that Americans should thank God for the many blessings and guidance.
And so, I have proclaimed April 5 to 7, 1991, as National Days of Thanksgiving. Once again, I urge Americans to unite in prayer and turn to our greatest power.
We give thanks for the remarkable unity of our people throughout the conflict and especially for the strong support shown for our troops in the field. I am confident that our nation will emerge stronger and more united to face the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
Though we thank God that our prisoners are home and our casualties were fewer than widely predicted, we must not forget all the innocents who have suffered as a result of the war. We hope for the immediate return of divided families and for the swift recovery from illness and injury.
Finally, let us look to the future and pray for a world marked by peaceful relations between people.
As we mark these National Days of Thanksgiving, may God bless the United States of America.
