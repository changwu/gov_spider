(Senate)
(Rep. McDermott, D-Washington, and 49 cosponsors)
The Administration supports providing additional weeks of unemployment benefits to Americans who are suffering from long-term joblessness due to the economic downturn. Millions of Americans want employment but cannot find it, and the Administration is committed to supporting these Americans as they look for work and struggle to raise their families and pay their bills. In addition to assisting struggling families, helping unemployed workers is an effective way to boost the economy and an important part of the Administration's broader efforts to move swiftly and aggressively to jump start job creation and grow our economy. At the same time, fiscal responsibility is central to the medium-term recovery of the economy and the creation of jobs. The Administration therefore supports the fiscally responsible approach to expanding unemployment benefits embodied in the bill.
