The job of voters in Alabama's Republican primary on March 13 is simple: They should vote for whom they believe is the strongest candidate -- the man they believe can defeat Obama.
In our view, that man is Mitt Romney.
...
Given an economy that continues to struggle and a Congress at war with itself, Romney's strengths separate him from the Republican Party's other would-be challengers to Obama.
...
Romney, though, could present a serious challenge to Obama in November. He is an able fundraiser and much better organized than his rivals, which reflect well on his competency.
That competency shone through with Romney's rescue of the scandal-ridden 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City. Romney came on board after previous leaders resigned amid bribery charges and left the event with a $379 million shortfall. The Games ended up making a $100 million profit.
In Massachusetts, one of the country's most liberal states, Romney worked with an overwhelmingly Democratic Legislature to adopt sweeping education reforms that included testing and accountability for teachers and schools, as well as incentives for teachers whose students perform well.
...
We expect we'll find that out in the general election, and that Romney will prove to be a strong candidate.
