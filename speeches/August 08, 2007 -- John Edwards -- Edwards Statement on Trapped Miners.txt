    Chapel Hill, North Carolina - Senator John Edwards released the following statement sending his prayers to the miners trapped in Huntington, Utah.
"Elizabeth and I are very concerned about what is happening in Huntington, Utah, and continue to hope and pray for the safe return of the trapped miners. This tragedy highlights the need for increased workplace safety for all American workers, particularly those in mining and manufacturing jobs.
"The law Congress passed last year â€“ the MINER Act -- took important steps to address the health and safety of America's mine workers, but we all know there is more work to do. That's why Congress needs to pass the new Supplemental MINER (S-MINER) Act. We need to prevent tragedies like those at occurred at Sago, West Virginia and Aracoma, West Virginia and create a deterrent for mine operators that try to cut corners, while dealing with the long-term health concerns caused by respirable dust. We cannot rest until the laws that protect America's miners make their work as safe as possible."
"This collapse and rescue effort is a reminder that we must do more to ensure that workers are not risking injury or worse just trying to do their job."
