It goes back to two areas in particular, energy policy and tax policy, expanding North American energy resources, there's more known resource reserves in Canada, the United States, and Mexico than in Russia and Saudi Arabia. You develop that, you drive down the costs of electricity, tie that in with the lowering of the corporate tax rate, which is the highest in the Western world, and you will have a renaissance in manufacturing in this country like we've never seen before. That would be my first step to send a powerful message that we can do this. America is an extraordinary and resilient country and Americans need to hear and know that our best days are in front of us."
