    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Goodlatte, R-VA, and 11 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 3004, Kate's Law. This bill commemorates Kate Steinle, the 32-year-old woman who was shot and killed two years ago in San Francisco as she walked along a pier with her father. The alleged shooter, Francisco Sanchez, was an illegal immigrant who had already been deported five times and had seven felony convictions.
H.R. 3004 would increase the penalties that may be imposed on criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry, deterring reentry and keeping criminal aliens off our streets. The bill is consistent with the Administration's broader efforts to strengthen enforcement of our immigration laws and improve the security of our Nation's borders.
If H.R. 3004 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.
