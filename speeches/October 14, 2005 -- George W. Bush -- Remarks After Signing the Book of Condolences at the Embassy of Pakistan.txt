    Mr. Ambassador, thank you for having us. I'm here to express the condolences of the American people to those who suffered mightily as a result of the earthquake that struck your country. There's been a lot of loss of life, and Americans pray for those families who have lost a loved one.
There's been a lot of damage, and we want to help in any way we can. I told the Ambassador that—reminded him what I told President Musharraf—I said when I spoke to him, I said, "Pakistan is a friend, and America will help." We've moved a lot of military equipment in there. We're helping with humanitarian aid as well. And so not only will we offer our prayers, but we'll offer our help and help the people and help the Government, help this great nation get back on its feet.
Thank you for having us.
