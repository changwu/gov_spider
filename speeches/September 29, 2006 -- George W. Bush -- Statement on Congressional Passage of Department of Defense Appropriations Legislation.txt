    I applaud Congress for passing legislation that will provide our men and women in uniform with the necessary resources to protect our country and win the war onterror. As our troops risk their lives to fight terrorism, this bill will ensure they are prepared to defeat today's enemies and address tomorrow's threats. I look forward to signing this bill into law.
