    HOUSTON, Texas — U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement in recognition of Tisha B'Av:
"To all those observing the mourning of Tisha B'Av, I wish you a time of meaningful reflection on the destruction of the holy Temples and the calamities that befell our Jewish brothers on this day. As our Jewish friends hope for the rebuilding of the Temple speedily in our days, I share their joy in the establishment of a Jewish State after 2,000 years of exile. Especially today, with stakes so high, we can never allow there to be a threat to Israel's destruction. We must furiously fight the Iran deal that puts Israel in jeopardy so that we may never again mourn the destruction of the Jewish State."
