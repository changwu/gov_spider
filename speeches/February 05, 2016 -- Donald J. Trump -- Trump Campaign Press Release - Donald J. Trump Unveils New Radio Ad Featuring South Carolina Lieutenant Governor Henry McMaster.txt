    (New York, NY) February 5th, 2015 - Today Donald J. Trump debuted a new radio ad featuring South Carolina Lieutenant Governor Henry McMaster. The ad will begin airing today in South Carolina. Last week Mr. Trump received McMaster's endorsement. The Lt. Gov. previously served as South Carolina Attorney General, South Carolina Republican Party Chairman, and was the first United States Attorney appointed by President Ronald Reagan.
The new ad focuses on key issues of Mr. Trump's campaign including homeland security, job creation and Mr. Trump's leadership and strength.
Lt. Gov. McMaster joined Mr. Trump at his rally in Lexington County, South Carolina last week, where there were thousands in attendance, to voice his support.
He said, "I am delighted to support Donald Trump. He is a man of accomplishment and speaks the truth in words everyone can understand, instills confidence in the people about our country's bright future, and reflects and believes in the strength and determination necessary for success. These qualities - and his quiet compassion for those in need - are essential to making America Great Again. Now is the time for Donald Trump."
Mr. Trump will be in Florence this evening for a rally with a record crowd expected to attend. The Trump Campaign continues to dominate in South Carolina with all recent polls showing Mr. Trump with substantial, double digit leads in all state polls and great momentum as the February 20th primary contest approaches.
