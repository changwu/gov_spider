    I commend the Senate for moving swiftly to confirm Henry Paulson as Secretary of the Treasury. I look forward to working with Hank to keep our economy and financial markets strong and to continue our efforts to choke off sources of terrorist financing. I thank Chairman Grassley, Senator Baucus, and Senator Schumer for their leadership during the confirmation process. I congratulate Hank and his family on his confirmation and thank him for his service to our Nation.
