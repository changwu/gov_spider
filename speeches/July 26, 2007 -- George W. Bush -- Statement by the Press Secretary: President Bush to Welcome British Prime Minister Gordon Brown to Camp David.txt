    President Bush will host British Prime Minister Gordon Brown at Camp David on July 29-30, 2007, for his first visit to the United States as Prime Minister. The United States shares a uniquely close relationship with the United Kingdom, which is a resolute partner in addressing the key strategic challenges facing our two nations and promoting peace and prosperity in the world. The President looks forward to continuing consultations with the Prime Minister on a broad range of shared goals, including progress in Iraq and Afghanistan, preventing Iran from obtaining the means to build nuclear weapons, ending the genocide in Darfur, and protecting our homelands from the threat posed by terrorists.
