Pool Report 4/brief remarks 
President Trump exited the White House residence at 4:20. He spoke for only about one minute and his precise remarks were inaudible to your pooler. I will send quotes when I get them.
Trump spoke about the stock market, the college football game he is attending, and defended "totally consistent" comments on Soleimani.
At 4:26, Marine One was en route to Joint Base Andrews. The first lady is joining Trump on the trip to New Orleans.

Pool Report 5/Soleimani Quote 
Departing the White House, President Trump took just one question, from John Roberts on the intelligence used to justify the Soleimani airstrike:
"Well, first of all, I think it's been totally consistent. But here's what's been consistent: We killed Soleimani, the number one terrorist in the world by every account. Bad person, killed a lot of Americans, killed a lot of people. We killed him. And when the Democrats try and defend him, it's a disgrace to our country. They can't do that. And let me tell you, it's not working politically very well for them. So we killed the number one terrorist in the world, Soleimani, and it should have been done 20 years ago. We'll see you at the game."
Trump opened his remarks saying:
"The stock market is way up, the country is doing really well, and we'll see you at the game."

Marine One landed on the South Lawn at 2:19, significantly later than scheduled due to additional time spent at the LSU-Clemson football game.
President Trump and the first lady held hands walking to the White House residence at 2:23. He waved but did not stop to talk.
Robert O'Brien and Lindsay Reynolds, chief of staff to Melania Trump, followed.
