    Michelle and I were deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Jim Tyree. Jim was a quintessential Chicagoan, a South Side kid from humble roots who worked his way to the top but never left the city behind. He was beloved for what he gave back to the city that gave him so much, from his work with nonprofit organizations to his service on the board of the University of Chicago Medical Center to his role in giving the Sun-Times a new lease on life. He will be sorely missed, but never forgotten.
Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Eve and their three children in these most difficult of times.
