    The President. I'll speak about one thing: Mrs. Casey. Nothing else.
Q. Okay.
Death of Ellen Harding Casey 
The President. Do you have a question about Casey?
Q. Yes. What was her role in your life?
The President. She played an enormous role, not just in my life, but everyone's.
You know, there's a quote my sister always uses about Michelangelo. It says: He saw the angel in the marble, and he carved, and he set it free. That's who she was. She was an incredible woman, decent, honorable. Her values were amazing.
And every time I would go to Scranton over the years, I would stop and see her. She was a friend.
Anyway, I'm going up or I'm going to be late for Bobby.
Q. Will you come talk to us about Hawaii?
The President's Meetings With Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan and President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea at Camp David, Maryland 
Q. On the Camp David summit, are you willing to share what your goals are for the summit, sir?
The President. Not until I meet with them.
Q. Okay. Thank you.
