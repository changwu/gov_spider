    Clinton NH Support Continues to Grow
CONCORD, NH -- On the heels of last week's announcement that 16 New Hampshire State Representatives have decided to support Senator Hillary Clinton for President, Assistant House Majority Leader Bette Lasky of Nashua announced today that she has decided to support Sen. Clinton.
"I am both overwhelmed and humbled by the incredible support I am receiving in New Hampshire," said Senator Clinton. "I am looking forward to returning to New Hampshire and working with Bette to bring the positive message of my campaign to living rooms and town halls all across the Granite State."
After New Hampshire Democrats gained the majorities in the State House and Senate in the fall of 2006, Speaker Terie Norelli named Lasky, who is currently serving her fifth term, to one of three Assistant House Majority Leader positions. Prior to becoming the Assistant House Majority Leader, Lasky had been the House Minority Whip. She is also currently serving on the New Hampshire Democratic Party's Constitution and Bylaws Committee.
Active in local and state politics for many years, Lasky has been the Chairman of the Nashua City Planning Board, a Nashua City Selectman, and Vice Chair of the Nashua City Committee. She also served on the Board of Directors of Girls, Inc.
"There are a great number of qualified people in this race, but Senator Clinton's experience, vision and passion make her the right candidate to be the next President of the United States," said Lasky.
Bette's husband Elliot, a long time Democratic activist and local optometrist, is also supporting Senator Clinton.
