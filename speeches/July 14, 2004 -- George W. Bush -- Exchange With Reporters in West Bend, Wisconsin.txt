    Purchase at Mick's Candyman
The President. This is spectacular, thanks.
Q. What are you getting there?
The President. I'm just getting, you know, about 400 calories a pop.
Q. I thought you gave up on the sweets, sir.
The President. Well, I'm confronted with excellent sweets. I'll be biking this weekend, in other words. Are you a biker these days?
Q. I'm ready to go.
The President. You are? Record that. [Laughter]
Employee Dot Bradley. You will enjoy these thoroughly. They're wonderful. Just for the President.
The President. I'm looking forward to it.
How much do I owe you?
Owner Davey Bartlett. They are free.
The President. No, they're not free.
Mr. Bartlett. Okay, $5.28 with tax.
The President. How's your business doing?
Ms. Bradley. Wonderful.
Mr. Bartlett. Seventy-two cents is your change.
Ms. Bradley. So good to meet you.
Mr. Bartlett. Nice to meet you.
The President. Appreciate you, candy man, great to see you all. Thanks for saying hi. Good to meet you.
All right, listen, buy something here. [Laughter] Here's how the economy works. You're overpaid. My tax relief has left more money in your pockets to spend here.
Q. Can you spot me $5? [Laughter]
The President. Thank you all. Hey, Tommyâ€”you remember Tommy.
Ms. Bradley. Yes. Hi, Tommy.
Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson. It's always good to see you.
The President. Thank you all. Is anybody going to buy anything here? I'm trying to drum up a little business. [Laughter]
Q. As long as you don't leave us behind.
The President. Leave no reporter behind. [Laughter]
