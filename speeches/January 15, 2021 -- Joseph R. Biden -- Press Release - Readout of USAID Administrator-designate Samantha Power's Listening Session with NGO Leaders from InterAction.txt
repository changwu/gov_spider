    USAID Administrator-designate Samantha Power participated in a virtual listening session with more than two dozen NGO leaders from the InterAction coalition. InterAction is the largest alliance of international NGOs in the United States. Participants outlined their priorities, concerns, and ways in which they hoped to work with the Biden-Harris administration.
Ambassador Power and the participants discussed their shared priorities of responding to COVID-19, strengthening global health security, tackling the climate crisis, addressing the root causes of global fragility, strengthening democratic governance, improving our response to humanitarian emergencies, reducing global poverty, and prioritizing inclusion and integration. Ambassador Power also shared her respect and admiration for the critically important work USAID and its NGO partners do around the world.
Several in the group also applauded her selection, noting the enthusiasm with which her nomination has been greeted in the development community and appreciation for President-elect Biden's decision to elevate the position to the National Security Council.
The participants and Ambassador Power promised to keep an open line of communication, recognizing these organizations are essential partners in the larger effort to address the critical challenges facing the United States and the world at this time.
