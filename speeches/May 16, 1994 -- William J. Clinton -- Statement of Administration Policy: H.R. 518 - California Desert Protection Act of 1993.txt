    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Lehman (D) CA and 111 others)
The Administration strongly supports House enactment of H.R. 518. The Administration will work with the Senate and the House during further congressional consideration of the legislation to resolve outstanding issues and ensure protection of these important public lands and national parks.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 518 could reduce collections that offset spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary PAYGO estimate is zero.
