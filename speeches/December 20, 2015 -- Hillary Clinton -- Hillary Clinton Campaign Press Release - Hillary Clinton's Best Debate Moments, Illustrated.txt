Hillary took the stage for the third debate of the Democratic primary—and she showed that no one is more prepared to be commander in chief and to keep America safe. She tackled everything from substance use disorders and addiction to destroying ISIS and global terror to raising incomes and preventing another financial crisis. Here are some of her best moments, as live-sketched by New York City-based artist Julia Rothman.
She called for commonsense laws to keep guns out of the wrong hands.
Hillary: "I think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us."

She had the perfect response to this question. Moderator: "Should corporate America love Hillary Clinton?"
Hillary: "Everybody should!"

She outlined tough reforms to rein in Wall Street.
Hillary: "There are currently two hedge fund billionaires running ads against me here in New Hampshire. They started in Iowa. Now, you'd have to ask yourself why are they running ads against me? And the answer is because they know I will go right after them, that I will not let their agenda be America's agenda."

She defended the Affordable Care Act—and laid out a plan to improve it.
Hillary: "We have fought, as Democrats, for decades to get a health care plan. I know. I've got the scars to show from the effort back in the early '90s. We want to build on it and fix it."
