    I send greetings to those celebrating the Lunar New Year, the Year of the Rooster.
For many Asian Americans, the Lunar New Year is a special time of thanksgiving and celebration. It has long been an opportunity for families to honor the past and welcome the future. In marking this special occasion, you help preserve your rich heritage and ensure that your values of family, faith, and respect for tradition are passed on to future generations. This observance also reminds all Americans of the unique fabric that makes up our country and the diversity that has made our Nation stronger and better.
Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for peace and prosperity in the New Year.
