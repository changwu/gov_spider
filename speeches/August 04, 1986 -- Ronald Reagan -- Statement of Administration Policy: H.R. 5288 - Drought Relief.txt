    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revision)(House)(Rep. de la Garza (D) Texas and 38 others)
The Administration strongly opposes any legislative action on drought relief. Adequate authority to deal with the serious problems in the Southeast already exists, as evidenced by the actions announced by Secretary Lyng on August 1, 1986. H.R. 5288 is unnecessary, therefore, and would be extremely expensive if fully implemented.
