    We are pleased that Members of Congress from both parties have come together to confirm Jay Powell and Jeremy Stein as members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Today's broad bipartisan vote in the Senate reflects their deep knowledge of economic and monetary policy, as well as their distinguished backgrounds and unique experience. At this important time for our economy we are grateful that Mr. Powell and Dr. Stein will serve the American people in these critical positions.
