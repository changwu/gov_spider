    Today I have signed into law H.J. Res. 374, making further continuing appropriations for the fiscal year 1992.
Providing for the operation of the Government through Continuing Resolutions is an undesirable practice. However, a third Continuing Resolution for FY 1992 is necessary at this time in order to keep certain activities of the Government functioning while the Congress completes the appropriations process.
I commend the Congress for presenting me with a simple, straightforward extension of funding that is not burdened with unrelated provisions. I urge the Congress to complete the ordinary appropriations process by November 26, which is the date this third Continuing Resolution expires.
