    We warmly welcome the announcement today by the South African Government that they are lifting the state of emergency in Natal. We see this as yet another important landmark on the road toward full normalization of political activity in South Africa.
We believe that President de Klerk deserves credit for his political courage and leadership. We would reaffirm our full support for the historic process in which he and Mr. Mandela [leader of the African National Congress] are currently engaged.
As President Bush said on the occasion of President de Klerk's visit to Washington, we believe that the process of change in South Africa has become irreversible. The lifting of the state of emergency in Natal reflects that reality.
