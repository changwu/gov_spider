(House)
(Rep. Black, R-Tennessee, and Rep. Davis, D-Illinois)
The Administration supports making permanent the American Opportunity Tax Credit and looks forward to working with Congress to ensure that students and working families have ongoing access to this and other important middle class tax benefits that are also scheduled to expire in just a few years. However, the Administration opposes H.R 3393 because it is part of a broader effort to pass permanent, unpaid-for extensions of traditional tax extenders that, taken together, would add approximately $800 billion to the deficit.
