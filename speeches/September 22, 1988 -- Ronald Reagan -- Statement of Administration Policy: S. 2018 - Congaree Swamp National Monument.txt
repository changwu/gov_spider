    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Thurmond (R) South Carolina and Hollings (D) South Carolina)
The Administration opposes S. 2018. At the request of Congress, the National Park Service is currently preparing a plan that evaluates expanding the boundaries of Congaree Swamp National Monument. Consideration of this legislation would be premature prior to completion of the Park Service plan.
The Administration supports enactment of the amendments adopted on September 22, 1988, by the House Interior Committee regarding late payment charges under Federal mineral leases, and urges the House to adopt these provisions as a separate bill.
