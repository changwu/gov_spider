    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement today about the announcement by Senator John Kerry that he will not run for President in 2008.
"Elizabeth and I know John's decision not to run for President in 2008 is a difficult one, because we know his first instinct is always to respond to any call to serve his country. He and Teresa have our very best wishes as they concentrate on other ways to continue the exemplary service that has improved the lives of so many in so many ways.
Elizabeth and I forged a special friendship with John and Teresa in the 2004 campaign, both as competitors and as teammates. We will be forever grateful to them for the opportunity to work and fight together in our common effort to change the course of our country. We will forever remember public and private moments all across the country with these dear friends. And their friendship did not end with election day, for no one outside of our family was more supportive of Elizabeth as she battled cancer than John and Teresa.
In the months and years ahead, all Americans are fortunate to have John's experience, insight, and conscience in the Senate as our government tackles critical problems including finding an appropriate exit from the war in Iraq. In Vietnam, in public office, and in private life John Kerry has always fought the good fight for the right cause. Our country and our party need John Kerry, and we are proud to know that our friend will respond to that call as he always has."
