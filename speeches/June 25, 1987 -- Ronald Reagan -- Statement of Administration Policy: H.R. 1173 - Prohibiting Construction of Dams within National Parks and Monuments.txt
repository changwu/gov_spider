    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Lehman (D) California and 35 others)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1173 as unnecessary because:

— existing law already adequately protects units of the National Park System from any adverse effects of water development projects; and
— construction of any new impoundments within national parks and monuments already requires an act of Congress. 
Finally, the bill could weaken existing protections offered by current law for certain units of the National Park System.
