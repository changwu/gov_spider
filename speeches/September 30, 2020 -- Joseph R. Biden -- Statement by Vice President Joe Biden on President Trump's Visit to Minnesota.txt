    During last night's debate, President Trump refused to take responsibility for his mismanagement of a pandemic that has cost Minnesota more than 130,000 jobs and claimed the lives of more than 2,000 Minnesotans. He tried to distract from the fact that his administration is in court trying to eliminate protections for those with pre-existing conditions and take away health coverage from 265,000 Minnesotans in the middle of a pandemic. For those who are worried about keeping their small business open, losing hours at their job, or caring for an aging parent — President Trump offered nothing but excuses, lies, and division.
Minnesotans deserve a president who will bring us together — not tear us further apart — and focus every single day on making their lives better. That starts with coming together to defeat COVID-19 and rebuilding our economy to include every Minnesotan — from Moorhead to Minneapolis, Redwood Falls to Rochester, and Duluth to Detroit Lakes. There's too much at stake in this election to leave anyone behind.
