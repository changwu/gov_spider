    THE PRESIDENT said:
"I appreciate the efforts being made by the American Legion and associated organizations in organizing an intensive drive to begin February 15 to extend employment. Mr. Henry L. Stevens, national commander of the Legion, and his associates have placed the entire organization also at the disposal of the organization that held its first meeting at the White House today. I am confident that the Legion and the organizations cooperating with it will perform a real service in the work undertaken."
