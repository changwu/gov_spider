HOUSTON, Texas â€” Republican Presidential candidate Ted Cruz released the following statement today after sweeping 14 delegates in Wyoming:
"We had a tremendous show of grassroots support that resulted in a critical victory at today's Wyoming Republican Convention. This victory continues a momentum shift that started in Utah and carried through Wisconsin, North Dakota and Colorado. Grassroots are rising up. Republicans overwhelmingly elected delegates who will support us at the national convention and nominate us to take on Hillary Clinton. This is how elections are won in America. This is another step in our drive to win a majority of Republicans to be the nominee."
