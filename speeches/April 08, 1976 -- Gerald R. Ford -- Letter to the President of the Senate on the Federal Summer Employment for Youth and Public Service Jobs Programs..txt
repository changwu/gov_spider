    Sir:
I ask the Congress to give immediate consideration to proposed supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year 1976 in the amount of $528,420,000 for the Department of Labor's summer youth employment program.
The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and observations.
I also remind the Congress that the $1.7 billion I requested in 1976 supplemental appropriations for temporary employment assistance is urgently needed to prevent substantial layoffs from federally subsidized public service jobs by the end of this fiscal year.
Respectfully,
GERALD R. FORD
[The President of the Senate]
