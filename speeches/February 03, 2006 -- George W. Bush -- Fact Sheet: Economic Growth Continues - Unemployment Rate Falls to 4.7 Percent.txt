The President's Agenda To Strengthen A Vibrant Economy
President Bush's Agenda Will Ensure Continued Opportunity For America's Workers And Entrepreneurs. In his State of the Union Address, the President laid out an agenda to maintain the economy's momentum and ensure that America remains the leader of the global economy. The President called upon Congress to make tax relief permanent and to continue working with him to limit the growth of government through fiscal discipline and remain on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. We have reduced the growth of non-security discretionary spending every year since 2001, and last year this spending was cut. The President is advancing pro-growth policies to make the health care system affordable and accessible; reduce America's dependence on foreign oil through the Advanced Energy Initiative; continue to open markets to American goods and services; reform the immigration system and ensure secure and orderly borders; and encourage innovation through the American Competitiveness Initiative, which will double the Federal commitment to the most critical research programs emphasizing the physical sciences, modernize and make permanent the research and development tax credit, reform the job training system, and strengthen math and science education.
