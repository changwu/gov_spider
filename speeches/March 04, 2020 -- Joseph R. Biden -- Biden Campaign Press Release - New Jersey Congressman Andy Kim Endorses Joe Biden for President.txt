    Today, New Jersey Congressman Andy Kim released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"When I worked at the White House, Vice President Biden once pulled me aside and shared his belief that 'all politics isn't local, it's personal.'
"He taught me that to serve the American people meant to treat everyone with respect and to not lose sight of the humanity of the work. I never forgot that moment and I continue to see in the Vice President a true example of a public servant that earnestly fights for the people â€” all the people. I hope to see him back in the White House, leading our nation with dignity and honor."
Congressman Andy Kim also joins Congressman Tom Malinowski as a New Jersey leader backing Biden. Biden leads the field in congressional endorsements with support from more than 55 U.S. Representatives and seven U.S. Senators, including the most endorsements from members of both the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
