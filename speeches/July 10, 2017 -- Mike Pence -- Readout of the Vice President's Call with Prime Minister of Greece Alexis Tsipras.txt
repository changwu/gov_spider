    The Vice President spoke by phone today with Prime Minister of Greece Alexis Tsipras. The leaders reaffirmed the enduring ties between Greece and the United States. The Vice President congratulated the Prime Minister on Greece's progress toward recovering from the economic crisis and thanked him for Greece's role as a pillar of stability in the region, its NATO contributions, and its military cooperation with the United States. The leaders expressed regret that the Conference on Cyprus closed last week without a settlement agreement, and the Vice President underscored continued U.S. support for a comprehensive settlement to reunify the island as a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation. The Vice President extended to Tsipras an invitation to visit Washington, and the leaders agreed to meet in the near future.
