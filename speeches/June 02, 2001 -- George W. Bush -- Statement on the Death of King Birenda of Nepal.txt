    I am deeply saddened and shocked at King Birenda's untimely death. I also mourn the loss of Queen Aiswarya and other family members and extend my deepest sympathies to the King's extended family. I send my condolences to the Nepalese people during this difficult period. Our prayers are with the Government and people of Nepal.
