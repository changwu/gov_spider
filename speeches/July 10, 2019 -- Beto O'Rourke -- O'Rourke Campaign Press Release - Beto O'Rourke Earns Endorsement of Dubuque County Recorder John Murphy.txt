    Announcement Follows O'Rourke's Sixth Trip to Iowa
DES MOINES, IA â€” Following Beto O'Rourke's sixth trip to the Hawkeye State, and his first trip with Amy and their three kids, the campaign earned the endorsement of Dubuque County Recorder John Murphy.
"I am proud to endorse Beto O'Rourke for President because of his deep commitment to issues like fighting climate change and protecting our veterans. He's leading us in a new kind of politics that takes no one for granted and writes nobody off. That's what we need to inspire the Democratic Party and secure victories up and down the ballot in November 2020. Beto is the real deal and I'm looking forward to helping him and his campaign organize across Iowa," said John Murphy.
"John Murphy is a true leader in his community and we are proud to earn his endorsement. We're building an organization that will win in February by going everywhere and engaging everyone. John is going to be an important part of that work going forward," said Norm Sterzenbach, Beto O'Rourke's Iowa State Director.
Beto has taken nearly 500 questions from Iowans in 43 counties since launching his campaign in March and has brought the ideas and experiences of Iowans into his campaign and vision for the country. He has met with Iowans in small towns, big cities, and has held house parties in a variety of areas across the state, including counties that went for President Obama but flipped to President Trump, Democratic strongholds, and rural Iowa.
O'Rourke has also earned the endorsements of the following Iowa elected officials:

Former Iowa Rep. Nate Willems
Linn County Supervisor Brent Oleson
Polk County Soil and Water District Commissioner Lou McDonald
