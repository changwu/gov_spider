    During National Diabetes Month, we raise awareness about this debilitating disease. Millions of Americans with diabetes or prediabetes are unaware of their medical condition. Proper information, combined with improved nutrition and exercise, can save lives. We also take this opportunity to renew our support for the tens of millions of Americans who are currently battling diabetes.
Diabetes, which affects Americans of all backgrounds and ages, is a chronic, debilitating illness that increases the risk of serious, potentially fatal health issues, such as vision loss, heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Nearly 10 percent of Americans are afflicted with diabetes, and it is estimated an additional 34 percent of American adults are at risk of becoming diabetic.
Type 2 diabetes accounts for more than 90 percent of all cases of diabetes in the United States. While there is not yet a cure for diabetes, medical research has confirmed that improved eating habits and increased physical activity can dramatically reduce the instances of type 2 diabetes. Every American should take charge of his or her own care by learning about diabetes, and making appropriate modifications to their diets and lifestyles.
My Administration is committed to empowering more Americans with the tools and research needed to combat all forms of diabetes. We give our support to the medical professionals and caregivers who have dedicated themselves to battling this disease and the scientists and researchers who are on the cusp of great innovation to ease the daily burden of care. We are close to achieving the goals of developing artificial pancreas devices and personalized options for automated blood glucose testing and insulin delivery.
Together, we will fight to overcome all forms of diabetes and ensure a healthier future for all Americans.
