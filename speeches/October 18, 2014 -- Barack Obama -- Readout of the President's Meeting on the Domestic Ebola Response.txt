    The President on Saturday evening convened members of his national security and public health teams to update him on the response to the domestic Ebola cases. The President's advisors detailed the status of the contact tracing process to identify and, as necessary, monitor all individuals who may have come into contact with Ebola patients in Dallas following their exposure. The President's team also reviewed for him the comprehensive measures the Administration—acting together with state and local partners—is taking to ensure that Dallas has all of the appropriate and necessary resources to diagnose any additional cases safely and effectively. The meeting concluded with a discussion of broader steps to increase the preparedness of our health sector nationwide.
