    Today, the President signed the US-Morocco Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. This agreement will help create jobs and new opportunities for Americans by deepening our trade ties with an important friend in the Arab world. Morocco's leadership has been steadfast in its support for economic and political liberalization and with this agreement, Morocco joins Jordan and Israel as our FTA partners in the region. This agreement also advances the President's goal of a U.S.- Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA) by 2013. The President's goal envisions an ever-widening circle of free trade that will help integrate the Middle East region into the global trading system. The openness, prosperity, and hope that free trade will engender will help make the region and America safer.
