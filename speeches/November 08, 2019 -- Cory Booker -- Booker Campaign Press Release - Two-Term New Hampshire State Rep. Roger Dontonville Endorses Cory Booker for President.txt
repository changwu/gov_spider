    Booker earns field-leading 86th New Hampshire endorsement
Manchester, NH â€” New Hampshire State Representative Roger Dontonville (Enfield), a two-term legislator, retired teacher and advocate for growing the economies of rural communities, today endorsed Cory Booker for president. Dontonville believes Booker is uniquely capable of uniting the country and restoring civility in our public discourse.
"After seeing him captivate a packed, 500-person crowd at Dartmouth with his message of uniting our party and our country, it is clear that Cory Booker is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump and heal our country. Cory knows that beating Trump is the floor, not the ceiling, and he's actually shown he can get big things done in difficult environments," said State Rep. Roger Dontonville. "Further, Cory impressed in the last debate by keeping his eye on the prize -- coming together to win in November 2020. I'm ready to help Cory win the New Hampshire primary and become our nominee so we can restore civility in our country and make justice and opportunity real for everyone."
Dontonville represents Grafton County District 10 and is serving his second term. He is the latest state elected official to back Booker in the 2020 primary, and the endorsement comes just one day after Booker announced his plan to ensure that rural communities such as the ones Dontonville represents are places where real economic opportunity can be found. Booker emphasizes in the plan that no one should have to leave their home to find economic opportunity in America.
Booker now has earned a total of 86 Granite State endorsements -- more than any other 2020 candidate -- including three state senators, 16 state representatives, the state's longest-serving mayor, and dozens of key activists across New Hampshire.
This endorsement comes ahead of Booker returning to the Granite State on November 15 to officially file, in-person, for the New Hampshire primary ballot.
