    President Bush will welcome President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia to Washington on March 19, 2008. Georgia is a key ally in the war on terror, particularly in Iraq, and a valuable partner in an important region. The President looks forward to discussing a range of issues with President Saakashvili, including our common efforts to advance freedom and security around the world; Georgia's Euro-Atlantic aspirations; efforts to promote a peaceful resolution to the separatist conflicts in South Ossetia and Abkhazia within a unified Georgia; the Georgian government's ongoing democratic reform efforts, particularly in advance of parliamentary elections; and cooperation on energy security.
