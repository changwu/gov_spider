  A Proclamation

1. By Proclamation 4334, of November 16, 1974, the President modified Subpart A, Part 10, Schedule 1 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202, hereinafter referred to as the "TSUS") to establish, effective January 1, 1975, following expiration of the Sugar Act of 1948, a rate of duty and quota applicable to sugars, sirups and molasses described in items 155.20 and 155.30 of the TSUS. By Proclamation 4463 of September 21, 1976, as amended by Proclamation 4466, of October 4, 1976, the President modified the rate of duty applicable to such sugars, sirups and molasses.
2. The President took these actions pursuant to authority vested in him by the Constitution and statutes of the United States, including section 201(a)(2) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1821(a)(2)), and in conformity with Headnote 2 of Subpart A of Part 10 of Schedule 1 of the TSUS, hereinafter referred to as the "Headnote". The Headnote was part of a trade agreement that embodied the results of the "Kennedy Round" of international trade negotiations. That agreement is known formally as the 1967 Geneva Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and the agreement includes, as an Annex, "Schedule XX", a schedule of United States trade concessions made during those negotiations. This agreement was concluded pursuant to section 201(a) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1821(a)), and was implemented by Proclamation No. 3822, of December 16, 1967, (82 Stat. 1455) which, inter alia, added the Headnote to the TSUS.
3. The Headnote provides, in relevant part, as follows:
"(i) . . . if the President finds that a particular rate not lower than such January 1, 19613, rate, limited by a particular quota, may be established for any articles provided for in item 155.20 or 155.30, which will give due consideration to the interests in the United States sugar market of domestic producers and materially affected contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, he shall proclaim such particular rate and such quota limitation, . . .
"(ii) . . . any rate and quota limitation so established shall be modified if the President finds and proclaims that such modification is required or appropriate to give effect to the above considerations; . . ."
4. Section 201 (a) (2) of the Trade Expansion Act authorizes the President to proclaim the modification or continuance of any existing duty or other import restrictions, or such additional import restrictions as he determines to be required or appropriate to carry out any trade agreement entered into under the authority of that Act, except that pursuant to section 201(b) (2) of the Act, the President may not by proclamation increase a rate of duty to a rate more than 50% above the rate existing on July 1, 1934. The currently applicable tariff rates in rate column numbered 2 for sugars, sirups, and molasses, described in items 155.20 and 155.30, are treated as the rates "existing on July 1, 1934", for the purposes of the President's proclaiming authority.
5. General headnote 4(b) of the TSUS provides that a rate of duty proclaimed pursuant to a concession granted in a trade agreement shall be reflected in the column numbered 1 of the TSUS and, if higher than the then existing rate in column numbered 2, shall also be reflected in the latter column.
6. I find that the modifications hereinafter proclaimed of the rates of duty applicable to items 155.20 and 155.30 of the TSUS are appropriate to carry out that portion of the Kennedy Round trade agreement set forth in the Headnote, and as provided for therein, give due consideration to the interests in the United States sugar market of domestic producers and materially affected contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes, including section 201 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, and pursuant to General Headnote 4(b), and Headnote 2, Subpart A of Part 10 of Schedule 1, of the TSUS, do hereby proclaim until otherwise superseded by Jaw:
A. The rates of duty in rate columns numbered 1 and 2 for items 155.20 and 155.30 of Subpart A, Part 10, Schedule 1 of the TSUS, are modified, and the following rates are established:
155.20 ..... 2.98125?¢ per lb. less 0.0421875?¢ per lb. for each degree under 100 degrees (and fractions of a degree in proportion) but not less than 1.9265625?¢ per lb.
155.30 ...... dutiable on total sugars at the rate per lb. applicable under Item 155.20 to sugar testing 100 degrees.
B. Those parts of Proclamation 4334 of November 16, 1974, Proclamation 4463 of September 21, 1976, and Proclamation 4466 of October 4, 1976, which are inconsistent with the provisions of paragraph (A) above are hereby terminated.
C. The provisions of this Proclamation shall apply to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on and after the date of this Proclamation. However, the provisions of this Proclamation shall not apply to articles (a) exported to the United States before 12:01 A.M. (U.S. Eastern Standard Time), on the date of this Proclamation, or (b) imported to fulfill forward contracts entered into before 12:01 A.M. (U.S. Eastern Standard Time), on the date of this Proclamation, Provided, that articles referred to in (a) and (b) above are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or before January 1, 1978.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy seven and of the Independence of the United States of America, the two hundred and second.

JIMMY CARTER
