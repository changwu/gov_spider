    I was deeply saddened to hear last night of the death of astronaut Deke Slayton, a pioneer in space exploration who helped chart the course for America's pursuit of the New Frontier.
Throughout his career, Deke met adversity with determination, and discouragement with a dedication to never yield his dreams. His commitment to space exploration helped pull the world into an era of new possibilities that grows and expands to this day.
Both Hillary and I extend our heartfelt sympathies to Deke Slayton's family and former colleagues. We mourn his passing, but we celebrate what he stood for and what he accomplished for America.
