    Dublin, N.H. -- On the third anniversary of President Obama's "red line" comments, Gov. Scott Walker released the following statement:
"Three years ago today, in a feeble attempt to threaten Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, President Obama made his infamous ‘red line' comment. Assad subsequently ignored the president's hollow warning – along with a similar threat from Secretary Clinton – and he used chemical weapons to murder his own people. President Obama's meek response to this atrocity sent a devastatingly clear message of weakness to our enemies: you will not pay a price for defying our commander-in-chief. We need new leadership—leadership that will restore American credibility in the world."
