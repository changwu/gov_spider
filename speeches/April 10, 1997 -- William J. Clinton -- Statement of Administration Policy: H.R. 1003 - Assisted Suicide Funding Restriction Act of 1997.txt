    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep Hall (D) TX and 118 cosponsors)
The President has made it clear that he does not support assisted suicides. The Administration, therefore, does not oppose enactment of H.R. 1003, which would reaffirm current Federal policy prohibiting the use of Federal funds to pay for assisted suicides and euthanasia.
