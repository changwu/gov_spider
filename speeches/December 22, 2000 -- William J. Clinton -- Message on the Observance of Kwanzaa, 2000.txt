    Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Kwanzaa.
One of the best ways we can shape the future is to preserve what we value of our past. The celebration of Kwanzaa is a wonderful example of this endeavor. With its focus on the values that have sustained African Americans through the centuries—unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith—Kwanzaa also emphasizes the importance of strong families and communities to our success as a nation in the years to come.
African Americans have a proud history and a rich heritage. During this holiday season, as Americans of many different backgrounds remember and rejoice in their cultural and religious traditions, let us all give thanks for the diversity that is among America's greatest strengths, and let us unite around the shared dreams and values that bind us together as one nation.
Hillary joins me in sending best wishes to all for a memorable Kwanzaa and for peace and happiness in the years to come.
