    Two-minute Message Will Air Across Iowa On Jan. 2nd
The Clinton Campaign today announced that Hillary will make her final closing argument to Iowans in a two-minute televised appearance on January 2nd on the eve of the caucuses. The taped message will air on every 6PM newscast throughout the state.
Hillary continues her "Big Challenges, Real Solution--Time to Pick A President" Tour today with events in Lawton, Denison, Carroll and Guthrie Center while President Clinton will be in Dallas County, Clay County, Dickinson County, Palo Alto County and Kossuth County.
As she travels across the state, Hillary will continue to make the case that in the face of great challenges, she has the experience to make change happen starting on day one. America faces a war abroad and a troubled economy at home -- critical moments that demand a President who is tested, ready to lead on Day 1 and offers real solutions to the big challenges we face. And that person is Hillary Clinton.
