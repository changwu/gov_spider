Elizabeth Warren is being hammered even by the Left. Her false claim of Indian heritage is only selling to VERY LOW I.Q. individuals!Retweets: 20544Favorites: 91859

'Trump could be the most honest president in modern history. When you look at the real barometer of presidential truthfulness which is promise keeping he is probably the most honest president in American history. He's done exactly what he said he would do.'

Watched the debate last night & Beto O'Rourke who wants higher taxes and far more regulations is not in the same league with Ted Cruz & what the great people of Texas stand for & want. Ted is strong on Crime Border & 2nd A loves our Military Vets Low Taxes. Beto is a Flake!Retweets: 20321Favorites: 78161

Ted Cruz has done so much for Texas including massive cuts in taxes and regulations - which has brought Texas to the best jobs numbers in the history of the state. He watches carefully over your 2nd Amendment. O'Rourke would blow it all! Ted has long had my Strong Endorsement!Retweets: 20115Favorites: 80076

Hard to believe that with thousands of people from South of the Border walking unimpeded toward our country in the form of large Caravans that the Democrats won't approve legislation that will allow laws for the protection of our country. Great Midterm issue for Republicans!Retweets: 25401Favorites: 85614

College educated women want safety security and healthcare protections ' very much along with financial and economic health for themselves and our Country.
