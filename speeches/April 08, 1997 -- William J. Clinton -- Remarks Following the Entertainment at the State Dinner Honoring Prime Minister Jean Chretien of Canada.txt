    Let me say to all of you, first, I have wanted Denyce to sing here for a very long time, and I have patiently waited for the chance to get all this worked out. And I heard her sing not very long ago at the annual prayer breakfast here in Washington. And I came home, and I said, "I'm impatient. I'm tired of this. I want this woman at the Canadian state dinner." [Laughter] I don't know whether she had to cancel something else to be here tonight or not.
Thank you, Warren, for your wonderful playing and your artistry. I thought they were a fitting end to a wonderful evening.
Now, let me again say to Jean and Aline and to all the Canadians who are here, we're delighted to have you. There will be music and dancing in the hall for those of you who are capable. [Laughter] And the rest of us will creep off into the sunset. [Laughter] But you may stay as long as you like.
And again, please join me in expressing our appreciation to Warren Jones and Denyce Graves. [Applause]
Thank you very much.
