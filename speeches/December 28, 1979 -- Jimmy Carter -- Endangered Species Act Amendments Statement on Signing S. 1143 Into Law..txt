    I am very pleased today to sign into law S. 1143, a 3-year reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act. This act is one of the most far-reaching and progressive laws ever enacted by any nation to protect wildlife and plant resources. Reauthorization of the act has been one of my high legislative priorities.
In addition to reauthorization, the bill I am signing strengthens our endangered species protection program by including plant, as well as animal, species in the emergency listing and international cooperation provisions. The act also authorizes funds to the Department of Agriculture to enforce provisions related to plants.
The bill revises the procedures for implementing the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The Congress has established a strong and independent International Convention Advisory Commission to advise the Secretary of the Interior on scientific authority responsibilities related to the convention. The scientific integrity of the convention will be preserved by the Commission's advice on the effects of trade, the listing of species on the convention appendices, and the interpretation and implementation of the convention.
I look forward to and will continue to support the implementation of a vigorous endangered species program.
