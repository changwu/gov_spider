    IT IS BOTH my duty and pleasure to express the appreciation of your many guests to both the Commission and the people of Virginia for your bounteous hospitality. The hospitality of Virginia has been the highest expression of courtesy in our country now for more than two centuries.
No one steps upon the soil of Virginia without inspiration from the part she has played in the winning of our liberties and the building of our institutions. It needs only to be remarked that from within a few score miles of this shrine have come five Presidents of the United States. And high character and deep patriotism which directed the events from which sprung these shrines have also-been the inspiration of national leaders throughout our history.
We thank you not alone for fine courtesy but for the inspiration which comes from Virginia.
