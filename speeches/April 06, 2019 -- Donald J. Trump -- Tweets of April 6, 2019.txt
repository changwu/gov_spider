I have not read the Mueller Report yet even though I have every right to do so. Only know the conclusions and on the big one No Collusion.

.....years and $30 million and they found No Collusion No Obstruction. But the Democrats no matter what we give them will NEVER be satisfied. A total waste of time. As @FrankLuntz has just stated 'Enough America has had enough. What have you accomplished. Public is fed up.'Retweets: 17898Favorites: 74117

So the 13 Angry Democrats were investigating an event that never happened and that was in fact a made up Fraud. I just fought back....Retweets: 931Favorites: 3207

Why should I be defending a fraudulent Russian Witch Hunt. It's about time the perpetrators of this fraud on me and the American People start defending their dishonest and treasonous acts. How and why did this terrible event begin? Never Forget!Retweets: 39489Favorites: 161385
