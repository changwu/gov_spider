    To the Congress of the United States:
I am submitting herewith for your consideration a copy of the report of the Secretary of the Treasury regarding the proposed Agreement and exchange of notes with Germany for the complete and final discharge of the obligations of that Government to the United States with respect to the awards made by the Mixed Claims Commission, United States and Germany, and for the costs of this Government's Army of Occupation.
The plan of settlement has my approval and I recommend that the Congress enact the necessary legislation authorizing it.
