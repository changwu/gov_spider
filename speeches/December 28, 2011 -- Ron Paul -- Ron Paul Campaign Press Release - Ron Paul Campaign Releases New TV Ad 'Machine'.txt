    Ad condemns harmful Washington atmosphere and presents Ron Paul as leader with a bold plan to solve our economic crisis
LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign released today a new television ad titled 'Machine' airing on television in the key early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. The ad begins airing today.
The 30-second ad condemns the dysfunctional Washington-insider atmosphere created and furthered by slick politicians, and presents Ron Paul as a leader who has stood apart and above such an environment.
'Machine' suggests that the self-serving actions of serial flip-flopping politicians brought about the current period of government-imposed economic weakness. These politicians are ones that supported corporate bailouts and mandates on businesses, to the detriment of our overall economic health. In glaring contrast, Ron Paul is showcased as a different kind of politician who has always been outside of the well-oiled machine that works for itself rather than for America's needs. Included in the ad are details of the 12-term Congressman from Texas's 'Plan to Restore America,' which makes the hard choices and sets the nation on a path to recovery and lasting, sustainable prosperity.
"Our new ad 'Machine' argues the point that Washington is populated with politicians and well-connected interests that serve themselves rather than a vulnerable public that relies on politicians to create the proper atmosphere for fair competition and growth. In contrast Ron Paul has always been above the fray and promotes policies and initiatives such as his 'Plan to Restore America,' an economic blueprint to help Americans recapture their constitutionally-guaranteed economic and civil liberties," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
