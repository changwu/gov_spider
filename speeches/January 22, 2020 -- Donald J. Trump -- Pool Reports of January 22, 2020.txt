POTUS travel pool report 10/sign and a middle finger salute 
Small groups of onlookers filmed the president's motorcade as it passed back through town. Near the edge of town a lone man stood on a hillside with a middle finger raised high.
Pool saw a message traced in large letters in the snow, apparently where POTUS could have seen it from the air: "There is no Planet B"



January 22, 202014:10

POTUS travel pool 11/a little color from the presser 
It's not much, but for those interested, here are a few bits and pieces:
The presser was in the Jakobshorn room, the same place where Trump did the CEO breakfast.
It was tight - maybe 60 seats - arranged theater style with a center section and two side sections.
Layout was very basic - podium, flags, makeshift lights (lots of extension cords and tape) and some fabric backdrops.
Pool had no notice of the presser before POTUS announced it himself, but was seated a few minutes before staff seated others. There was a scramble to get everyone seated and for TV correspondents to establish connections on the fly, but nothing too dramatic.
There ended up being a few empty seats.

Note that report 15 contained this readout from the White House but did not carry the usual subject line or additional information as we were already airborne when it his my inbox and I was trying to ensure it made it out.
