"Gov. Perry is guided by faith every day as he travels our great country discussing his strong social and fiscal conservative values, record and vision with voters in Iowa and across the nation."
"Faith" Script:
Gov. Perry: "When you run for president, you get a bunch of questions about your faith."

"People want to know what drives you, how you make decisions."
"Now some liberals say that faith is a sign of weakness. Well they're wrong. I think we all need God's help."
"America's greatest leaders have been people of strong faith, strong values. That makes for a strong America."
"I'm Rick Perry, I'm not ashamed to talk about my faith, and I approve this message."
