To Judge Frank Johnson
I have your letter of November 29 in which you request that your nomination to be Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation be withdrawn and it is with sincere regret that I do so.
On behalf of the Nation, I am pleased to express my appreciation for your dedication, energy, and tireless efforts throughout your career with the judicial branch of the government. I want you to know that the people of this country and myself are truly happy that we will continue to have the benefit of your advice, contributions, and services on the Bench.
You have my warmest wishes for a speedy recovery and every happiness in the years ahead.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
[The Honorable Frank M. Johnson, Jr., Chief Judge, United States District Court, Middle District of Alabama, Montgomery, Alabama 36101]
November 29, 1977
Dear Mr. President:
I write to request that you withdraw my nomination to be the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
As you are aware, since I agreed in the middle of August, 1977, to accept the Directorship of the Bureau, it was necessary that I undergo major surgery to correct an abdominal aortic aneurysm. While the surgery appears to be completely successful and I am recovering, my rate of recovery is very slow. It is evident to me that it will be several more months before I will regain my strength and stamina. It will not be fair to the Federal Bureau of Investigation or to me to keep this matter pending any longer.
I want you to know that I appreciate the confidence that you have expressed through my nomination and I regret that conditions over which I have no control necessitate this letter requesting withdrawal of the nomination.
Respectfully yours,
FRANK M. JOHNSON, JR.
CC: Attorney General Griffin B. Bell
[The President, The White House, Washington, D.C.]
