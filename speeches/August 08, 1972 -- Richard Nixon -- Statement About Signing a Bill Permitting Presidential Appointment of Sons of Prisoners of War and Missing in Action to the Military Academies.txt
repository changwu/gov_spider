    I HAVE signed into law S. 2945, a bill which makes it easier for sons of our POW's and MIA's to attend our military service academies if they so choose. Without lowering admission or rating standards, this measure assigns the highest priority to those qualified candidates whose fathers have proven their devotion to their country to the fullest measure.
I am particularly pleased to sign this measure because it reaffirms our country's appreciation of the tremendous service and sacrifice of our prisoners of war and missing in action in Southeast Asia.
This measure is one more reminder that, as a government and as a people, we are determined to do everything we can to help the families of these men who have sacrificed so much in our behalf. Fathers and sons, they both deserve no less from us.
