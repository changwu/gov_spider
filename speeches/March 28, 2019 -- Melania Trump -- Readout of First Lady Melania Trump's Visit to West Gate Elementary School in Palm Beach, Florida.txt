    First Lady Melania Trump visited West Gate Elementary School in Palm Beach County today. In line with the First Lady's Be Best initiative, West Gate Elementary School has a special program designed to eliminate bullying in the classroom.
As part of her initiative, Mrs. Trump has placed a heavy emphasis on the well-being of children and continually seeks out programs that help to improve the daily lives of children. West Gate Elementary School dedicates itself to removing bullying from the academic environment by blocking out time for biweekly meetings between teachers and students in an effort to develop emotional skills, including empathy, in peer-to-peer interactions.
Mrs. Trump visited several classrooms ranging from second grade to fifth grade. The First Lady joined the students as they came together as a class to talk about empathy, teamwork, and positive attitudes. The lower grades participate in daily social and emotional learning initiative meetings while the upper grades come together a couple times a week.
"Thank you to the teachers and students at West Gate Elementary for such an enjoyable visit," said First Lady Melania Trump. "I believe it is important for schools to focus on the overall well-being of our youngest citizens, which will help them develop in their earliest years so that they can reach their full potential as our next generation."
