    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith a certified copy of the Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalization for Foreign Public Documents adopted at the Ninth Session of the Hague Conference on Private International Law on October 26, 1960. The Convention, which was opened for signature on October 5, 1961, is presently in force in twenty countries.
This is the third convention in the field of international civil procedure produced by the Hague Conference on Private International Law to be sent to the Senate. It complements the Conventions on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil and Commercial Matters and on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil and Commercial Matters which are already in force for the United States to assist litigants and their lawyers in civil proceedings abroad.
The provisions of the Convention contain short and simple rules which will reduce costs and delays for litigants in international cases. The provisions would eliminate unnecessary authentication of documents without affecting the integrity of such documents. They would also free judges and other officials, who presently certify signatures, from the time-consuming and unnecessary administrative process presently required.
The Convention has been thoroughly studied by the bench and bar of the United States. Its ratification is supported by the Judicial Conference of the United States, by the American Bar Association, and by other bar associations at the state and local level.
I recommend that the Senate of the United States promptly give its advice and consent to the ratification of this Convention.
