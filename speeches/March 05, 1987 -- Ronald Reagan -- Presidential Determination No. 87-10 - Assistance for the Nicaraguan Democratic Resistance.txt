    Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Subject: Further Assistance to Nicaraguan Democratic Resistance
In accordance with Title II, Section 211(e) of the act making appropriations for military construction for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1987, as contained in Public Law 99-500, approved on October 18, 1986 ("the act"), I hereby determine that the conditions set forth in that Section with respect to provision of assistance to the Nicaraguan democratic resistance have been met, specifically:
(a) that the Central American countries have not concluded a comprehensive and effective agreement based on the Contadora Document of Objectives;
(b) that the Government of Nicaragua is not engaged in a serious dialogue with representatives of all elements of the Nicaraguan democratic opposition, accompanied by a cease-fire and an effective end to the existing constraints on freedom of speech, assembly, religion, and political activity, leading to regularly scheduled free and fair elections and the establishment of democratic institutions; and
(c) that there is no reasonable prospect of achieving such agreement, dialogue, cease-fire, and end to constraints described above through further diplomatic measures, multilateral or bilateral, without additional assistance to the Nicaraguan democratic resistance.
You are hereby directed to report this determination to the Congress. This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.
