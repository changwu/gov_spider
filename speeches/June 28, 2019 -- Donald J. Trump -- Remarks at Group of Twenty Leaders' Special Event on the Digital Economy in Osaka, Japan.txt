    President Trump. Well, thank you very much, Prime Minister Abe. It's an honor to join you and so many distinguished world leaders for this special session on the digital economy.
American success in the digital economy is based on free flow of data, strong privacy and intellectual property protection, access to capital, and innovation. The United States is committed to sustaining this approach to digital trade long into the future.
We're eager to work with like-minded partners around the world to advance these priorities. The digital economy is a crucial driver of economic growth.
At the same time, as we expand digital trade, we must also ensure the resilience and security of our 5G networks. This is essential to our shared safety and prosperity.
Further, the United States opposes data localization and policies, which have been used to restrict digital trade flows and violate privacy and intellectual property protections.
The United States seeks a future of digital trade that empowers all of our people. We look forward to working with other G-20 members to advance an open, fair, and market-based digital economy that provides for the free flow of data and brings new prosperity to all of our nations.
Thank you very much.
