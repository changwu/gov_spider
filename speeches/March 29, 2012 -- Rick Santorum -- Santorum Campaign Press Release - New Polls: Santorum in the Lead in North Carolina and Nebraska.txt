    While many in the media want to write that this race is over, new polls in North Carolina and Nebraska showing Rick in 1st place should make them think twice.
The Wall Street Journal picked up on the North Carolina poll movement and had this to say:
"...The firm Public Policy Polling leans left, yet its recent survey suggests that Mr. Santorum becomes more competitive as the field shrinks. PPP finds that Messrs. Romney and Santorum are now tied for the lead. Says PPP, "Two weeks ago Romney had a four point lead over Santorum in the state. Romney's support has remained pretty steady since then," but Mr. Santorum has gained as Mr. Gingrich has declined. "If Gingrich dropped out of the race Santorum would open up a 6 point lead in North Carolina with 43% to 37% for Romney and 13% for Paul."
We are gaining ground, and as the race moves forward into late April, May and early June the states that vote are much more favorable to our campaign. Case in point, the Nebraska poll shows us solidly ahead 39%-25% over Romney. PPP also pointed out:
Nebraska's another state where Santorum would gain in a big way if Newt Gingrich got out of the race. His lead would expand to 21 points with him getting 51% to 30% for Romney and 10% for Paul.
