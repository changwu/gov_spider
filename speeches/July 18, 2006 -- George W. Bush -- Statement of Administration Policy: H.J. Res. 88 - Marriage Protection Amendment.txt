    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Musgrave (R) Colorado and 134 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of the Marriage Protection Amendment. When activist judges insist on redefining the fundamental institution of marriage for their States or potentially for the entire country, the only alternative left to make the people's voice heard is an amendment to the Constitution. Without a constitutional amendment, judges and local officials could continue to attempt to redefine marriage. The Administration believes that the future of marriage in America should be decided through the democratic constitutional amendment process, rather than by the court orders of a few. The Administration urges both houses to pass the Marriage Protection Amendment and submit it to the States for ratification.
