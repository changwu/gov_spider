    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Never Released 12/11/91)(Senate)(Metzenbaum (D) OH and 10 others)
The Administration supports the goal of increasing employment opportunities for women in nontraditional occupations. The Administration opposes S. 367, however, because it would establish new reporting requirements and a new demonstration grant program that are unnecessary to achieve the goal. The Administration's proposed amendments to the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) would achieve the objectives of S. 367. They would do so by requiring programs receiving JTPA funds to provide an assessment and a service strategy that would take into account each participant's aptitudes and goals for nontraditional employment.
