    Singing Grandma of 1992 Coverdell Jingle Has New Verse for Dole
Dole Jingle Available Via Radio Actuality System
Mrs. Marjorie Lopp, author of the 1992 Coverdell campaign jingle, has added a new verse to her repertoire on behalf of Senator Bob Dole.
At Senator Coverdell's Victory Celebration in 1992, Senator Bob Dole called Lopp "the Singing Grandma" who played a key role in delivering Senator Coverdell's message to Georgia voters. The famed jingle was a staple in Coverdell's advertising and has become a part of Georgia election lore after being awarded a Pollie in 1992. The jingle has been featured on CNN, ABC, NBC, and CBS national TV networks.
"Marjorie Lopp played a key role in my 1992 Senate victory," said Coverdell. "Now she can help us get Bill Clinton out of the White House."
