    Florida Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater made the following statement on Mitt Romney's plan for real change:
"Mitt Romney will win this election. The people of America are desperate for a leader who believes in them; a leader who will champion their creativity, imagination and goals; a leader who trusts in the enterprising spirit of Americans and believes in their potential; a leader who will reduce the load of regulation, taxation and litigation that we have carried on our backs these past four years and set us free to dream it, risk it and build it. Mitt Romney will win this election because the American people seek a leader who trusts in our individual capacity to achieve and our collective capacity to shape a new era of American prosperity. Mitt Romney will win this election because he believes in America and he believes in us!"
