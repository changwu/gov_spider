    Today, Vice President Kamala Harris met with the leaders of a dozen businesses and organizations to announce a Call to Action for the private sector to deepen investments in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. During the meeting, the Vice President and the group exchanged innovative ideas and strategies to support families and small businesses in the region, and lift barriers to investment. Each of the 12 businesses and organizations have announced commitments to support inclusive economic development in the Northern Triangle. Furthermore, they committed to rallying additional private sector commitments.
This represents progress. It is part of the Biden-Harris Administration strategy to leverage private sector commitments to foster economic growth and opportunity in the region -- in addition to strengthening governance, combating corruption, and improving security. As Vice President Harris has said, our goal is to help people in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras find hope at home.
