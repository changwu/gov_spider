    First Lady Melania Trump traveled to Huntington, West Virginia today to visit Lily's Place, the nation's first nonprofit infant recovery center. Dr. Elinor McCance-Katz, assistant secretary for mental health and substance use at the Department of Health and Human Services, and Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the President, accompanied Mrs. Trump on the visit.
While there, they participated in a roundtable discussion with staff, as well as a graduate of the Lily's Place program. After the discussion, Mrs. Trump toured the facility and spoke with two families currently enrolled in the program.
Mrs. Trump stated, "I am impressed with the passion and commitment to serve the community demonstrated by the founders and staff at Lily's Place. By placing a priority on the whole family, infants born dependent on drugs are given the best opportunity to thrive because their parents are also given the support and tools they need to recover and succeed, as parents and members of their community. It is my hope that we can find ways to create more of the opportunities afforded by places like Lily's Place, so that we can continue to help infants and children grow into happy, healthy adults."
