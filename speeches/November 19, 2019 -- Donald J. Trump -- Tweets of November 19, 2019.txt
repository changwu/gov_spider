At my meeting with Jay Powell this morning I protested fact that our Fed Rate is set too high relative to the interest rates of other competitor countries. In fact our rates should be lower than all others (we are the U.S.). Too strong a Dollar hurting manufacturers & growth!Retweets: 18431Favorites: 77306

Nancy Pelosi just stated that 'it is dangerous to let the voters decide Trump's fate.' @FoxNews In other words she thinks I'm going to win and doesn't want to take a chance on letting the voters decide. Like Al Green she wants to change our voting system. Wow she's CRAZY!Retweets: 43090Favorites: 146249
