    President Donald J. Trump applauds the House of Representatives for passing its pro-growth FY 2018 budget resolution today. This resolution is a key step towards Making America Great Again by supporting the Administration's legislative agenda, as it, among other things, drives economic growth and job creation, creates a pathway to fix our rigged and burdensome tax code and establishes a framework for rebuilding our military and securing the border. President Trump looks forward to working with both chambers of Congress to enact a budget as soon as possible.
