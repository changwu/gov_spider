    President Donald J. Trump spoke by phone on July 2 with Lt. Col. Dick Cole, the last surviving member of the famed Doolittle Raiders. The President offered his best wishes and support to this 101-year-old veteran who was recently injured. The President congratulated Lt. Col. Cole on his courage, thanked him for his service, and wished him a full recovery in advance of his upcoming 102nd birthday.
Lt. Col. Cole served as co-pilot of the lead B-25 bomber, piloted by Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle, during the daring 1942 raid on Tokyo after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Lt. Col. Cole and the rest of the Raiders launched their aircraft knowing that they would not have enough fuel to return to friendly territory. Lt. Col. Cole and the rest of his crew bailed out over China and received assistance from Chinese soldiers and civilians, as well as an American missionary in China.
President Trump appreciates the service and sacrifice of all veterans as we celebrate Independence Day.
