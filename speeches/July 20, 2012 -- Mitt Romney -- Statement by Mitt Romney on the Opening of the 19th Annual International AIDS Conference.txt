    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the opening of the 19th annual International AIDS Conference in Washington, DC:
"AIDS is an indiscriminate killer. It takes our young and our old. It leaves behind widows and orphans. And in many parts of the world, it affects those least able to help themselves. Significant progress has been made in research, education, and delivery of medication, but more needs to be done. America is a compassionate nation.  It has been — and must continue to be — a beacon of hope for innovative research and support as we seek to overcome the global challenge of AIDS."
