    Chicago, IL -- On Saturday, September 15, hundreds of homes across the country will open their doors to Obama supporters for "Countdown to Change" house parties. "Countdown to Change" is an opportunity for grassroots supporters to reach out to their friends and neighbors and to help with campaign efforts in early states like Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire and South Carolina.
Each "Countdown to Change" house party will participate in a strategy conference call with the Obama campaign state director from their selected early state and receive a briefing on how they can best help the campaign expand its efforts as the caucus and primary dates draw closer. Supporters will also have the opportunity to write postcards to organizers and supporters in the early states, telling them why they support Barack Obama.
The house parties will be followed by "Countdown to Change" events hosted by Barack Obama in Washington, DC on Tuesday, September 18th; Atlanta, GA on Thursday, September 20th and Portland, ME on Tuesday, September 25th.
