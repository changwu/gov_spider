The unemployment rate is 7.3%, up from 5.0% before the pandemic.
Since February 2020, approximately 337,081 fewer people are employed.
701,000 adults – 9% of all adults in the Commonwealth – report not having enough food to eat. This includes 381,000 adults living with children, or 14% of all adults living with children, who report that the children in their household do not have enough to eat.
An estimated 489,000 renters, or 20% of renters, are not caught up on rent.

More than $5.1 billion in relief for K-12 schools.
Economic impact payments of up to $1,400 per person (in addition to the $600 per person provided in December) for more than 8.1 million adults and 2.8 million children. This is 86% of all adults in the Commonwealth and 84% of all children in the Commonwealth.
