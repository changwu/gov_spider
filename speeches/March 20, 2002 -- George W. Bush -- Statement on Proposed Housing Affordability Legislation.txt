    I commend Chairman Oxley, Housing Subcommittee Chairwoman Roukema, and Congressman Green for introducing H.R. 3995, the "Housing Affordability for America Act of 2002," and look forward to working with them on the bill in the legislative process. Increasing housing opportunities for all Americans is a high priority for my administration. In particular, I am committed to increasing the opportunities for minority families to become homeowners.
The purchase of a home is a unique commitment that benefits the homeowner and the community and ultimately the Nation. My budget contains proposals designed to increase homeownership and affordable housing opportunities. Through their hard work on the "Housing Affordability for America Act of 2002," Chairman Oxley, Chairwoman Roukema, and Congressman Green have joined in this worthy effort.
