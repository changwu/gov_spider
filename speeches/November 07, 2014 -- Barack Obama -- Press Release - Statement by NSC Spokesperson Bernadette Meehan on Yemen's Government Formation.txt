    The United States welcomes the formation of a new cabinet in Yemen and commends the efforts of President Hadi, Prime Minister Bahah, the country's political leadership, and Yemen's diverse communities to come together to form an inclusive government that can better meet the aspirations of the Yemeni people.
We remain firmly committed to supporting all Yemenis as they work to implement the September 21 Peace and National Partnership Agreement, the National Dialogue outcomes, and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Initiative, which collectively form the foundation for a peaceful and prosperous Yemen. All of Yemen's communities have important roles to play in Yemen's peaceful political transition. This multi-party cabinet must represent the strength of Yemeni unity over individual and partisan interests that may seek to derail the goals of a nation.
The United States reaffirms its enduring partnership with the people of Yemen in supporting meaningful political and economic reform and countering the shared threat from al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).
