    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Kennedy (D) MA)
The Administration supports helping needy Americans afflicted with AIDS and other diseases gain access to health care and in providing assistance to areas disproportionately affected by this and other diseases. However, the Administration has concerns about provisions contained in S. 2240.
The Federal Government will pay an estimated $870 million during Fiscal Year 1991 in HIV/AIDS health care costs through Medicaid. The proposed $600 million grant program contained in S. 2240 is not tightly targeted to the neediest individuals and would not be an efficient use of scarce resources.
Additionally, the narrow disease-specific approach of S. 2240 runs counter to the government's existing health care financing system. Disease-specific approaches run the risk of giving existing health care payors (e.g., States, insurance companies, and localities) the incentive to limit coverage for the disease being given special treatment â€” exactly the opposite of the goal we all seek to achieve.
Federal health care financing targets assistance first to those most in need. New grant programs should adhere to that policy while not discouraging Federal/State/local/private treatment financing programs from continuing to serve financially needy individuals. For these reasons, the Administration does not recommend passage of S. 2240.
