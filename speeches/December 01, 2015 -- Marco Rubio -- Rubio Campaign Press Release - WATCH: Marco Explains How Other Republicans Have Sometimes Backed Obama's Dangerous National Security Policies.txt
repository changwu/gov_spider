On Fox News tonight, Marco slammed President Obama's emphasis on climate change as a national security issue:


But even some Republicans are going along with the President's efforts to gut the military and weaken our intelligence programs.
One example: Ted Cruz, who led an effort just this year to take certain important powers away from U.S. intelligence agencies. 
Here's what Marco had to say about it:
I can tell you my position and that is: I stand strongly on behalf of the ability of this government to gather intelligence on our adversaries and our enemies, especially terrorists, but also other nation states. Those [intelligence programs] keep us safer.
There are Republicans, including Senator Cruz, that have voted to weaken those programs. That is just part of the record, it is nothing personal.
The fact of the matter is that, today, we do not know as much as we once did about potential adversaries.
