    Paul voter outreach event attracts hundreds—again
ANKENY, Iowa — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul was greeted by 750 people tonight at his Council Bluffs Town Hall Meeting held at the city's Mid-America Center.
Iowa campaign staff for the 12-term Congressman from Texas reported that the energetic audience comprised of supporters and undecided voters filled the venue to capacity, resulting in a standing-room-only crowd. The theme of Paul's speech — "Restoring Our Personal and Economic Liberties" — was extraordinarily well received, according to Ron Paul 2012 Iowa Chairman Drew Ivers.
Last night at his own 'Salute to Veterans' rally in Des Moines, Paul attracted more than 550 veterans, their family members, and the general public.
