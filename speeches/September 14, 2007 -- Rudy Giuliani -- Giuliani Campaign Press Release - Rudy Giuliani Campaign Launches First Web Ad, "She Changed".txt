    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced it will launch its first web ad, entitled "She Changed." The ad focuses on Senator Clinton's politically expedient positions on the War in Iraq, as well as her support for the ad attacking General Petraeus placed by MoveOn.org in The New York Times.
The web ad goes up at www.JoinRudy2008.com beginning today.
Script and audio link are below.
Script for "She Changed":
NARRATOR: "In 2002, Hillary Clinton voted to authorize military action in Iraq â€¦ because she believed it was the right thing to do."
CLINTON: "If left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons."
CLINTON: "He has also given aid, comfort and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al-Qaeda members."
CLINTON: "So it is with conviction that I support this resolution as being in the best interests of our nation."
NARRATOR: "But now that she's running for President, Hillary Clinton has changed her position, even joining with the radical group MoveOn.org in attacking American General Petraeus. Clinton stood silently by when MoveOn.org ran this venomous ad in The New York Times."
NARRATOR: "The same General she called an expert not long ago."
NARRATOR: "Now, she is questioning his honesty."
HILLARY CLINTON: "The reports that you provide to us really require the willing suspension of disbelief."
NARRATOR: "Just when our troops need all our support to finish the job, Hillary Clinton is turning her back on them. General Petraeus and the brave men and women now serving under him deserve an apology. And our nation deserves better. Senator Clinton, do the right thing. Apologize for your comments and condemn the MoveOn.org ad."
