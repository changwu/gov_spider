    Today, President Donald J. Trump released $50 million in stabilization assistance for Syria to protect persecuted ethnic and religious minorities, and advance human rights. This funding will provide emergency financial assistance to Syrian human rights defenders, civil society organizations, and reconciliation efforts directly supporting ethnic and religious minority victims of the conflict. It will also go toward increased accountability, removal of explosive remnants of war, community security for stabilization assistance, documenting human rights abuses and international humanitarian law violations, and support for survivors of gender-based violence and torture. We hope regional and international partners will continue their contributions as well. Ensuring the freedom and safety of ethnic and religious minorities remains a top priority for this Administration.
