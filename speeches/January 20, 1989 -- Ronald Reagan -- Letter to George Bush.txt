    [On stationary that reads "Don't let the turkeys get you down" with an illustration of an elephant surrounded by turkeys]
Dear George:
You'll have moments when you want to use this particular stationery. Well, go to it.
George, I treasure the memories we share and wish you all the very best. You'll be in my prayers. God bless you and Barbara. I'll miss our Thursday lunches.
Ron
