    HAMILTON FISH ARMSTRONG distinguished himself as a scholar, a diplomat, and an editor. His vast learning, combined with his extensive practical experience, made him a valuable source of counsel for several generations og American leaders. As the inspired and inspiring editor of Foreign Affairs, he was a strong force for a more peaceful, more stable world.
Mrs. Nixon and I extend our deepest sympathy to his family.
