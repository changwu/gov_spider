    To the Senate of the United States:
I am transmitting, for the Senate's advice and consent to ratification, the Consular Convention between the United States of America and the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria signed at Washington on January 12, 1989. I am also transmitting, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the convention.
The signing of this convention is a significant step in the process of enhancing and broadening the relationship between the United States and Algeria. There currently does not exist a bilateral agreement on consular relations between the two countries. The convention sets forth clear obligations with respect to matters such as notification of consular officers of the arrest and detention of nationals of their country and protection of the rights and interests of nationals of their country.
The people of the United States and Algeria have a tradition of friendship and cooperation. I welcome the opportunity through this consular convention to promote the good relations between the two countries. I recommend the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the convention and give its advice and consent to ratification.
George Bush
