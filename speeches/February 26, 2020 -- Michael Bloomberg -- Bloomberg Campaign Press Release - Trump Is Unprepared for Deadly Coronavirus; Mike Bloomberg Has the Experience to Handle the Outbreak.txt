    A new ad released today, titled 'Pandemic', highlights Mike's record as an experienced crisis manager
NEW YORK — In a new 30-second ad entitled 'Pandemic' airing nationally on cable and broadcast tomorrow, Mike Bloomberg 2020 calls attention to the spread of the new and deadly coronavirus. With the virus officially hitting the U.S. and spreading, Americans are becoming increasingly worried for their health and safety — but because of President Trump's reckless cuts to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) funding and his senseless elimination of protective measures put in place following the last pandemic Ebola virus outbreak, the U.S. is underprepared for coronavirus.
Trump is putting American lives at risk every day, ignoring science, claiming the virus will "miraculously" disappear by April and relying on "warm weather" to end the spread of the virus. It is clearer than ever that the country needs a leader with real experience managing a crisis.
"Managing a crisis is what Mike Bloomberg does," the ad begins. "In the aftermath of 9/11, he steadied and rebuilt America's largest city, oversaw emergency response to natural disasters, upgraded hospital preparedness to manage health crises, and he's funding cutting edge research to contain epidemics."
Mike is a proven leader and has a track record on public health spanning from his tenure as mayor of New York City to his philanthropic investments in global health. As mayor, Mike led the city of 8.4 million through the constant threat of bioterrorism attacks, the swine flu outbreak in 2009, and the West Nile virus in 2012.
Yesterday Mike issued a statement on the coronavirus outbreak ahead of last night's Democratic debate in Charleston, South Carolina. Read the full statement here.
