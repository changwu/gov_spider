Boston, MA – Today, the Romney for President Campaign released the members of the Missouri Women for Mitt Steering Committee. In addition, the campaign announced that Mrs. Ann Romney will visit Kansas City on Monday, February 4.
In releasing the Steering Committee, Governor Romney said, "All over the country I'm hearing people say that Washington is broken – and I think we all know that it won't get fixed by sending the same people back just to have them sit in different chairs. I have a record of turning around businesses, the Olympics, and Massachusetts and I can't wait to get my hands on Washington. I appreciate the support of these tireless Republican activists and I look forward to working with them to ensure that we earn the support of as many Missouri voters as possible."
