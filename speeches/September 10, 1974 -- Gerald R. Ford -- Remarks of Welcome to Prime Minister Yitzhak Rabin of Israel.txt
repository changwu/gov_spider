    Mr. Prime Minister and Mrs. Rabin :
It is a very real pleasure for me to have the opportunity of welcoming both of you to the United States.
You are returning as the leader of a great country. You are returning to meet many of your friends over the years that you knew so well during your service here as Ambassador to the United States.
I trust that you and Mrs. Rabin will thoroughly enjoy this visit back to the United States.
The United States, Mr. Prime Minister, has been proud of its association with the State of Israel. We shall continue to stand with Israel. We are committed to Israel's survival and security.
The United States for a quarter of a century has had an excellent relationship with the State of Israel. We have cooperated in many, many fields--in your security, in the well-being of the Middle East, and in leading what we all hope is a lasting peace throughout the world.
Many of our people have a close personal relationship and association with your citizens, your fellow citizens in Israel, and we hope and trust that this relationship will grow and expand.
Over the last few months, there has been movement in the Middle East for a lasting and durable peace. Israel has cooperated; Israel has been helpful. And we hope and trust that in the months ahead, the foundation which has been laid will be built upon.
We want, you want, and others throughout the world want a lasting and durable peace in the Middle East.
The first steps have been taken; others will follow. And I am certain and positive that, as we meet here during the next several days, we can contribute to the building of a better and finer peace in the Middle East.
I hope that you and Mrs. Rabin will have a delightful and warm welcome, which you so richly deserve, in the United States.
