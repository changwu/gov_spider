    Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism John Brennan called Yemeni President Abdo Rabo Mansour Hadi today to discuss the ongoing political transition in Yemen. Mr. Brennan commended President Hadi's continued leadership and reiterated that the U.S. Government strongly supports full implementation of the National Dialogue. He noted that it is essential that all Yemeni political actors, especially those from the previous government, play a constructive role in the transition process, and he expressed concern over recent reports that some former government officials are being disruptive. President Hadi thanked the United States for its strong support and affirmed his commitment to restore stability to Yemen through a political transition. Mr. Brennan and President Hadi both emphasized the strong partnership between the United States and Yemen and pledged that the two countries, together with Yemen's other international partners, will work closely together to confront Yemen's security and economic challenges.
