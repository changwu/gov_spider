    Governor Jeb Bush today made the following statement on the selection of Congressman Paul Ryan as Mitt Romney's Vice Presidential running mate:
"I applaud Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as his Vice Presidential running mate. Congressman Ryan's command of economic policy and the federal budget will prove invaluable as Governor Romney fights to reform government, accelerate job growth and rein in the out-of-control spending that has been a hallmark of President Obama's years in office. This courageous choice is the type of leadership American voters deserve. And, I believe it will ensure a victory for the Romney-Ryan ticket this November."
