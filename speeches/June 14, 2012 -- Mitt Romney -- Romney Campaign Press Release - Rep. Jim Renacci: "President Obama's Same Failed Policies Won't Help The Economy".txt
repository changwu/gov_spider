    Congressman Jim Renacci made the following statement on President Obama's visit to Cleveland:
"I am amazed by the skill with which President Obama takes the same failed, liberal ideas and tries to convince Americans that the results will be different this time. Today, he predictably offered more of the same. President Obama recently said that the private sector in America is 'doing fine.' Before he leaves Ohio, I invite him to visit some of the businesses that have shuttered their doors in our state and talk with the middle-class families who are struggling to make ends meet. Mitt Romney understands the economy and knows what it takes to bring it back. He will lead Ohio – and all of America – to a brighter future."
