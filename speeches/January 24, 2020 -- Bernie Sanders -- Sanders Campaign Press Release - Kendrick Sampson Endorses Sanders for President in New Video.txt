    WASHINGTON â€“ In a new video released on Friday by Bernie 2020, actor and activist Kendrick Sampson announced his endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign for president. Sampson cites the senator's consistency on issues like criminal justice reform over decades.
"He said what was on his mind and he meant it. And he'd been saying it for decades," Sampson says in the video. "I have seen him listen and act and that makes me very confident in his consistency, confident in his values, confident in his purpose...and that he's going to follow it."
The endorsement comes during the 2020 Sundance Film Festival where Miss Juneteenth, Sampson's latest work, is nominated for Sundance's Dramatic Competition. The film is one of seven black-lead films that will compete in this year's festival.
