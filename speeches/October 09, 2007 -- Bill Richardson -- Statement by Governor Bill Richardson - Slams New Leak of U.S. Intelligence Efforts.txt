    Richardson says Bush administration is more focused on public relations than on national security
KEOSAUQUA, IA-- New Mexico Governor and Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Richardson today released the following statement on the new Bush administration leak of U.S. intelligence:
"Beltway insiders like Senator Hillary Clinton who have said that President Bush has made America safer could not be more wrong. From the start, this administration has put photo ops and sound bites ahead of making America more secure.
"Now the Bush-Cheney administration has blown an excellent intelligence source that might have led to Osama bin Laden just to get some cheap publicity.
"It is clear that this White House prizes public relations above the hard work of improving America's national security.
"Leadership should not be about careful political calculation. It should be about bringing people together to solve problems. That is what I have done my entire career.
"As President, I will put the safety of American citizens ahead of scoring political points."
