    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to submit to the Congress the eighth annual report of the National Science Board, Science at the Bicentennial--A Report from the Research Community.
This report reviews the history of research in the United States and summarizes the results of a survey conducted by the Board in 1975 which sought the opinions of research managers on the problems facing basic research in universities, industry, Federal laboratories and nonprofit institutes.
The report reflects the pride of the research community in the tremendous accomplishments resulting from the scientific research effort in the United States, particularly since World War II. The report shows concern about a number of problems facing research institutions in 1975. It also shows the expectations for many more contributions in the future from science--contributions which will be important to the strength and well-being of our Nation.
The thoughtful statements expressed in this report will receive the attention of my new Office of Science and Technology Policy and the new President's Committee on Science and Technology, which will soon begin its two-year examination of the overall context of the Federal science, engineering and technology effort.
The strength and prosperity of the United States which is so respected throughout the world is due in large measure to the contributions of scientific research, I believe this force must be maintained and I have sought significant increases in Federal funding for basic research in my 1977 Budget, in fact, an increase of 11 percent over 1976 estimates. This increased funding would reverse the decline in the levels of Federal support for basic research that began in 1967.
The views set forth in this report will enhance our ability to make informed decisions about the Nation's support of science. I commend it to the attention of the Congress.
