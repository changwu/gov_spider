    Oregon Congresswoman Darlene Hooley reacted to Senator Obama's comments on small town America today, saying they don't reflect the views of her community.
BACKGROUND: At a fundraiser in San Francisco this week, Senator Obama shared his views of Americans from small towns: "it's not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations."
Oregon Congresswoman Darlene Hooley:"I was dismayed by Senator Obama's remarks that demeaned the values of folks from small towns and rural areas. I represent many small towns throughout Oregon's Willamette Valley that are filled with hard-working and patriotic Americans who lift up their communities. Small town values have helped make America the country it is today. We need leaders who will bring Oregon's cities and rural areas closer together, and the type of stereotypes expressed by Senator Obama won't help in uniting America."
