    Today's news that our economy grew at an anemic 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2007 reinforces my fear that we are sliding into a recession. This data confirms that for far too many families, the state of the union is a state of economic anxiety.
I have been calling since early December for Congress and the President to take immediate action to jumpstart our economy. I am heartened to see that the House moved quickly to pass a stimulus package. But we need more than tax rebates and business incentives to fix our ailing economy. That is why I have called for extending unemployment insurance for those who are looking for work, expanding heating assistance for those facing skyrocketing heating cost, and enacting a comprehensive solution to the housing crisis, including a 90-day foreclosure moratorium and a 5-year interest rate freeze on subprime mortgages.
