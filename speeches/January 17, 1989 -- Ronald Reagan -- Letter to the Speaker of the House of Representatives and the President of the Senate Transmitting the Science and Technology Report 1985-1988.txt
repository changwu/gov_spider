    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am pleased to submit the Science and Technology Report 1985-1988, as required under the National Science and Technology, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976, as amended. This is also the first report covering the years 1985 through 1988, in keeping with our intention to restore the intended schedule for this report.
Strong support for our Nation's science and technology has been the policy of this Administration. The goals of this support are enhanced national security, increased economic strength and competitiveness, and improved quality of life. Today, more than every before, we must use our technical resources purposefully and effectively in order to retain international leadership.
This report highlights the significant Government decisions and actions in science and technology and the future outlook in selected areas of science and engineering. It also presents the Federal research and development programs and discusses results and achievements, as appropriate. The international cooperation aspects of Federal research and development programs, including a summary of the associated negotiations and agreements concluded, are given special emphasis.
Our challenge for the future is to draw upon our unique strength in basic science and to accelerate the development of technology and products that will benefit our society.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
