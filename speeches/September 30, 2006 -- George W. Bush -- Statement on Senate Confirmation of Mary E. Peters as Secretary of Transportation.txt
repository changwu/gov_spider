    I am pleased that the Senate swiftly confirmed Mary Peters as Secretary of Transportation.
Mary is an innovative thinker who will work with State and local leaders to confront challenges and solve problems. I look forward to working with her to reduce highway and aviation congestion, modernize our Nation's infrastructure, and increase the efficiency of travel in our country. Her leadership will enable the Department to maintain a safe, reliable, and efficient transportation system.
I congratulate Mary and her family on her confirmation and thank her for her service to our Nation.
