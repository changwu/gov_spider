    Michigan Republican National Committeeman Saul Anuzis made the following statement on tonight's economic debate in Rochester, Michigan:
"Mitt Romney won tonight's debate by laying out how he will help Michigan and the rest of the country return to economic prosperity. I know that rebuilding the economy in Michigan and across our country will not be easy. We face economic difficulties our country has not seen for decades. Mitt Romney has shown throughout his life that he can turn around difficult situations by using commonsense conservative principles. Michigan is personal to Governor Romney – it is where he was born and raised – and I know that he will work his hardest to rebuild the state's economy and bring back jobs."
