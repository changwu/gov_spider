PURSUANT to the request of the North Atlantic Council that I designate a U.S. officer to take the position of Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, I have designated General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower. In taking this action I wish to express both my gratification and agreement with the view of the North Atlantic Council that General Eisenhower's experience and talents make him uniquely qualified to assume the important responsibilities of this position.
