    President Obama. I want to say how wonderful it is to see Prime Minister Noda again. He very graciously called me shortly after the election. And this becomes yet another opportunity for us to reaffirm the extraordinary alliance between our two countries.
That alliance between the United States and Japan has been a cornerstone of prosperity and security in the region, and we are going to have the opportunity to further discuss steps that we're taking to renew that vision and that alliance for the 21st century.
In fact, in April, when Prime Minister Noda visited Washington, we released a joint vision statement that's guiding that effort going forward to further strengthen our alliance.
And I'm sure we'll also have an opportunity to discuss the economic issues that the world is facing right now. As the world's twoâ€”two of the world's largest economies, I think it's going to be very important for us to continue to coordinate effectively to promote jobs and growth, trade and investment throughout the Asia-Pacific region, which has a huge impact in the world.
So I want to welcome the Prime Minister and look forward to a good conversation.
Prime Minister Noda. President Obama, I would like to, first of all, again congratulate you on your reelection to your second term.
I welcome the U.S. policy to place importance on the Asia-Pacific region. Basing on the shared vision that we announced in April, I would like to further cooperate and work in order to generate synergy effects between the policies of Japan and the United States.
With the increasing severity of the security environment in East Asia, the importance of the Japan-U.S. alliance is increasing evermore further. I would like to proceed with concrete cooperation to develop our alliance, and I hope to discuss this with you today.
President Obama. Thank you very much, everybody.
