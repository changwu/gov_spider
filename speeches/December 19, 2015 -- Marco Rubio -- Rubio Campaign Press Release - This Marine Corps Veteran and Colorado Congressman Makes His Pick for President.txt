Colorado Representative Mike Coffman is backing Marco.
What set Marco apart for Congressman Coffman, a Marine Corps veteran? The work they've done together on national security and veterans issues.
Marco understands the threats facing our country and his plan for a New American Century will strengthen our military, keep our country safe, and it's why as a Marine Corps combat veteran and member of the House Armed Services Committee, I am proud to endorse him.
Marco stood with me to pass VA reforms that honor our commitments to the men and women who have served our nation in uniform. Marco is a generational leader and I look forward to helping him win Colorado in 2016.
Coffman isn't the only conservative star from Colorado who's backing Marco: Senator Cory Gardner joined up with the team last month.Representative Coffman, thank you for your service, and welcome to Team Marco!
