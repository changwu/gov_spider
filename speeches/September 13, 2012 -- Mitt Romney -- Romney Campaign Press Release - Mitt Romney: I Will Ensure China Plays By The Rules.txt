I want to make sure our goods can go throughout the world. But I also want to make sure that if a nation cheats like China has cheated, we call them on the carpet and don't let it continue." â€” Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "We're going to open up new markets for our goods and expand our reach into other parts of the world where other nations are now competing. I want to make sure our goods can go throughout the world. But I also want to make sure that if a nation cheats like China has cheated, we call them on the carpet and don't let it continue. And the cheating takes on a lot of different dimensions. I mean, cheating occurs if you hold down your currency. You might wonder, what in the world has that got to do with jobs here? Let me tell you: When China manipulates their currency by holding down the value of their currency compared to ours, what it does is makes their products in this country artificially cheap. And that then drives American manufacturers and American producers out of business and kills jobs. The President's had the chance year after year to label China a currency manipulator, but he hasn't done so. And I will label China the currency manipulator they are on the first day."
