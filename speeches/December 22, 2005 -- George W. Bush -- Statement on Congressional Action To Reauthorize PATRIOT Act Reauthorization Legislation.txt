    I appreciate the strong commitment by the majority of the House and of the Senate to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act. The terrorists are determined to strike America again and inflict even greater damage than they did on September 11, 2001. The PATRIOT Act is essential to protecting the American people against the terrorists. The act tore down the wall between law enforcement and intelligence officials so that they can share information and work together to help prevent attacks. The Senate Democratic leader boasted last week that the Senate Democrats had "killed the PATRIOT Act." Our Nation's security must be above partisan politics. The PATRIOT Act has helped us disrupt terrorist plots and break up cells here in the United States. I will work closely with the House and Senate to make sure that we are not without this crucial law for even a day.
