    I AM extremely pleased that the House of Representatives has finally passed a bill to extend the general revenue sharing program. While the bill which passed the House does not contain many of my proposals for renewal of this critical domestic program, it does preserve the revenue sharing concept and incorporates certain changes I have proposed. I am hopeful that the Senate will proceed to consider this legislation quickly and will examine my recommendations to improve the program. The reenactment of this legislation is urgently necessary in order to avoid serious economic and fiscal problems for many States and units of local government.
