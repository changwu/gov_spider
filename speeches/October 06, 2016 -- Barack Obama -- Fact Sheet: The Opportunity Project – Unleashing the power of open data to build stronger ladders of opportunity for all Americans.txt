    "The reason I'm here really is to recruit all of you...how can we start coming up with new platforms, new ideas, new approaches across disciplines and across skill sets to solve some of the big problems that we're facing today?"
– President Barack Obama at SXSW, March 11, 2016
Today the White House is announcing the expansion of the Opportunity Project and the launch of twenty-nine new digital tools built by companies and non-profit organizations to increase access to opportunity in communities across the country.
Although the poverty rate declined more rapidly in 2015 than in nearly fifty years, too many communities still do not have access to the resources and opportunities that residents need to thrive. The unprecedented combination of open data and technological talent that has emerged in recent years can play a critical role in closing that gap, as technologists partner with community leaders to expand access to opportunity in ways that were not previously possible.
The President launched the  Opportunity Project in March 2016 to catalyze the creation of new digital tools that use federal and local data to empower communities with information about critical resources, such as affordable housing, quality schools, and jobs. By providing easy access to curated federal and local datasets at  opportunity.census.gov, and facilitating collaboration between technologists, issue experts, and community leaders, the Opportunity Project is transforming government data into digital tools that create more just and equitable communities and help people solve problems in their everyday lives.
Since its inception, the Opportunity Project has yielded dozens of new digital tools that help meet needs in communities like finding affordable housing near jobs and transportation, advocating for broader access to opportunity in neighborhoods, and making data-driven investments to increase economic mobility.
Through the Opportunity Project, technologists, local governments, and community groups across the country are answering the President's call to harness 21st century technology and innovation to expand access to opportunity for all Americans.
Key components of today's announcements include:

Twenty-nine new digital tools built by non-profits, companies, and students, use federal and local data to address a set of national priorities identified by six federal agencies, specifically the Departments of Labor, Transportation, Education, Housing and Urban Development, and Agriculture, and the Office of the Surgeon General with support from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Organizations including Great Schools, MapBox, Airbnb, the University of Oregon, and FitBit collaborated with community members to accelerate progress toward these priorities. They created digital tools that help unemployed Americans build skills and find jobs, increase transit accessibility in low-income communities, help families navigate information on the quality of schools, and tackle other pressing challenges.
The Department of Commerce announces its commitment to lead the Opportunity Project moving forward and create a lasting platform for technologists to collaborate with government and local communities using federal open data. 
New and easier ways to access high-value Federal data on civil rights and course access through the Department of Education's new Civil Rights Data Collection Application Program Interfaces (APIs), and combined jobs, skills, training and wage data through the Department of Labor's new OpenSkills API. 
New commitments from federal government, non-profits, tech companies, coding boot camps, and academic institutions to use the Opportunity Project data and create or use digital tools to build stronger ladders of opportunity nationwide, such as the Department of Labor and Department of Education's commitment to co-lead a new Opportunity Project challenge, new funding from Coursera for universities to develop courses that use the Opportunity Project data in their curriculum, and more. 
A call to action from the White House for members of the public to develop new tools, offer additional sources of data, and invent new ways of using open data to make our communities more prosperous, equitable, and just.  We want to hear what new steps you are taking or programs you are implementing in your community.

Measure of America's "Data2go.NYC," a tool that provides up-to-date information on neighborhood assets, has reached tens of thousands of users, including policymakers, social service delivery organizations, and advocates working to reduce poverty and inequality in the city. For example: 



A Councilmember is using Data2Go.NYC to focus on his district's greatest challenges.
City health agencies and organizations used the tool to decide on language translations and dissemination of vital health information
Libraries have used the tool to identify areas with the greatest need for wifi hotspots.



PolicyLink added new datasets to its "National Equity Atlas" to help communities and policymakers understand economic inclusion and access to opportunity. PolicyLink's partners were able to use these datasets to identify opportunities for improving Atlanta's economy. 


Redfin's "Opportunity Score," is a tool that uses Opportunity Project data to show users jobs they can access from affordable homes within 30 minutes or less without a car and helps real estate agents and developers identify communities with demand for new housing within reach of employment centers It is now available in over 350 cities across the country. In partnership with MIT, Redfin also used Opportunity Score in new research on the relationship between job accessibility, housing costs, and economic mobility. 
Socrata developed a tool that allows users to access geographic opportunity data programmatically or via API. Tens of thousands of users have accessed the Open Data Network since Socrata included Opportunity Project data.

Highlights of progress on commitments made in March 2016 to develop new tools, offer additional sources of data, and deepen community engagement through the use of the data:

Code for America launched an Opportunity Project challenge as part of the National Day of Civic Hacking, a nationwide day of action when software developers, federal and local governments, designers, non-profits, and residents collaborate on challenges posed by federal agencies and local governments. For example, in Austin, 250 people used the Opportunity Project's data to build an app, "impactmap.us", for corporate giving campaigns to make smarter, local giving decisions based on actual needs and real data. 
The Los Angeles Promise Zone partnered on #Hack4Equality, a seven-week hackathon to combat issues in the LGBTQ community through technology development. Nearly 300 developers used open data from the Opportunity Project to build innovative applications that would tackle LGBTQ homelessness and inequality. The grand prize winner was "LooBot," an SMS chatbot that seeks to connect those without wifi access to gender-neutral restrooms and locate charging outlets. The runner-up was "Kristening.me," a website that simplifies transgender identity change documentation. 
The National Data Science Organizers (NDSO), a group of connected data science non-profits, meetups, and schools, partnered with the non-profit LRNG to build an online civic-tech course for youth 13-24 years of age. This course was built using Opportunity Project data to teach civic technology and data skills, while helping youth both learn about and serve the needs of their local communities with government data. 
Neighborland partnered with Bay Area Rapid Transit to demonstrate the capabilities of their platform for transportation advocacy organizations. Partners can now visualize open data from DOT, HUD, and Census Bureau through an integration with mySidewalk at no additional cost.
