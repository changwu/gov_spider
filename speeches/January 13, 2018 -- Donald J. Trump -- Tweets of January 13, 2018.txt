I don't believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA. They are all talk and no action. This is the time but day by day they are blowing the one great opportunity they have. Too bad!Retweets: 27380Favorites: 124729

So much Fake News is being reported. They don't even try to get it right or correct it when they are wrong. They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author who knowingly writes false information. The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election!Retweets: 34708Favorites: 148208
