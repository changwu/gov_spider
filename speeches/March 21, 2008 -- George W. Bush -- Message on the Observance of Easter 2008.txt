    "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies."
JOHN 11:25
Laura and I send greetings to all those celebrating the joyful holiday of Easter.
The Resurrection of Jesus Christ reminds people around the world of the presence of a faithful God who offers a love more powerful than death. Easter commemorates our Savior's triumph over sin, and we take joy in spending this special time with family and friends and reflecting on the many blessings that fill our lives. During this season of renewal, let us come together and give thanks to the Almighty who made us in His image and redeemed us in His love.
On this glorious day, we remember our brave men and women in uniform who are separated from their families by great distances. We pray for their safety and strength, and we honor those who gave their lives to advance peace and secure liberty across the globe.
Happy Easter. May God bless you, and may God bless our great Nation.
GEORGE W. BUSH
