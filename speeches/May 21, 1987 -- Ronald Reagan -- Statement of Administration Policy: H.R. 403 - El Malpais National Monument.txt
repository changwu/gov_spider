    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Richardson (D) NM and Lujan (R) NM)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 403, because the bill would:

— include too much private land within the El Malpais National Monument and the El Malpais National Conservation Area, exposing the Federal government to expensive land acquisition pressures;
— require the Department of the Interior to conduct a duplicative wilderness study of lands that have already been studied;
— require construction of two visitor centers when one would be adequate;
— prematurely designate two new wilderness areas totalling over 80,000 acres before an ongoing wilderness study process can be completed;
— fail to release for multiple use management several areas that have been studied and determined to be unsuitable for wilderness designation; and
— unnecessarily restrict land management flexibility by requiring a number of land exchanges that could be completed under existing authority without the additional administrative burdens imposed by H.R. 403.
