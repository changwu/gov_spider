    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Bereuter (R) NE and 11 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports passage of H.R. 254, which authorizes key reforms of the North American Development Bank (NADB) and the Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC). Since taking office, President Bush has worked closely with Mexico's President Fox to make these institutions more effective in addressing the critical environmental needs of the communities of the U.S.-Mexico border region and, thus, improve the quality of life for the region's 12 million residents. To achieve these goals, the two Presidents agreed on a package of NADB/BECC reforms in March 2002.
H.R. 254 will enable the United States to move forward to implement two of the most important NADB/BECC reforms. The bill would allow the NADB to make its financing more affordable by allowing it to make grants and non-market rate loans out if its paid-in capital. H.R. 254 also would authorize the geographic expansion of NADB/BECC activity in Mexico, which would allow the institutions to address important environmental issues that may affect communities on both sides of the border, but whose origin may lie outside their currently defined region of operation.
Passage of H.R. 254 will demonstrate the United States' strong bilateral cooperation with Mexico and commitment to environmental protection, and would strengthen the ability of the NADB and the BECC to perform their important environmental mission. The Administration urges its passage.
