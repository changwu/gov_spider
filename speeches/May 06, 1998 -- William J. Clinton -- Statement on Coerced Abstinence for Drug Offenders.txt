Two States—Connecticut and Maryland—have now joined the Federal Government in embracing tough systems of testing and sanctions for drug offenders. All States should follow their lead, and Congress should support their efforts. The choice is simple: cut crime and drug use by demanding that criminals kick their drug habits, or release drug offenders back into the community knowing they will commit more crimes to feed their addiction.
