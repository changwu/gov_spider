    Your Majesty, on behalf of the American people, I welcome you to this country. We recognize--in you--both a leader of the Arabian people and a custodian of those cities most sacred to Islam. It is an honor to have you here.
We were fortunate, in the United States, in calling your late father, His Majesty King Saud, our friend.
We are equally fortunate in calling you our friend. And I look forward with great expectation to the conversations we shall have here of problems important to both our countries because we value your friendship and we believe out of these conversations should come results to strengthen and reaffirm the friendships that we have with your country.
