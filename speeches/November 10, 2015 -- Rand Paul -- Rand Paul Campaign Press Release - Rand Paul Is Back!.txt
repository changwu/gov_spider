    MILWAUKEE, WIS.- Tonight, Senator Rand Paul dominated the GOP field with his passionate defense of liberty. His strong, factual answers and specific policy proposals to reform government distinguished him as a leader with a vision rooted in common sense solutions.
"I want a government really, really small, so small you can barely see it," Senator Paul said. "I want lower taxes and much more money in the private sector." He held other Republicans accountable for the hidden entitlements in their proposals, arguing against tax credits that would harm growth. He also advocated against belligerent defense spending, saying, "I want a strong national defense, but I don't want us to be bankrupt."
Senator Paul also argued that we must rein in the executive overreach of President Obama's imperial presidency: "So much power has gravitated to the executive branch, Congress is a bystander. We don't write the rules."
Senator Paul will fight for liberty as our Founders intended--governed again for the people and by the people, not the entrenched special interests destroying our nation.
