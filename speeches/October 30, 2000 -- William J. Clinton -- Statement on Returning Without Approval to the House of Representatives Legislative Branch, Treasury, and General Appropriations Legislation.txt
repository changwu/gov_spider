    I am returning herewith without my approval, H.R. 4516, the Legislative Branch and the Treasury and General Appropriations Act, 2001. This bill provides funds for the legislative branch and the White House at a time when the business of the American people remains unfinished.
The Congress' continued refusal to focus on the priorities of the American people leaves me no alternative but to veto this bill. I cannot in good conscience sign a bill that funds the operations of the Congress and the White House before funding our classrooms, fixing our schools, and protecting our workers.
With the largest student enrollment in history, we need ad budget that will allow us to repair and modernize crumbling schools, reduce class size, hire more and better trained teachers, expand after-school programs, and strengthen accountability to turn around failing schools.
I would sign this legislation in the context of a budget that puts the interests of the American people before self-interest or special interests. I urge the Congress to get its priorities in order and send me, without further delay, balanced legislation I can sign.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, October 30, 2000.
