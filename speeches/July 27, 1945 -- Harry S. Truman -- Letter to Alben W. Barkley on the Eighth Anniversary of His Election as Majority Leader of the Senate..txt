    Dear Alben:
Today marks the eighth anniversary of your service as Majority Leader of the Senate. I understand that this is twice as long as any of your predecessors have served. These years have been eventful ones. They have been years of great moment to the United States and to the world.
In all of the recent events which have meant so much in shaping the future of our civilization you have played an important and effective role. Not only have you helped to fulfill the ideals and principles of our party, but you have been willing and anxious to lay aside all semblance of partisanship or desire for party advantage whenever the welfare of our nation required it.
I congratulate you on your past service as Majority Leader, and, also, on your thirty-three years of service in the Congress. The nation is grateful to you for your patriotic share in the accomplishments of these years, and I know that the years to come will be equally fruitful.
With all best wishes for your continued health and success from your old friend,
Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Alben W. Barkley, The United States Senate]
