    Under authority of the act of Congress of June 4, 1897 (30 Stat., 11, at 34 and 36), and upon recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture, it is hereby ordered that on and after March 1, 1912, the boundaries of the Zuni National Forest, Arizona and New Mexico, as proclaimed March 2, 1909, and modified by subsequent proclamation of July 1, 1910, be further modified by excluding therefrom those parts of the Zuni and of the Navajo Indian Reservations included in said national forest by the said proclamation of March 2, 1909, except those parts of the said Navajo Indian Reservation described in Executive order No. 1284 of January 16, 1911, and included in said Zuni National Forest by said proclamation of March 2, 1909, which are hereby retained as national forest land.
The purpose of this exclusion is to restore in all respects the Zuni Indian Reservation and that part of the Navajo Indian Reservation not affected by Executive order No. 1284 of January 16, 1911, to the status existing prior to the said proclamation of March 2, 1909, as though the inclusion of the lands within the Zuni National Forest had not been ordered, and said Indian reservations are hereby fully recreated and restored to that status, with the exception above mentioned.
