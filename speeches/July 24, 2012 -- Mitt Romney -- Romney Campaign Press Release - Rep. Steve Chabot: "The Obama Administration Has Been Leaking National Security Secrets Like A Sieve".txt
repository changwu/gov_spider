    Ohio Congressman Steve Chabot, the Chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia, today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's speech to the VFW:
"The Obama Administration has been leaking national security secrets like a sieve. In his speech today to the VFW, Mitt Romney has made plain what he thinks about this behavior, calling it 'contemptible' and a betrayal of our national interest. This is not a partisan issue.Â  Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, has also been pointing fingers of blame at the Obama White House. I agree with Governor Romney when he says that those responsible for the leaking 'must be exposed, dismissed, and punished. The time for stonewalling is over.'"
