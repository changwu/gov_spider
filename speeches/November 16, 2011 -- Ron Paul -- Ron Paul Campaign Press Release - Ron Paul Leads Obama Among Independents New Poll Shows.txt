    Paul only candidate in GOP field to best the President
LAKE JACKSON, Texas - In a new Public Policy Poll, 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul bests President Obama 48 to 39 percent among independent voters. The poll also showed Paul as the only Republican candidate leading President Obama among independents.
"This is yet another poll that clearly shows how competitive Ron Paul is against the sitting President," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton. "Dr. Paul is making strides not just among Republicans, but independent voters as well. This broad base of increasing support proves that the American people are looking for conviction instead of the typical status quo rhetoric being offered by establishment candidates."
These results follow an earlier Bloomberg News poll showing Paul in a statistical first place finish in Iowa, a key early voting state. Furthermore, a late October CNN/Time poll showed him in the top three in the key states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina.
