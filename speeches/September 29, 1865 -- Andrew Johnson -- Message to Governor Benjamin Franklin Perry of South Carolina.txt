    GOVERNOR B.F. PERRY: I thank you for your dispatch of the 28th instant. I have to congratulate your Convention upon its harmonious and successful amendments to the constitution. It affords great satisfaction here to all who favor a speedy restoration of all the States in the Union. Let this work go on, and we will soon be once more united, a prosperous and happy people, forgetting the past, looking with confidence to a prosperous and harmonious future.
ANDREW JOHNSON, President United States.
