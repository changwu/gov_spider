    On the heels of another record-breaking jobs report, President Trump's re-election campaign launched a new television ad touting the Trump Administration's historic success at rebuilding the American economy. The ad, titled 'Great American Comeback,' contrasts President Trump's efforts to safely re-open the economy with Joe Biden's plans to shut our country down again. While Joe Biden and the radical left threaten to kill countless American jobs and businesses, President Trump's administration is pioneering new ways to save American lives and prosperity.
'Great American Comeback' is part of a multi-state buy that will launch next week in North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, as well as on national cable.
