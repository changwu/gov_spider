    Today I have signed into law H.R. 1654, the "National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2000."
I commend the bipartisan efforts of the Congress to pass a NASA authorization bill that funds my Administration's priorities, including building the International Space Station, improving Space Shuttle safety, reducing the cost of access to space through the new Space Launch Initiative, and investing in outstanding science and technology.
I am disappointed, however, that this bill falls short of enabling NASA to conduct the most balanced, efficient, and effective space program. My Administration communicated significant objections and concerns with H.R. 1654 as it progressed through the legislative process. This bill satisfactorily addresses many of the key concerns; however, it limits NASA's flexibility to pursue a promising commercial habitation module for the International Space Station. It also includes several other objectionable provisions and fails to include all but one of the fourteen legislative provisions proposed by my Administration.
I have signed this bill today because it authorizes funding for a robust space and aeronautics program for the Nation.
