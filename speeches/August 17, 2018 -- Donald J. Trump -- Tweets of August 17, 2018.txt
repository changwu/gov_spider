Turkey has taken advantage of the United States for many years. They are now holding our wonderful Christian Pastor who I must now ask to represent our Country as a great patriot hostage. We will pay nothing for the release of an innocent man but we are cutting back on Turkey!Retweets: 23080Favorites: 87039

'The FBI received documents from Bruce Ohr (of the Justice Department & whose wife Nelly worked for Fusion GPS).' Disgraced and fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok. This is too crazy to be believed! The Rigged Witch Hunt has zero credibility.Retweets: 21100Favorites: 79565

'While Steele shopped the document to multiple media outlets he also asked for help with a RUSSIAN Oligarch.' Catherine Herridge of @FoxNews @LouDobbs In other words they were colluding with Russia!Retweets: 17833Favorites: 62892

'Very concerned about Comey's firing afraid they will be exposed' said Bruce Ohr. DOJ's Emails & Notes show Bruce Ohr's connection to (phony & discredited) Trump Dossier. A creep thinking he would get caught in a dishonest act. Rigged Witch Hunt!Retweets: 21651Favorites: 76957

.@TuckerCarlson speaking of John Brennan: 'How did somebody so obviously limited intellectually get to be CIA Director in the first place?' Now that is a really good question! Then followed by 'Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is a FAKE War Hero...' So true a total Fake!Retweets: 19048Favorites: 72942

How can 'Senator' Richard Blumenthal who went around for twenty years as a Connecticut politician bragging that he was a great Marine war hero in Vietnam (then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a Marine nor ever in Vietnam) pass judgement on anyone? Loser!Retweets: 30040Favorites: 110496

'Director Brennan's recent statements purport to know as fact that the Trump campaign colluded with a foreign power. If Director Brennan's statement is based on intelligence he received while leading the CIA why didn't he include it in the Intelligence Community Assessment......Retweets: 18995Favorites: 71461

In speaking with some of the world's top business leaders I asked what it is that would make business (jobs) even better in the U.S. 'Stop quarterly reporting & go to a six month system' said one. That would allow greater flexibility & save money. I have asked the SEC to study!Retweets: 16741Favorites: 75930

How does a politician Cuomo known for pushing people and businesses out of his state not to mention having the highest taxes in the U.S. survive making the statement WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT? Which section of the sentence is worse?Retweets: 20620Favorites: 78103

The local politicians who run Washington D.C. (poorly) know a windfall when they see it. When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it. Never let someone hold you up! I will instead...Retweets: 18468Favorites: 83128

....attend the big parade already scheduled at Andrews Air Force Base on a different date & go to the Paris parade celebrating the end of the War on November 11th. Maybe we will do something next year in D.C. when the cost comes WAY DOWN. Now we can buy some more jet fighters!Retweets: 15472Favorites: 70688

When a politician admits that 'We're not going to make America great again' there doesn't seem to be much reason to ever vote for him. This could be a career threatening statement by Andrew Cuomo with many wanting him to resign-he will get higher ratings than his brother Chris!Retweets: 21888Favorites: 88873
