    Today, the Vice President spoke with International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers' (IBEW) locals across the country to discuss the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to workers, and to encourage collaboration as we implement the historic, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law which will create good-paying, union jobs across the country. She also talked about her memorable visits to IBEW halls, facilities, and programs through the years, including as Vice President, most recently during a trip to North Carolina.
The Vice President thanked IBEW President Lonnie Stephenson for his leadership, and said she looks forward to their continued work together.
