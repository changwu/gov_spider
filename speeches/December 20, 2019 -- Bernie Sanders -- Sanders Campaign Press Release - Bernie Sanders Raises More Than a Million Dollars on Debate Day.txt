    WASHINGTON – U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign on Friday announced that yesterday it raised more than a million dollars from tens of thousands of contributions – the best single debate day for the campaign all year.
"A lot of candidates on the debate stage last night worked hard to convince voters that our leaders must rely on super PACs funded by the wealthy and gather big checks in wine caves to beat Donald Trump in 2020," Campaign Manager Faiz Shakir said. "Bernie Sanders is proving them wrong every single day. Working class Americans know Bernie is going to stand with them when he's in the White House because he always has and they're saying it loudly by pitching in a few dollars when they can. Refusing to take cash from billionaires and CEOs is a key reason why the senator will earn the trust of voters and generate the enthusiasm needed to win the nomination, sweep Donald Trump out of the White House and create a political revolution to transform our country."
The fundraising total and number of individual donations yesterday was the highest for Sanders' campaign during a debate day in 2019, which is just the latest sign of the momentum his campaign is seeing all over the country.
