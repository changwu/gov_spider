    Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey today made the following statement on President Obama's comments about redistributing wealth: Â 
"Americans got a clear look at President Obama's government-centered philosophy when he told small business owners that 'you didn't build that.' Now we have a glimpse of his long-held belief in redistribution through government. But rather than more taxes and overspending, Americans understand that success comes from a society based on free enterprise, where opportunity abounds and a thriving economy supports upward mobility. They need a president like Mitt Romney, whose policies will create jobs, generate new wealth, and allow people from all walks of life to achieve their fullest potential."
