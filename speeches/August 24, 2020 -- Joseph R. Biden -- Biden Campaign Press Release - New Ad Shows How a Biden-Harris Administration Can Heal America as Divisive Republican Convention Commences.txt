    Today, as the Republican Convention gets underway, Biden for President released a new minute-long ad showing the stark contrast between Joe Biden's positive, hopeful, and inspiring vision for the country and Donald Trump's divisive, harmful, and chaotic presidency has let down working families during the national crises. At its core, the ad is about bringing America back together — a notion that will be lacking from the Republican Convention — and a sharp distinction to the current occupant of the White House.
"Heal America" first shows how the nation is grappling with four major and ongoing crises — the public health crisis, economic crisis, climate crisis, and a national wrecking on racial injustice — and how we need a team of leaders who can step in on day one and tackle these crises. The ad highlights how the leadership of Joe Biden and Kamala can solve these issues and can unite America, heal America, and create a better America.

The ad will air throughout the week of the Republican Convention on national cable channels. It is part of the Biden for President's ongoing national paid media program across television, radio, and digital, with $26 million in spend this week.
