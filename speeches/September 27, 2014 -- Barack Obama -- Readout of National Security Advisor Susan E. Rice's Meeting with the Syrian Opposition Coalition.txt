    National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice met at the White House yesterday with a delegation from the Syrian Opposition Coalition (SOC) led by SOC President Hadi al-Bahra and reaffirmed the United States' commitment to supporting Syria's moderate opposition. Ambassador Rice explained that U.S. and partner nations' air strikes in Iraq and Syria are targeted at ISIL. She also reiterated that President Assad had lost all legitimacy and that the United States remains committed to pursuing a negotiated settlement that ensures a genuine and broadly inclusive political transition. Ambassador Rice and the SOC discussed ways that the United States can support the moderate opposition to advance our mutual goals of countering ISIL and strengthening the prospects for a political transition.
