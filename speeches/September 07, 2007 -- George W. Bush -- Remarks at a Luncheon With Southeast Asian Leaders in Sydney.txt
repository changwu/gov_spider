    President Bush. Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much for inviting me to join the ASEAN group. ASEAN represents our fourth largest trading partner. In other words, this is a group of friends that represent more than just social acquaintances; you represent commerce and trade and prosperity. And I want to thank you very much for giving me the chance to come and talk to you about our common interests and common goals.
I have invited the ASEAN leaders to Texas at their convenience. I'm looking forward to hosting you down there. I'm looking forward to continuing our constructive conversation onâ€”whether it be democracy or fighting terror or expanding trade or avian flu or climate change.
I also am pleased to announce that we'll be naming an Ambassador to ASEAN, so that we can make sure that the ties we've established over the past years remain firmly entrenched.
So I appreciate your hospitality. It's good to be amongst friends. I enjoyed our candid conversation, and I thank you for your leadership in this important part of the world.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore. Thank you. Thank you very much.
President Bush. You bet. Thank you all.
