    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today released a new Spanish-language ad, entitled "McCain, Plan Economico," highlighting ways in which his economic plan will help small businesses flourish during these uncertain economic times. The ad will air on the internet.
"John McCain recognizes the role that Latino small businesses and entrepreneurs play in our country's economic success in an ever-changing global marketplace," said former U.S. Treasurer Rosario Marin.
The ad follows the Cinco de Mayo announcement of John McCain's participation in the La Raza Annual Convention in San Diego on July 14, 2008 and the release of John McCain's Spanish "Estamos Unidos" website, www.johnmccain/espanol .
