    Recognizing the Death of Jan Nowak-Jezioranski
President Bush mourns the passing in Warsaw of Jan Nowak-Jezioranski, a great Polish freedom fighter and American patriot. Jan Nowak's life was devoted to freedom's cause. He was a leader in freedom's struggle in the 20th century from Poland's resistance to the Nazis in World War II through the return of democracy to Poland after 1989, in which he played important roles. Jan Nowak-Jezioranski pursued his values tenaciously, and contributed greatly to the building of a Europe whole, free, and at peace. A longtime leader in the Polish-American community, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996 in recognition of his achievements on behalf of liberty.
