    As you probably know, I am coming West next week to get at first hand all the information I can with respect to the situation in the drought area. We plan to arrive in Des Moines early morning, Tuesday, September 1st, and I would appreciate it very much if you could find it convenient to meet us there for a general discussion of the situation. To this conference I am also inviting Governors Herring, Cochran, Park and Marland.
I am asking Governor Herring, as our host, to advise you as to the detailed plans for the conference.
