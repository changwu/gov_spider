    There continue to be confusing and sometimes conflicting reports that American citizens being illegally held .as hostages might be placed before some type of public trial or tribunal. As we made clear on November 20, such an action would be a further provocation to the United States and to the world community. The gravity of the situation created by the illegal and irresponsible holding of the hostages would be compounded by any such public exploitation of American citizens. The authorities in Iran would bear full responsibility for any ensuing consequences.
As also stated on November 20, the United States is seeking a peaceful solution through every available channel. This is far preferable to the other remedies available to the United States.
