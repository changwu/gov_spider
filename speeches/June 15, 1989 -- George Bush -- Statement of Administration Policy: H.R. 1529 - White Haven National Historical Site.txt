    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Gephardt (D) MO and 7 others)
The Administration recognizes the historic qualities of White Haven, Missouri, where Ulysses S. Grant lived for a time before the Civil War. The Administration does not support enactment of H.R. 1529, however, until a study of the suitability and feasibility of establishing the site as a new unit of the National Park System has been conducted.
