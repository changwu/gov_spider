In town pool report #3 - briefing starting soon
Today's briefing is scheduled to start at 5:30 p.m. It is available on whitehouse.gov/live. Reporters in the room had their temperatures taken beforehand (though no questions about whether we had been coughing or experienced any shortness of breath).

I have asked for more details on the executive order and will pass them on if I get them.
