    Chapel Hill, North Carolina - Senator John Edwards' campaign to transform America continues to gain momentum in the LGBT community. For the third time this year the campaign announced the endorsement of several prominent community leaders from across the country. Tonight at the Visible Vote '08 presidential forum, sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and LOGO Television, Edwards showed why so many LGBT leaders and activists support him for president. This group joins dozens of other national LGBT leaders who have previously endorsed Edwards.
"I am proud to have the support of so many leaders from the community who are committed to equality for all Americans," said Edwards.
"As activists for social and economic justice, we need a candidate who believes in the beloved community, who honors hard work and sacrifice, and who stands up for civil rights," said Hans Johnson, President of Progressive Victory and officer of Pride at Work, the official LGBT organization of organized labor. "As Democrats, we need to put our strongest foot forward in order to set the country on a better course. John Edwards is the candidate equal to these challenges."
The LGBT leaders endorsing Edwards for president today are:

Kyle Bailey, Board member of National Stonewall Democrats
Kenda Kirby, former Executive Director of North Carolina Human Rights Initiative
Hans Johnson, President of Progressive Victory
Greg Gallo, Board member of National Stonewall Democrats
Les Krambeal, Board member of National Stonewall Democrats
Todd Elmer, former Clinton Administration Commerce Department Official
