    Today, former Congressman and Dallas Mayor Steve Bartlett endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich for president and joined the Kasich for America leadership team.
"Texans are looking for a tough, proven leader who stands ready to get things done in Washington," said Bartlett. "For that reason and more, I am proud to stand with John Kasich, who has the best chance to defeat Hillary Clinton in the general election. He is a tested and dedicated governor who turned Ohio's economy around. We can trust him to bring the same commonsense conservative solutions to the White House."

Steve Bartlett represented Texas' 3rd District from 1983-1991. He was the mayor of Dallas from 1991-1995. He previously supported Governor Jeb Bush's candidacy for president.
"I am grateful to have Steve Bartlett's support," said Kasich. "He has a remarkable understanding of what our job creators and small businesses need to take chances, grow and succeed without the weight of government regulations holding them back. He will be a great asset to our leadership team in Texas."
