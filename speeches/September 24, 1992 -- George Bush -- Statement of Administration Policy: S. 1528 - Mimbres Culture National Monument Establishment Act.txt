    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 9/25/92)(House)(Bingaman (D) NM and Domenici (R) NM)
The Administration strongly opposes House passage of S. 1528, which would establish a Mimbres Culture National Monument in New Mexico as a unit of the National Park System. The bill fails to protect sufficiently the interests of the private landowners both within and outside the boundaries of the proposed monument.
