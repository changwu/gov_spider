"I applaud all of the workers who are today demanding $15 an hour and a union. Not too long ago, the establishment told us that a $15 minimum wage was unrealistic. Some thought it was 'pie-in-the-sky.' But a grassroots movement led by millions of working people refused to take 'no' for an answer. Loudly and clearly workers said, 'yes we can increase the minimum wage, not just to $10.10 an hour, not just to $12 an hour, but to a living wage of $15 an hour.'
"And now look what has happened: Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco, California, New York, and Oregon are all moving forward to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
"This campaign is about building on these successes so that everyone in this country can enjoy the dignity and basic economic security that comes from a living wage, no matter what state they live in. That includes ending the subminimum wage for tipped workers and persons with disabilities. And not only do workers need a living wage, they also need a seat at the negotiating table. That's why we must also expand collective bargaining rights and pass the Workplace Democracy Act.
"Raising the minimum wage raises the standard of living of all workers because these workers spend the money, creating jobs and growing the economy."
