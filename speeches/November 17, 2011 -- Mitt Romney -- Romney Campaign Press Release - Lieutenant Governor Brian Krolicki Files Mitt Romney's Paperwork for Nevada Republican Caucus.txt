    Romney for President today filed the required paperwork necessary for Mitt Romney to participate in the Nevada Republican Caucus. Lieutenant Governor Brian Krolicki, Mitt Romney's Nevada State Co-Chair, delivered the paperwork to the Nevada Republican Party.
"This next election is one of the most important in generations, and for Nevada the ramifications are profound and clear â€“ our wounded state cannot continue to endure the current administration's recklessly chosen path that has led to higher unemployment and falling incomes. Today's filing is one small, but highly important, step as Mitt Romney's team in Nevada works to help him bring positive change to our state and to the rest of the country. Only someone with Governor Romney's deep understanding of the economy and job creation can reverse the failed policies of the last three years and begin to rejuvenate our country."
