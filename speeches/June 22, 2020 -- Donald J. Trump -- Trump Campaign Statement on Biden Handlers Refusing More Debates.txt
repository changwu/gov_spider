    "It's pretty obvious that Joe Biden's handlers are afraid to send their candidate out without a script and teleprompter handy. An earlier and longer debate schedule is necessary so Americans can see the clear difference between President Trump's vibrant leadership and Biden's confused meandering. Based on his performance in a Philadelphia speech last week, it's not a question of trusting Biden to answer the phone at 3:00 AM in an emergency, it's a question of whether he can answer it at 3:00 in the afternoon. It's been 81 days since Biden held a press conference and his handlers continue to encourage him to stay hidden. Americans deserve better."
- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
