    The President today made additional disaster assistance available to the State of Florida that was impacted by Tropical Storm Bonnie and Hurricane Charley beginning on August 11, 2004, and continuing, by authorizing an increase in the level of Federal funding for debris removal and emergency protective measures under the Public Assistance program, including direct Federal assistance.
Under the President's major disaster declaration issued on August 13, 2004, the Federal government was paying 75 percent of the eligible costs for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct Federal assistance. The President's order today increases the Federal share to 100 percent of the eligible costs for debris removal and emergency protective measures for the first 72 hours, beginning from the date of declaration. In addition, the Federal share for direct Federal assistance is increased to 100 percent of the total eligible costs.
