    Today I am directing all Federal agencies to take steps to reduce consumption of electricity in California to the maximum extent possible. As one of the largest power consumers in California, it is critical that the Federal Government take every possible step to reduce non-essential power consumption at Federal facilities in the State.
During power shortage emergencies, it also is important that we increase our generation of power in the West, much of which is supplied to California customers. Therefore, I also am directing that Federal agencies that generate power, and the Federal Power Marketing Administrations, take all possible steps to maximize the amount of electricity that can be delivered to California.
These short-term measures will assist California utilities and consumers in meeting electricity needs during this critical period.
