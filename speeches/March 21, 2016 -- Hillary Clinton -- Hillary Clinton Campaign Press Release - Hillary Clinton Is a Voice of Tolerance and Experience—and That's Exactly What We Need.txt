    Let's talk about why.
If you listen to the loudest voices out there today, you'd think we're a country that hates Mexicans, hates Muslims, and thinks that committing war crimes is the best way to make America great again.
The truth is that the only thing that would prevent America from being great would be to empower these voices.
In all of this clutter, there's been one consistent voice. A voice of tolerance and experience, from a candidate who's spent a lifetime fighting for the rights of the less fortunate. A candidate who knows firsthand the complexity of our international relationships.
That candidate is Hillary Clinton.
As this primary process continues, Hillary could soon have an insurmountable delegate lead and with that, the Democratic nomination. That would then make her the only grown-up in the room. And if ever there was a time for a grown-up, that time is now.
On April 16, Amal and I will be getting together with Hillary at our home in Los Angeles, and we'd be honored to have you there with us. Just add your name to win a chance for you and a guest to be there.
The good news is, I'm not cooking.
