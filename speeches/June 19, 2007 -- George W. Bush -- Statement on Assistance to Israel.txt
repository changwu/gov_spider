    I am strongly committed to Israel's security and viability as a Jewish state and to the maintenance of its qualitative military edge. During our meeting today, I told Prime Minister Olmert that I am committed to reaching a new 10-year agreement that will give Israel the increased assistance it requires to meet the new threats and challenges it faces. The work on this new agreement was launched during the Prime Minister's previous visit. I will send Under Secretary of State Nick Burns and an interagency team to Israel in July to lead discussions aimed at concluding an agreement soon.
