That's why Marco led the fight in the Senate last year to pass the VA Management Accountability Act. It was based on a pretty simple premise from the private sector — if someone isn't doing their job at the VA, they can be fired.
Nothing could be simpler. We need to make sure those directly responsible for the terrible performance of the VA can be held accountable.
Unfortunately, the VA isn't using the law as intended, and Senator Rubio is continuing to fight for more accountability and better results from the VA — because nothing is more important than taking care of our veterans!
