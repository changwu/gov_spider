    I am profoundly shocked and saddened by the tragic and violent death of Earl Mountbatten. In peace and in war, he was a leader of monumental ability.
Here in the United States, his memory is enshrined for the paramount role he played in achieving victory for the Allied Forces during World War II. We mourn his passing and that of the two youngsters who died with him this morning.
I have expressed my sincere condolences and those of the American people to Her Majesty the Queen, to Prince Philip, and to Prime Minister Thatcher in this time of great loss.
