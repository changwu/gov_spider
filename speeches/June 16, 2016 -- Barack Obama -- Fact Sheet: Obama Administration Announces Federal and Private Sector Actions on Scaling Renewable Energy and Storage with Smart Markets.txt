    President Obama believes in the need to transition to a cleaner, more reliable, and affordable 21st century power grid. Under his leadership, transformations in how we produce and consume electricity are decreasing carbon pollution, scaling up renewable energy, and generating savings on consumers' energy bills. Since 2009, renewable energy generation has increased at a record pace, while costs have decreased dramatically. Building on this progress, smart electricity market reforms, enhanced transparency, and flexible energy resources such as storage and demand response have the potential to further accelerate the development of a cleaner and smarter grid. In fact, in 2015 alone, the United States doubled the installed capacity of advanced energy storage to 500 megawatts (MW) and deployment of this key resource is projected to continue to expand.
With this dynamic progress as the backdrop, today the White House is hosting a Summit on Scaling Renewable Energy and Storage with Smart Markets. The Summit brings together regulators, power companies, municipalities, and energy developers that are leading efforts to promote smart electricity markets and greater grid integration of renewable energy and flexible resources such as energy storage.
The Administration is announcing new executive actions and 33 state and private sector commitments that will accelerate the grid integration of renewable energy and storage. Together, these announcements are expected to result in at least 1.3 gigawatts of additional storage procurement or deployment in the next five years. These actions include:
• A new report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers on the technical and economic considerations and opportunities relating to the grid integration of renewable energy resources.
• The federal government committing to increasing its storage and microgrid capacity through programs that will make our federal and military bases more resilient and provide funding for microgrids in rural communities.
• The U.S. Department of Energy promoting access to and standardization of energy data.
• Sixteen developers and power companies in at least eight states announcing new storage procurement and deployment targets for the next five years.
• Investors announcing $130 million in new funding commitments for energy storage.
• In aggregate, these new procurement, deployment, and investment commitments announced today could lead to approximately $1 billion in investments in energy storage.
• Power companies and developers committing to deploy smart water heaters, smart meters, and demand response programs.

Federal Executive Actions on Smart Markets and Energy Storage
• White House Council of Economic Advisers is releasing a report titled "Incorporating Renewables into the Grid: Expanding Opportunities for Smart Markets and Energy Storage." One of the report's key findings is that current and projected levels of variable renewable energy resources are opening up opportunities for technologies such as energy storage and demand response to ensure the reliable and cost-effective supply of electricity. The report also finds that wholesale market reforms are already helping to enable these technologies to participate in some markets. Ongoing cost reductions and advancements in communication infrastructure are expected to further enhance the potential for these technologies going forward.
• Increasing the Federal Government's Storage Capacity: U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) announces that it intends to issue a Request for Information about building-level energy storage to explore a number of possible storage solutions, in particular for emergency back-up (potentially to replace diesel generators), for enhancing resiliency, and for aiding in demand response management of peak loads.

This analysis will promote confidence among customers who consent to contribute their data to the effort that their wishes for anonymity are respected, and among participating utilities that customer data privacy is part of the fundamental design of the program.
o National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has developed a sophisticated model of the Eastern Interconnection to understand power system operations with hundreds of gigawatts of wind and solar meeting 30% of electricity needs. NREL commits to releasing in August 2016 the results of its study, including the power system model and visualization tools to enable academia and industry to explore the transition to renewable energy with more resolution than ever before. NREL also announces that it recently established the Utility Rate Data Working Group (URDWG), which will identify an appropriate machine-readable data standard for utility rate data and potentially demonstrate a proof of concept in collaboration with utilities, data users, and other relevant stakeholders. The URDWG will leverage the foundational work of the Utility Rate Database (URDB), which is produced by NREL on behalf of DOE's Solar Energy Technologies Program and includes more than 39,000 rates for over 3,700 utilities. The development of an easy-to-use machine-readable data solution will make it easier to update utility rates as they change over time, and also make utility rate information more accessible for utilities, energy companies, consumers, researchers and policymakers across the country.
o Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) released, in April 2016, Phase I of a study for the California Public Utilities Commission leveraging smart meter data to estimate the potential for demand response and advanced behind-the-meter storage to provide cost-effective resources as part of California's future electricity system. LBNL will continue to support research and analysis on grid modernization across the United States and is expanding on its Phase I with a Phase II report in the fall of 2016. The Phase II report will explore the potential for demand response and distributed energy resources to meet capacity, ancillary services, ramping, and flexibility needs in California.
o Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently joined San Diego Gas & Electric's Green Button Connect program, in which residential and commercial customers in San Diego can name EIA as an electronic recipient of their daily energy consumption data. EIA will use this to test direct data collection protocols that could be deployed on a larger scale. EIA will also launch a pilot collection in 2017 to sub meter and record consumption by end use consuming devices within typical American homes. Emerging sub metering technology will provide direct measurements of electric, natural gas, and water consumption and more accurate estimates of household demand than current modeling efforts allow.
