    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Ford (D) MI and four others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3424, mainly because it would discriminate against teachers recruited abroad for the Defense Department overseas schools, who are largely wives of military personnel and civilian employees, by relegating them to temporary and substitute status in the school system. This would have a serious, negative impact on the quality of education in DOD's overseas schools and on the morale of military and civilian employees serving abroad.
