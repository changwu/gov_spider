    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, opened for signature at Washington, London, Mexico City and Moscow on December 29, 1972. The report of the Department of State is enclosed for the information of the Senate.
This Convention is designed to establish in each country which is a party to this Convention, a national system for regulating the ocean disposal of wastes comparable to the system for this country provided by Title I of Public Law 92-532 enacted October 23, 1972, the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972.
International concern for the protection and effective management of our oceans has been growing in recent years. We expect this Convention to come into force in a relatively short period of time and to provide a significant and successful step in the international control of marine pollution. I recommend that the Senate give prompt consideration to this Convention and consent to its ratification.
