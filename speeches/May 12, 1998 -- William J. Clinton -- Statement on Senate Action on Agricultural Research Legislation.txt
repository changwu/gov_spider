    I am very pleased that the Senate today passed with an overwhelming majority the bipartisan conference report on the agriculture research bill. This vital legislation makes needed reforms and provides funding in several areas that are priorities for my administration. The legislation provides important benefits to America's farmers and to those who have come to this country seeking a brighter future. I would like to extend my warm gratitude to Senators Lugar and Harkin for their vision and hard work stewarding a bill that ably balances crop insurance, agriculture research, rural development, and Food Stamps for legal immigrants in need.
The last hurdle that remains for this bill is for the House of Representatives to pass the conference report. I urge the House to act quickly on this legislation.
