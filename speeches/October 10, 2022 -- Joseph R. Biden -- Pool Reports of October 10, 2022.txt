In-town pool report #1 - gathering
Good afternoon from a very quiet White House campus (except for the incessant sucking buzz of an excavation truck going full bore in the north driveway).
Pool is gathering now on the South Lawn for Marine One's arrival. The arrival is open press. More soon.



October 10, 202215:53

In-town pool report #2 - Marine One lands
Marine One landed on the South Lawn at 3:46 p.m.
POTUS stepped down at 3:49, waved to the pool gathered in the driveway and walked alone across the lawn toward the West Wing, taking a wide berth and walking around the far end of the guard hose. No response to shouted questions, if he heard them at all.
He entered the Oval at 3:50.

In-town pool report #3 - lid
The WH called a travel/photo lid at 3:58 p.m. Enjoy the rest of your day, all.
