    Denish to serve as NM Campaign Chair
In another sign of the support and excitement Senator Hillary Clinton is receiving across the country, New Mexico Lt. Governor Diane Denish today announced her endorsement and will serve as the Chair of the New Mexico for Hillary campaign.
"I am standing with Hillary Clinton because she will fight every day she is in the White House for our families and children. She is the candidate with the heart, record and experience to bring about the change we need," said Lt. Governor Denish. "Hillary and I share the important goals of expanding access to health care, improving our schools and ensuring every American can take advantage of our nation's opportunities. New Mexicans know Hillary Clinton, they know she's a fighter and they share her vision of putting working Americans first. I'm proud to offer her my endorsement."
As a mother, small business owner, and community activist, Lt. Governor Denish has a long, proven record of delivering results for the people of New Mexico. She successfully reorganized the New Mexico Democratic Party and oversaw several electoral successes.
Denish was elected Lieutenant Governor in 2002, becoming the first woman to ever hold that office in New Mexico.
Lt. Governor Denish was reelected on November 7, 2006. As Lt. Governor, Denish has fought to improve education, increase access to health care, crack down on criminals who endanger children and create greater economic opportunities for New Mexicans.
"Lt Governor Denish is a true inspiration and I am honored to have her support," said Senator Clinton. "As Lt. Governor, she has shown a true, committed passion for helping New Mexico's families. Like her, I have chosen this life of public service because I want to help people and build a brighter future for everyone. I am running for President not to put band-aids on America's problems. I want to solve them."
