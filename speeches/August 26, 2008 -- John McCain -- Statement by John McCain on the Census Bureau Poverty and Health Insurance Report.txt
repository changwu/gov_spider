    ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, U.S. Senator John McCain issued the following statement on the Census Bureau Poverty and Health Insurance Report:
"Today's announcement reminds us that Americans are suffering in a struggling economy. Too many of our neighbors are living in poverty, too many can't find a job, and too many are living without health insurance.
"My health care plan will substantially reduce the rolls of the uninsured by providing a $5,000 per family refundable tax credit that will help more Americans get the coverage they need or maintain the coverage they already have. We'll also undertake meaningful reforms to restrain the out-of-control growth in health care costs that is putting coverage out of reach for too many Americans.
"To improve the lot of working families, we need to dedicate ourselves to the path of economic growth. My economic plan is designed from the ground up to create jobs, opportunity, and economic growth by keeping taxes low, providing tax relief for American families, fighting rising energy prices and encouraging innovation."
