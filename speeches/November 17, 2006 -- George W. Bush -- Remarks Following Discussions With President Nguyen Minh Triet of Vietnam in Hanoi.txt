    Mr. President, thank you very much for your hospitality. Laura and I have been struck by the friendliness of the people of Vietnam. In our drive through this beautiful city, we were pleased to see thousands of your citizens with smiles on their faces. And we're so grateful.
I've been reading and studying about your country, and I have seen now firsthand the great vibrancy and the excitement that's taking place in Vietnam. You're like a young tiger, and I look forward to continuing to work to make sure our bilateral relations are close. And thank you for hosting APEC. And thank you for hosting a dinner for us tonight. We're really looking forward to it.
