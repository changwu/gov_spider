    Mitt Romney today announced the support of elected officials and leaders from Georgia.
"I'm proud to earn the support of so many great conservatives in Georgia," said Mitt Romney. "They recognize, like most Americans, that our economy is struggling today because of President Obama's failed policies. I look forward to working with them to bring my message of job creation and reduced spending to all Georgians."
Announcing his support, Labor Commissioner Mark Butler said, "Mitt Romney has the temperament, experience, and leadership we need to move our country forward. I am confident he will put policies in place that will foster job growth and encourage businesses to hire because he spent his life in the private sector and understands how the real economy works. I am proud to support his campaign for president."
