    I condemn in the strongest terms the appalling attack against a British servicemember in Woolwich on May 22. The United States stands resolute with the United Kingdom, our ally and friend, against violent extremism and terror. There can be absolutely no justification for such acts, and our thoughts and prayers are with the family of the victim, the police and security services responding to this horrific act and the communities they serve, and the British people.
Our special relationship with the United Kingdom is especially important during times of trial. And I look forward to my trip to the United Kingdom to participate in the June G-8 summit hosted by Prime Minister Cameron, which will include discussions on the important global security challenges our countries face together.
