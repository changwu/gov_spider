    ARLINGTON, VA -- This afternoon, Barack Obama told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that there was an argument for cutting business tax rates -- despite attacking the very same tax cuts earlier today. Once again, the American people are left with a tax plan that changes by the day and is little more than just words. Check out the facts below: 
"By Barack Obama's own measure, Obama now supports billions in 'tax cuts for big oil companies' and corporations that are sending American jobs overseas. The truth: Barack Obama has a difficult time coming to terms with the devastating effects of his own economic plan, is learning as he goes and just isn't ready yet." -- Tucker Bounds, McCain-Palin 2008 spokesman 
Today, Barack Obama Remained Open To Cutting The Business Tax Rate
Barack Obama: "And, In Fact, You Can Make An Argument For Lowering The Corporate Tax Rate." CNN'S WOLF BLITZER:"At a time of economic distress, is it wise to increase the corporate tax rate?" OBAMA: "We're not increasing the corporate tax rate." BLITZER: "I know, but there's some talk that you want to increase it, it's 35% right now. you talked about --" OBAMA: "Where is that talk coming from?" BLITZER: "I don't know, you tell me. You want to keep it at 35%?" OBAMA: "I have no plans for increasing the corporate tax rate. And, in fact, you can make an argument for lowering the corporate tax rate, but only if you, at the same time, close all the corporate loopholes. The problem we have right now, on paper we've got a high corporate tax rate; in actual terms, corporations aren't paying their fair share." (CNN's "Situation Roo m," 10/31/08)

But Even Today, Barack Obama Decried These Very Same Business Tax Cuts
Just Today, Barack Obama Decried Giving Tax Cuts To American Businesses. OBAMA: "At a moment like this, the last thing we can afford is four more years of the tired, old theory that says we should give more to billionaires and big corporations and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else." (Barack Obama, Remarks, Des Moines, IA, 10/31/08) 
Barack Obama: "It's Not Change When He Wants To Give $200 Billion To The Biggest Corporations Or $4 Billion To The Oil Companies." (CNN's "American Morning," 10/29/08) 
Barack Obama Criticized John McCain For Proposing "Another Huge And Permanent Corporate Tax Cut." OBAMA: "Senator McCain used the crisis as an excuse to push a so-called stimulus plan that offered another huge and permanent corporate tax cut, including $4 billion to the big oil companies, but no immediate help for workers." (MSNBC's "Countdown," 9/16/08) 
In Addition To Changing His Position On Business Tax Cuts, The Obama-Biden Campaign Has Changed Their Tax Plan Numerous Times In The Past Week
CHANGE #1 ($250,000): In July 2008, Barack Obama Said: "If You Make $250,000 A Year Or Less, We Will Not Raise Your Taxes. We Will Cut Your Taxes." (Barack Obama, Remarks, Powder Springs, GA, 7/8/08) 
CHANGE #2 ($200,000): In New Obama Ad "Defining Moment" The Threshold For The Obama Tax Plan For Families Seeing A Tax Cut Is Lowered From $250,000 To $200,000. OBAMA AD: "The Obama Plan: Families Making Less Than $200,000 Get Tax Cut." (Obama Ad, "Defining Moment," 10/25/08) 
CHANGE #3: In An Interview With A Scranton, PA, News Station, Joe Biden Said That Only Families Making Under $150,000 Would Get A Tax Cut. BIDEN: "Spreading the wealth was not--he was talking about is all of the tax breaks have gone to the very, very wealthy. For example you have right now, this year, under the old tax policy that was just -- that was put in by George Bush, people making an average 1.4 million a year, good people, decent people, patriotic -- they're going to get an $87 billion tax break. What we're saying is that $87 billion tax break doesn't need to go to people making an average of 1.4 million, it should go like it used to. It should go to middle class people -- people making under $150,000 a year." (Joe Biden, Interview With WNEP Scranton, 10/27/08)

(Mark Murray and Mike Memoli, "$150,000 Vs. $250,000," MSNBC's "First Read" Blog, http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com , Posted 10/28/08) 
CHANGE #5: Obama Surrogate Governor Richardson Said Only Those Making Less Than $120,000 Would Get A Tax Cut.
