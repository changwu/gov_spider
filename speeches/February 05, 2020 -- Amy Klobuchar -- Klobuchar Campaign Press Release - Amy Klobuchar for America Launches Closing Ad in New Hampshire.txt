KLOBUCHAR: We have a President who thinks everything is about him. His tweets, his golf courses, his ego. But I think the job is about you. Your healthcare, your schools, your security, your families, and your future. I'm Amy Klobuchar. I'll be a President and a commander in chief who restores decency to the White House and gets things done for you. That's why I approve this message.
