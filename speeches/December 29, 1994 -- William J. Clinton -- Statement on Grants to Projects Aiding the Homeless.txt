    It is imperative that we not turn our backs on the Nation's homeless. The number of homeless families and young people suffering from abuse and neglect continues to rise. It is my hope that these grants will help those who need our help the most. I am also pleased that AmeriCorps members will be engaged in the struggle to end homelessness. This is an example of national service at its best.
