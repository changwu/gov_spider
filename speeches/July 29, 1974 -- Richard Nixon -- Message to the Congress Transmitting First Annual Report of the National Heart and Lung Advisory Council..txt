    To the Congress of the United States:
I herewith transmit the First Annual Report of the National Heart and Lung Advisory Council, prepared in accordance with the requirement of Public Law 92-423, the "National Heart, Blood Vessel, Lung, and Blood Act of 1972."
It should be noted that funds for the Heart and Lung Institute have been increased greatly in recent years: from $195 million in 1971 to $286 million in 1974, to $309 million proposed for 1975. In short, the Administration's actions on the heart and lung program clearly identify it as an area of very high priority.
While there are recommendations in the Council's report that are at variance with the Administration's views, the Council's Report merits serious consideration and will be closely studied and evaluated. I am forwarding the report so that the Congress may also have it available for its deliberations.
