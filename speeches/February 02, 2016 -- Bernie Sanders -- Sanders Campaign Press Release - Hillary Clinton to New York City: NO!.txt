    KEENE, N.H. â€” Jeff Weaver, Bernie Sanders' campaign manager, issued the following statement Tuesday after Secretary Hillary Clinton refused to participate in a proposed debate in New York City:
"We are incredibly disappointed that Secretary Clinton refuses to do a debate in New York City. Why does the Clinton campaign object to a debate in New York City? Wasn't Secretary Clinton the senator from New York? Why is her campaign dissing the Big Apple?"
