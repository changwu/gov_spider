    Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff and Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Dr. Jewel Bronaugh visited the Capital Area Food Bank and hosted a roundtable with the Food Bank's staff, community partners, and volunteers. During the roundtable, the Second Gentleman and Deputy Secretary discussed the administration's all-of-government approach to creating more equitable access to food and addressing the root causes of hunger by investing in long term solutions beyond providing meals. The participants shared how they are working to increase outreach and expand resources to communities. Mr. Emhoff highlighted the administration's efforts to lower costs for working families to ensure that no family has to choose between paying for food or living expenses.
Next month the administration will announce a national strategy to end hunger and reduce diet-related diseases at the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health.
