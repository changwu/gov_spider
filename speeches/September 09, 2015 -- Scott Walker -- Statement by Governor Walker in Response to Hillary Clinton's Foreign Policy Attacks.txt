    Madison, Wis. – After being attacked this morning by Hillary Clinton for his positions on the Iran nuclear deal and ISIS, Gov. Scott Walker released the following statement:
"Hillary Clinton's legacy as secretary of state is that every country she touched is more messed up than the day she and President Obama took office. The bad Iran deal she supports and is fighting to keep in place gives the Iranian regime­ a nuclear program with an American stamp of approval and billions of dollars to fund terrorism. It will make the world more dangerous and Iran more powerful. While Hillary Clinton tries to spin her failed record as secretary of state, I'm focused on tackling America's foreign policy challenges and leading on Day One to ensure America can actually defeat – not ignore – radical Islamic terrorism."
