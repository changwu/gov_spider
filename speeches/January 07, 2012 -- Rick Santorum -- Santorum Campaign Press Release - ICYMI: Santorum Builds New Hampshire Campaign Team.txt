Verona, PA - Republican Presidential candidate Rick Santorum has recruited 99 primary captains around the state of New Hampshire who will serve as local organizers and ambassadors for the Santorum Campaign. The extensive organization of the Santorum Campaign throughout New Hampshire reflects the Senator's travel and commitment to the First-in-the-Nation Primary State. Santorum has visited New Hampshire on 30 occasions.
Senator Santorum said: "I am honored to have such a great outpouring of support from Granite State conservatives. Many have said to me that I should skip New Hampshire because the state does not 'match-up' with my brand of conservatism. Today's announcement proves the nay-sayers wrong, because New Hampshire Republicans are looking for a candidate who is committed to their state, who speaks from the heart, and speaks the truth about the challenges facing our nation. I am committed to New Hampshire and was proud to support their efforts to remain the First-in-the-Nation primary state, and I look forward to working with this great team as we move on to victory in the New Hampshire primary."
Mike Biundo, National Campaign Manager, said: "As a New Hampshire resident, I could not be more proud to work for a candidate like Rick Santorum who has stood tall for the values that make America the greatest nation in the history of the world. From this announcement, it is clear that I am not alone. This is a terrific team of well-respected and well-known activists from around the state, and I am confident that with their help, the Santorum Campaign will shock the establishment on primary night."
