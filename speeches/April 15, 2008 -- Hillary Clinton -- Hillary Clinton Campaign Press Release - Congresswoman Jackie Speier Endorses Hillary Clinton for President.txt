    Congresswoman Jackie Speier today announced her endorsement of Hillary Clinton for President. Speier was sworn in less than week ago as the newest Member of Congress, filling the vacancy of California's 12th Congressional District.
"Nothing makes me more proud than to announce my endorsement of Hillary Clinton for President," said Speier. "As a woman, a lawmaker and a mother, I understand what electing Hillary will mean for this country. She will not only bring an extraordinary grasp of the issues to the White House, but also a uniquely feminine skill set - consensus building, negotiation, and patience - that will serve our nation well. As President, Hillary will set an example for how to run a country with diplomacy and restraint."
"I am thrilled to have the support of the newest Member of Congress, Jackie Speier," said Clinton. "Jackie has been a force to be reckoned with in California politics for more than two decades, standing up for children, families, and consumers across the state. Congress is fortunate to have someone with her fortitude and vision, and I look forward to working with her as we bring real change to Washington."
A lifelong resident of the San Francisco Bay Area, Speier's career began when she served as legal counsel to Congressman Leo J. Ryan. While accompanying Congressman Ryan to Jonestown, Guyana in 1978, the Congressman was assassinated and Jackie was shot five times. Speier credits that experience with inspiring her life in public service.
In 1980, Speier was the first woman and youngest person ever elected to the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors, where she served for six years. She followed that with 18 years in the California Legislature, where she received numerous awards including the American Medical Association's "Outstanding Government Service Award" and the League of California Cities "Legislator of the Year."
