    Dole/Kemp '96 Deputy Press Secretary Christina Martin released the following statement today.
"The Clinton campaign is no better at math then they are at keeping drugs out of our schools. The tax cuts in the Dole/Kemp economic plan am fully paid for by saving just 6 pennies out of every destroyed non-defense government dollar. Don't take our word for it, though. Ask the four Nobel prize-winning economists who have endorsed the Dole/Kemp plan."
