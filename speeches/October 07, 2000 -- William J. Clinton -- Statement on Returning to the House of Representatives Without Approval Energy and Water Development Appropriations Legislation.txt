    Today I vetoed a deeply flawed energy/water appropriations bill that threatens major environmental harm by blocking our efforts to modernize operations on the Missouri River. This antienvironmental rider would not only jeopardize the survival of three threatened and endangered species but would also establish a dangerous precedent aimed at barring a Federal agency from obeying one of our Nation's landmark environmental statutes.
Additionally, this bill funded scores of special projects for special interests. It failed to provide sufficient funding for priorities in the national interestâ€”including environmental restoration of the Florida Everglades and the California-Bay Delta, and our strategy to restore endangered salmon in the Pacific Northwest. It also failed to fund efforts to research and develop nonpolluting sources of energy through solar and renewable technologies that are vital to America's energy security.
I urge Congress to quickly produce an energy/ water bill I can sign.
