    Presidential Determination No. 90-29
Memorandum for the Secretary of Transportation
By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 1302 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 ("the Act"), 49 U.S.C. App. 1532, I hereby:
(1) determine that continuation of commercial air services to and from Saudi Arabia is necessary to carry out the foreign policy of the United States. Such commercial air services facilitate, in particular, actions in support of the United States and international response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the evacuation of American citizens from areas affected by the invasion. These services facilitate, in addition, the maintenance of normal political and commercial exchange with the countries of the region.
(2) approve provision by the Secretary of Transportation of insurance against loss or damage arising out of any risk from the operation of an aircraft in the manner and to the extent provided in Title XIII of the Act, 49 U.S.C. App. 1531, et seq., whenever he determines that such insurance cannot be obtained on reasonable terms and conditions from any company authorized to conduct an insurance business in a State of the United States.
You are directed to bring this determination immediately to the attention of all air carriers within the meaning of section 101(3) of the Act, 49 U.S.C. App. 1301(3), and to arrange for its publication in the Federal Register.
