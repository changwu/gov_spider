    All right. It has been my honor to welcome these very important leaders of different faiths to this dialog. They represent the very best of Turkey, which is a country that is secular in politics and strong in its faith. And we've had a wonderful discussion. I'm so honored that these leaders would take time and share their thoughts with me. And I welcome them, and I thank them for being so faithful to the Almighty God.
Thank you for coming.
