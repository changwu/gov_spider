    My warmest wishes to all those celebrating Cinco de Mayo on this 155th anniversary of the Battle of Puebla.
The Battle of Puebla reminds us of the incredible courage and resolve of the Mexican people as they fought for their country and defended their freedom. On May 5, 1862, General Ignacio Zaragoza's Mexican forces withstood the French assault on the town of Puebla de Los Angeles, despite being outnumbered and underequipped. The Battle of Puebla remains an important symbol of Mexican bravery and tenacity.
On Cinco de Mayo, we commemorate the heroic victory of the Mexican Army over the invading forces of Napoleon III at the Battle of Puebla and pay tribute to the proud Mexican heritage it exemplifies. We also honor the Mexican-Americans whose fighting spirit and patriotism have been influential in shaping the character of our great Nation.
Melania and I hope everyone enjoys the festivities. Happy Cinco de Mayo!
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
