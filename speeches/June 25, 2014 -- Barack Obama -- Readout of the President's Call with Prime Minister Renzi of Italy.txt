    The President spoke today with Prime Minister Renzi of Italy about the latest developments in Ukraine. They agreed on the importance of the Government of Ukraine and the separatists continuing discussions to implement the peace plan put forward by President Poroshenko. They also stressed the need for Russia to use its influence over separatist groups to persuade them to abide by the cease-fire and for Russia to take immediate concrete steps to stop the flow of weapons and militants across the border. The leaders agreed we will continue to coordinate measures to impose additional costs on Russia if it fails to take rapid action to deescalate the situation in eastern Ukraine.
