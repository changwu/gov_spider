    I was saddened to hear of the death of former British Prime Minister, the Earl of Stockton, Harold Macmillan, one of the United Kingdom's most distinguished postwar leaders. The American people share in the loss of a voice of wisdom and humanity who, with eloquence and gentle wit, brought to the problems of today the experience of a long life of public service. We will miss him, and we extend to Lord Stockton's family and the British people our warmest sympathy.
