    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Sen. Dorgan (D) North Dakota and 20 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of S. J. Res. 17, a resolution disapproving the rule submitted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with respect to broadcast media ownership. The Administration believes that the new FCC local and national media ownership rules more accurately reflect the changing media landscape and the current state of network station ownership, while guarding against undue concentration in the marketplace. S.J. Res. 17 overturns all of the FCC's new media ownership rules - negating almost two years of careful study, detailed analysis, and thorough review; creating significant regulatory uncertainty; and preventing the implementation of important new rules which will improve the quality of local news and support free over-the-air broadcast television. If S. J. Res. 17 were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto it.
