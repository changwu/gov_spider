MITT ROMNEY: "You know, I know there are some people who want four more years, but we don't want four more years like the last four years. This election, in my opinion, comes down to a very dramatic choice between two different courses for America. When it relates to the economy, the president's course is status quo. His slogan is 'Forward.' I think 'forewarned' is a better term. I mean, I don't know if you watched or read his speech at the Democrat convention, but he laid out a plan which was just like what he said four years ago: another stimulus, bigger government."
