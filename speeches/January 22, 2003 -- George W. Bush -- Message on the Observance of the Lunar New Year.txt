    I send greetings to those celebrating the Lunar New Year, the Year of the Goat.
The Lunar New Year has traditionally celebrated the rejuvenation of the earth and the start of the new farm season. Today, for many Asian Americans it represents a period of new beginnings and renewed hope. During this time, individuals around the world reaffirm the value of friendship, celebrate family, and look forward to a hopeful future.
As our Nation continues to welcome new opportunities and face new challenges, the Lunar New Year reflects our country's ongoing dedication to affirming the vitality of our traditions, strengthening our relationships with our neighbors, and building a peaceful, more prosperous future for all.
Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for peace, health, and happiness in the New Year.
