    With the death of Nathan Perlmutter, we have all suffered a tremendous loss. His passing leaves a void which cannot be filled. But he also leaves a legacy which will long be remembered and cherished. We will not forget his devotion to his family, the Jewish people, and his country; nor his devotion to the very highest principles: truth, respect for the inalienable rights of individuals, and human freedom.
I personally take some consolation in the fact that only 3 weeks ago I was able to award him a richly deserved Presidential Medal of Freedom, our nation's highest civilian honor. Although he was then already too ill to attend the ceremony, I had the pleasure of talking with Nate by phone before the event. I also had the pleasure of giving the award to Ruth Ann Perlmutter, his wife and collaborator in all his many achievements. To her and the rest of Nathan Perlmutter's family, Nancy and I send our heartfelt condolences.
