    New TV Ad Released Today Features Judge Judy Saying: 'No One Comes Close to Mike Bloomberg's Executive Achievement, Government Experience and Impactful Philanthropy'
New York, New York â€” Today, Judge Judy Sheindlin, in a new TV ad, endorses Mike Bloomberg for president, touting his executive and government experience as what is needed to unite the country and lead us through challenging times.
"I like to say you can judge someone's character by what they've done. Mike Bloomberg has done amazing things and will be a truly great president," said Sheindlin, whose highly-rated TV program is celebrating 24 years on air this year. "No one comes close to Mike Bloomberg's executive achievement, government experience and impactful philanthropy."
The "Judge Him" ad featuring the popular TV judge will be running across digital channels and in relevant broadcast programming across 26 states.
Sheindlin, who has never before endorsed a presidential candidate, was outspoken in her support of Mike even before he decided to run, having penned an op-ed in USA Today urging him to seek the presidency and pledging support for his campaign.
"We're hopelessly divided, and a bitterly divided family cannot thrive. The only way we can begin to come together again, I said, is if Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City, becomes our next president," said Sheindlin in her piece. "I realize I am taking a personal and a career risk in making such a statement. I have carefully stayed away from politics for 50 years, except to vote. But times have changed in our country, and I believe the moment has come for me to step out from behind the curtain."
A native of New York City, Judge Sheindlin is the former Supervising Judge of the Family Court in New York County, the author of five books and the founder of Her Honor Mentoring, now in its 13th year.
