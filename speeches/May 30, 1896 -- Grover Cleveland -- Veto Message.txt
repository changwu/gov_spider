    To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 6037, entitled "An act granting a pension to Mrs. Amanda Woodcock."
The bill provides for the granting of a pension to the beneficiary therein named, describing her as the "widow of Robert Woodcock, deceased, late a private in the Fourth United States Volunteer Infantry in the Mexican War."
My action in this case is based upon the following statement concerning the bill from the Pension Bureau:
The bill, if approved, would be inoperative, inasmuch as there was no such organization in the Mexican War as named in the bill (Fourth United States Volunteer Infantry ), and the service alleged by the soldier having been in the Fourth Kentucky Volunteer Infantry.
GROVER CLEVELAND.
