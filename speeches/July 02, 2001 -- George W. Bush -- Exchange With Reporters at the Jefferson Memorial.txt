    Fourth of July
Q. What's the occasion, Mr. President?
The President. Just wanted to come over. We're looking right out our window every day at the Jefferson. It's a beautiful day— wanted to come over and begin the beginning of the Fourth of July celebration here at the Jefferson Memorial. It's a good opportunity to say hello to some of our fellow Americans.
Q. What does the Fourth mean to you, Mr. President?
The President. Well, it's an unimaginable honor to be the President, during the Fourth of July, of this country. It means what these words say, for starters, the great inalienable rights of our country. We're blessed with such values in America. And I—it's—I'm a proud man to be the—the Nation based upon such wonderful values. I can't tell you what it was like to be in Europe, for example, to be talking about the greatness of America.
But the true greatness of America are the people. And it's another reason we're here, is to be able to say hello to some of our fellow Americans. And we're here to celebrate. It's good to see everybody.
