    Today I am proud to announce my intention to renominate General Marty Dempsey as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Admiral Sandy Winnefeld as the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. These two superb officers have led our military and their families with great distinction, deep conviction, and absolute integrity over the past 2 years, and I am confident in saying that our Nation is safer and more secure today because of their visionary, dedicated, and tireless leadership.
General Dempsey often talks about trust as the foundational quality of the profession of arms: trust between leaders, those they lead, the institutions they represent, and the nation they serve. These two distinguished military leaders have earned my trust and that of the American people. I am inspired by their dedicated service to our great Nation and the example they set for our women and men in uniform. I urge the Senate to reconfirm these outstanding officers as swiftly as possible.
