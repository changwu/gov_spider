    I think all the information that I have has already been reported in the press relative to the Naval Limitation conference at Geneva. They are evidently having some difficulty in reaching a final agreement about cruisers. As I am sure that each of us went there with a desire for an agreement that would afford limitation, I have every hope and expectation that some agreement will be reached, not probably just an agreement that any one of the nations would wish, but some point on which all can agree.
