    National Security Advisor Tom Donilon met this afternoon with Dr. Mahmoud Gibril, the President of the Libyan Transitional National Council's Executive Bureau. Mr. Donilon hosted Dr. Gibril and his delegation at the White House in order to continue the close consultations between the Obama Administration and the leadership of the Transitional National Council (TNC) about the situation in Libya. During the meeting, Mr. Donilon stated that the United States views the TNC as a legitimate and credible interlocutor of the Libyan people. In contrast, Mr. Donilon stressed that Qadhafi has lost his legitimacy to rule and reiterated President Obama's call for Qadhafi to leave immediately.
Mr. Donilon and Dr. Gibril discussed how the United States and the coalition can provide additional support to the TNC. Mr. Donilon applauded the TNC's commitment to an inclusive political transition and a democratic future for Libya.
