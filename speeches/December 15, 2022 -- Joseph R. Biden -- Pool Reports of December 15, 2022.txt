In town pool report #4
In his morning remarks at the Leaders Session of the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit (which should be checked against the transcript), the president said "the people of Africa are indispensable partners" to the United States. He mentioned Russia's "unprovoked war" and blamed it for "erasing many of the development gains we have worked so hard to achieve." Speaking of the money he and Congress plan to spend on programs for Africa, he said, "Our new shared vision statement lays out a forward-looking plan." He added, "We want to work with you on issues that matter the most." And, "We want to increase our collaboration in every area." He said the aid that will be coming from the IMF will help "build resilience." He then said that "the United States will always lead with our values." He said that is "part of our DNA." He added, "That doesn't mean we always get everything right. We surely don't." But he said "consistent self improvement" is the goal.
He also cited what he called "record voter turnout in Zambia" and said "our greatest power is our people." He added, "One of the achievements I want to highlight today…is combating democratic backsliding." He promised to work with African governments and civil society in this area, including facilitating voter registration programs. Again, he promised to "work with our African partners" in the years to come. He added, "Now, as every leader understands, the real measure of success is not in announcements. It's in the follow through." That, he said, is why he has appointed veteran ambassador Johnny Carson to implement the promises made here. Joking about travel to the continent, he said, "Be careful what you wish for. I may show up." He said there will be visits to Africa by the First Lady, the Vice President, the Secretary of State and other top officials. "All kidding aside, we're all going to be seeing you and you'll see a lot of us." All, he said, is in service to building "an integrated, prosperous and free Africa." He concluded saying "I'm eager to hear from all of you." He then sat down to listen to the program and the pool was escorted to a holding room.

The president just completed his remarks at the opening of the Food Security discussion and turned it over to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.
The president spoke in front of a colorful array of all the represented countries with an American flag to the far left as looking at the stage. In his remarks, he lamented that, "Today, famine once more stalks the horn of Africa…taking the livelihoods of millions of people across the continent." He said that climate change and covid 19 complicate the situation. "The challenges we face are both clear and they are urgent," he said, He talked of American food and security assistance, which he said is even more needed because of what he called a "dramatic surge in the horn of Africa." He announced an additional $2 billion in humanitarian assistance. He said, "We're bringing everything to bear on this problem." To help "lessen chronic hunger": he talked of unused arable farm land in Africa, "land that can be used to transform the continent." With this a revival of Africa's agricultural sector, he said, "Africa has the potential to feed its people and also help feed the world."

Supplemental foreign pool report #1
Hello all,
I'll be your supplemental foreign pooler for the President's events at the US-Africa Leaders Summit.
1st event is the leaders session on the African Union's Agenda 2063, scheduled for 11:15am.
The AU agenda 2063 was first announced in 2013, 50 years after the creation of the Organization of African Unity (the predecessor of the AU) and adopted in 2015, as a "blueprint and master plan" for the next 50 years to "transform Africa into the global powerhouse of the future."
Among the main stated goals of the agenda are:
-economic development
-political integration & independence from foreign powers
-democracy & justice
-security & peace
-strengthening cultural identity
You can find more information of the AU agenda 2063 here
https://au.int/en/agenda2063/overview



December 15, 202211:29

Supplemental foreign pool report #2
Your foreign pooler is in the meeting room. Several leaders have already started taking their seats around the leaders center table.
Per WH, we are expecting POTUS to speak first, followed by Macky Sall, President of Senegal and current Chairperson of the AU. Then Moussa Faki, Chairperson of the AU Commission (former PM of Chad).



December 15, 202212:56

Supplemental foreign pool #3 - remarks
POTUS expressed his condolences to the people of the DRC following the devastating & deadly floods that killed more than 100 people so far.
He officially announced his support for the AU to join the G20 as a permanent member (as he did for the UNSC back in September) His announcement was met with a round of applause.
Sec of State Tony Blinken then introduced President Macky Sall of Senegal who is the current Chair of the AU.
He also mentioned it was the first time all leaders were around the same table at this summit. There are however at least 5 empty leaders seats.
Sall spoke French. (This is my own translation so please check against official translated transcript.)
He started by thanking POTUS & FLOTUS for their hospitality
"We appreciate your attachment to the African-American partnership."
"In these times of profound mutation, working together requires another way of thinking the world by acting as partners conscious of their unequal development levels, respectful of their common values and their differences."
He listed priorities
-Peace, security and fight against terrorism
-triple impact of climate change, health crisis, wars
"The current crisis weakens the democratic ideal on the continent."
-Investment on infrastructure for development
-"Africa, the least polluting continent but the most vulnerable to climate change (...) is asking for a just and fair energy transition"
-Food sovereignty
-Just governance.
Thanked POTUS for already giving part of the answer by supporting G20 permanent membership for the AU.
AU chair also called out the US on 2 issues
"We are calling on the lifting of sanctions that continue to impact the Zimbabwean people."
Likely referring to the 'Countering Malign Russian Activities in Africa Act', Sall said the AU was "preoccupied by the US legislation regarding trade between our countries and a foreign economic power. This project, with its sanctions, which targets a whole continent, is a first in international relations. All of Africa is wondering why such legislation, and why is Africa the target."
He called on the US to rethink this move saying that adopting this bill "could gravely harm the relationship between Africa and the United States."
Blinken then introduced Mr. Faki who spoke in French for a couple of minutes
