    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am writing concerning the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP program offers duty-free access to the U.S. market for products that are imported from developing countries. It is authorized by title V of the Trade Act of 1974.
Pursuant to title V, I have determined that Mauritania no longer meets the eligibility requirements set forth in the GSP law. In particular, I have determined that it has not taken and is not taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights. Accordingly, I intend to suspend Mauritania indefinitely as a designated beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP.
This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
