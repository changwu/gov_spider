    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Udall (D) AZ and Kolbe (R) AZ)
The Administration opposes the enactment of H.R. 2843. The National Park Service is currently studying one of the two areas that H.R. 2843 would add to the existing Tumacacori National Monument to form the new National Historical Park. Until both areas can be established to be of national significance, and the feasibility and suitability of designating them as a part of a National Historical Park can be evaluated, such designation would be premature. This is especially true because the wide geographical separation of the three sites would make it difficult to manage them as a single Park. Because the missions proposed to be added to the existing National Monument are currently owned by the Archeological Conservancy and the Arizona Historical Society, they are under no imminent threat of development. Accordingly, nothing would be lost by allowing the study process to be completed.
