    Carl D. Peterson. Thank you so much for being here. It's great to have you. Thanks for taking your time. I know you know our head coach well.
The President. I do know Dick. Thanks. Thanks for letting me come by and say hi. I appreciate you coming out to say hello. I'm in the neighborhood. [Laughter] I'm shaking hands. But I wish you all the best this season.
I particularly want to thank the players who, in the off-season or during the season, are helping people who hurt. I know you've got a big platform, and you can make a difference in people's lives. The fact that you can help somebody who is in need is a great contribution. It's one thing to be a star on the field; it's another thing to be a star off the field. I know a lot of you are.
Head Coach Dick Vermeil. These guys are great guys.
Mr. Peterson. We're very proud of this guy's father—Priest Holmes's dad re-upped, and he's in Iraq right now. And our prayers and thoughts are with him. And we got to see Priest set the NFL record at Arrowhead last year, 27 touchdowns.
The President. I remember when I was the Governor of Texas—[laughter]—I'm trying to keep his taxes low. [Laughter]
Mr. Peterson. Everybody here wants you to continue to do the same thing, believe me.
The President. Good luck to you all. Let me walk around and shake some hands.
