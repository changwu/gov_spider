    Cites Paul's Consistent Record and Economic Plan
CONCORD, N.H. — New Hampshire District 9 State Senator Ray White (R-Bedford/ Merrimack) today announced his endorsement of 2012 GOP presidential candidate Ron Paul.
"Unlike the other candidates, Ron Paul has been singing the same tune for years—going back to his first term in Congress," said Senator White. "He has understood and tried to warn us for decades about the economic crisis we now face, and he is the only candidate who understands the gravity of the situation.
"Without an immediate course correction in federal spending and federal debt, we will reach a point of no return. But with serious economic policies targeting our ballooning budget and fiscal irresponsibility, we still have an opportunity to turn this looming meltdown into an actual recovery.
"Ron Paul's Plan to Restore America is that opportunity. No one else has put forward a plan to dig this nation out of debt and out of trouble in only three years, and only Ron Paul will do it without ransacking the security of seniors, veterans, and the people who have, unfortunately, come to depend on government programs in these tough times.
"The core of an American recovery must be fiscal responsibility from Day 1 of the new administration. And we can trust Ron Paul to deliver."
Ray White (R-Bedford) Senator District 9, is also a Certified Financial Planner (CFP), and Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC). He specializes in employee benefits and financial planning.
