    Today, I have signed into law S. 943, the "Johnson-O'Malley Supplemental Indian Education Program Modernization Act" (the "Act"). Section 2 of the Act amends the Johnson-O'Malley Act of 1934, creating a new section 7 that purports to require the Secretary of the Interior to submit an annual report recommending appropriate funding levels for a statutory program. My Administration will treat this provision in a manner consistent with Article II, section 3 of the Constitution, which provides the President with the discretion to recommend to the Congress only "such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient."
