    I send my best wishes to all those who are observing Lithuania's national day. Lithuanians have inspired the world by building a vibrant democracy and free market economy. Here in America, those who trace their roots to Lithuania have enriched all walks of our national life. As close allies, the United States and Lithuania have an unwavering commitment to our common security, and our partnership will only grow stronger in the years to come.
