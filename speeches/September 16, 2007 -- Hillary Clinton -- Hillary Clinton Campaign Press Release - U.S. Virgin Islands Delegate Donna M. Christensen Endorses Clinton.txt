    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of U.S. Virgin Islands Delegate to Congress Donna M. Christensen and named her a Co-Chair of Hillary's U.S. Territories Campaign and a member of the Campaign's Health Care Task Force.
"We need change, and Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to deliver it," Congresswoman Christensen said. "Hillary is ready to lead this country on her first day in the White House and her health care platform - and its emphasis on ensuring health equity - is exactly the direction we need to be heading."
Congresswoman Christensen is serving her sixth term, and is the only African-American physician serving in Congress and the first female physician ever elected to Congress. She serves on the Committee on Natural Resources and the Homeland Security Committees and is Chair of the Subcommittee on Insular Affairs. Congresswoman Christensen is also Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust.
Prior to being elected to Congress, Congresswoman Christensen served as the Medical Director of the St. Croix Hospital and as the Territorial Acting Commissioner of Health.
"Donna's tireless efforts to provide health care for her constituents and all Americans - regardless of gender, geography, race or ethnicity - is truly an inspiration," Clinton said. "I look forward to working with her as we bring our message of change, equality and fairness across the country."
