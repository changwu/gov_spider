    Enjoying solid support with Granite State voters
LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” A Rasmussen poll released yesterday shows 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul third place in New Hampshire, further solidifying his position at the top of the field among New Hampshire primary voters. Paul won 14 percent of likely primary-goers in the poll.
"The latest poll results show Ron Paul as a solid choice in New Hampshire and a refreshing voice against the status quo," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton. "The American people, and the people of New Hampshire, are paying attention and are ready for a candidate with the conviction to bring about real change."
The latest poll follows a number of recent polls placing Paul among the top three in key early states. According to NewsMax/Insider Advantage, Ron Paul is a solid second place in Iowa. And in a recent American Research Group poll, Paul took third among likely Iowa Republican caucus-goers. He also scores third place in New Hampshire, according to a recent WMUR/University of New Hampshire poll. And the most recent Suffolk University/7 News poll has Paul holding steady in second place with 14 percent among likely New Hampshire primary voters.
In addition, a late October CNN/Time poll showed the Texas congressman in the top three in the key Republican primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina.
