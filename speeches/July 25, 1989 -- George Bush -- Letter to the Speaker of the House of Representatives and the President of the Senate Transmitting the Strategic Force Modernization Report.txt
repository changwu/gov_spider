    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Transmitted herewith is the report requested in section 908 of the FY 89 National Defense Authorization Act. Both classified and unclassified versions are provided.
The forces described in this report are illustrative only. They represent a range of forces that would be permitted by a treaty if it were concluded in accordance with the positions tabled by the United States at the strategic arms negotiations. In particular, the options that do not contain mobile ICBMs do not at present correspond with our fundamental goals for the ICBM forces and our Defense program. Each of the examples demonstrates the importance of continued, aggressive strategic force modernization of all three elements of the strategic triad.
It is inappropriate to make a recommendation from among these illustrations at this time. That should await both our own budget deliberations and further progress in the START negotiations.
I am fully committed to the strategic modernization program I have put forward. The modernization of our submarine, bomber and land-based missile force is essential to the continued strength of our deterrent and to the success of these very important negotiations.
Sincerely,
George Bush
