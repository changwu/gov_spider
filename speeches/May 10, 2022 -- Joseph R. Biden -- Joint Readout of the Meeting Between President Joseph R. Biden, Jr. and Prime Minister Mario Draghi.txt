    President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. of the United States and Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy met today at the White House. The leaders reaffirmed the strong and broad U.S.-Italian partnership reflected in the deep and enduring ties between our people and our countries, of which our alliance through NATO and the U.S. partnership with the EU are critical components. They discussed recent developments in Russia's unprovoked and unjustified war in Ukraine. They underscored their continued commitment to pursuing peace by supporting Ukraine and imposing costs on Russia. In the face of the global economic challenges created by Russia's actions, they discussed measures aimed at fostering food security and reshaping global energy markets. They committed to maintaining their work together on global crises from COVID-19 to climate change, as well as to continuing their cooperation on shared foreign policy challenges, including China and Libya. The leaders looked forward to further discussions at the G-7 Summit and NATO Summit in June.
