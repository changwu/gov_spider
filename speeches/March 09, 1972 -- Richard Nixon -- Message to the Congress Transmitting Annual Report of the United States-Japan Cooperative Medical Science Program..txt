    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to send to the Congress the Fifth Annual Report of the United States-Japan Cooperative Medical Science Program.
This joint research effort in the medical sciences, undertaken in 1965 following a meeting between the Prime Minister of Japan and the President of the United States, continues its sharp focus upon widespread diseases of great importance in Asian nations: cholera, leprosy, malnutrition, the parasitic diseases filariasis and schistosomiasis, tuberculosis and certain viral diseases.
During 1971 several reports were published marking this program's first 5 years of research progress. Following careful planning and a review of objectives, it has been decided to expand the program scope to include research concerned with pollutant induced cancer, birth defects and related abnormalities.
This effort remains directed primarily toward diseases in Asia, however, the research results are clearly relevant to a much broader human spectrum. I am particularly heartened by the mutuality of this joint activity which has been undertaken so successfully by biomedical scientists in Japan and the United States. We can find few satisfactions greater than working effectively together with other nations for the ultimate benefit of all mankind.
