    Across the country, people are experiencing the devastating impacts of extreme weather worsened by climate change. As peak hurricane season approaches, my administration continues taking action to bolster the country's preparedness and support response and recovery efforts.
I continue to be briefed on Tropical Storm Harold and its potential impacts on South Texas. At my direction, FEMA predeployed personnel to Texas to assist State and local officials and to coordinate on any requests for resources should Federal assistance be required. FEMA has also made preparations to surge personnel and resources, if needed. I urge people in the storm's path to follow State and local guidance.
I have also been briefed on Tropical Storm Franklin, and I directed FEMA to predeploy personnel and resources to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We continue to monitor the storm's path, and I urge people in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to follow local guidance.
