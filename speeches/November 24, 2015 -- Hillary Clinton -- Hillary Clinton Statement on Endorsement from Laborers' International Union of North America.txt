    Hillary Clinton released the following statement after earning the endorsement from the Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA). Clinton now has the support of nearly 11 million union members across 15 different national unions who have endorsed her campaign.
"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of the Laborers' International Union of North America, one of the fastest-growing and most diverse unions in the country.
"Unions like LIUNA have helped build the great American middle class, and they are essential as we work to build the good-paying jobs and careers of the 21st century. It's time to put more Americans to work modernizing our infrastructure—building roads and bridges, repairing leaky pipelines, upgrading our water systems, and hardening our energy system against the threats of cyberattack and climate change. As President, I will fight to increase investment in our infrastructure, including our energy infrastructure, and will protect the prevailing wage standards and project labor agreements that make construction careers middle-class careers.
"I have always stood with organized labor and working Americans, and I will stand with them and fight for them as President. Because when workers are strong, families are strong—and when families are strong, America is strong."
