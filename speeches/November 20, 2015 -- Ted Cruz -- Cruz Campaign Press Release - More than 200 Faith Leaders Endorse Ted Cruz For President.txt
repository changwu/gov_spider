HOUSTON, Texas — Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today announced additions to his Faith Leadership Team which include more than 200 faith leaders from around the nation. This follows the campaign's announcement yesterday of it's National Prayer Team, led by Cruz Crew volunteers, dedicated to a focused season of prayer on behalf of the nation, Cruz, and his family and staff. Cruz continues to show commitment to conservative values by rallying people of all faiths to unite around support of religious liberty. Cruz has held two Rallies for Religious Liberty that were widely attended, the first in Iowa on August 21 and most recently in South Carolina on November 14.
"I am excited to be surrounded by so many people of faith," Cruz said. "Believers are alarmed that their values are not being represented, nor their liberties respected, in Washington. This list reflects a wide range of denominations, ministries, geography, and church size. At every level of our campaign and in all of the early states, we are allied with leaders of faith communities, from mega churches to small-town congregations and parishes. People of faith who have never participated in the election process are engaging early, and they are taking leadership roles!"
"We know that if even a fraction of the evangelicals who routinely don't vote were to turnout and vote, Washington could be changed almost overnight," Cruz continued. "Bringing new faith voters to the polls is an essential part of our strategy, and we are succeeding."
Multiple independent legal firms focusing on religious liberties advise that clergy may discuss the positions of candidates, endorse or oppose candidates for public office, and make personal financial contributions to candidates without violating any of the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code.
"More than 75,000 Americans of faith have signed up to support Cruz for President since the campaign launched," said Reverend Rafael Cruz, Ted's father. "We are witnessing a groundswell of enthusiasm and support for a Ted Cruz presidency. This is a testament both to the high interest in Ted among people of faith and to his consistent defense of religious liberty for all Americans at every step of his career. People admire Ted's courage – this is the kind of president we have been looking for. Increasingly, the faith community is coalescing behind Ted Cruz."
