    To the Congress of the United States:
The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program offers duty-free treatment to specified products that are imported from designated developing countries. The program is authorized by title V of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended.
Pursuant to title V, I have determined that Cambodia should be designated as a least developed beneficiary developing country under the GSP program because it has taken steps to improve worker rights and the protection of intellectual property. I have also determined, as a result of the 1995 Annual Review of petitions for changes that three products should be added to the GSP list of eligible products and that the competitive need limits on 22 products should be waived. As a result of a review of 1996 imports of GSP products, I have determined that de minimis limits on 79 products be waived and 11 products, whose imports no longer exceed the program's competitive need limits, should be redesignated as GSP eligible. Finally as a result of certain provisions of the legislation enacted in August 1996 reauthorizing GSP, I am granting GSP eligibility to an additional 1,783 articles not previously included under GSP, provided that they are imported directly from the least developed beneficiary developing countries.
This notice is submitted in accordance with the requirements of title V of the Trade Act of 1974.
