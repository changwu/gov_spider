    Situation in the Middle East
Q. Mr. President, are you consider cutting off ties to Yasser Arafat, sir?
The President. I am disappointed in Yasser Arafat. He must make a full effort to rout out terror in the Middle East. In order for there to be peace, we've got to rout out terror. And ordering up weapons that were intercepted on a boat headed towardâ€”headed for that part of the world is not part of fighting terror; that's enhancing terror. And obviously, we're very disappointed.
Q. We're told that you thought his explanation was insulting, sir.
The President. I never said that. Thank you all.
