    The President. Can you hear me? Good. Well, first of all, let me thank you all for coming. I'm astonished by this crowd, but it is what we have seen all week. I can't thank you enough on behalf of all of us for the wonderful hospitality we've had here. My family never needed a vacation more, and it's hard to imagine how this one could have been better. We are going home immensely grateful to all the people who have been here, for your hospitality, your warmth, your understanding of the problems we caused on occasion and very much refreshed, renewed, and ready to go back to work for the American people.
We have a lot of work to do. We're going to take up the health care issue, which I think is the most important thing out there facing our country right now and any number of other things that you will read about in the days ahead.
I don't want to give a political talk tonight. I just want to tell you that, at a very personal level, this was a wonderful 10 days for us, and we are grateful to all of you. This has been a great time. This is a great family place. I wish everyone in America could see it, but at times I thought everyone in America was here already. [Laughter]
I'd like to ask Hillary to come up and say a word on behalf of our family, and I want to thank you again. And we want to get out here and shake a few hands before we leave, but I want Hillary to say a word or two.
[At this point, Hillary Clinton expressed her thanks.]
The President. Thank you very much. Bless you. I hope we'll see you again. Thank you so much.
