    DNC Member Enid Goubeaux cites Obama's ability to end "politics as usual"
Chicago, IL - Today, Ohio superdelegate and DNC member Enid Goubeaux endorsed Barack Obama.
Her statement is below:
"I am endorsing Sen. Obama because his message, 'Ëœyes we can' has inspired so many voters, especially younger voters, to take part in shaping our country's future.
