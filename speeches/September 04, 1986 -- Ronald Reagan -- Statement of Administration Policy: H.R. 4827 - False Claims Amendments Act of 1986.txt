    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Glickman (D) Kansas and 10 others)
The Administration supports House passage of the House Judiciary Committee amendment to be offered as an amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 4827. This proposal, in conjunction with legislation such as S. 1134, the "Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act," which would permit agencies to use an administrative proceeding to prosecute certain fraud cases, is essential to strengthening the Government's ability to combat fraud.
