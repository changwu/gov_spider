    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revision)(House)(Rep. Mica (D) Florida and eight others)
The Administration supports passage of H.R. 2068 with an understanding that the Committee will accept an amendment to delete Section 120 regarding passport and counseler services. However, the Administration will continue to work for deletion of Section 108 that restricts the use of migration and refugee assistance funds.
Section 108 would preclude voluntary agencies from receiving any refugee resettlement grants from the State Department if other law, sought by the Administration, to keep refugees off welfare for the first ninety days after arrival in the United States is enacted. This would have a disastrous result by effectively barring the State Department from rechanneling initial refugee support assistance through private voluntary agencies. Section 120 would establish a consular and passport services fund by earmarking receipts now credited to the miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury. Establishment of such an independent fund would weaken Executive and congressional oversight and controls over the allocation of approximately $200 million of annual expenditures, hamper both the President and Congress in their determinations of budget priorities, and unduly complicate the provisions of passport and consular services to the public.
