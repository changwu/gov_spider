    The President has named Loretta Avent, his Special Assistant for Intergovernmental Affairs, to be the White House Liaison to the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, the White House announced today.
"Too often in the past, the Federal Government has not been a very good neighbor to the rest of the Washington area," said the President. "I am committed to changing that relationship and have full confidence in Loretta's ability to act effectively to make the White House a full partner in the affairs of the region where we live."
