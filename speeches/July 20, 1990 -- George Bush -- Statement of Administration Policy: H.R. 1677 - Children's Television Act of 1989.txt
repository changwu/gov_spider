    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Bryant (D) Texas and 43 others)
The Administration believes that broadcasters should be encouraged to increase both the amount and the quality of children's programming. Nevertheless, the Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1677 in its current form and urges that it not be considered under suspension of the rules.
Section 4(2) raises serious First Amendment concerns by permitting the Government to deny license renewals if a station does not carry what the Government views as adequate programming for children. The Administration recommends amending it to delete the requirement that the Federal Communications Commission consider children's programming in the license renewal process. The amendment could instead require stations to investigate and evaluate whether their programming adequately serves the educational and informational needs of children.
Section 3(b) would limit the amount of advertising in children's programming. This provision may constrain revenues and defeat the purpose of the bill by causing a reduction in children's programming.
