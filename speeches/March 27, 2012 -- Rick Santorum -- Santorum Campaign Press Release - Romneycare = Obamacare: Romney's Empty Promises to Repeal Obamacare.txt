    Verona, PA - On the second day of Supreme Court hearings to determine the constitutionality of Obamacare, we ask the question: How can we trust that Mitt Romney will repeal Obamacare? After implementing socialized medicine as Governor of Massachusetts, Romney advocated for implementing Romneycare nationwide, so why should we believe now that he will repeal Obamacare when he helped put it in place?
Washington Examiner's Senior Editorial Writer Phillip Klein wrote about the reason to doubt Romney will repeal Obamacare: "Mitt Romney talks a big game about repealing Obamacare on the campaign trail these days. But in the wake of the law's passage, he had a more modest goal: 'repeal the bad and keep the good.'"
Klein concludes that Romney will "slowly retreat back to his position to repeal the 'worst aspects' of the law. The one hope for changing this would be for conservatives - and their allies in Congress - to raise hell every single day and make it clear that Romney will not get anything done until the health care law is repealed."
Rick Santorum took his case to the steps of the United States Supreme Court Monday and repeated his vow to repeal Obamacare, saying: "If we run this campaign-which I will-on Obamacare, if we make this the central issue of the campaign, and we're successful, there's no doubt that Obamacare will be repealed in one way or another. And that's not going to be the case with Gov. Romney because he can't make it the argument," Santorum said. "Because if he makes it the argument, the Obama machine will turn it right back on him and therefore there won't be the mandate. He may say he wants to repeal Obamacare, but he won't have the mandate for the course of this campaign to be able to win the argument, not just here in Congress but across the country."
