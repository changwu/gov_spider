    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Tennessee and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms, high winds, and heavy rain on July 21-22, 2003.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in the Shelby County. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
Federal funding is also available to State and eligible local governments on a cost-sharing basis for the repair or replacement of public facilities damaged by the severe storms, high winds, and heavy rain in the counties of Fayette and Shelby.
In addition, Federal funding is available on a cost-share basis for hazard mitigation measures.
Representing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Michael D. Brown, Under Secretary for Emergency Preparedness and Response, Department of Homeland Security, named Charles M. Butler as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The Agency said that damage surveys are continuing in other areas, and additional counties may be added for assistance after the assessments are completed.
