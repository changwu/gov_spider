    The Trump campaign released the following statement after Joe Biden said, "There's more than one, one, you know, coronavirus. This covid-9 is one strain of that."
"Joe Biden masquerades as the guy with all the answers on the coronavirus but then he demonstrates quite clearly that he has no idea what he's talking about. He is still the same guy the Obama White House had to apologize for during the swine flu outbreak of 2009. Ol' Joe has lost his fastball, if he ever had one to start with."
- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
