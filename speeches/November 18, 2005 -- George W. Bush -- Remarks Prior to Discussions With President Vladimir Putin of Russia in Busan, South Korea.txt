    President Putin. Distinguished Mr. President, allow me to cordially welcome you and your colleagues. And I get impression that with some of your colleagues, I never said goodbye. [Laughter] And it is very pleasant indeed, that with these colleagues, we virtually had permanent contacts on almost all bilateral and international issues.
And I'm especially pleased to have this meeting with you here in South Korea. You stayed here for quite a while, and probably you will tell me of your impressions.
President Bush. That's right. Thank you.
Well, thanks, Vladimir, for hosting this meeting. I always enjoy a chance to have a good discussion with you. You're right; we've got a very important relationship. We value your advice, and we value the strategic relationship we've built. So thanksâ€”thanks again for hosting this.
