    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICYThis Statement Has Been Coordinated by OMB with the Appropriate Agencies
(Senate)(McCain (R) Arizona and 18 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 1219, as amended by the Senate on June 20th, for the reasons explained in the attached letter from the President dated June 24th.
This bipartisan legislation includes many proposals that have been endorsed by the President since 1992. It will limit campaign spending, provide free and discounted broadcast time to candidates for Federal office, curb the influence of political action committees and lobbyists, and put an end to the "soft money" system. S. 1219 will open the political process and shift power from special interests to ordinary citizens.
