.@FoxNews Polls are always bad for me. They were against Crooked Hillary also. Something weird going on at Fox. Our polls show us leading in all 17 Swing States. For the record I didn't spend 30 hours with @abcnews but rather a tiny fraction of that. More Fake News @BretBaierRetweets: 16040Favorites: 64663

Next week ICE will begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States. They will be removed as fast as they come in. Mexico using their strong immigration laws is doing a very good job of stopping people.......Retweets: 37105Favorites: 154390

....long before they get to our Southern Border. Guatemala is getting ready to sign a Safe-Third Agreement. The only ones who won't do anything are the Democrats in Congress. They must vote to get rid of the loopholes and fix asylum! If so Border Crisis will end quickly!Retweets: 23981Favorites: 111326

The story in the @nytimes about the U.S. escalating attacks on Russia's power grid is Fake News and the Failing New York Times knows it. They should immediately release their sources which if they exist at all which I doubt are phony. Times must be held fully accountable!Retweets: 18270Favorites: 69504

Wow! The State Department said it has identified 30 Security Incidents involving current or former employees and their handling of Crooked Hillary Clinton's Emails. @FoxNews This is really big. Never admitted before. Highly Classified Material. Will the Dems investigate this?Retweets: 25397Favorites: 82423

Only a few people showed up for the so-called Impeachment rallies over the weekend. The numbers were anemic no spirit no hope. More importantly No Collusion No Obstruction!Retweets: 18185Favorites: 86092

Mario Draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the Euro against the Dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the USA. They have been getting away with this for years along with China and others.Retweets: 14592Favorites: 58420

Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan who has done a wonderful job has decided not to go forward with his confirmation process so that he can devote more time to his family....Retweets: 12965Favorites: 74126
