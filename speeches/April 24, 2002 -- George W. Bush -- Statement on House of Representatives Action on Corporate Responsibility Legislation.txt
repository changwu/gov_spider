    I commend the House for acting quickly to pass reforms that improve corporate responsibility and protect shareholders. The House bill includes the three core principles of my 10-point planâ€”providing better information to investors, making corporate officers more accountable, and developing a stronger, more independent audit system. With 80 million Americans participating as shareholders of companies, we must ensure high standards, tough disclosure requirements, and accurate information. The House bill is a responsible approach to addressing these important issues.
