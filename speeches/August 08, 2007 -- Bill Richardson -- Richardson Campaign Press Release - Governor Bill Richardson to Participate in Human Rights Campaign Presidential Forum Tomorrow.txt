    SANTA FE, NM -- Governor Bill Richardson will participate in the Human Rights Campaign Presidential Forum in Los Angeles on Thursday, August 9th, at 6:15pm (Pacific Time).
"I have been a proud and committed supporter of my friends in the GLBT community throughout my time in public service. I am happy to have the opportunity to detail my positions and record, and to make it clear why I am the best presidential candidate for American gays and lesbians," said Governor Richardson.
Governor Richardson's record on issues of importance to the GLBT community is unmatched in the presidential race. As Governor of New Mexico, he expanded anti-discrimination laws to include sexual orientation, provided state health insurance for domestic partnerships, and signed into law the state's first hate crimes legislation that includes acts based on sexual orientation. He has fought hard to get a full domestic partnerships bill passed in New Mexico and he will continue fighting until it is law. As a Congressman, Richardson opposed the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy.
WHEN: Thursday, August 9th, 6:15 PM (PT)
