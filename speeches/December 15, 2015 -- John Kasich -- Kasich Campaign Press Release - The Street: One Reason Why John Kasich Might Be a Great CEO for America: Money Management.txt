By James Passeri
The Street: Don't be fooled by the fact that John Kasich's resume includes a seven-year stint at Lehman Brothers: He may still be the most fiscally responsible of the Republican presidential hopefuls.
While the Ohio governor served as a managing director at the failed investment bank — which is often viewed as the domino whose fall touched off the worst of the 2008 financial crisis — his tenure as a managing director belies a successful career as both a thrifty fiscal planner and bipartisan deal maker.
"The next president is going to face an extremely serious budget situation," said Chris Edwards, the director of tax policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. "And Kasich knows the federal budget better than all the other candidates."
As chairman of the House Budget Committee, Kasich helped reach across party aisles in 1997, working with Congressional Democrats and President Bill Clinton's administration to create a fiscal plan that balanced the budget for the first time since 1969, according to Edwards.
If the role of president is somewhat akin to that of a corporate CEO, Kasich's aptitude in controlling costs may be the most important of the skills he could bring to the job. While he has never been a corporate CEO, along with his work in finance, he has served as Ohio's chief executive since 2011.
In that role, he reduced the state income tax by 16% and eliminated the so-called "death tax" under which the state collected a portion of household and small-business assets when they were included in inheritances.
