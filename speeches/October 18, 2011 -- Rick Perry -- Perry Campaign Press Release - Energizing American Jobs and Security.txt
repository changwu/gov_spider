    Gov. Rick Perry will energize American jobs and national security through executive orders and executive actions that expand energy exploration all across America. Key components of his plan, Energizing American Jobs and Security, include:

Expand energy exploration offshore and on federal and private lands across the country by executive order, creating over 1.2 million jobs
Eliminate current and proposed activist EPA regulations from the Obama administration, saving 2.4 million jobs by 2020 and lowering projected costs by $127 billion
Reduce, rebuild, and refocus the EPA federal regulators, returning authority to the states
Level the playing field for all energy producers, removing Obama's practice of picking winners and losers and ending the Obama war on coal and natural gas production

Gov. Perry's plan is based on a simple premise: Make what Americans buy. Buy what Americans make. And sell it to the world.
