    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Texas Speaker of the House Joe Straus.
"I'm very pleased to earn Joe's endorsement," said Mitt Romney. "The people of Texas are looking for a leader that will stand up to President Obama and clearly articulate conservative values. We've had enough of the out-of-control spending, government intrusion, and economic decline of the last three years. I look forward to working with Joe in the months to come as I outline my vision to restore America's greatness."
Announcing his support, Speaker Straus said, "From the Olympics to major businesses, Mitt Romney has proven his ability to turn around troubled organizations, and I can think of few places more in need of a turnaround than Washington, D.C. We've seen a number of good candidates in this primary race; I believe Mitt Romney is the best choice to defeat President Obama and bring our Texas spirit of low taxes, limited government, balanced budgets and fiscal conservatism to Washington."
