Another one of many Fake T.V. Ads, this one about the Tennessee Valley Authority, which for years has paid its top executive a ridiculous FORTUNE. Not run by the U.S., but I have long been fighting that crazy "salary" & its polices. Strange ad paid for (?) by "U.S. Tech Workers".Retweets: 27718Favorites: 119545
