LAKE JACKSON, Texas — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul drew an incredible 4,600-plus supporters and undecided voters to a massive town hall meeting in Illinois.
The event took place at 7:00 p.m. CST at the University of Illinois, located at 1206 South Fourth Street, Champaign, IL 61820. Due to a deluge of early RSVPs for Dr. Paul's campus town hall meeting, the original university speaking venue of Foellinger Auditorium was switched to George Huff Hall, which was filled to capacity and then some. Event organizers noted that today's balmy weather of about 80 degrees resulted in a hot temperatures inside the un-air conditioned Huff Hall, yet the crowd was as engaged to listen to Dr. Paul as ever.
U.S. Rep. Tim Johnson (R-IL), who recently endorsed Ron Paul for the presidency, introduced the 12-term Congressman from Texas. Dr. Paul, for his part, spoke about his platform of constitutionally-limited government, the inseparable link between personal and economic liberties, and elements of his path-breaking 'Plan to Restore America.'
The University of Illinois event was organized by 'Youth for Ron Paul' (YFP), an initiative of the Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign. Since 'Youth for Ron Paul' launched in September 2011, students nationwide have organized 583 chapters and recruited more than 46,000 people.
