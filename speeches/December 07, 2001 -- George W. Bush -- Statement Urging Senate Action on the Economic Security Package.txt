    Today's unemployment numbers are troubling, and they underscore that we must act to ensure America's economic security. The most important thing we can do for unemployed workers and those who are concerned about their jobs is to get the economy growing. The Senate has not acted on the economic security package I proposed in October, and since then, over three-quarters of a million Americans have lost their jobs. Today's important economic warning demonstrates that American workers have already waited too long, so I urge the Senate to take immediate action to help workers and our economy.
