    The President's Scheduled Travel to Saudi Arabia 
Q. Mr. President, have you made a decision about how you will handle the Khashoggi killing when you go to Saudi Arabia?
The President. The same way I've been handling it. I'm not going to meet with—I'm not going to meet with MBS; I'm going to an international meeting. And he's going to be a part of it, just like there were people part of the discussion today.
Q. Sir—[inaudible]——
Ukraine 
Q. Mr. President, how concerned are you about the three Americans who are reportedly missing in Ukraine? Have you been briefed?
The President. I have been briefed. We don't know where they are.
But I want to reiterate: Americans should not be going to Ukraine now. I'll say it again: Americans should not be going to Ukraine now. They should not be going to Ukraine.
Oil and Gasoline Prices 
Q. What will the consequences be for oil companies if they don't boost supplies?
The President. Well, look, one of the things that has happened is that the price of gasoline exceeds the price based on the barrel of oil costs right now. So if you just take what a barrel of oil costs on average, it should not be this high. They're making exorbitant profits, number one.
Number two, I've contacted them—my team has—to ask what their plans are and to give any suggestions they have. They have over 9,000 leases—9,000. They can drill until they're—until hell won't have it. But they're not doing it, number two.
Number three, I think we're going to be in a position where we're going to—oh——
[At this point, the First Lady approached the President.]
The First Lady. We've got to go! [Laughter]
[Several reporters spoke at once.]
Q. Mr. President, do you still consider MBS a rogue ally?
India 
Q. [Inaudible]—2 billion people in India are waiting for you to visit India.
The President. I've been to India twice, and I'll be back to India. And my relations are very good. Thank you.
