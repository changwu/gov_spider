    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Young (R) AK and four others)
The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 2677. This bill would: (1) seriously compromise the management of unique Federal resources for which the Department of the Interior is responsible; and (2) require the expenditure of scarce Federal resources to train State employees who would only, use such training in the rare event of a government shutdown. The bill also fails to address a variety of liability, management, and cost issues. There would be no need for this type of legislation if Congress would enact an Interior Appropriations Act that is acceptable to the President or a continuing resolution until such time as an acceptable appropriations bill is enacted.
