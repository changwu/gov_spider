    THE PRESIDENT.. I understand that on occasion there will be inadvertent inaccuracies in reporting of news. And this is part of our system and I don't condemn it; I live with it. But this morning there was an example that I think is serious enough to warrant a direct appearance before you by the President of the United States.
This story in the Washington Post, "White House Imposes Freeze on Strategic Arms Talks," is totally inaccurate. And before that story was published, the reporters were informed that the story was totally inaccurate. The editors decided to go ahead with it anyhow.
It damages our country, it damages my credibility, and I think it damages the prospect for a continuation of the basic policy of our Government, which has not changed since I came in office, that is, to proceed aggressively with SALT discussions, to conclude a treaty as early as possible and without delay because of political considerations, and to make sure that that treaty, when concluded, is in the best interests of our country.
This matter has never been discussed, even informally, among the three people in our Government responsible for SALT discussionsâ€”Paul Warnke, the head of ACDA, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, or myself. We have never even discussed it, and I wanted to make it clear and on the record that this story is inaccurate, that our policy is unchanged. And this is the statement I wanted to make to you.
Q. Is it possible someone's trying to torpedo the negotiations?
THE PRESIDENT.. Jody will respond in depth in just a few minutes to any questions that you might have.
Q. Can you tell us anything about your talks with Gromyko, were there any hopeful prospects?
THE PRESIDENT.. Jody can answer that.
