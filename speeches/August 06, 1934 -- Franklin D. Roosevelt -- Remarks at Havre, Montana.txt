    I wish I had a loud speaker on the train, but there is none. This is not a political campaign.
I have never been through this section of Northern Montana and the reason I chose this particular route was because I wanted to learn something at first hand both by talking to the people, and seeing conditions with my own eyes. As you know, we are trying to do a good many new things, but I believe the country understands what we are trying to do and is supporting our effort to make a better living for the average citizen.
I notice that here we are on the outskirts, the edge, of what we call the secondary drought area. I am glad it has not been any worse here than it actually has.
We have to provide in the days to come for the elimination of the causes not only of drought but of the conditions that come from drought. It is going to take a long time to do it, but, as I have said before, I think we are on our way and that you good people understand it and are supporting it.
I wish I had time to stop off here and spend a little longer time, but I have been away from Washington now for a little over five weeks—it was actually five weeks yesterday—having covered the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Canal Zone and Hawaii. I have to get back to the Nation's capital.
I hope when I come back through here next that things are going to be better than they are today. Many thanks.
