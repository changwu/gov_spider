Effective today, pursuant to section 12304 of title 10, United States Code, I am authorizing the Secretary of Defense to order units and individual members of the Selected Reserve to active duty to augment active component forces for the effective conduct of "Enhanced Department of Defense Counternarcotic Operation in the Western Hemisphere." This authority is necessary to ensure the Department of Defense can properly conduct operations required to meet our evolving security challenges.
