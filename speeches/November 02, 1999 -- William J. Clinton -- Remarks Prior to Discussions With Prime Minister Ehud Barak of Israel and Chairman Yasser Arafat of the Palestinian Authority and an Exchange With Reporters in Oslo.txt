    Middle East Peace Process
The President. I think I can speak for all of us when I say, first, we're very grateful to the Government of Norway for inviting us here for this important ceremony. And we now have to give some real energy to the framework talks, but I think even though the issues are difficult, the will is strong, and we're off to a good start.
Q. How do you see the strong focus, Mr. President, on the issue of the settlement?
The President. I think that the less we say now to the public and the more we work in private, the better off we'll be and the more likely we will be able to get an agreement.
Q. [Inaudible]—a summit in January or February in Washington, or maybe in Camp David?
The President. I wouldn't—I don't think we should rule it out or in. We ought to make sure—see how much progress we can make between now and then. You know, I would do anything I could to help them.
Q. What is the main issue you will discuss right now when you start negotiations?
The President. I think we just have to talk about—to get agreement on the ground rules, how we're going to proceed.
