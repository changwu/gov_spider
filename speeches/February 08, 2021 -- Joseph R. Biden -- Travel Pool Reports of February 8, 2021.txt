Travel pool report #1 — En route to New Castle base 
Wilmington, Del.
Good frigid Monday morning. The POTUS motorcade departed his Wilmington home at 8:22 a.m. and we are on our way to New Castle Air National Guard Base for a quick return back to Washington.

Travel pool report #2 — Departure from Delaware 
New Castle Air National Guard Base, Del.
The POTUS motorcade arrived at New Castle Air National Guard Base at 8:32 a.m. POTUS boarded AF1 shortly thereafter, and he appeared to trip very slightly going up the stairs but quickly caught himself on the railing. TV pooler says there is video.
Wheels up shortly back to JBA.

Travel pool report #3 — JBA arrival
Andrews Air Force Base, Md.
AF1 landed at JBA at 9:13 a.m. after a 29-minute, uneventful flight. No visitors to the back of the cabin. CNN was playing on the giant television screen in the conference room near the front of the plane.
POTUS disembarked AF1 at 9:23 a.m., saluting the base commander and walking with him toward M1 while patting his back. When he boarded M1, POTUS saluted again and waved. M1 took off from JBA at 9:28 a.m.
With that, passing it off to in-town pool. It's been a pleasure serving as your pooler for President Biden's first AF1 trip, and apologies again for messing up all those Delaware town names. Thanks to Geoff Earle for all his help this weekend.
