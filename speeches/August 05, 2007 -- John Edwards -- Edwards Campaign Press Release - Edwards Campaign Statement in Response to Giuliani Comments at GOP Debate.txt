    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ John Edwards for President National Press Secretary Eric Schultz released the following statement about Rudy Giuliani's comments today during the GOP debate attacking Senator John Edwards' plan to restore fairness to our tax code. Edwards recently released a plan that raises the tax rate on capital gains to 28 percent for families earning more than $250,000. Additionally, Edwards proposed a "Get Ahead" credit cutting taxes on the savings of Americans up to $75,000.
"Today, Rudy Giuliani showed yet again that all he has to offer America is four more years of George W. Bush. Giuliani, Bush and the greedy special interests they represent want to keep Washington rigged. That all ends when John Edwards is sworn-in, the lobbyists are kicked out, and regular people start getting a fair shot."
