    I am extremely pleased that Secretary of State Baker and Foreign Minister Pankin have announced that the United States and the Soviet Union are issuing invitations to a Middle East peace conference in Madrid beginning on October 30.
I myself plan to be there to help open this historic gathering, one with the potential to bring true peace and security to the peoples of the area.
As the invitation makes clear, the objective of the effort is nothing less than a just, lasting, and comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict, to be achieved through a two-track approach of direct negotiations between Israel and the Arab States and Israel and the Palestinians based upon U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.
I very much hope that all those invited will respond quickly and affirmatively so that the necessary organization and preparations can be completed for this historic undertaking.
