    Two-week swing will highlight key economic issues
Chicago, IL - The Obama campaign announced today that Senator Obama will launch a two-week economic swing—the "Change that Works for You" tour—on Monday, June 9. Obama will travel across the country, talking to Americans about how the economy affects their everyday lives. He'll hold events with voters where they work and where they live, discussing the challenges we face and his plans to turn the economy around.
The tour will kick off on Monday with an economic speech in Raleigh, North Carolina.
"The middle class has always been the engine of prosperity in this country—but for nearly eight years we've had an administration that tells working people 'you're on your own,'" Senator Obama said. "Not when I'm President. I'll reform our tax code to benefit the middle class instead of the big corporations. I'll make sure that quality health care is affordable and accessible for every American. And I'll provide real relief from the housing crisis by creating a foreclosure prevention fund, providing a tax break for homeowners, and cracking down on fraudulent lenders. Those are the kind of solutions that will make a difference for working Americans—and that's the kind of change we'll be discussing on this tour."
