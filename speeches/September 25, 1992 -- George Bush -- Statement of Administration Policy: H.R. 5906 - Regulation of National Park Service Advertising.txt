    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 9/28/92)(House)(Vento (D) MN and Lagomarsino (R) CA)
The Administration opposes H.R. 5906, which would limit the National Park Service's (NPS) authority to regulate advertising in the National Park System. Such a restriction is unnecessary and may have undesirable and unintended consequences. The NPS already regulates and controls advertising, commercial activities, and special events to protect natural and cultural park resources throughout the Nation. The NPS also has regulations that prohibit its employees from endorsing products or services for advertising, publicity, or sales purposes.
The statutory advertising prohibitions embodied in H.R. 5906 lack the flexibility that is necessary to deal with complex issues over time. For example, under H.R. 5906, the NPS would be precluded from permitting a number of charitable events within the boundaries of the National Park System, such as the annual Marine Corps Marathon, the Desert Storm homecoming, and the Race for the Cure. In contrast, existing regulations protect the public interest, while enabling full recognition of park contributors and allowing appropriate special events within the National Park System.
