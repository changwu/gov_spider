    On Eid al-Fitr, the First Lady and I send our warmest greetings to Muslims in the United States and around the world as they celebrate.
Known as the "Festival of Breaking the Fast," Eid al-Fitr marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan, a month filled with fasting, prayer, reflection, and other traditional observances. Over the past weeks and months, as we have fought the coronavirus, we have relied on our faith, family, and friends to help guide us through these unprecedented times. As Muslims observe the day of Eid al-Fitr, we hope they find both comfort and strength in the healing powers of prayer and devotion.
Now more than ever we are reminded of the reassuring peace, uplifting love, and heartening fellowship that religion brings into our lives. We send our best wishes for a blessed and joyous Eid al-Fitr.
