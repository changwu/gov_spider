    Today Congressmen Jim Kolbe and Charles Stenholm announced their bipartisan legislation to shore up Social Security through personal accounts. President Bush congratulates Congressmen Kolbe and Stenholm for the bipartisan nature of their efforts. For the last few years, these two Congressmen have worked across party lines in an effort to build a bipartisan consensus to strengthen Social Security through personal accounts. In recent months, they have given active and important support to the bipartisan Commission to Strengthen Social Security. Although the White House cannot embrace every aspect of their legislation, the President nonetheless believes that we should encourage all constructive proposals. The President expresses appreciation for the work being done by Congressmen Kolbe and Stenholm, and calls upon others to emulate their bipartisan spirit.
