    Progress on almost every issue discussed on the debate stage tonight is being held up by one thing: the toxic influence of money in politics. Our broken campaign finance system has left Washington unable to tackle the defining problems of our time — climate change, rising healthcare costs, gun violence, and income inequality.
Taking on the corrupting influence of Big Money in politics has been the fight of Governor Bullock's career. As President, he'll start on Day One with an ambitious plan to combat the influence of money in politics and make sure Washington works for everyone.
Governor Bullock's Record:

Passed one of the most progressive campaign finance disclosure laws in the country, setting a national standard for clean and fair elections.
Has been called the "biggest threat to Citizens United."
As Attorney General, brought the first challenge to Citizens United all the way to the US Supreme Court. 
Sued the Trump Administration over its new dark money loophole which removes transparency requirements for certain political organizations.
Signed an executive order requiring every business that bids on public contracts to disclose their political spending.

Prohibited foreign money from state elections by banning foreign nationals from direct or indirect contributions in Montana elections.
