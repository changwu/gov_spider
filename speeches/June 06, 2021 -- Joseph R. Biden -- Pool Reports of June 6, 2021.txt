In town pool report #1 - lunch lid until 2:45 pm
The White House just called a lunch lid until 2:45 pm.
Greetings from a warm, sunny Sunday afternoon at the White House. The sky is pale blue and completely empty of clouds. It's currently 90 degrees and the weather forecast predicts a high of 95 later today.
President Biden doesn't have any public events on the schedule. The White House won't say if there's an outing in the works, or any other plans. I'll send any information as I get it.
