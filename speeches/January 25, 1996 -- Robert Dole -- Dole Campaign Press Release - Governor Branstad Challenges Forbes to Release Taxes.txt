    (Des Moines, IA) --Governor Terry E. Branstad challenged presidential candidate Steve Forbes to join Senator Bob Dole in releasing detailed records of his finances. The Governor made his challenge on Thursday at the State Capitol.
"Iowans demand openness from their leaders and deserve to know when a candidate has conflicts of interest. As Governor, I have released my tax records every year and certainly think candidates for President of the United States should be held to a similar standard," Branstad commented. "If Steve Forbes wants to be treated like a serious candidate, he should do what the other candidates have done and release information on his personal finances."
In the 1994 Iowa gubernatorial race, Branstad was the only candidate in both the primary and general election to release his detailed tax information to the general public. He has called for the Iowa Legislature to enact a law requiring candidates for statewide office to disclose their financial information every year that they seek or hold public office.
"We know that Steve Forbes as one of the richest men in the world and that he's spending millions of dollars of his own money attacking his fellow Republicans. I think Americans deserve the right to know more about Steve Forbes and his finances."
The Governor added, "As a Midwesterner, Bob Dole has set a new standard for openness and honesty in government by releasing his tax records for every year he has been in public service. that's the kind of leader Iowans want and America needs."
