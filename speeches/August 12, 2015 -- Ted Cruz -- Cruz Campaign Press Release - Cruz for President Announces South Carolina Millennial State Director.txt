HOUSTON, Texasâ€” U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, today announced the addition of a Millennial State Director to his South Carolina grassroots team.
"I understand the crucial role Millennials will play in the 2016 presidential election, and I am proud to welcome Elliott Kelley on to our statewide leadership team." Cruz said. "Elliott's energy, campaign experience and leadership will be a valuable asset to the campaign as we engage students and young professionals in the process."
"I am honored to be the Millennial Director for Senator Ted Cruz's South Carolina campaign," said Elliott Kelley. "I look forward to actively engaging and bringing to the table Millennials for Cruz. Millennials expect the truth, and we will show up at the polls for a leader and a fighter. After all, the Millennials are who will pay the lion's share of Obamacare, if it is not repealed; and Millennials are on the hook for the massive 18-Trillion dollar debt that continues to grow and threaten our futures."
