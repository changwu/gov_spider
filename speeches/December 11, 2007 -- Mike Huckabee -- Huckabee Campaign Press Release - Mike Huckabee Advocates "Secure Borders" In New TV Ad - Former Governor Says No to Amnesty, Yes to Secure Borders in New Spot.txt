    Little Rock, AR â€“ Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee said today that a new television ad, called "Secure Borders," will help Iowa voters understand his plan to secure America 's borders.
"It ought to be at least as difficult to get across an international border as it is to get on an airplane in our own home town," said Huckabee in the ad, echoing a sentiment he often expresses on the campaign trail.
The new 30-second ad, unveiled Monday, will begin airing in Iowa . Huckabee said the ad focuses on his No. priority, which is to seal America 's borders. The former governor unveiled a nine-point plan to reform U.S. immigration laws last week. Huckabee's "Nine-Point Strategy for Immigration Enforcement and Border Security" provides a tough, equitable and comprehensive approach to dealing with the current immigration crisis.
The plan implements a broad-based strategy that commits the resources of the federal government to the enforcement of our immigration laws and results in the attrition of the illegal immigrant population.
The spot (his fourth in Iowa ) also reiterates Huckabee's opposition to amnesty. "We need to make it clear that we'll say no to amnesty and sanctuary cities." said Huckabee.
