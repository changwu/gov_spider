    Thomas Corcoran, known as Tommy to his legion of friends, was one of those bright young men of the 1930's who helped to light America's way through the dark years of the Great Depression. He generated ideas, enthusiasm, and the confidence that something could be done about the problems that beset this country. "Tommy the Cork" was one of those individuals America cannot do withoutâ€”he was an indomitable doer and an irrepressible advocate.
Throughout his years, he remained a valued counselor to Presidents and statesmen. I convey my deepest sympathy to his family and to all Americans who, indeed, have lost a source of vitality and a voice of experience.
