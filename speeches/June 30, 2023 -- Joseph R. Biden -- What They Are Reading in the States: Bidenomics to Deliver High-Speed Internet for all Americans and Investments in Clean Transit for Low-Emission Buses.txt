    Across the country, local news outlets are reporting on the widespread impacts of Bidenomics – President Biden's vision for growing the economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down – like critical investments in the nation's infrastructure.
Just this week, the Biden-Harris Administration announced major investments to provide funding for electric and low emission buses and with the Broadband, Access and Development Program (BEAD), provide every home and business with high-speed internet service by 2030.
