The NATO-Ukraine council meeting has been delayed until 1:30 p.m. The pool was brought into the cavernous room at 12:47 p.m. where the meeting will be held. Before the leaders have arrived, we were positioned on risers to face a crescent table in the center with smaller desks surrounding. At the crest of the table was Stoltenberg's seat, with the Biden's on the right of him. Next to Biden's seat is Sunak's and Zelensky's is to his right. Attaching a photo below.

Travel pool report #6 - meeting
After Zelensky and Stoltenberg gave a press conference in another part of the summit, staff and others began to stream into the meeting room for the council meeting. Biden entered at 1:41 p.m. and walked over to a group that included Sunak, Frederiksen, Stoltenberg among others who mingled and posed for photos. It was too far away to hear any of the conversations, but the leaders were smiling and shaking hands as they spoke. At one point, Biden draped his arm around Sunak's shoulder. Zelensky entered at 1:52 p.m. and shook Biden's hand, posing for photos with Biden and others.
While the press was waiting before the leaders arrived, the Ukrainian flag was brought into the meeting room and placed beside the British Union Jack in a row of NATO member flags.
Stoltenberg gave brief remarks, starting off by recognizing this is the first of such a meeting and saying the gathering would "address the common question of security." He went on to praise Zelensky. "We are inspired by your courage," he said. "Today we meet as equals," he said. Press was then escorted out.

"The outcome of the NATO summit in Vilnius is a very much needed and meaningful success for Ukraine," he said. The remarks concluded at 4:30.

Foreign pool report #9 - Bilat
The pool was brought into another room at 5 p.m. for the bilat with Biden and Zelensky. The leaders were seated in a small room. Biden began with his remarks, telling Zelensky that the United States would continue to back Ukraine with additional support.
"The United States is doing everything we can to get you everything we can," he said. "Bad news for you is we're not going anywhere."
Zelensky then spoke, thanking Biden and the United States for the aid. He then said that he talked with Biden about the criticism from nations that spoke out after the United States said it would provide cluster munitions.
"It's very simple to criticize cluster munitions," Zelensky said, adding that Russia uses such weapons. "I didn't hear some of you countries criticize Russia." Zelensky acknowledged it was a difficult decision for Biden but said "this decision will help us save us." Biden made note of Zelensky's thanks to the American people specifically.
Biden then asked press to leave and wranglers shouted over reporters asking questions. Staff had managed to get some reporters out of the room while the leaders answered two questions.
The wranglers also shouted over the presidents as they answered. Politico's Jonathan Lemire asked if Zelensky was satisfied with the results.
"By the end of this summit, we have great unity for our leaders and security guarantees — that is a success for the summit. I think so but it's my opinion," Zelensky answered.
ABC's Justin Gomez then asked how long should it take before Ukraine be allowed to join NATO.
"An hour and 20 minutes," Biden joked.
Pool was escorted less than 10 minutes after we entered. We're now holding in the vans.

Foreign pool note #1 - background on bilateral with Zelenskyy
Good afternoon,
I'm your foreign pooler for POTUS's bilateral meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The meeting was scheduled for 3:45 PM but will be slightly delayed because of G7.
Zelenskyy and his wife Olena arrived in Lithuania on Tuesday afternoon on the Polish presidential jet. They both attended a concert downtown Vilnius with the Lithuanian first couple. Addressing the crowd, Zelenskyy thanked Lithuanians for "a very clear, honest and courageous position to invite Ukraine to NATO". During the event a flag brought back from the battlefield in Bakhmut was raised. Several thousand people attended the event, many of them waved Ukrainian flags. Today Zelenskyy attended the inaugural meeting of a new NATO-Ukraine Council. He held several bilateral meetings, including with Secretary General of NATO and leaders of United Kingdom, France, Germany, Canada, Australia and Netherlands.
Previous meetings:September 1, 2021 - WashingtonDecember 21, 2022 - WashingtonMay 21, 2023 – Hiroshima, G7 SummitFebruary 20, 2023 - Kyiv
Zelenskyy's Bio43-years old was born in Kryvyi Rih in central Ukraine. He grew up as a native Russian speaker, but he is also fluent in Ukrainian and English. Zelenskyy received a law degree from Kyiv National Economic University but decided to pursue a career as an actor, comedian, script writer and producer. In 2015 Zelenskyy played a role in a popular television series Servant of the People of a schoolteacher who was elected president. Three years later the political party Servant of the People was created, and he successfully run for President of Ukraine, easily unseating the incumbent Petro Poroshenko. Official website of the President of Ukraine's office list his numerous international film festivals awards. It also emphasizes the fact that from outset of the hostilities in Donbas Zelenskyy team "KVARTAL 95" rendered support to the Armed Forces with funds, equipment and arranged shows on the front lines.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy remains one of the most popular politicians around the world. He has surprised many by his transformation from a former comedian into a wartime leader. After the full-scale Russian invasion, Zelenskyy's popularity in Ukraine skyrocketed. His approval ratings in Ukraine remain above 90 percent, with more than 55 percent strongly approving his actions as President.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy is married to Mrs. Olena Zelenska. They have two children - daughter Oleksandra and son Kyrylo.
Agenda:After arriving in Vilnius Zelenskyy laid out the following priorities for his visit to the NATO summit:

new support packages for our army on the battlefield,
understanding that Ukraine has invitation to NATO when the security situation allows it,
security guarantees for Ukraine on the way to NATO.

Military assistance for Ukraine:According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy the United States has committed more than $76 billion in security, humanitarian, and financial aid to Ukraine since the beginning of the Russian invasion in February 2022. Total military assistance reached $46.6 billion, including:

$18.3 billion for training, weapons, equipment, and logistical support through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative,
$23.5 billion in weapons from Defense Department stocks.
$4.7 billion (6%)

In addition, the Biden administration directed to Ukraine $26.4 billion in financial and economic support and $3.8 in humanitarian support.
U.S. provided Ukraine with 42 military packages with wide range of weapon systems and ammunition: Javelin anti-armor systems, Stinger anti-aircraft systems, grenade launchers, 155mm Howitzers and ammunition, HIMARS systems, Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, Abrams tanks, armored personnel carriers, Humvees, Patriot air defense battery and munitions, NASAM systems, Avenger air defense systems, Mi-17 helicopters, and many, many more.
NATO accession:NATO communiqué approved in Tuesday said the alliance would support Ukraine on its path towards joining NATO, but offered no timeline or specific conditions. NATO decided to remove conditions included in Membership Action Plan and create NATO-Ukraine Council.
Yesterday Zelensky expressed disappointment calling the plan absurd. "It's unprecedented and absurd when time frame is not set neither for the invitation nor for Ukraine's membership" - he said.
Responding to Zelenskyy's criticism Amanda Sloat, senior director for Europe at the National Security Council, said that she also considers NATO's communiqué "unprecedented" but in a positive way. She emphasized that by removing MAP NATO members recognized that "Ukraine has already made significant progress in terms of reform".
Today, during joint presser with Stoltenberg, Zelenskyy Zelenskyy changed the tone and thanked NATO for military support and for removing MAP. "I would like to extend words of gratitude to you for these important steps. (…) We highly appreciate the recognition that Ukraine will not need an action plan on its way to NATO." – he said.

Foreign pool report #2 - Kishida full quote
We are waiting for a pool spray on top of the POTUS's meeting with Zelenskyy.
In the meantime, a full Kishida's quote from the G7 event:
I'm pleased to be able to announce the Joint Declaration on support for Ukraine. today.
It's your sort of protocol database at the g7 Hiroshima summit by engaging in discussions that included a wide range of invited countries. We agreed that unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion are unacceptable anywhere in the world. And to safeguard a free and open international border based on the rule of law.
I feel that it is a truly meaningful that we the g7 leaders and Vladimir have gathered once again today.
Going forward this declaration it will be open to any country that shares the intention that to support Ukraine. I hope many countries will choose to join. G7 will continue to stand by Ukraine. Our solidarity will never waver.



July 12, 202317:37 EEST

Foreign pool report #3 - Zelensky's quotes
Zelenskyy started by thanking POTUS for his support.
"It is really a difficult job for our people, soldiers, civilians, moderacji, fathers and children really to apply hope the and I reminds them all these days, you are with us. I mean, you and and Americans, all of America, Americans and Congress".
Zelenskyy defended Biden's decision to supply cluster munitions:
"it's very simple, you know, to criticize, for example, cluster munitions, and you made a difficult political decision. but you have to know that Russia used such weapons from the first day. (…) I didn't hear from all parts of the world , when Russia began to use it, I didn't a hear the same kind of criticism"
On U.S. support:
"You gave us huge support. I want to thank all Americans, we understand that it's more than 43 Billions as of today. It's big support, and I understand that it's all your money, but you have to know that you spend this money for not not just fighting. We spend this money for our lives.
After Zelenskyy finished talking a reporter shouted the following question: " Are you satisfied with what you got from NATO. You were so frustrated yesterday?"
Zelenskyy engaged but it was really hard to hear what he said over staff asking us to leave. Listening to my recording your pooler could hear only:
"We have a great unity……success of the summit. I think so but it's my opinion. Thank you".



July 12, 202318:29 EEST

For Zelenskyy's answer to a question I'd rather direct you to travel report #9. Meryl Kornfield did much better work than I.
Zelenskyy's quote:
"It's really a difficult job for our people: soldiers, civilians, moderns, fathers and children to apply hope in the lives. And thank you very much that all these days you are with us, I mean, you and and Americans, all Americans and Congress. Thank you, Mr. President that you are with us shoulder to shoulder fro first days of full scale war. We appreciate this very much.
And really, really, you now, we understand you're leading support, because when you give some weapons I'm sorry that… but I want to say John what I said during the meeting of our Council that it's very simple, you know, to criticize, for example, cluster munitions on which you made decision, difficult political decision, but but you have to know that Russia used such weapons from the first days on a full scale, from the first days of occupation of Crimea, from 2014 and 2015. In all our territories, in Donbas they used it and
they continue doing it. Your decision will help us to save us and that's why my appreciation for that. And I didn't hear from all the you know, parts of the world when when Russia began to use it, I didn't hear the same countries criticized Russia. I think that it was very useful to (inaudiable) them.
Thank you so much for the help. We really counted on that and we still do today. You gave us huge support. I want to thank all Americans, we understand that it's more than 43 Billions as of today. It's big support, and I understand that it's all your money, but you have to know that you spend this money for not not just fighting. We spend this money for our lives. And the I think that we saved lives for Europe for all the world.
So thank you very much also for this summit. At the end of the summit we had I think this Council, which is great success and security guarantees, as you said it and we began to speak about it in Kyiv. So now we see that you had great idea that g7, that also Euro countries, which are the great decisions. And I think it will help very much because it has a real effect, that has very concrete things. So thank you.
