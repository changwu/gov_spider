    I commend Congress, particularly Senators Bond and Mikulski and Representatives Boehner and Hoekstra, for working with my administration and taking swift action to pass the ''Strengthen AmeriCorps Program Act.'' The bill establishes accounting guidelines for the Corporation for National and Community Service that will help put AmeriCorps on a sound financial footing. It is also the essential first step toward maximizing enrollment this year to benefit the nonprofit organizations that count on AmeriCorps members to offer help and hope to people in communities across the country.
I hope Congress will continue to show strong support for my effort to help every American answer the call to volunteer service and act quickly to strengthen and expand national service by passing the ''Citizen Service Act.''
