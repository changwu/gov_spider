    I am pleased to sign into law today H.R. 4347, a bill reauthorizing construction of the WEB rural water-supply pipeline in South Dakota, providing for study of further water resource developments in South Dakota, and authorizing the use of power generated through the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program for irrigation-pumping for certain Indian lands.
One of the strengths of our American system of government is its ability to reconsider in an orderly manner well-established plans that later fail to meet changed conditions. In signing H.R. 4347, I am pleased that this strength enables me to help correct the course of our water resources development in South Dakota, so that real problems faced by real people can be met by real solutions.
I commend Governor William Janklow, Senator James Abdnor, Senator Larry Pressler, Congressman Clint Roberts of South Dakota, and other leaders in that State for their patient and thorough work in seeing the WEB Rural Water Development Act through to this milestone. I am pleased to add my official approval to this legislative effort, one that attests to the determination of the people of South Dakota and their elected Representatives and also, I believe, to the willingness of this administration to cooperate with the States in finding practical solutions to problems that have too long been ignored.
