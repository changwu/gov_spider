    The President called Prime Minister Abbott last night regarding the Sydney hostage tragedy. The President expressed condolences on behalf of the American people to the families that lost loved ones, and his wishes for a speedy recovery to those who were injured. He conveyed admiration for the strength, resilience, and compassion of the Australian people and his confidence that they will emerge from this tragedy stronger. Noting the Australian public's embrace of #Illridewithyou and the Muslim leaders who have disavowed the actions of the hostage taker, the President also praised Australia's rejection of any violence taken in the name of religion and the fear this violence seeks to stoke. Finally, as close and strong allies, the President reiterated that the United States stands ready to provide assistance as Australia moves forward in the aftermath of the hostage situation.
