  A Proclamation

Bicycling is finally breaking away in this country, making racers and riders out of a hundred million Americans.
Whether they are huffing up mountain roads on vacation or commuting a few miles to work every day, bicycle riders are using their energy to save our energy, while their pumping legs mean pumping hearts and better health. One of the most energy-efficient forms of transportation known to man, bicycle tiding is bound to become even more popular in the energy conscious, health-conscious future.
The Congress, by joint resolution (H.J. Res. 414), has authorized and requested the President to designate the first day of May, 1980, as National Bicycling Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, do hereby declare May 1, 1980, National Bicycling Day.
I call upon the people of the United States and interested groups and organizations to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and events.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.

JIMMY CARTER
