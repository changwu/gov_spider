    Two weeks ago, President Reagan expressed his sincere hope that President Brezhnev would join him this June in addressing the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament. President Reagan also said that he would look forward to a meeting with President Brezhnev in that context.
We have seen today's TASS report of President Brezhnev's statement to Pravda suggesting a summit meeting this fall. We will, of course, study President Brezhnev's remarks carefully.
In the meantime, President Reagan remains hopeful that President Brezhnev will come to the United Nations this June and meet with him then.
