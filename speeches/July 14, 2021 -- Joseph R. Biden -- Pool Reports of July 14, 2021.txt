In-Town Pool 1 - Checking in 
Howdy. It's a balmy 90 degree afternoon with little cloud cover and ample humidity at the White House today. It's brutal out here. Pool is gathering before our sojourn to Capitol Hill.
The heat didn't stop teen pop star Olivia Rodrigo from arriving in a pink, black and white Clueless-esque gingham co-ord mini-skirt suit set and towering white platform shoes around 11:30 a.m.—unfortunately, I wasn't able to see her arriving, but I caught some footage via the always talented pool photographers and C-SPAN feed. Feeling some jealousy, jealousy over here.
I haven't gotten a sense of when her meeting with Fauci and the President will happen, but I assure you I will let you know as soon as I can. As a reminder, POTUS + Fauci will film vaccination PSAs to be released on Rodrigo's and the White Houses' social channels.
Besides being a Gen-Z influencer for a day, here's what else is on the President's public schedule: In the afternoon, the President will attend a lunch with the Senate Democratic Caucus at the United States Capitol. This lunch will be closed press.

*Note that this lunch is happening at the same time as the press briefing, so I'll be unable to advise on 2-minute warnings, etc. As always, the briefing will be steamed on all White House social channels, CSPAN, etc.*

In town pool report 2 - rolling to capitol 
Pool began rolling to the Capitol at 1:03 PM. Pool briefly caught a glimpse of POTUS - he's wearing a dark suit.
Surprise, we're running a touch behind schedule. I'll be in touch once we're up on the Hill. Chao.

In town pool report 3 - Capitol arrival 
Pool arrived at the Capitol at 1:09 pm we hit no red lights, stop signs on our uneventful ride over. A few supporters waved at the motorcade as we wizzed past.
Biden approached a gaggle of reporters, including your pool, outside the lunch room in the Capitol and jokingly mused "is this my homecoming?" When asked by a reporter if he could keep Democrats on board in regards to budget reconciliation. Biden replied "we're going to get this done." He did not answer any other yelled question. Biden was walking aside Chuck Schumer.
Biden entered the lunch room at 1:12 pm. Pool is holding at a crowded gaggle.

In town pool 4 - Capitol departure 
Biden exited the Mansfield Room (S207) at 2:00
Biden approached the pool, and while he took no questions, he told the pool that it's "great to be home, great to be back with all my colleagues, and I think we're going to get a lot done."
We're rolling back home.

In Town Pool Report 7 - mayors and governors meeting 
Pool entered the Roosevelt Room at 3:50 pm. Below are some highlights from his brief remarks. He spoke for about three minutes. No news really.
As always, please check against the playback and the audio. I'll attach an audio file, but be aware there's a little bit of cross talk. Biden was quite soft spoken.
"We have a chance to solve these problems, a bipartisan chance to solve these problems. Create millions of jobs—literally."
"Were going to get something done and that's why I think my Build Back agenda is all about."
"Mayors and governors, [crosstalk] we're going to get this done. And what we're going to do is, time to stop talking about it and time to get you the resources. What I want to talk about today is what you need most..."
He took two shouted questions. First, are the pay-fors intact?
"I think we're in good shape. There may be some slight adjustments in the pay fors...We have an agreement, we have an agreement, there might be some slight changes. I am not sure what may happen."
When asked if the two track strategy may jeopardize the future of either bill, Biden said "No, I think it is the only way to get it done...with two tracks."

In Town Pool Report 9 - Psaki statement on Miller meeting 
Passing along a statement from Jen Psaki via the WH:
The President will meet with General Miller today to thank the General for his extraordinary service in Afghanistan. As the final commander of the Resolute Support Mission, General Miller oversaw the vast majority of our drawdown from Afghanistan, which is a particularly vulnerable period for our troops. That this drawdown has been conducted in such an orderly and safe way is a testament to General Miller's leadership, and the President looks forward to personally thanking him later today.
