    OF THE MANY humanitarian programs conducted by the United States ,through the Agency for International Development, none is more important-or more expressive of our national concern with peaceful progress in the developing world--than the work to eliminate the scourge of disease.
The challenge is measured in cruel statistics. Smallpox epidemics in Africa have killed one in four stricken by the disease. Measles kills about 10 percent of the African children it infects. Gastrointestinal diseases have taken a fearful toll. Even for those who survive, these diseases often leave behind continuing miser), in disfigurement, crippling arthritis, blindness, and increased susceptibility to other illnesses. There is also the tragedy visited upon the families of the victims.
Beyond the suffering of the individual, there is a loss to the larger community. For disease ravages the energy of body and mind which is the engine of national development.
But the progress you mark today in Niger is dramatic proof that man can be free of these age-old bonds.
This one hundred millionth vaccination against smallpox is not only an impressive measure of technical assistance. It is one hundred million opportunities to be productive citizens of the new Africa.
And like most great strides in development, it was made possible by people working together--20 nations of West and Central Africa, the World Health Organization, regional groups, and AID--all doing their share in a common cause.
My warmest congratulations to all those who have helped reach this milestone.
