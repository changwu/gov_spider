HB 216 Domestic Violence Victim Substitute Address (Sponsored by Nathan P. Cote)
This law will allow victims of domestic violence or a representative to create a substitute address for them if there is a good reason to believe the victim's safety is at risk. The address will remain confidential and guarded from data bases to ensure further safety of victims. These addresses can be used by the victim when interacting with any public agency, like school districts or the Motor Vehicle Department. This helps ensure that an abuser is unable to track a victim through these agencies.
