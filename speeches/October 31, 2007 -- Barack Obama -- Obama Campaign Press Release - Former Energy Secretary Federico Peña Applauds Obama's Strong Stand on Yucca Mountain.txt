    Las Vegas, NV -- Former Energy Secretary and Obama Campaign National Co-Chair Federico Pe√±a applauded Barack Obama's consistent opposition to Yucca Mountain and his strong stand in speaking out on the issue during a conference call with reporters this afternoon.
"Barack Obama has been a long-time and unwavering opponent of the Yucca Mountain project. Billions of dollars have been spent on Yucca, but we are no closer to ensuring nuclear waste won't pollute aquifers and jeopardize the health and safety of Nevadans. It's time to focus our resources on alternatives that offer safe solutions on how we deal with the nation's spent nuclear fuel."
"Barack understands the challenges of nuclear power. Illinois has 11 nuclear reactors, more than any other state in the country. He has the leadership to develop and create consensus around a national energy policy that deals with nuclear waste based on sound science. He has a plan to help this country achieve energy independence and combat global warming through nuclear and renewable energies, like geothermal, wind and solar power."
Senator Barack Obama submitted a letter this morning to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Environment and Public Works Committee Chair Barbara Boxer at the Senate Committee Hearing on Yucca Mountain, calling on committee leaders to officially abandon the project.
