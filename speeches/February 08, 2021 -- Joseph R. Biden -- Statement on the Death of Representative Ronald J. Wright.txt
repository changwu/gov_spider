    Jill and I were saddened to learn of the passing of Congressman Ron Wright. A sixth-generation son of Tarrant County, Ron served the people of Arlington as a city councilor, as mayor pro tempore, as a county tax assessor-collector, as a long-time congressional staffer, and as a Member of Congress representing the Sixth District.
He was also a fighter who battled bravely against both cancer and COVIDâ€”19, diseases that our Nation will continue working tirelessly every day to defeat in the memory of all those we have lost. Our prayers are with Ron's wife Susan, their three children, and their nine grandchildren.
