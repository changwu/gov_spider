(House Rules)
(Rep. Black, R-TN, and 176 cosponsors)
(Rep. Franks, R-AZ, and 82 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 3134 and H.R. 3504 because the bills, while different, would have the same consequence of limiting women's health care choices.
H.R. 3134 would defund Planned Parenthood based on its provision of abortion services. Planned Parenthood uses both Federal and non-Federal funds to provide a range of important preventive care and health services, including health screenings, vaccinations, and check-ups to millions of men and women who visit their health centers annually. Longstanding Federal policy already prohibits the use of Federal funds for abortions, except in cases of rape or incest or when the life of the woman would be endangered. By eliminating Federal funding for a major provider of health care, H.R. 3134 would limit access to health care for men, women, and families across the Nation, and would disproportionately impact low-income individuals.
H.R. 3504 would impose new legal requirements related to the provision of abortion services in certain circumstances, which would likely have a chilling effect, reducing access to care.
If the President were presented with H.R. 3134 or H.R. 3504, he would veto them.
