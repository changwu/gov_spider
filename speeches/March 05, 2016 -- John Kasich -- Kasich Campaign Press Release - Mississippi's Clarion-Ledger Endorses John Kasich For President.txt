Only John Kasich has consistently conducted himself as a serious leader with serious ideas. He does not see the world in absolutes, approaching issues with the wisdom that belies his experiences as a U.S. congressman, state senator, private-sector businessman and current governor of Ohio. His vast knowledge of economic and foreign policies would be an invaluable asset as the next president of the United States with our nation facing an uncertain economic future and volatile world powers that are evolving quickly in the Middle East and Asia.
[...]
We truly believe Kasich to be a genuine man, principled and pragmatic. He has a track record of not only conservative political stances but actual conservative governing.
We wholeheartedly endorse John Kasich for the Republican presidential nomination.
