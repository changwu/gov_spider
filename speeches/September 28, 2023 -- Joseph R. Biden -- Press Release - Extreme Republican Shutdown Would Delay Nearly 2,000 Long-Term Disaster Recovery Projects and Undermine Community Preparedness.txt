    With just days left before the end of the fiscal year, extreme House Republicans are playing partisan games with peoples' lives and marching our country toward a government shutdown that would have damaging impacts across the country—including delaying long-term disaster recovery and undermining preparedness in communities across the country. Their partisan approach stands in stark contrast to the Senate's bipartisan progress towards keeping the government open and making a down payment on disaster relief funding.
As the Administration has continued to call on Congress to provide disaster relief funding, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) continues to dwindle and is now forced to prioritize only immediate lifesaving and life sustaining operations. An Extreme Republican Shutdown would leave the DRF underfunded—delaying nearly 2,000 long-term recovery projects in communities across the country. For example, Wilson County School in Tennessee would continue being unable to push forward with rebuilding due to a deadly tornado that left 100 teachers and 1,000 students without classrooms. In New Jersey, millions of dollars meant to help rebuild a senior citizen building following Hurricane Ida would remain frozen. And in Florida, hundreds of millions of dollars of Hurricane Ian recovery obligations would continue to be delayed. An Extreme Republican Shutdown would also undermine communities' preparedness by preventing fire departments from accessing funding necessary to retain firefighters and purchase equipment, halting first responder training, and jeopardizing access to grants for disaster and terrorism preparedness.
The reason these disaster recovery and preparedness priorities are now at risk: extreme House Republicans' relentless efforts to slash funding for vital programs rather than work in a bipartisan manner to keep the government open and address emergency needs for the American people. House Republicans have turned their backs on the bipartisan budget deal that two-thirds of them voted for just a few months ago and instead proposed a continuing resolution (CR) that proposes devastating cuts to programs that millions of hardworking Americans count on—including to FEMA. Their extreme CR also fails to provide the urgent funding President Biden requested for FEMA's DRF.
Below is a breakdown of the nearly 2,000 recovery projects across all 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico that would be further delayed during an Extreme Republican Shutdown:
