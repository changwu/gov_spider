    Thank you all for coming. Welcome to the South Lawn. Laura and I are thrilled you're here. This is called "Rodeo on the South Lawn." [Laughter] And we've—first of all, I want to thank all the Members of the Congress and the Senate who are here. Thanks for serving the country.
I always take this opportunity to thank your families on your behalf. I know you do it all the time, but I know you couldn't serve without the support of your loved ones. And so, for all the family members who are here, the wives and the husbands and the children and the grandchildren, welcome. Thanks for serving the country too.
We got some interesting entertainment for you tonight. We got some people who can play music and some people who think they can play music. [Laughter] We got three bands, one—the first band will be called The Compassionates. The leader of that band is my Chief of Staff, Josh Bolten.Yes. Then we've got—The Second Amendments will be playing tonight. That would be Congressman Collin Peterson, Dave Weldon, Kenny Hulshof, Thaddeus McCotter—he's that rock-and-roll dude, Thaddeus McCotter—and Congressman Jon Porter. Once you get through those two bands, then a real group of musicians will be here, and we're fortunate Riders in the Sky will be playing for you tonight.
I hope you enjoy this as much as Laura and I enjoy it. We're really glad you're here. God bless you all, and God bless our great country. Please welcome The Compassionates.
