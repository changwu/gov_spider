    Memorandum for the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Energy, and the Director of National Intelligence
Subject: Aviation Screening Technology and Procedures Review
On December 27, 2009, I directed that an immediate review of aviation screening technology be initiated. This review should be led by the Department of Homeland Security, working with other departments and agencies including the Department of Energy and the National Laboratories. All aspects of aviation screening technology and procedures regarding domestic and international air travel should be considered as part of this review. This review shall be conducted in a manner that does not interfere with the ongoing criminal investigation and prosecution of any individuals involved in the attempt to detonate an explosive device onboard Northwest flight 253 on December 25, 2009.
A preliminary report, including recommendations for strengthening aviation screening technology and procedures and outlining how the Department of Homeland Security plans to proceed, shall be provided to the White House Staff Secretary by December 31, 2009. Follow-up direction will be provided, as appropriate, based on the contents of the December 31, 2009, report.
