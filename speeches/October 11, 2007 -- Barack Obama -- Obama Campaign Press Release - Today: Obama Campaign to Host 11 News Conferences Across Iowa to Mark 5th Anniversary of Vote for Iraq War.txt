    Des Moines, IA -- The Obama Campaign announced 11 press conferences happening TODAY across Iowa to mark the anniversary of Congress' vote to authorize the invasion of Iraq. Five years ago this week, members of Congress authorized and enabled the war in Iraq by voting to give George Bush a blank check to wage war. This vote came less than two weeks after Barack Obama spoke to 3,000 Americans in downtown Chicago and laid out his clear opposition to invading Iraq.
"This war was planned by Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, two men with some of the longest resumes in Washington. Five years ago today, many other politicians in Congress relying on their Washington experience followed the conventional political thinking and voted in favor of this ill-advised, ill-conceived war," veteran Bob Sprengeler of Cedar Rapids said. "Drawing on his own experience and judgment, Barack Obama stood up and said 'Ëœno' to the war before the vote in Congress and before it was popular to do so. He demonstrated that he's got the right experience and right judgment to be our next Commander in Chief."
Iowans and veterans across the state will also unveil a post-card writing campaign to call on Senator Grassley to join Senator Obama's bipartisan coalition to end the war in Iraq. On Saturday October 13, thousands of Obama supporters will go door-to-door to share Senator Obama's vision to turn the page in Iraq during a nationwide "Canvass for Change." Participants will distribute post-cards urging Grassley to join Obama's bipartisan coalition and will talk with Iowans about Obama's movement to change the way Washington works and to end the failed policies in Iraq.
