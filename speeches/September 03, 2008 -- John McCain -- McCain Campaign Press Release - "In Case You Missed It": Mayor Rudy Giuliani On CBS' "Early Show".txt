She has a record of reform. She has a record of leadership. She's run a budget." -- Mayor Rudy Giuliani

Mayor Rudy Giuliani: "Barack Obama has never governed a city, never governed a state, never governed an agency, never run a military unit, never run anything. Sarah Palin has been a mayor. She's been a governor. She has a record of reform. She has a record of leadership. She's run a budget. So, why are all these questions for her? Has anybody ever asked Barack Obama, can you bring up your two kids and be president of the United States? They are asking 'can she be vice president and be a mother?' Come on." 
CBS' Maggie Rodriguez: "So you're saying you have no doubt and mothers shouldn't either, that she can do it? 
Mayor Giuliani: "Where are the feminists? I mean is it just the early feminist groups? Where are they?" 
Rodriguez: "I think they are fair questions. It's a lot to judge." 
Mayor Giuliani: "They are questions. I don't know if they're fair questions. You can ask any question you want, then to designate it as a fair question. You know, can you be a mother and be a vice president? We've had a lot of fathers run for president and no one has ever asked them, 'can you be a father and be president?' Don't tell me there isn't a difference there."
