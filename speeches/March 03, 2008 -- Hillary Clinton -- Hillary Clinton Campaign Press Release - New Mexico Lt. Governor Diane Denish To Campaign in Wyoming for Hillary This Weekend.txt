    Denish to Attend Nellie Tayloe Ross Dinner, Democratic Party Mockus
The Clinton campaign today announced New Mexico Lt. Governor and New Mexico Campaign Chair Diane Denish will campaign in Wyoming this Saturday and Sunday, March 1 and 2.
Denish will attend Wyoming's Nellie Tayloe Ross dinner in Cheyenne on Saturday, March 1, on behalf of the campaign, sharing with attendees Hillary Clinton's record of delivering solutions on the problems facing America's working families.
On Sunday, March 2, Denish will attend the Wyoming Democratic Party's Mockus in Cheyenne to help educate Wyoming voters on the caucus process, drawing from the campaign's successful efforts in the February 5 New Mexico Caucus.
"I am so excited to be on the trail for Hillary Clinton this weekend in Wyoming," said Denish. "Hillary Clinton is the candidate I want as our Commander in Chief - and she is the only one with the strength, experience, and record to begin tackling the serious issues that face our country from day one in office."
Denish was elected Lieutenant Governor in 2002, becoming the first woman to ever hold that office in New Mexico.
Lt. Governor Denish was reelected on November 7, 2006. As Lt. Governor, Denish has fought to improve education, increase access to health care, crack down on criminals who endanger children and create greater economic opportunities for New Mexicans.
