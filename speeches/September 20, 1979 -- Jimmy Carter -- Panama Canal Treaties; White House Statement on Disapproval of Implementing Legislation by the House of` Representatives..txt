    The President deeply regrets that the House of Representatives did not adopt the legislation proposed by the House-Senate conference to provide for the operation of the Panama Canal under the treaties that enter into force on October 1. We understand that the new conference will meet again soon, possibly as early as tomorrow.
The administration will make every effort to obtain the necessary legislation. The United States must have legislative authority by October 1 to exercise our rights to operate the canal. It is inconceivable that the Congress would allow the Panama Canal to be closed even for a short time.
The President is confident that the Government of Panama will respond to this development with the dignity and restraint which has characterized it during the long deliberations on the canal treaties and the implementing legislation in the Congress.
