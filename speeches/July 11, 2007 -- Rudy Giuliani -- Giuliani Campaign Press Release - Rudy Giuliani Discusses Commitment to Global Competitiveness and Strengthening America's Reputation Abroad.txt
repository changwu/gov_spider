    In a speech in Novi, Michigan today, Mayor Rudy Giuliani will continue to lay out his 12 Commitments to the American People by discussing his commitment to expanding America's involvement in the global economy and strengthening our nation's reputation around the world.
To make the United States more globally competitive, the Mayor will empower America's 21st Century workforce, bring more countries and people into the global marketplace, and aggressively advance free trade and new markets for American-made products worldwide.
The Mayor will also propose refocusing the State Department and reforming the Foreign Service to help strengthen America's reputation abroad by combating anti-Americanism and expanding our country's economic and cultural exchanges with the Arab and Muslim world, while promoting freedom internationally.
"This is a moment of rare opportunity for new American leadership," Giuliani has said. "To succeed in the 21st Century, America must expand our historic commitment to free people, free governments, and free markets. That means expanding our involvement in the global economy and strengthening our reputation around the world."
Expanding America's involvement in the global economy and strengthening our nation's reputation around the world is one of Rudy's Twelve Commitments to the American People, his bold vision aimed at moving America forward. He will continue to travel the country this summer to detail each of his Twelve Commitments. For more about the Twelve Commitments, please click here.
