President Obama has consistently tried to undermine our Second Amendment rights — in fact, he seems obsessed with it.

Neil Cavuto: You said that President Obama wants to take people's guns away, yet under his Presidency have more than doubled. That doesn't sound like a White House unfriendly to gun owners.
Marco: That sounds like people are afraid the President is going to take their guns away. Look, the Second Amendment is not an option, it's not a suggestion, it's a Constitutional right.

Strong answer on guns from Rubio. And good follow-up answer too.

Marco Rubio will stand up for our Second Amendment individual rights, period.
