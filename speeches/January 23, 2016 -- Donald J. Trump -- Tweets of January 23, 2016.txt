Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. Jeb --- mom can't help you with ISIS, the Chinese or with Putin.Retweets: 5009Favorites: 10636

.@BrentBozell, one of the National Review lightweights, came to my office begging for money like a dog. Why doesn't he say that?Retweets: 2008Favorites: 4711

The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!Retweets: 1982Favorites: 5745

Cruz says I supported TARP, which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs, the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!Retweets: 2022Favorites: 5803

Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.Retweets: 2272Favorites: 5874

Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. & is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi, low interest loans. No legal disclosure & never sold off assets.Retweets: 2062Favorites: 5320

Ted Cruz poll numbers are down big. Because he was born in Canada and was, until recently, a Canadian citizen, many believe he cannot run!Retweets: 1837Favorites: 5328
