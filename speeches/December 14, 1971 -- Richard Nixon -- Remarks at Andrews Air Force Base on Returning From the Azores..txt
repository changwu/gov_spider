    Ladies and gentlemen:
As you know, we have just returned from an historic meeting in the Azores with President Pompidou. President Pompidou and I agreed, at the conclusion of our meeting, that our joint statement that has been issued to the press and some brief oral statements that we made would be the only statements we would make at this time. However, Secretary Cormally, on the international economic front, and Secretary Rogers, on the international issues other than economic, will give you a brief fill-in of the other matters that were covered. I will say nothing more because of our understanding with the President that we would both at this point stand on what we have already said.
