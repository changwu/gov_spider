"The reason we came is the chef's not bad," he joked.
He praised the sacrifice of those serving in the military, calling them the "greatest fighting force in the history of the world." He also thanked their spouses, saying they put up with "an awful lot." He also thanked Gov. Roy Cooper, who is in attendance.
The president said he'll be serving mashed potatoes in the buffet line. Pool is holding toward the back of the room as the president and First Lady assist with one of the buffet lines on the other side of the room. The smell of turkey and other thanksgiving fare is filling the air of this enclosed space as guests are dismissed by table to get food.

After about 40 minutes at a serving station, the Bidens began going table to table to meet and greet the service members and military families in attendance. Pool remained in our holding area throughout that time (photographers were allowed to follow the president). The First Lady came to a table right near the pool for a few minutes at one point, though the conversation was inaudible as there was music playing in the background.
The president mingled at tables a bit further away from the pool as the two took a divide and conquer approach to cover the whole room.
Also, for those wondering, Robert Irvine is the chef who hosted tonight's meal.
