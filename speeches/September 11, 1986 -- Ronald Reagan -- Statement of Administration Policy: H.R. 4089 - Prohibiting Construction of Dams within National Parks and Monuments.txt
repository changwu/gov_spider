    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Lehman (D) California)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4089 as unnecessary because:
— existing law already adequately protects units of the National Park System from any adverse effects of water development projects;
— existing impoundments under Federal license already require Federal permits; and
— construction of any new impoundments within national parks and monuments already require an act of Congress.
