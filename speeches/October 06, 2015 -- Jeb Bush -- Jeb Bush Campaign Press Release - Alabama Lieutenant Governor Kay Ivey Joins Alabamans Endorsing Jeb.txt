    Alabamans know firsthand the conservative leadership Governor Jeb Bush provided in their neighboring state of Florida. Alabama Lieutenant Governor Kay Ivey just announced she'll serve as a delegate for Jeb and filed papers with the state party to secure his place on the ballot for Alabama's presidential preference primary.
Jeb is the first candidate to get on the ballot in Alabama, which is one of six states that make up the March "SEC primary."
"Jeb Bush was a strong governor who provided conservative leadership in Florida. He has a positive vision for the future of America and is a leader who will restore us to greatness by increasing economic growth through his plans to reduce regulations and reform the tax code. He is the only candidate capable of providing leadership on an international level to handle the many crises the current administration has fumbled. I'm proud to run as a delegate for Jeb Bush and submit his qualifying papers," said Alabama Lieutenant Governor Kay Ivey.
Ivey's support signals the growing grassroots support Jeb has on the ground in states far beyond the early February caucuses and primaries. His endorsements from key state and local leaders across the country are simply unmatched in the field.
Lt. Governor Kay Ivey joins other Alabamans supporting Jeb:
Former Governor Bob Riley
Congressman Mike Rogers
Mary Scott Hunter, Board of Education Representative
State Senator J.T. Waggoner
