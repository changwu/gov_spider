    Today we celebrate our Army's 242nd birthday. Soldiers of character, the sons and daughters from across our proud nation, serve as the cornerstone of our Army. As the world's premier land force, they stand ready to defend this great Nation. The Army colors have 189 campaign streamers marking battles from the Revolutionary War to today's campaign against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Nearly 185,000 soldiers are currently deployed in 140 different countries helping to protect our great nation, our allies, and our interests. We cannot overstate how important our Army is to preserving our freedom and way of life. Our nation is eternally grateful.
