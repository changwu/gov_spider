We're going to hear a lot of things in Charlotte, but we're not going to hear a convincing argument that we're better off than we were four years ago We're going to hear from President Clinton tonight in Charlotte. My guess is we'll get a great rendition of how good things were in the 1990s, but we're not going to hear much about how things have been in the last four years." -Paul Ryan

PAUL RYAN: "We're not on the right path. We're going to hear a lot of things in Charlotte, but we're not going to hear a convincing argument that we're better off than we were four years ago. We're going to hear from President Clinton tonight in Charlotte. My guess is we'll get a great rendition of how good things were in the 1990s, but we're not going to hear much about how things have been in the last four years. And by the way, under President Clinton, we got welfare reform. Chuck Grassley—everybody else in Congress—we got welfare reform which moved people from welfare to work to get people out of poverty. President Obama's rolling back welfare reform."
