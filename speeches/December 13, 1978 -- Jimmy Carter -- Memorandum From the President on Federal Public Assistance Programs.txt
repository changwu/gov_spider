    Memorandum for the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Director, Office of Management and Budget, the Director, Community Services Administration
I am directing today that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare initiate a major interdepartmental review of the Federal policies and procedures for determining applicant eligibility for Federal public assistance programs, including AFDC, SSI, Food Stamps, Medicaid, employment and training, social services, and housing assistance.
A substantial part of the costs of administering these programs is directly tied to eligibility determination. Those procedures, because of complexity and duplication, add to the waste, high error rates, and fraud which hurt every taxpayer, and most importantly, penalize and frustrate those who have legitimate needs.
I hope that this review will produce recommendations which will lead to more consistent and less burdensome government-wide practices to make the eligibility determination process simple, understandable and efficient. Such improvements could also lead to better quality services for those who are eligible to receive them.
All citizens are concerned about making a bold attack on inefficient and wasteful government. Equally important to me, is our ability to assist our needy citizens in a more responsive and compassionate manner. I know that I can count on your support in meeting both these objectives.
