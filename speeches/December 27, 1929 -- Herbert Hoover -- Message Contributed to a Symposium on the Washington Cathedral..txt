IN THE COURSE of time I hope that Washington may become architecturally an inspiration to the nation. This hope will be achieved when there is beautiful architectural expression of the fundamental aspects of our democracy. Certainly one of these aspects, because it is the deepest spring of our national life, is religion. Therefore, as a wonderfully beautiful expression of religion, I watch with sympathetic interest the growth of the great Cathedral on the heights overlooking Washington.
