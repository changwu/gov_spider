They discussed their concerns about Russia's continued build-up of military forces around Ukraine, as well as preparations to impose massive consequences and severe economic costs on Russia should it choose military escalation. They coordinated the details of a potential transatlantic response, including both financial sanctions and export controls, imposed in coordination by the United States, the European Union, and other partners and Allies. They also agreed to continue the close partnership between the United States and the European Union on a wide range of issues including energy security, COVID-19, health security, and partnership on international infrastructure development through the Build Back Better World and Global Gateway initiatives.
