    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am forwarding for the consideration of the Congress a draft bill that would designate a "Nancy Hanks Center" in Washington, D.C.
Nancy Hanks served with great distinction as Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts from 1969 to 1977. She provided wise leadership in defining a proper role for the Federal Government in the cultural life of the Nation and safeguarding the creative integrity of artists and arts institutions against Government interference.
The proposed Nancy Hanks Center would include the Old Post Office Building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the plaza adjoining the building and the public use spaces within the Old Post Office including the Pavilion and the clock-observation tower. This designation is particularly apt since the renovation of the Old Post Office, its occupancy this year by Federal cultural agencies and commercial enterprises and its exhibits are due in large measure to the foresightedness, persuasiveness, intellect, and vigor of Nancy Hanks. I believe that enactment of this legislation would serve the national interest by honoring one of its superb public servants in a permanent and meaningful way.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
