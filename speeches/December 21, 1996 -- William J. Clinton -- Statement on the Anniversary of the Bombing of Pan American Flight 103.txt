    On this day 8 years ago, Pan American Flight 103 was savagely torn from the skies over Lockerbie, Scotland. We have not forgotten the 270 victims who perished in that cowardly act of terrorism. And we have not forgotten their families. On behalf of the American people, we remember your loss today. We draw strength from your dignity and your courage. You are not alone in your determination to see that the perpetrators of this evil deed are brought to justice. Your country stands with you and shares your continuing grief.
The sponsors of terrorism hope that with the passing of time the world will forget their crimes. We will not forget. Time has not diminished our outrage, and it never will. We are determined to see that those who committed these murders are brought to justice. That is why we continue to demand the extradition of the two Libyans who have been indicted for this vicious offense to stand trial in the U.S. or U.K. It is also why we have pushed for and secured tough international sanctions against Libya that we strengthened further with legislation in 1996. We will not rest until this case is closed and justice is done.
