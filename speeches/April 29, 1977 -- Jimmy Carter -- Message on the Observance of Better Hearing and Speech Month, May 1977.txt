    This traditional observance provides a fine opportunity for all Americans to reflect on the needs of our twenty-two million fellow citizens affected by hearing and speech disorders.
All of us can be encouraged by the steady increase in the numbers of men, women and children who are overcoming such handicaps. We can also find comfort in the continuing efforts of all the organizations and individuals responsible for guiding and developing programs to assist those with hearing, speech or language impediments. By promoting community activities relating to improved health, rehabilitation and social care, you are performing a vital public service.
I urge more Americans to volunteer their time and energy to this worthwhile cause.
