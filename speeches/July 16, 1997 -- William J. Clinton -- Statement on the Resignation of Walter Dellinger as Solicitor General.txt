    With deep regret, I accept the resignation of Walter Dellinger as Solicitor General. Walter Dellinger has been an outstanding advocate for the American people. He has fought tirelessly and courageously for the rights of all Americans. He has represented this country in some of the most important cases ever decided by the United States Supreme Court, and in each case, worked hard to assure that the Court understood the national interest and not just the particular interests of the selected few. Walter is one of Nation's most brilliant constitutional scholars, and I know his students are delighted that he will return to teaching. But we will miss his talent, his leadership, his energy, and his sense of justice.
