    Veterans Affairs Secretary-designate Denis McDonough today joined veterans from The Mission Continues as they partnered with District of Columbia Public Schools' The Excel Academy for a day of community service in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. to refurbish and revitalize the school's grounds. The Mission Continues is a nonprofit organization that empowers military veterans to continue their service and empowers communities with veteran talent, skills, and preparedness to generate visible impact. The veterans and Secretary-designate worked to update the school's garden and build safe outdoor learning spaces for students, among other activities, to provide a sense of normalcy and inspiration at the all-girls K-8 school located in Washington, D.C.'s Anacostia neighborhood.
