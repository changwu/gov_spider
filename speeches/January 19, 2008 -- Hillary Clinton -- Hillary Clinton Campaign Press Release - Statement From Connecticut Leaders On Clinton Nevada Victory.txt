    Hartford - After a day of statewide phone banks and the endorsement of AFT Connecticut, enthusiastic Hillary Clinton supporters across the state issued the following response to Hillary's win in Nevada. "The people of Nevada responded to Hillary's focus on the challenges they face in their daily lives," said Stamford Mayor Dan Malloy. "The people of Connecticut share the same concerns of rising energy and gas prices, a declining economy, and the lack of quality affordable health care. On February 5th, they will have their say in the Presidential selection process and I'm confident they'll pick the candidate ready to lead on Day One, Hillary Clinton." "This is another great win for Hillary," said Connecticut for Hillary Co-Chair Susan Cocco. "Her focus on delivering real change and real results for the American people lead her to victory in Nevada. Hillary will continue to listen to people all across the country, including here in Connecticut, and they'll see she is the candidate with the experience to get our country headed back in the right direction." "Hillary's campaign continues to gain momentum here in Connecticut and across the country," said Former Connecticut Democratic Party Chair George Jepsen. "With another win in Nevada and another great day of endorsements and grassroots activities here in Connecticut the campaign is on a roll. We're all excited about today's win , but we also know that there is lots of work to do to win again on February 5th." Today in Connecticut, Hillary received the endorsement of the AFT Connecticut, the state's second largest AFL-CIO Union. The Union represents more than 28,000 professionals, including healthcare, higher education, public employees, paraprofessionals and school related personnel, and teachers.
