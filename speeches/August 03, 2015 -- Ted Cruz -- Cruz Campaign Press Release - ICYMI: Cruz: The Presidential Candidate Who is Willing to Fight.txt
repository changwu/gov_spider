HOUSTON, Texas — Today, Leon Wolf wrote at RedState to encourage Republicans to support U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz's candidacy for President. In particular, Leon wrote:
I like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) 100% a lot as a Senator, but I have never been a huge fan of his candidacy for President – at least until now. Generally speaking, I prefer governors to Senators, and I have an especial wariness for first term Senators...
However, episode three billion in the GOP Failure Theater tour, this time featuring Planned Parenthood failure theater, has pushed me into the camp that makes me want, more than anything, to see a Presidential candidate who is willing to fight and show the cowering squishes who run this party how it is done.
...
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), on the other hand, has shown time and time again a willingness to put himself at risk of personal and professional alienation for the sake of his principles. Whatever you think about Cruz's repeated efforts to repeal Obamacare, his actions with respect to the Planned Parenthood defunding fight have demonstrated, even for those who have been inclined to defend leadership over the years, how well and truly rotten the Senate leadership is.
...
If you are coming increasingly to the belief – as I am – that willingness to fight is the most important qualification for our 2016 nominee, then it's time to take a second hard look at Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), whatever you think about his other qualifications.
