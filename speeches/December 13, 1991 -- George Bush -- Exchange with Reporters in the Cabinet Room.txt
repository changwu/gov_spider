Q. Could you just explain -- I mean, why are you satisfied with assurances that there's no nuclear threat because of the Soviet -- --
The President. We will explain all that in time. I can't do it at a photo opportunity. It's very complicated.
Q. Are you satisfied there's no problem?
The President. I can certify to the American people that the assurances we've been given are very positive. And we are continuing to stay engaged in it. So, please let us have this time. I only have a little bit, limited -- --
