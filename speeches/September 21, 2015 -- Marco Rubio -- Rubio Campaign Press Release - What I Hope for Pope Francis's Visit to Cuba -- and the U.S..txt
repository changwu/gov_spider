We Americans are free to give our opinions and make our voices heard. We work in a free enterprise economy that, for over 200 years, has lifted countless individuals above the circumstances of their birth to achieve their God-given potential. We have been an exceptional country because, here, people are free to practice their faiths and worship God.
And we have enshrined in our founding documents and promoted the fundamental truth, all around the world, that the rights of all men, women and children — not simply Americans — come from God.? . . .
Our brave men and women have made many sacrifices in just wars to defeat the forces of evil. We have exported our greatest values: freedom and opportunity, which have lifted millions out of poverty. At home, these values allow Americans to use their God-given potential and make their dreams reality. For this reason, we are truly blessed, and I am excited for Pope Francis to see this firsthand.
This month, the Pope also visits a country that is close in distance from the United States, but far from free.
In Cuba, His Holiness won't find a government that protects its people and their God-given rights. Instead, he will find a regime that oppresses people and hinders progress, both socially and politically. He will meet with a regime that is solely responsible for the Cuban people's plight over the past 56 years.
