    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(McCain (R) AZ and 3 others)
The Administration supports the goal of assisting Indian tribes to improve environmental quality. The Administration, however, opposes S. 2075 because it would establish an unnecessary new grant program to achieve that goal.
Generally, the activities specified in the bill could be achieved under existing authorities. For example, under the Native American Programs Act of 1974, almost $1 million has been awarded to 20 grantees for the establishment of tribal environmental codes. Further, Indian tribes that qualify for consideration as States are already eligible to receive grants and administer environmental programs under most environmental statutes administered by the Environmental Protection Agency.
