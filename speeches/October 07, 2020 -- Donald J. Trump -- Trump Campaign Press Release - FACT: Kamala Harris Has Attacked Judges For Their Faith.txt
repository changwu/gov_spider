    Democrats are attacking Amy Coney Barrett for her religious beliefs; they're taking a page out of Kamala Harris' playbook.
Even before she was nominated, Democrats, progressives, and members of the media launched anti-Catholic attacks against Judge Barrett, baselessly tarnishing a woman of faith for political purposes


In 2018, Kamala Harris suggested that membership in the Catholic, pro-life organization the Knights of Columbus was disqualifying for a federal judicial nominee.

Harris tried to smear judicial nominee Brian Buescher, effectively treating his membership in the Knights "as if it were allegiance to a hate group." 



The Senate passed a resolution unanimously rebuking the anti-Catholic line of questioning from Harris and her fellow Democrats.
