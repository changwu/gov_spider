    In the latest sign President Biden's economic plan is working, today's Consumer Price Index showed that prices fell 0.1% last month. This is the sixth month in a row that annual inflation has come down.
Additionally, gas prices are down more than $1.70 from their peak, food prices had the smallest increase in almost two years, and the overall cost of goods is falling.
The President's economic plan is providing more breathing room to American workers and families through aggressive action to lower gas prices, strengthen our supply chains, and build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
