    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Hefley (R) CO and eight cosponsors)
The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 260 unless amended to delete provisions in sections 101 and 102 that establish a process for identifying National Park System (NPS) units that should be closed. This emphasis on closing existing parks undermines the commitment made by previous generations to protect this Nation's important natural and historic resources. The Administration supports other, forward-looking provisions in H.R. 260 that provide for a NPS Plan and the establishment of a clear process for identifying and evaluating potential new NPS units.
