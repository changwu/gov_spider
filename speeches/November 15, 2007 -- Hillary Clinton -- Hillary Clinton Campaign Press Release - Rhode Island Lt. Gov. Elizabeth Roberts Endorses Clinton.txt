    Roberts Will Join Campaign's Health Care Task Force
The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Rhode Island Lieutenant Governor Elizabeth Roberts, and named her to the Campaign's Health Care Policy Task Force.
"Hillary Clinton's 35-year record fighting for children and families makes her uniquely qualified to lead this country from her first day in the White House," Roberts said. "She has the strength and experience and vision to provide quality, affordable health insurance to every American."
Roberts was elected Lieutenant Governor in 2006 after a distinguished career in the State Senate, where she earned a reputation as a tireless fighter for expanding quality, affordable health care for Rhode Islanders.
In her five terms in the Senate, Roberts became a leader on government reform efforts,
helped expand the state's prescription drug program for seniors (RIPAE), enacted legislation to shield children from the dangers of lead paint, helped more working families get coverage through Rite Care, and vigorously promoted biomedical research in Rhode Island.
As Lieutenant Governor, Roberts is charged with the state's long-term care planning, emergency management coordination and small business advocacy. She has also been a leading proponent of stem cell research on the state level, working closely with Congressman Jim Langevin.
"I admire Elizabeth's tireless commitment to universal health care, and I'm honored to have her support," Clinton said. "I'm delighted she'll help spread our message of change across Rhode Island."
