 In-town pool report #3 Ceremony concludes, comments on Giuliani & election 
Ceremony ended at 12:58pm. Here are additional comments:
POTUS to Gable: Now, I'm larger than you a little bit. You think I can take you in wrestling?Gable responds POTUS would have "no chance."
Later towards the end of the event, after POTUS placed the medal on Gable, POTUS was asked about Rudy Giuliani after it was announced he tested positive for COVID-19.
"Rudy's doing well. He's doing very well. No temperature and he actually called me earlier this morning. Was the first call I got."
POTUS continues:"Greatest mayor in the history of New York and what he's doing now is more important. And he will admit that. He was the greatest mayor, did a fantastic job, especially when you see what's going on nowadays. Rudy Giuliani was a great, great mayor and what he's doing now, and he will say it -- is even more important."
Q: Are you looking to change the outcome of the election or trying to make the case, to the American people, that it wasn't fair.
"I think the case has already been made if you look at the polls. It was a rigged election. If you look at the different states, the election was totally rigged. It's a disgrace to our country. It's like a third world country, these ballots pouring in from everywhere, using machinery that nobody knows ownership nobody knows anything about.
They have glitches -- as they call them glitches. The glitches weren't glitches, they got caught sending out thousand of votes, all against me, by the way.
No, this was like from a third world nation and I think the case has been made. And now we find out what we can do about it. You'll see a lot of big things happening over the next couple of days."
