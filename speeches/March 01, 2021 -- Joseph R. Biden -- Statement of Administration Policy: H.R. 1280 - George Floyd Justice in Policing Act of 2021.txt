    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. Bass, D-CA, and 197 cosponsors)
To make our communities safer, we must begin by rebuilding trust between law enforcement and the people they are entrusted to serve and protect. We cannot rebuild that trust if we do not hold police officers accountable for abuses of power and tackle systemic misconduct – and systemic racism – in police departments.
President Biden has a long record of championing meaningful policing reform and previously called for the Congress to enact provisions like those in H.R. 1280, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021. The Administration encourages the House to pass this legislation, and looks forward to working with the Congress to enact a landmark policing reform law.
