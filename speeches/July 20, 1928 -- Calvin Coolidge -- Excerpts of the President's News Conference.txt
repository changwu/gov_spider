    I had learned from Secretary Kellogg that various governments interested in the proposed treaties were considering meeting in Europe, so that they might all be signed at the same time. I think the suggestion has been made that such a conference would be held in Paris. The State Department has that proposal under consideration, but while it looks on it with favor hasn't come to any definite conclusion.
I am not familiar with all the details of it, but so far as I am informed I am inclined to think that such a conference might be very helpful in giving it a setting and emphasizing the importance of the proposed treaties.
PRESS: Has any one suggested holding it in Washington?
PRESIDENT: I think not. It is so much easier for one man to go to Paris than it is for all the countries concerned to come over here that I think it is more probable that if such a conference is held it will be held in Paris, rather than in this country.
