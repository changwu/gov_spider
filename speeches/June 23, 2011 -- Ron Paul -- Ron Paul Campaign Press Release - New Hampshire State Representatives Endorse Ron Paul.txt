    Concord, NH — New Hampshire State Representatives George Lambert (Hillsborough, District 27) and Cameron DeJong (Hillsborough, District 9) today announced their endorsements of Congressman Ron Paul for the 2012 GOP nomination for president.
"I think we're seeing massive disenchantment with the idea that the big, expensive federal government can manage everything from the American economy to the civilian uprisings in the Middle East," said DeJong.
"This is costing us trillions of dollars that would be better invested in private economic growth. New Hampshire is historically one of the top donor states — meaning, we give a lot more in taxes than we get back. With our citizens getting hit hard by unemployment, the housing market, and fuel prices, I think it's time for a president who respects the Tenth Amendment, and spends less time coming up with high-priced Washington plans, and more time letting states and individuals create a working economy."
Representative Lambert added, "Government is constrained by the Constitution, not empowered by it, and it needs to be accountable and transparent to the people. As a state legislator, I champion the New Hampshire Constitution. For us to be a free and prosperous country, we all need to live by the rules we've agreed to. That's more important to me than any other issue.
"There's only one candidate who has consistently voted for and adheres to the Constitution," Lambert continued, "and that's Ron Paul."
