    Thursday, Hillary Clinton released the following statement on the historic peace agreement reached between Colombian government and the FARC rebels:
"I join people around the world in celebrating the historic peace agreement in Colombia, which brings to a close the longest-running internal armed conflict in the Americas. I applaud those who forged this pact. And I'm proud of the American diplomats who supported them at every step along the way. Now Colombia must turn this agreement into a just and lasting peace. As President, I'll ensure that the United States remains their partner in that process. The people of Colombia deserve nothing less. And the safety and security of our hemisphere and world will be strengthened by Colombia's success.
"After more than 50 years of war, a new day now dawns in Colombia. The road ahead is long. But this long-awaited milestone is worth celebrating."
