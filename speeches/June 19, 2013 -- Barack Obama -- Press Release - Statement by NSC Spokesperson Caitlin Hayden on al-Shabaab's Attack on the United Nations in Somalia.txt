    The United States condemns in the strongest terms al-Shabaab's despicable attack on the United Nations in Somalia today. The attack targeted people and organizations working in partnership with the Somali Government to provide health services, clean water, sanitation, education, and economic opportunity â€“ people striving to build a better future for the Somali people. We commend the brave and swift response by the Somali security forces and the African Union Mission in Somalia, and send our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of the victims of this heinous act.
Today's attack highlights the repugnant terrorist tactics al-Shabaab continues to use to stand in the way of efforts to ease the suffering of the Somali people. Whether by denying food and medical aid during one of the region's worst droughts, or by repeated attacks against fellow Somalis and soldiers helping to build a lasting peace, al-Shabaab has shown again and again that it stands on the side of death and destruction.
The United States remains a steadfast partner of the Somali people and their government as they work to build a safer, more prosperous future. We reiterate our strong support for the important work of the United Nations toward reaching that goal. Those seeking to derail Somalia's progress will not succeed.
