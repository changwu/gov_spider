    It is with a great deal of pleasure that I have today received the report of the President's Advisory Committee on the Points of Light Initiative Foundation.
Last summer I announced a three-part strategy to make community service central to the life and work of every individual, group, and organization in America. To help to implement this strategy, I announced that the Points of Light Initiative Foundation would be formed. I asked Gov. Tom Kean of New Jersey to head a committee to advise me on the structure of the Foundation and on the legislation needed to accomplish its goals. At the same time, the White House Office of National Service has developed recommended goals for the Foundation.
In addition to Governor Kean, this distinguished Presidential Advisory Committee is composed of Edward A. Brennan, chairman and chief executive officer of Sears, Roebuck & Co. and chairman of the board of governors of the United Way; Norman A. Brown, president and chief programming officer of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation; Frances Hesselbein, national executive director of the Girl Scouts of the United States of America; and Vernon E. Jordan, Jr., senior partner of the law firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld and former president of the National Urban League.
I am committed to making community service national policy of the highest priority. Drug abuse, illiteracy, homelessness, AIDS, environmental decay, and hunger must no longer be seen as someone else's problems for someone else to solve. To be a Point of Light is to measure your own success by what you do for someone else. Community service must become part of our daily pattern of living.
I am confident that the report I have received today from this distinguished group of Americans will assist us greatly in achieving these worthy goals.
