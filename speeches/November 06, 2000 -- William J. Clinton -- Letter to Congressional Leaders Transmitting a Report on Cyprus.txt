    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question covering the period August 1- September 30, 2000. The previous submission covered events during June and July 2000.
The United States has remained steadfast in its efforts to bring about a negotiated Cyprus settlement based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation. I conveyed our views to Turkish President Sezer during a meeting at the United Nations Millennium Summit, emphasizing the importance of a just and lasting solution for all Cypriots. Secretary Albright delivered a similar message to her Greek and Turkish counterparts during the United Nations General Assembly. Special Presidential Emissary Alfred Moses, Special Cyprus Coordinator Thomas Weston, and U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Donald Bandler continued to provide diplomatic support to the United Nations-sponsored proximity talks in July and early August in Geneva and again in September in New York. The United Nations reports that this process has taken a "qualitative step forward" and was scheduled to resume in Geneva on November 1.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
