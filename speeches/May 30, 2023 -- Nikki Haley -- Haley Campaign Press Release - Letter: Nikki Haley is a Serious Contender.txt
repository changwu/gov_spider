Nikki Haley, this is a serious contender in the presidential race. The daughter of Indian immigrants, an accountant, a two-term governor of South Carolina, and ambassador to the United Nations where she took the "kick me" sign off the United States! While governor of South Carolina, they amassed an impressive list of accomplishments. She speaks her mind.
Although a member of the Trump administration, she openly told him when she disagreed with his actions. She is married to a combat veteran and her tenets are "faith, family, and country." This is the kind of person we need in the Oval Office. Someone ready to stand tall in the face of pressure, both foreign and domestic.
