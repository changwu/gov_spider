    President Moon, thank you very much. It's a great honor to have you at the White House and your very beautiful and lovely wife. We appreciate it.
And we're going to have tremendous discussions tonight. I know you've been discussing with our people some of the complexities of North Korea and trade and other things, and we'll be discussing them all as we progress. And it could be very well late into the evening.
We very much respect you and we very much respect the people of South Korea. I'd like to also congratulate you upon your election victory. It was a great victory, and you did a fantastic job. A lot of people didn't expect that, and I did expect it. I thought that was going to happen. So I want to congratulate you very much.
And thank you also, thank you for coming.
