    Mitt Romney today announced the support of California State Senate Republican Leader Bob Huff and Assembly Republican Leader Connie Conway.
 
"The reception I have received from leading Republicans in California has been overwhelming," said Mitt Romney. "Bob and Connie share my vision for creating a better environment for job creation and have been working hard to bring jobs back to California. Their support is another sign that voters are looking for a proven job creator and leader."
"Mitt Romney is the only candidate who I trust to bring jobs back to California and improve our economy," said Senator Huff. "Our country needs his economic experience, proven leadership, and bold plan to create jobs and shrink government. That is why so many Republicans in California support his campaign and why I am proud to endorse him."
"After three years of failure from Washington, it is clear to me and many Californians that we need a change of direction in the White House," said Assemblywoman Conway. "President Obama did not have any job-creation experience and it shows. Our country has not recovered like the President promised and instead of seeing more job growth, we have only seen more and more debt. Mitt Romney spent his life in the private sector and knows what it will take to get our economy going."
