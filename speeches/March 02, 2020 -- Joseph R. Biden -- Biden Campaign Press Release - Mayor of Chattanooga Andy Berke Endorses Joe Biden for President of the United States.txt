    Today, Mayor of Chattanooga Andy Berke released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"In 2015, when a gunman attacked two military facilities in Chattanooga and senselessly killed five brave servicemembers who proudly served our country, Joe Biden, who has lost too many loved ones, showed up to console the heartbroken families. In a moment of horrific tragedy, Joe Biden helped heal our community. That's the type of leader Joe is and it's why I believe he is uniquely positioned to bring our nation together. Let's put someone in the White House who will unite all Americans, bring dignity to the most powerful office in the world, and fight every day for hardworking families in Chattanooga and across the nation. I am proud to endorse Joe Biden for President of the United States."
Berke's endorsement adds to the growing momentum Joe Biden has established in Tennessee, a critical Super Tuesday state. He joins 30 current and former elected officials, including state senators and representatives, mayors, city council members, and community leaders in supporting Joe Biden.
Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,400 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
