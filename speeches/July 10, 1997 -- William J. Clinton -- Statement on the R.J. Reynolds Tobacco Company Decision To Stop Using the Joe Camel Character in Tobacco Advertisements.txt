    I welcome R.J. Reynolds' decision today to stop using Joe Camel in its advertisements. This step is long overdue. As I said last year when we announced the FDA rule to protect youth from tobacco, we must put tobacco ads like Joe Camel out of our children's reach forever. I am glad RJR has finally taken this step today, and I hope other companies will follow suit. In the months ahead, I will keep fighting until the days of marketing tobacco to our children are over.
