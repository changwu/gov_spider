He was born in Miami, Fla., on April 16, 1922. He attended the University of Florida and the University of Miami and graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1946.
Weaver served 2 years of sea duty in the Navy and then spent 6 months at photogrammetry school and 6 months in the training group at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He resigned from the Navy in 1949. He was recalled to active duty in 1951 and served 2 years in the Office of Naval Intelligence at the pentagon.
Following his resignation from the Navy, Weaver worked for two small 'business concerns in Miami prior to joining Stephens, Inc., a larger investment banking firm in Little Rock in 1961.
From 1962 to 1969, he worked at Hollis & Co., a Stephens, Inc., subsidiary, and Union Management Corp., a subsidiary of Union Life Insurance Co. (which is an affiliate of Stephens, Inc.).
