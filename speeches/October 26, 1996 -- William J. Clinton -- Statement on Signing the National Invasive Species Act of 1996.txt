    I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 4283, the "National Invasive Species Act of 1996."
This legislation will help to control the unintentional introduction and spread of invasive species, such as zebra mussel, throughout the waters of our Nation. The damage such species cause to our environment and the economy, including our fisheries, is significant and continues to increase.
H.R. 4283 will establish a national voluntary ballast water management program to reduce the threat of additional pest species entering our waters. The bill also includes provisions to support important research and demonstrations of new technologies for combating aquatic nuisance species.
This bill is an important tool to safeguard our economic and environmental resources, and I am pleased to sign it.
