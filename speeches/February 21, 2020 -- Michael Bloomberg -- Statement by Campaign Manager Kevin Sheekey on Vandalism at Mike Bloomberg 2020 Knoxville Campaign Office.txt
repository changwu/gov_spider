    Today, Campaign Manager Kevin Sheekey issued the following statement in response to last night's incident of vandalism at the Mike Bloomberg 2020 campaign office in Knoxville, Tennessee and other related incidents:
"This latest incident at our Knoxville campaign office is exactly what we've been warning about. We don't know who is responsible for this vandalism, but we do know it echoes language from the Sanders campaign and its supporters.
"Over the past week, we've seen similar attacks against Mike Bloomberg 2020 offices in multiple states. Fortunately, no one has been injured. But this needs to end before someone gets hurt.
"We call on Bernie Sanders to immediately condemn these attacks and for his campaign to end the Trump-like rhetoric that is clearly encouraging his supporters to engage in behavior that has no place in our politics."

Knoxville Office, 2/21/2020
Multiple instances of vandalism have taken place at Mike Bloomberg 2020 offices over the past several weeks that involved language that mirrors attacks that Sen. Sanders' supporters and staff has used online and in interviews:

In Toledo, Ohio, the office was vandalized on 2/13
Our Youngstown, Ohio, office was vandalized and defaced on 2/14
Our Ann Arbor, MI office was vandalized with writing on the windows saying "Corporate Pig" on 2/13




Our Flint, MI office was defaced with a sign saying "Eat the Rich" on 2/16


The language used in these attacks mirrors language from Sen. Sanders and his campaign staff:
