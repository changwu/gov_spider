    HOUSTON, Texas – The Cruz for President campaign today announced the endorsement of former Senator Phil Gramm from Texas. Gramm served Congress representing the state of Texas for more than two decades, first in the U.S. House of Representatives, then later as Senator. He taught economics at Texas A&M University for 12 years before his election to Congress. Gramm is widely respected for his successful efforts to reduce federal spending, rebuild our national defense, and mandate Reagan-era tax cuts. Gramm will serve the campaign as a Senior advisor on economic issues and spearhead outreach to Members of Congress.
"Ted Cruz is a fearless leader and fighter for conservatives all over this country," said Gramm. "He has consistently and unwaveringly fought to protect our God-given liberties his entire life. I believe he is the leader that America needs now, at a time when our freedoms are endangered. I intend to do everything in my power to help Ted Cruz broaden his political base, win the nomination, and be elected President of the United States. "
"Phil has been a powerful voice for conservative values his entire career and Americans know and respect his principled leadership on their behalf during his time in Congress," said Cruz. "When Bill Clinton tried to push HillaryCare through Congress, Phil stood firm and unequivocally with the American people — his leadership showed the nation that when leaders stay true to their values and fulfill their promises, the trust they earn from the voters can influence public opinion and change the course of our country for the better. I am honored to have his support for this campaign."
