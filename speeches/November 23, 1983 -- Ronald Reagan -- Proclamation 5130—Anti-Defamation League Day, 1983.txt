  A Proclamation

Since its inception, the Anti-Defamation League has worked to strengthen the democratic underpinnings of American society and to establish a harmonious unity of friendship and understanding amidst this Nation's religious, racial, and ethnic diversity. The Anti-Defamation League has combatted, counteracted, and worked to educate the public against anti-Semitism, racism, and the extremists of totalitarianism. The Anti-Defamation League also has articulated the special concerns and interests of the American Jewish community in upholding human rights and civil liberties in this country and throughout the world and served as an effective advocate for friendship with Israel.
The Anti-Defamation League and its leaders and supporters set an example of leadership and participation in events and programs to affect the well-being and future of all people. In purpose and program, the Anti-Defamation League espouses and fulfills the highest ideals and aspiration of Americans of all faiths, races, and cultural origins.
The Congress, by House Joint Resolution 408, has designated November 12, 1983, as "Anti-Defamation League Day" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of that day.
Now, Therefore, L Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim November 12, 1983, as Anti-Defamation League Day.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.

RONALD REAGAN
