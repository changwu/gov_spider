    Secretary Julián Castro recites names of black lives lost at the hands of police-involved shootings
COLUMBUS, OH (October 15, 2019) – In the sixth Democratic debate, the biggest applause of the evening went to former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and San Antonio Mayor Julián Castro during a conversation about gun violence in America. Secretary Castro reminded the other candidates and viewers that "police violence is gun violence" and that communities of color are skeptical of greater policing. The American people saw a bold, new generational leader ready to unite our nation around a positive vision for the future.
Though Secretary Castro's speaking time on the debate stage amounted to less than half of Senator Warren's, his impact was felt on behalf of vulnerable communities. One of several memorable lines on stage at the debate, Secretary Castro said, "Think about how absurd it is that this President is caging kids on the border and effectively letting ISIS prisoners run free."
Following the debate, in a tweet and in spin room interviews, Secretary Castro also addressed housing, immigration, and climate change, which were excluded from tonight's debate.

Reverend Dr. Chuck CurrieFor 30 years, I've worked to end homelessness. @JulianCastro has released the most comprehensive plan to reach that goal and to create affordable housing. How we treat the least of these is akin to how we treat God. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate4
Dante Barry, Founder & Executive Director of Million Hoodies Movement for JusticeThank you to @JulianCastro for making the connection about police violence, gun violence $ mandatory assault weapons buyback. Buybacks don't get to the root of the problem and we have to be cautious when those guns are brought back to law enforcement to kill POC. #DemDebate
Allison Stephens, DNC National CommitteewomanBlack women are dying in childbirth due to racism in the health care system. I almost became one of the many. #Democrats need to #trustblackwomen to make our own decisions and we need #reprojustice. Thank you @JulianCastro for standing with us.
Ilyse Hogue, President of NARAL Pro-Choice America.@JulianCastro speaks to the critical need to look at reproductive justice and why it is that poor women are denied access to freedom over their own futures when rich women are not. #BeBoldEndHyde #DemocraticDebate
Indivisible Guide.@JulianCastro is leading on this issue. He was the first candidate to call for eliminating "qualified immunity" which is a legal loophole that protects violent cops from lawsuits when they violate people's constitutional rights. #DemDebate
Former Democratic Candidate for Queens District Attorney, Tiffany Cabán"So grateful for @JulianCastro's presence throughout this campaign. Police violence is also gun violence and we need to address that!" #demdebate
