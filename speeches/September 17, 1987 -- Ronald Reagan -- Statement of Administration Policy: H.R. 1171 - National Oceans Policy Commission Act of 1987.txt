    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Jones (D) North Carolina and 16 others)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1171. The proposed National Oceans Policy Commission would unnecessarily duplicate the existing institutional framework for addressing ocean policy issues. Additionally, the administration has expressed constitutional objections to the manner in which the proposed entity would be established.
