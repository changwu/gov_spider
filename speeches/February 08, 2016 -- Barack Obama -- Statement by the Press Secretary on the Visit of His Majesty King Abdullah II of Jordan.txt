    The President will host His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan at the White House on February 24, 2016. The United States greatly values its enduring and strategic partnership with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, as well as our shared initiatives on a broad range of diplomatic and security challenges. During their meeting, the President and King Abdullah will discuss efforts to counter ISIL, resolve the Syrian conflict, address the needs of Syrian and Iraqi refugees in Jordan and how the U.S. can continue to support the Kingdom's generosity in hosting these refugees, and assist Jordan as it continues its political and economic reform initiatives. They will also discuss how best to advance prospects for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and other issues of mutual interest.
