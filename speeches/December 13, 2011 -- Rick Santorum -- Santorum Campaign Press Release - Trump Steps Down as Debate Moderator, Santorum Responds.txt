    Verona, PA - Donald Trump stepped down today as the moderator the highly publicized NewsMax debate in Iowa on December 27th. The debate promised to be truly substantive and informative, as the only two confirmed participants were Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich.
Senator Santorum said: ""The media has anointed Newt as the frontrunner, isn't it time he go toe to toe with the consistent conservative alternative? The people of Iowa deserve as many opportunities to hear from the candidates as possible, because while Obama is beatable, we have to elect a conservative nominee who's record is a clear contrast to the President's."
