When all of the people pushing so hard for Criminal Justice Reform were unable to come even close to getting it done they came to me as a group and asked for my help. I got it done with a group of Senators & others who would never have gone for it. Obama couldn't come close....Retweets: 18871Favorites: 84154

House Republicans should allow Chairs of Committees to remain for longer than 6 years. It forces great people and real leaders to leave after serving. The Dems have unlimited terms. While that has its own problems it is a better way to go. Fewer people in the end will leave!Retweets: 8727Favorites: 38535

Great news that an activist investor is now involved with AT&T. As the owner of VERY LOW RATINGS @CNN perhaps they will now put a stop to all of the Fake News emanating from its non-credible 'anchors.' Also I hear that because of its bad ratings it is losing a fortune.....Retweets: 12943Favorites: 54018

...But most importantly @CNN is bad for the USA. Their International Division spews bad information & Fake News all over the globe. This is why foreign leaders are always asking me 'Why does the Media hate the U.S. sooo much?' It is a fraudulent shame & all comes from the top!Retweets: 12348Favorites: 50077

As bad as @CNN is Comcast MSNBC is worse. Their ratings are also way down because they have lost all credibility. I believe their stories about me are not 93% negative but actually 100% negative.
