    Head-to-head, Paul-Obama in statistical tie
LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” In a new PPP Poll, 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul is in a statistical tie with President Barack Obama in the battleground state of Florida, with Dr. Paul taking 44 percent to President Obama's 45 percent in the head-to-head matchup.
Dr. Paul performed the best against the President among the other Republican presidential candidates.
"This latest poll is just more evidence of Ron Paul's competitiveness against the President," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
"Ron Paul's message of constitutionally-limited government, a humble, pro-America foreign policy, and sound money is continuing to resonate with Americans who are clearly tired of the same failed policies being offered by establishment politicians. The same goes, it seems, for voters in the Sunshine State," added Mr. Benton.
These results come just days after a Harris Poll showed Ron Paul defeating President Obama 51 percent to 49 percent in a general election race.
