    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced endorsements in Southeast Iowa. Following Mayor Giuliani's swing through Iowa last week, which concluded at a town hall meeting with hundreds of local voters in Davenport, Mayor Giuliani earned endorsements from several county chairs and co-chairs throughout the region.
The Southeast Regional Chair is former state Senator Maggie Tinsman. Senator Tinsman was also a former Assistant Minority Leader and the first woman to serve on the Scott County Board of Supervisors. As the Southeast Regional Chair, she will work throughout the region to build upon Rudy Giuliani's volunteer base and grassroots organization. She is also serving as a statewide Co-Chair for the campaign.
Mayor Giuliani also received endorsements from Iowa County Sheriff Nicholas Roggentien and Robert Brennan, the Mayor of Deep River.
"The support for Rudy Giuliani during his recent trip to Iowa shows that his message of strong leadership and optimism is resonating throughout the state," said Giuliani's National Political Director Mark Campbell. "Rudy's team in Southeast Iowa will be a great asset to our campaign as we continue to build momentum and our volunteer base."
