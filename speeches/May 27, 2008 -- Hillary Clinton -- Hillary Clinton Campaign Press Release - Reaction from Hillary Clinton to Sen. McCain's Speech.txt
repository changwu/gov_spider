    Senator McCain today gave a speech about his "dream" to "reduce the nuclear threat" to the United States and the world. But Senator McCain's goals will remain an illusion as long as he continues to embrace and magnify the failed policies of the Bush administration.
Like George Bush, John McCain opposes negotiations with Iran, which has edged closer to a nuclear capability, while the United States has subcontracted its diplomacy out to Europe. John McCain today also outlined a vision of negotiations with Russia to reduce nuclear stockpiles. But kicking Russia out of the G-8, as Senator McCain has repeatedly proposed, will jeopardize this critical security goal, while setting back efforts to build international pressure on Iran to end its nuclear program.
As President, Senator Clinton will once again establish the United States as a nonproliferation leader. Under her leadership, the United States will have the courage to negotiate with our adversaries and the wisdom to conduct diplomacy effectively. She will support a policy of vigorous diplomacy with Iran to stop its nuclear program. She will embrace the goal of one day ending nuclear weapons; support ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; and, in close cooperation with our allies, work with Russia to negotiate deep and verifiable reductions in nuclear weapons.
