Yesterday, New Jersey senator and selfie aficionado Cory Booker hit the trail for Hillary Clinton. At some point along the way, Cory convinced Hillary to let him take over her Snapchat. 
The power went straight to Cory's head. 
Later, Cory shared one of the major keys to helping Hillary win in Iowa ... 
... his favorite snacks on the road ... 
... and the huge crowd that packed into a room to hear why Cory is supporting Hillary. 
Make sure you're following Hillary Clinton on Snapchatâ€”you never know who's going to take over!


Open Snapchat and take a picture of Hillary's ghost to add her as a friend!
Watch Cory's full Snapchat takeover.
