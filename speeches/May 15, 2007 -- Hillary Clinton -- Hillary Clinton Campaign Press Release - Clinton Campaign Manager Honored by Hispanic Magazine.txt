    Patti Solis Doyle is named among "2007 Latinas of Excellence"
Washington, DC -- Hillary for President campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle, has been honored by Hispanic Magazine with the "2007 Latinas of Excellence Award" for her accomplishments in the area of government, politics and civil leadership. Solis Doyle will be profiled in the May issue of the magazine, and she will accept the award at a ceremony in New York City on May 21.
"It is a great honor to receive this recognition," said Solis Doyle. "When I was growing up my parents had to take two or three jobs to be able to provide for our family. Their life story is what makes my work in public service, and particularly in this campaign, more significant. By helping elect Senator Clinton as President, we are helping hardworking families have access to health care, quality education and good paying jobs."
"I have known Patti for almost 16 years and I'm fortunate to have her not only as one of my closest advisors but also as my friend," said Hillary Clinton. "This recognition to her professional accomplishments is well deserved and it makes our campaign and her family proud."
Patti Solis Doyle is the first Hispanic woman to lead a presidential effort in the United States. She worked in the White House designing, managing and implementing the execution of Mrs. Clinton's schedule on all overseas travel, selecting and coordinating events to further the country's domestic, diplomatic and foreign policy goals. As a long time advisor to Senator Clinton, Patti also served as executive director of HILLPAC, Senator Clinton's political action committee. During Senator Clinton's 2000 Election Campaign, Solis Doyle coordinated press, policy, political, and scheduling operations, and served as a member of the executive advisory committee to determine day-to-day campaign management.
