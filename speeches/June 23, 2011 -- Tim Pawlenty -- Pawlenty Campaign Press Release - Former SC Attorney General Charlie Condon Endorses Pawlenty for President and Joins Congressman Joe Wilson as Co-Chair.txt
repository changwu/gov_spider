    The Pawlenty for President campaign announced today that former South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon endorses Gov. Tim Pawlenty for president and will join Congressman Joe Wilson in leading its efforts in South Carolina. The two term Attorney General from Charleston will serve as a coâ€“chair in the critical "First In The South" Presidential Primary.
"I am very excited to welcome Attorney General Condon to our team in South Carolina," Governor Pawlenty said. "General Condon is a respected leader throughout the state, and I am looking forward to working with him as he helps to lead this campaign to victory."
"Over the past few months I have gotten to know the rest of the field as well as Governor Tim Pawlenty," Condon said. "There is no question in my mind that he is the best candidate we have and the right man to put our country back on the right track. Pawlenty's strong fiscal record during his 8 years as governor of Minnesota proves that he is able to produce real conservative change amidst tough circumstances. I feel very strongly that in order to beat President Obama and make this country a better place for our children and grandchildren, we must elect Tim Pawlenty the next President of the United States."
Mr. Condon is a practicing attorney in the Charleston, SC area, and served as the Attorney General of South Carolina from 1995-2003. He previously served as co-chair of John McCain's 2008 presidential primary in South Carolina, as well as George W. Bush's and Bob Dole's efforts in 2000 and 1996, respectively. He will join Congressman Joe Wilson in chairing Governor Pawlenty's South Carolina effort.
