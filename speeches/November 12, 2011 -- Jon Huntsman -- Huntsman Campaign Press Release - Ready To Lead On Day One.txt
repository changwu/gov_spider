Friends:
We are living in tumultuous times, and America cannot afford a Commander-in-Chief who is forced to learn on the job.
We need a leader who possesses the experience and statesmanship necessary to defeat President Obama, and restore America's strength at home and abroad.
At tonight's foreign policy debate in South Carolina, Jon Huntsman showed he is that leader.
As the only candidate with proven success on the international stage, Jon demonstrated a clear understanding of the world's complex challenges, and offered a detailed plan to transform America's military and defense posture for the 21st Century.
Voters can trust Jon Huntsman to be prepared to lead from day one on critical issues such as defeating terrorism, expanding our economic engagement in the world through free trade, and dealing with rising powers such as China and India.
If you agree, I ask that you please make a donation to Jon's campaign of $25, $50, $100 or even the maximum amount of $2500.
After you make a donation, please share this page with your friends and family on twitter and facebook and ask them to do the same.
Thank you for standing with Jon.
