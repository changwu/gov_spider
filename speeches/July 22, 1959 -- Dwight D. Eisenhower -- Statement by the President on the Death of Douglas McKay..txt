    I WAS saddened to hear of the news of the passing of Douglas McKay. As former Governor of his State and former Secretary of the Interior, Mr. McKay devoted much of his life to public service. In his passing the nation has lost a distinguished citizen and an American of outstanding character. He was a loyal and valued friend.
Mrs. Eisenhower joins me in extending our deep sympathies to Mrs. McKay and her family on the great personal loss they have sustained.
