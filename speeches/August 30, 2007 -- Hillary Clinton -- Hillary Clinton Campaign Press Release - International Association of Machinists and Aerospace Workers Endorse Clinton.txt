    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The IAM is among the nation's largest industrial trade unions, representing over 700,000 active and retired members in airline, aerospace, manufacturing, railroad, woodworking and shipbuilding industries, and is a member of the AFL-CIO.
"Hillary Clinton earned the IAM's endorsement by focusing on jobs, health care, education and trade - the bread and butter issues of the American middle class," said IAM International President Tom Buffenbarger. "She is the only candidate of either party to come forward with a comprehensive manufacturing policy and the only candidate to connect with millions of Americans who feel invisible to the current administration."
The IAM will launch a massive education campaign among IAM members and extensive publicity in union publications and websites nationwide. Twenty-five states with over 450,000 active and retired IAM members will vote in the three weeks starting with the Iowa caucuses and ending with the polls closing in California on February 5th.
"I am honored to receive the support of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers," Clinton said. "It is time for America's working families to again share in our nation's prosperity. They will not be invisible to my administration."
The United Transportation Union and its 125,000 active and retired members endorsed Clinton earlier this week.
