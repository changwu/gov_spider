    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Roth (R) Delaware and four others)
The President's senior advisers will recommend disapproval if any bill containing title I of S. 2230 is presented for the President's action. The Administration supports efforts, both legislative and administrative, to improve the management of the Federal Government; however, by statutorily reorganizing the Office of Management and Budget, S. 2230 would inappropriately and unnecessarily interfere with the President's discretion and flexibility in managing the Executive branch, in general, and the Executive Office of the President, in particular.
