    Milwaukee, Wis. -- Today, Gov. Scott Walker released the following statement on the 14th Anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
"On this 14th anniversary of September 11, 2001, we remember with sadness the tragic events that forever altered our lives. On that terrible day, radical Islamic terrorists unleashed unimaginable horror against our country, ending nearly 3,000 innocent lives. As we honor the victims and keep their families in our thoughts and prayers, we cannot forget the bravery of the hundreds of first responders who sacrificed their lives while trying to save others. Today and every day, our hearts are filled with the strength and spirit of a nation that rose out of the rubble united, unintimidated, and undeterred from celebrating our uniquely American values of freedom, liberty, and opportunity for all. May we never take these values for granted and always remain vigilant in America's defense."
