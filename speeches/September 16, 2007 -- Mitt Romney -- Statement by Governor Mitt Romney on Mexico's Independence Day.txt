Boston, MA â€“ Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement today regarding Mexico's Independence Day:
"On the 197th anniversary of Mexico's independence, we send our best wishes to the people of Mexico and Mexican-American communities across the United States. We also honor the many contributions of Mexican-Americans to our culture through their patriotism, hard work, entrepreneurship, faith in God, love of family and respect for human life. Their talents and ambition have helped make the United States a great nation.
"In recent years, the Mexican people have chosen to remain on the path toward a more prosperous and democratic future. By strengthening the rule of law and promoting transparency, Mexico's leaders are committed to spurring development and ensuring that economic opportunity reaches all of their people.
"I believe that President Felipe Calderon will be an invaluable partner on bilateral and regional issues like trade, immigration and combating cross-border drug trafficking that threatens both our nations' futures. He has already demonstrated courageous leadership in taking on the violent cartels and deserves our respect and cooperation in this effort. There is also good reason to feel optimistic that his determination to modernize Mexico's economy will strengthen our robust trade ties which help generate jobs on both sides of the border.
"Mexico is a valued neighbor, partner and friend of the United States. As Mexicans celebrate their independence, we are reminded of the importance of this strong relationship based on shared interests and mutual respect."
