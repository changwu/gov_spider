    Today, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Director James Carroll released the following statement ahead of National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, which is Saturday, April 27.
"Our efforts to reverse the pattern of addiction in America start with preventing drug misuse before it's too late. In homes across the country, medicine cabinets are full of leftover prescription drugs that have the potential to take someone's life. National Take Back Day helps eliminate this threat by presenting an opportunity for Americans to safely dispose of their unused, expired, or unwanted prescription medications," ONDCP Director James Carroll said.
This weekend, approximately 6,000 collection sites manned by nearly 5,000 partner law enforcement agencies will be open between 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. local time. The public can find a nearby collection site at www.DEATakeBack.com or by calling 800-882-9539.
Now in its ninth year, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has collected a total of nearly 11 million pounds (more than 5,400 tons) of expired, unused, and unwanted prescription medications through its Take Back Day events.
