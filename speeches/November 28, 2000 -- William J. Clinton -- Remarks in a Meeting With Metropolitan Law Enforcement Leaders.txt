    Well, first of all, you guys look good on the steps here. [Laughter] Maybe you should just stay all day. It would be great.
I want to thank you for all the help you've given us these last 8 years, in all my many movements and oftentimes in very crowded times of the day and difficult circumstances. And I'm very, very grateful to all of you, and before I left, I just wanted to have a chance to get everybody together and say thank you.
I've had a wonderful time these last 8 years. And I was able to do my job in no small measure because of what you did, and I hope you'll always be glad that you did it.
I thank you very, very much. Merry Christmas.
