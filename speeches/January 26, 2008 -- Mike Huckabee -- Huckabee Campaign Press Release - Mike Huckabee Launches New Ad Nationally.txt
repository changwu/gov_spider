    Little Rock, AR â€“ Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee launched a new 30 second television ad Friday.
The new ad, "Common Sense," highlights Huckabee's Main Street message and the need for major reform in Washington, beginning with abolishing the IRS and ensuring that taxation, regulation, litigation are kept to the bare minimum.
The ad echoes a major campaign theme by Huckabee that he'll lead the fight to help Americans keep their jobs and paychecks. It will run nationally on various national cable programs.
"This ad highlights a high priority for Governor Huckabee, that he wants to be the president that nails the going out of business sign on the IRS," said Campaign Manager Chip Saltsman.
Huckabee media consultant Bob Wickers stated, "This is a major national cable buy that will not only impact the Florida campaign, but we plan on adding to it as we move into Super Tuesday."

:30 TV "Common Sense"
MIKE HUCKABEE TO CAMERA:
"The IRS penalizes productivity. Small business owners face their toughest competition from their own government. Excessive taxation, regulation, and litigation leads to job migration. Let's change this nonsense to common sense. I want to be the President who nails the "going out of business" sign on the door of the IRS. Visit mikehuckabee.com and join our team. I'm Mike Huckabee and I approve this message and I'll lead the fight to abolish the IRS; and we'll keep our jobs and paychecks."
