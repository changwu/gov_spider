    I WISH to extend to you my congratulations on the Liberal Party/National Country Party coalition victory in the recent Australian election. Americans continue to attach great importance to the warm friendship and close cooperation between the United States and Australia, and to the ANZUS alliance which symbolizes the basic identity of our values and objectives.
I look forward to working with you and your government as we face the challenges of strengthening the structure of peace and economic cooperation.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
