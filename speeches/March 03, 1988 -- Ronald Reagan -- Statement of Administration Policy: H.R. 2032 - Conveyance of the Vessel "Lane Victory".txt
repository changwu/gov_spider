    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Anderson (D) California and 3 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2032 unless it is amended to: (1) provide that the Federal Government shall not be liable for any claims resulting from the presence of asbestos on the vessel, and (2) delete section 4(c), which provides for the conveyance of equipment from other vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleet. The Administration therefore urges that H.R. 2032 not be considered under suspension of the rules and that it be amended accordingly.
