    I am pleased to extend my warmest greetings and best wishes as millions of Chinese throughout the world celebrate this New Year, the Year of the Rooster.
America is a strong and vibrant nation because its people are the people of many nations. They have given this land we love the inherited wisdom and strength of mankind's greatest civilizations, including that of China. Americans of Chinese ancestry can take pride in their cultural heritage and in the contributions they and their forebears have made to this country.
As we begin the New Year of 4679, we look forward with a vision of hope to a world where peace prevails and prosperity abounds.
Mrs. Reagan joins with me in extending our warmest regards to the Chinese American community.
RONALD REAGAN
