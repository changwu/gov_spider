    Laura and I are saddened by the death of Representative Julia Carson. Throughout her decade of service in the U.S. House of Representatives and her nearly 20 years in the Indiana General Assembly, Representative Carson served her constituents in Indianapolis with passion and commitment. She was revered as a champion for building strong and safe communities, working to end homelessness, improving financial literacy for all Americans, and helping her constituents achieve and maintain the dream of homeownership.
Julia was a dedicated and admired public servant who will be missed by her many friends and colleagues both at home in Indiana and in our Nation's Capital. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends.
