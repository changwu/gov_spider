Boston, MA â€“ Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement today regarding the 50th anniversary of the Little Rock Nine:
"Fifty years ago today, the Little Rock Nine boldly entered Central High School in fulfillment of the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision. This event marked an important step towards equality, as well as a victory for the rule of law and our Constitution. On this day, we honor the courage and legacy of Minnijean Brown Trickey, Elizabeth Eckford, Ernest Green, Thelma Mothershed Wair, Melba Pattillo Beals, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Terrence Roberts, Jefferson Thomas and Carlotta Walls LaNier.
"Despite the progress we celebrate today, the most important civil rights challenge of our time is the failure of our inner city schools. As President, I will go to work to improve standards and usher in a new era of American prosperity that touches all our people."
