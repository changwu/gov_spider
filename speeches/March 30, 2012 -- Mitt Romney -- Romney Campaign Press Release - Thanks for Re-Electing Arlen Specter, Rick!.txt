Senator Santorum's Campaign Says He Should Be Thanked For Helping To Re-Elect Liberal Senator Arlen Specter:
A Top Santorum Adviser Claims Santorum Deserves Full Credit For Keeping Arlen Specter In Office In 2004: "The Proof Is In The Pudding." "On Thursday, the top political adviser to former Sen. Rick Santorum said that should the Court rule that the government cannot punish those who refuse to buy insurance, the Republican presidential candidate would deserve some of the credit — all because he supported fellow Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter, a moderate Republican who later joined the Democratic Party. 'As a reminder, as we watch this whole Obamacare Supreme Court review unfold, it is very important to understand that if Rick Santorum hadn't supported Specter, there is no guarantee that we would have had [Justice Samuel] Alito and [Chief Justice John] Roberts who are going to play, probably, a major role in this,' Santorum's top adviser, John Brabender, told The Huffington Post. 'He was very firm with Specter that he needed Bush's conservative judges to be confirmed ... And as you know, Specter did that. The proof is in the pudding.'" (Sam Stein, "Rick Santorum Should Get Credit If Supreme Court Scraps Obamacare, Adviser Argues," The Huffington Post, 3/29/12)
