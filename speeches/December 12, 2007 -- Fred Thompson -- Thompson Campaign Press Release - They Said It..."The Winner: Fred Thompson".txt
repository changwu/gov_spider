"The winner: Thompson" (American Spectator, 12/12)
"Winner: Thompson" (Jim Geraghty, NRO, 12/12)
"Frankly, the candidate who had the best afternoon I think was Fred Thompson. This was easily his best debate performance and he seemed to shine in this subdued format." (Chuck Todd, NBC First Read, 12/12)
"Winner: Fred Thompson. Good substance, good personality, and his I won't raise my hand for an answer question reminded me of Reagan say 'I paid for this microphone.' Fred definitely won." (Right Wing News, 12/12)
"He had the sharpest tone and sounded like a leader" (NBC First Read, 12/12)
"This guy looks like he could eat most of the rest of the field for lunch." (Jim Geraghty, NRO, 12/12)
"Seriously, it's like Thompson came to the debate in Des Moines today to do two things: Kick butt and chew gum. And it appears he's all out of gum." (Mark Hemingway, NRO, 12/12)
"Fred Thompson is easily having his best debate; the format suits him well; it's very issue oriented and doesn't allow for too many back-n-forths and gives Fred a chance to shine." (Chuck Todd, NBC First Read, 12/12)
"Fred the Truth Teller....That's been his emphasis today, and a compelling one." (Rich Lowry, NRO, 12/12)
"Fred Thompson was smart, funny, irascible and consistent, and probably helped his standing here." (Ambinder, The Atlantic, 12/12)
"Judging by This Debate So Far... Romney's main threat in Iowa should be Fred Thompson." (Rich Lowry, NRO, 12/12)
"Thompson is sounding like he's decided this debate's format stinks, and so he's going to protest by mocking the mockery it has become. It's the most life he's shown in a while." (Jim Geraghty, NRO, 12/12)
"He seems, so far, a bit more rejuvinated than prevous ones." (Jim Geraghty, NRO, 12/12)
"'I want to take a chance on telling the truth to the American people.' Very nice line from Fred."
(Rich Lowry, NRO, 12/12)
"Finally, Fred wakes up and shows a little passion: 'When the enemies of this country are at the negotiating table, who do you want representing you? Whoever that guy is, that's the guy you ought to vote for for President.' One of his stronger moments." (Jim Geraghty, NRO, 12/12)
"Asked for a show of hands on global warming, Thompson finally stands up. 'I'm not doing any hand shows today.' A few folks applaud. Fred: You gonna give me a minute to answer it? Moderator: No. Fred: Then I'm not gonna answer it. This gets a smattering of applause. And yup, I'm applauding at home." (Jim Geraghty, NRO, 12/12)
"NEA... Another 'good for Fred' moment." (Kathryn Jean Lopez, NRO, 12/12)
"'The biggest obstacle is the NEA'....Another good Fred line..." (Rich Lowry, NRO, 12/12)
"Fred does come off as a sincere, solid man, with good instincts, who you want to see more of on more than Law & Order repeats." (Kathryn Jean Lopez, NRO, 12/12)
