    I am pleased that a bipartisan agreement was reached today in the Senate on legislation to provide permanent funding to protect critical lands across America. We have before us an historic opportunity to build a truly enduring conservation endowment. I commend Senator Bingaman and Senator Murkowski for their leadership in moving us closer to that goal. I am committed to working with Congress in the bipartisan spirit reflected in today's agreement so that future generations will have the resources to protect precious lands, from city parks to threatened farmland to our grandest natural treasures.
