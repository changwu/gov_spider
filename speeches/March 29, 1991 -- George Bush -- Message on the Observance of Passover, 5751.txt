    As Jewish people around the world gather to celebrate Passover and to recount through the Haggadah the story of the Exodus, we are reminded of the triumph of good over evil. We are also reminded that the enduring spirit of liberty can never be crushed by the cruel hand of tyranny and enslavement. This lesson appears time and again in the pages of the Bible; and following the recent coalition victory in the Persian Gulf, it is a lesson all the more vivid to us today.
The traditions honored in Jewish homes during Passover, the festival of freedom, celebrate the blessings of life and liberty and underscore their precious nature. This year, we join with our Jewish neighbors in giving thanks to the Almighty for those blessings and for His aid in preserving them. Indeed, as we strive to learn from the past and to face the future with renewed faith, we are united by our gratitude and by our renewed hopes for a safer, more peaceful world.
Barbara and I extend our best wishes to members of the Jewish community for a happy and joyous Passover holiday.
