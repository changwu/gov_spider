    Hillary Clinton released the following statement upon receiving the endorsement of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, which represents more than 80,000 members. Clinton now has the endorsement of 27 national labor unions or labor alliances representing more than 14 million workers."?I am honored to have earned the endorsement of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers."?In both the public and private sectors, the diverse members of IFPTE have helped build the mighty American middle class--standing up for workers' fundamental right to organize and bargain collectively, opposing trade deals that have benefited big corporations at the expense of working families, and demanding the fair pay and respect American workers deserve,"?As President, I will fight alongside IFPTE to protect workers' rights to organize free from corporate intimidation, to oppose the Trans Pacific Partnership and build a level playing field so American workers can compete and win in the global economy, and to stand up for the dignity of all workers in the public and private sectors. As President, IFPTE and organized labor will always have a champion in the White House and a seat at the table--because when unions are strong, families are strong, and when families are strong, America is strong.?"?
