    President Trump's refusal to take COVID-19 seriously or be honest with the American people about the reality of the virus, has cost Pennsylvania thousands of lives and hundreds of thousands of jobs. Over four years in office, all President Trump has delivered to working families in Pennsylvania are broken promises. Pennsylvanians see these failures every day in the factories that have closed down in their town, in the empty chair at their kitchen table, and in the stack of medical bills that they are unable to pay.
As president, I will listen to public health experts so we can safely open our economy and schools. I will empower working families in Pennsylvania, create millions of good-paying union jobs, and ensure that everyone has access to quality, affordable health care.
