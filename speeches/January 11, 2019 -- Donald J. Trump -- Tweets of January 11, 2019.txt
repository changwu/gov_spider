I often said during rallies with little variation that 'Mexico will pay for the Wall.' We have just signed a great new Trade Deal with Mexico. It is Billions of Dollars a year better than the very bad NAFTA deal which it replaces. The difference pays for Wall many times over!Retweets: 28752Favorites: 129907

Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border. I just got back and it is a far worse situation than almost anyone would understand an invasion!

...The Steel Barrier or Wall should have been built by previous administrations long ago. They never got it done - I will. Without it our Country cannot be safe. Criminals Gangs Human Traffickers Drugs & so much other big trouble can easily pour in. It can be stopped cold!Retweets: 32648Favorites: 142836

Drug prices declined in 2018 the first time in nearly half a century. During the first 19 months of my Administration Americans saved $26 Billion on prescription drugs. Our policies to get cheaper generic drugs to market are working!Retweets: 25338Favorites: 115390
