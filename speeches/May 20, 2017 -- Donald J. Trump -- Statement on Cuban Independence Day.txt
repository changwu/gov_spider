    On Cuban Independence Day, I extend my warmest wishes to the Cuban American community and the people of Cuba as our whole Nation joins you in celebrating the anniversary of Cuban Independence.
Americans and Cubans share allegiance to the principles of self-governance, dignity, and freedom. Today, we remember patriots like José Martí, who devoted himself to making Cuba an economically competitive and politically autonomous nation. He reminds us that cruel despotism cannot extinguish the flame of freedom in the hearts of Cubans, and that unjust persecution cannot tamper Cubans' dreams for their children to live free from oppression. The Cuban people deserve a government that peacefully upholds democratic values, economic liberties, religious freedoms, and human rights, and my Administration is committed to achieving that vision.
Today, we also honor the generations of Cuban Americans who have made outstanding contributions to our country by sharing their culture and talents. Cuban Americans have distinguished themselves in literature, the arts, business, sports, the courts, Congress, and within my Administration. We are especially thankful to the Cuban Americans who serve in our military and who have sacrificed in defense of our freedom.
Melania and I send our best wishes on this important day in history for the Americas. God bless the people of Cuba and our Cuban American friends who call the United States home.
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
