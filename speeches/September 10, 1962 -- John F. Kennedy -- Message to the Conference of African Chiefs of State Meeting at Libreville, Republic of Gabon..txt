    I APPRECIATE the message from your Secretary General, informing me that the first anniversary of the institution of the Afro-Malagasy Union will be celebrated on September 10th in the capital of the Republic of Gabon. It gives me great pleasure on this occasion to send my personal greetings to the conference of chiefs of state of this Union. I have watched with interest the development of your organization and its contribution to the goal of increased African economic and political development. May I extend my best wishes for continued progress.
