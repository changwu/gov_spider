    Mr. Frank Reed, a recently released hostage from Lebanon, arrived at Andrews Air Force Base earlier this afternoon. At about the same time, Mrs. Bush was preparing to depart Andrews Air Force Base for a commencement address at the Southeast Community College in Cumberland, KY. Following a press conference by Mr. Reed at Andrews at about 2:45 p.m., Mr. Reed and Mrs. Bush briefly met on the tarmac near her aircraft. Mr. Reed said he was thrilled to meet Mrs. Bush and "glad to be home." Mr. Reed introduced his family to Mrs. Bush. Mrs. Bush said, "We're so glad you're home. I know the President wishes he was here to meet you."
Both parties then proceeded on to their planned destinations. Mr. Reed will undergo further medical examination at the Malcolm Grow Hospital at Andrews Air Force Base. The White House will release in Washington a photograph of this meeting as soon as possible.
