    President Trump's re-election campaign today issued the following statement regarding news that a former FBI official will plead guilty to falsifying a document used to obtain permission to spy on the Trump campaign in 2016:
"In 2016, the Obama-Biden Administration weaponized the FBI and Department of Justice against their political opponent, then-candidate Donald Trump. In 2017, they undermined the peaceful transition of power. In 2018, their allies in the deep state and the media continued to push the Russia Collusion Hoax. They did this despite knowing that the Steele Dossier – bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party – was entirely fabricated, discredited, and full of Russian disinformation. Together, these abuses of power represent the greatest political crime in American history. Everyone involved in this plot to hurt our country must be held accountable for their corruption and perverting our democratic institutions – especially Joe Biden. It's a good step in the right direction that an FBI official and key member of Robert Mueller's team of angry Democrats is pleading guilty to doctoring evidence to further the illegal spying operation against President Trump."
