The Administration opposes H.R. 3391. Requiring EPA to provide 85 percent of Federal funds appropriated to the leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund to the States will likely impair the efficiency of the Federal program. Allowing States to use Federal Trust Fund monies for State underground storage tank assurance funds:
— could divert funds from State technical programs that ensure that cleanups occur in a timely fashion; and
— could allow the use of Federal funds to reimburse a tank owner or operator where State resources are available.
