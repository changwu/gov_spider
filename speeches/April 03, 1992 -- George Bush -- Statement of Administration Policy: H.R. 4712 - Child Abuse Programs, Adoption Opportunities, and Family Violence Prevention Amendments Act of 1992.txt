    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 4/6/92)(House)(Owens (D) NY)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 4712, but will seek amendments in the Senate to the following two sections of the bill:
—   Section 111, which would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make legislative recommendations to Congress. Such a requirement would contravene the President's exclusive authority under Article II, section 3 of the Constitution to recommend to Congress such measures as he deems necessary and expedient.
—   Section 322, which would require the Secretary of Education to "develop model programs for education of young people about domestic violence and violence among intimate partners." This section seeks to establish a national curriculum on a subject that each community will undoubtedly want to tailor to the needs of its own students.
