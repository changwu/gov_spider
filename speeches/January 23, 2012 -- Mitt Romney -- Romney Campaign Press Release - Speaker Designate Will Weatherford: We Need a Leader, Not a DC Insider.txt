    Florida Speaker Designate Will Weatherford made the following statement on tonight's debate in Tampa:
"Mitt Romney won tonight by proving again that we need a Washington outsider, not another DC insider, as our nominee. Only someone from outside Washington can fix the many problems that were caused by Washington politicians. Mitt Romney will be able to turn around our economy, create jobs, and restore fiscal health because he was able to do it as a businessman and as a governor. Floridians have felt firsthand the negative effects of President Obama's policies â€” only Mitt Romney has the contrasting record to defeat President Obama and bring positive change to our state."
