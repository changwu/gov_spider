    New Mexico Secretary of Economic Development Jon Barela made the following statement on the Supreme Court decision on President Obama's healthcare law:
"Today's Supreme Court decision to uphold President Obama's abominable healthcare law means a future of rising taxes and stagnating economic growth for the state of New Mexico. It means more burdensome regulations and mandates will infringe on the ability of New Mexico businesses to grow and create jobs. Governor Romney has repeated time and time again that no matter what happens in court, the battle to end Obamacare is not over. We need a leader in Washington who understands what it takes to grow the economy, and who won't allow government to strangle private sector job creation like Obamacare will do. Fortunately Governor Romney has pledged to begin the process of repealing and replacing Obamacare on day one of his administration. Governor Romney promises the type of leadership we need in Washington to help New Mexico's residents and businesses prosper and put an end to President Obama's job-killing health care law."
