Script For "Debra" (TV :30) 
DEBRA BARTOSHEVICH: I'm a proud Hillary Clinton Democrat.
She had the experience and judgment to be President.
Now, in a first for me, I'm supporting a Republican, John McCain.
I respect his maverick and independent streak, and now he's the one with the experience and judgment.
A lot of Democrats will vote McCain. It's okay, really! 
JOHN MCCAIN: I'm John McCain and I approved this message.
