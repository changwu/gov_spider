    Florida Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen made the following statement on tonight's third presidential debate:
"Under President Obama's failed leadership, in no part of the world is the United States' influence greater today than when he took office. Mitt Romney's optimistic world view was on clear display tonight, and it contrasted sharply with President Obama's failed record abroad. On the President's watch, our relationships with key allies like Israel have frayed, violence has erupted in the Middle East, and our military strength is at risk. Our country can't afford another four years of his failed leadership, and that's the reason we must elect Mitt Romney as our Commander-in-Chief."
