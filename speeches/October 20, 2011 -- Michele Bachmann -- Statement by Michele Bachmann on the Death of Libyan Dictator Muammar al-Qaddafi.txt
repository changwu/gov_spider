    San Francisco, Calif. â€” Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann issued today the following statement in response to the death of Libyan dictator Muammar al-Qaddafi:
"For more than 40 years, we lived with the Muammar al-Qaddafi regime and the atrocities he orchestrated. The world is a better place without Qaddafi. It is my hope that Qaddafi's reign of terror will be replaced with a government that respects the people of Libya and one that will be a good partner with the United States. Hopefully, today will also bring to an end our military involvement there, something I opposed from its beginning."
