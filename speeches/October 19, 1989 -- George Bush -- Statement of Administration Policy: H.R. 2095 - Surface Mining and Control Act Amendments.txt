    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rahall (D) WV and 14 others)
The Administration supports the reclamation of abandoned mine land, but opposes the enactment of H.R. 2095 because its reauthorizations are premature.
The authorization for collection of fees for the Abandoned Mine Land (AML) program will not expire until the end of FY 1992, and funds will be available for AML reclamation through FY 1995. Moreover, studies are currently underway to develop recommendations for the future of the AML program. Program changes should be postponed until the results of these studies can be assessed.
