    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith to the Senate a report of the Secretary of State, in relation to the necessity of modifying the present system of consular jurisdiction of the United States in the countries of the East. I regard this subject, to which I have adverted in my general message to Congress, as one deserving the earnest attention of the National Legislature.
CHESTER A. ARTHUR
(A similar message was sent to the House of Representatives.)
