    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the District of Columbia Code, as amended, I am transmitting the District of Columbia Courts' FY 2000 Budget request.
The District of Columbia Courts have submitted a FY 2000 Budget request for $131.6 million for its operating expenditures and $17.4 million for courthouse renovation and improvements. My FY 2000 Budget includes recommended funding levels of $128.4 million for operations and $9.0 million for capital improvements for the District Courts. My transmittal of the District of Columbia Courts' budget request does not represent an endorsement of its contents.
I look forward to working with the Congress throughout the FY 2000 appropriation process.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, February 5, 1999.
