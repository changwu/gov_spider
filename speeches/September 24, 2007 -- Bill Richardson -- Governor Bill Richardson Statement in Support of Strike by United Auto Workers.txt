    NEW YORK, NY-- New Mexico Governor and Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Richardson today issued the following statement in support of the United Auto Workers strike against General Motors:
"I am disappointed that it has come to this. But how can we ask American workers to secure our nation's economic future if we do not allow them to secure theirs?
"Things have to change. For too long, workers have held up their end of the bargain while employers and the government have failed to do the same. A fair day's work deserves a fair day's pay, decent benefits, and reasonable job security.
"I hope that this strike will come to a quick resolution that is fair for both sides. As a nation, we have to do better by working families. I have the experience to bring people together and produce real change in this country. As President, I will nominate a union member as my Secretary of Labor and will stand with working Americans."
