    Today, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield released the following statement on Vice President Mike Pence's visit to Wisconsin:
"President Trump admitted he intentionally downplayed the virus and misled the American people, and Wisconsin continues to pay the price -- in lost jobs, lost businesses, and lost lives. Even before the pandemic, Wisconsin manufacturers were struggling and farmers were weathering an erratic trade war. Today, many are barely hanging on.
"It didn't have to be this bad. Joe Biden has a plan to address the pandemic and build our economy back better. Instead of handing out massive tax breaks to giant corporations and the wealthy, he'll invest in workers, support small businesses, and make the promise of 'Made in America' real by cracking down on offshoring and bringing back jobs to Wisconsin. And when Joe Biden is in the White House, Americans can rest assured that he'll always tell the truth -- and that he'll fight for Wisconsin families as hard as he fights for his own."
