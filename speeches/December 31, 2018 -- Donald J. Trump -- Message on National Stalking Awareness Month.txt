    Stalking endangers the safety and well-being of millions of men and women each year. Too often, this serious crime goes unreported and unaddressed, prolonging feelings of helplessness and anxiety experienced by too many Americans.
Stalkers attempt to provoke fear in their victims through repeated and unwanted contact, including explicit and implied threats, following or waiting for the victim, and harassing the victim by misusing social media. These and other threatening actions often cause victims to endure physical and emotional distress. Young women are disproportionately victimized by stalking, but anyone can be affected by it or other forms of harassment. An overwhelming majority of victims are stalked by someone they know, and those recently separated or divorced are the highest at risk.
My administration continues to work with State and local partners to prosecute criminals who violate the privacy and safety of innocent Americans. The Department of Justice, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and others are promoting important strategies that prevent stalking. No one should ever feel unsafe because of unwanted interactions caused by stalkers.
During National Stalking Awareness Month, we stand with survivors, law enforcement professionals, and all who continue to combat this serious crime. Together, we must ensure that those who are dealing with undeserved abuse and manipulation know that they are not alone and that there is help.
