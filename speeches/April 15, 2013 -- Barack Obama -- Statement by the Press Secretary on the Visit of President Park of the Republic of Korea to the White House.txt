    President Obama will welcome President Park Geun-hye of the Republic of Korea to the White House on May 7. As we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the U.S.-ROK alliance this year, President Park's visit will highlight the growth, breadth, depth and strength of our alliance, our increased global cooperation, the deep economic ties between the United States and the Republic of Korea, and the strong bonds of friendship between the American and Korean people.
President Obama and President Park will also discuss a broad range of economic and security issues, including continued cooperation on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and countering the North Korean threat. They will also review the progress made in strengthening our economic ties and in enhancing and modernizing bilateral security cooperation.
President Park's visit underscores the importance of the U.S.-ROK alliance as a linchpin of peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and in the Asia Pacific region, and of the central role of alliances in the President's Asia-Pacific rebalancing effort.
