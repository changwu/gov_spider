    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Reps. Bedell (D) and Leach (R) Iowa, Markey (D) Massachusetts and 195 others)
The Administration is strongly opposed to enactment of H.J. Res. 3 because it has substantive problems with both major recommendations of the resolution: to secure the ratification of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT) and its companion Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty (PNET), and to realize a resumption of negotiations toward a Comprehensive Test Ban (CTB). With respect to the TTBT and PNET, our experience has shown that we cannot effectively verify Soviet compliance with the treaties as they now stand. With respect to a CTB, there are serious verification problems, and national security implications of proceeding now to negotiate a CTB. The United States relies upon nuclear testing to ensure the continued credibility and effectiveness of our deterrent as well as the reliability and safety of the U.S. arsenal.
The Administration strongly supports Congressman Hyde's substitute. The Hyde substitute embodies many of the Administration's long-term policies concerning arms control and national security and permits us to pursue our fundamental arms control objective, deep and verifiable reductions in nuclear arms and reductions of the risk of nuclear war, in the responsible manner which we now have underway in our negotiations and dialogue with the Soviet Union.
The reasons for the Administration's opposition to H.J. Res. 3 are more fully set forth in Secretary Shultz's letter to Rep.
