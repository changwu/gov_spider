    Today Americans across the country were proud to hear the news that Los Angeles will host the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2028, known as L.A. 2028. For the first time in a generation, the Olympics are coming back to the United States, and I am proud to support L.A. 2028. I want to congratulate the United States Olympic Committee and the entire bid team for developing a plan that will ensure L.A. 2028 demonstrates the best in American creativity, innovation, and hospitality.
The United States has a remarkable history of passionate and loyal support for the Olympic movement. No country has won more Olympic medals or trained more Olympic and Paralympic athletes. America always shines brightly during the Games, and L.A. 2028 will be no exception.
The Olympic and Paralympic Games are one of the world's greatest celebrations of humanity, and they hold a special place in the hearts of all Americans. Every 2 years, we unite behind the remarkable athletes of Team U.S.A. who represent our Nation's talent, drive, and our unwavering will to win. Their triumphs inspire our own pursuit of the American dream.
I am confident that the Summer Games in Los Angeles will exemplify both the Olympic ideal and the American spirit, and we look forward to hosting them.
