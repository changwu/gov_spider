    Walk through this South Carolina based high tech company with Jeb as he tours the facility and meets the employees. Like many businesses in this country, Nephron is worried about the future of our country. Despite having world-class products, Nephron is still seeking its permit from the FDA to be able to move forward with commercializing its products. It's frustrating to see how slow our government is working when so many high wage jobs are at stake. Hopefully, this business will get their permit and enjoy continued success, a benefit to their current and potential future employees.
