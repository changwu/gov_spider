    Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
In keeping with tradition, I am proclaiming the week of May 14 as Small Business Week. During this period, it will be important to focus public attention on the vital role played in our economic and social life by small firms and the people who own and run them.
To insure that the activities of this Administration contribute a frill measure to the small business concept, I would like to see participation by the maximum number of agencies. Specifically, I propose that you review the actions which you take that affect small business, including minority-owned business. These actions may be regulatory in nature or may be confined to purchasing, but it is important to insure that they contribute to the preservation of small concerns. In purchasing and other programs through which Federal funds are injected directly into our economic systems, I would hope that you meet or exceed established goals and adopt affirmative steps to insure that small business participants receive the largest share feasible.
It would be especially appropriate for the announcement of such actions to take place during Small Business Week.
