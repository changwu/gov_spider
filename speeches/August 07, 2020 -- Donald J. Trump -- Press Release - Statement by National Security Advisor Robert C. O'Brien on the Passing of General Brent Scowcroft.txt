    National Security Council
We are all deeply saddened by the passing of Lieutenant General Brent Scowcroft, one of the most distinguished individuals to serve as Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.
As National Security Advisor for President Gerald Ford and for President George H.W. Bush, General Scowcroft set the standard for effective leadership and defined the modern role of the NSA, acting as an "honest broker" by moving to the President's desk well-vetted and thoroughly debated policy options and advice for his consideration.
I admired General Scowcroft long before I came to hold this office, and my appreciation for his skill, dignity, and wisdom has only grown in the time I have been privileged to serve as National Security Advisor to President Trump. My goal since taking office has been to follow the "Scowcroft Model" for President Trump's NSC.
Our thoughts and prayers are with the General and his family as we celebrate his life and many years of service to our country.
