    The President today requested that CIA Director William Webster remain in his position for 1 month beyond his scheduled retirement on July 31. Director Webster graciously consented to the President's request. The Director's immediate response underscores the lifelong dedication to public service that has marked his career. The President appreciates this commitment and the Director's willingness to change his personal plans. The President requested the extension because of the announced delay in the confirmation hearings for Robert M. Gates.
