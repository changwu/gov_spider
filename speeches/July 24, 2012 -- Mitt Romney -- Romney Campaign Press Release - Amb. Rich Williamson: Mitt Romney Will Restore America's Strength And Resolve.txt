    Former U.S. Ambassador, and former Reagan Administration official, Rich Williamson today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's speech to the VFW:
"Many today believe that American decline is an inevitable fate that must be managed, not prevented.Â  They fail to recognize that a strong America is the best ally world peace and prosperity has ever known. As Mitt Romney powerfully argued in his speech to the VFW, we need to restore American strength and resolve in order to maintain the peace, protect our interests, and preserve our ideals. When it comes to foreign and defense policy, the choice between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney could not be starker. It is nothing less than a choice between American decline and another American Century. Mitt Romney is committed to defending America. He would never allow his subordinates to leak top-secret information, as Sen. Dianne Feinstein now says the Obama White House has been doing."
