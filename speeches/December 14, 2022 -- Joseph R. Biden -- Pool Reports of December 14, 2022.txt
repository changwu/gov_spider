Noted at the top that Morocco was the first African nation to reach the World Cup semi-finals. The game was set to kick-off at 2 p.m. EST.
"We can't solve any of these challenges without African leadership at the table, and I'm not trying to be nice. That's a fact."
"The United States is all in on Africa's future."
"Together we want to build a future where no one, no one, is left behind."
Announced a new memorandum of understanding opening new trade opportunities between the US and Africa, and infrastructure investments he said would encourage trade within Africa and help its energy economy transition to clean energy sources. Also announced investments to help Africa "participate in a digital economy."
"Improving Africa's infrastructure is essential to our vision of building a stronger global economy that can better withstand the kinds of shocks that we've seen the past few years."

in-town pool report #6 holding at convention center
Pool is currently holding in the motorcade in the convention center, awaiting Biden.
After the speech, the pool was quickly escorted out of room where the president spoke — though not before a big TV behind the main stage flipped to the France-Morocco match.
Pool was eventually taken back to the motorcade, though on a different route than POTUS. I've asked what the president did after the speech, and whether he spoke to anybody or watched the soccer game, and will report back if answered.

In-town pool report #11 gathering for toasts
Pool is gathering at the WH Palm Doors to observe the evening's toasts, as part of tonight's dinner with African leaders. The president, first lady, vice president, and second gentleman are all expected to attend.
The toasts are one of two looks inside tonight's dinner expected by your pooler.
A little color: Marines lined the driveway in the White House's North Lawn, presenting arms each time a car drove by on its way to the North Portico. Pool could not count how many marines were present from our available vantage point, but in the 6 o'clock hour, a long, slow procession of cars was visible.
On a separate note: The White House is illuminated green tonight, in observance of the 10-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting
The White House passes this along about the green illumination:
"We are lighting the White House green to provide a visual symbol of each of the 26 lives lost, their families, and the survivors. All of the families honor their loved ones in unique ways, including through different symbols and colors – and green is the color many of the families who lost loved ones in the Sandy Hook shooting used in ribbons and memorials in the early days after the shooting."

Pool was escorted into the East Room for the night's toasts at 7:10.
Two long tables, decorated by candles and flowers, were arranged in the East Room for the occasion. When most of the guests had taken their seats, the president walked to the front of the room and began his toast behind a lectern.
Biden noted that the theme this year's decorations at the White House was, "we the people."
"Our people lie at the heart of the deep and profound connection that forever binds Africa and the United States together. We remember the stolen men and women and children were brought to our shores and chains subjected to unimaginable cruelty."
"My nation's original sin was that period."
Mentioned that former president Barack Obama first convened a US-Africa summit during his presidency
"So please join me in raising your glass, if I can find one. Raise your glass to the people of America, to the people of the United States, to the people of Africa, and to the promise and potential of our partnership here."

CHEF MASHAMA BAILEYNamed "the most important chef in America" by the Financial Times, Mashama Bailey is the award-winning executive chef and co-founder of the critically acclaimed The Grey and its all-day counterpart The Grey Market in Savannah, Georgia. Along with her co-founder and business partner Johno Morisano, their Grey Spaces hospitality group opened two new restaurants in 2022: the Diner Bar and The Grey Market in Austin, which was lauded by The Austin American-Statesman and Austin Monthly Magazine as one of the city's Best New Restaurants, for its distinct take on Port City Southern fare.
Born in the Bronx and raised in Queens with maternal roots in Georgia, Mashama attended grammar school in Savannah. She first learned to cook at the hands of the women in her family and her formal education includes the Institute of Culinary Education (ICE) in New York City as well as LaVarenne in Burgundy, France. Prior to opening The Grey, Mashama's career includes a dozen years cooking throughout New York City, the last four of which were at Prune on Manhattan's Lower East Side under the tutelage of Gabrielle Hamilton. In 2019 and with the premier of Netflix's Chef's Table Season 6, Mashama became the first African American chef to star on the show. In 2022, her story was featured on the TODAY show as part of a series on inspiring women alongside the likes of Michelle Obama.
Together with Morisano, Mashama co-wrote Black, White and The Grey (Ten Speed Press/Penguin Random House) which explores the business partners' challenges navigating race, class and culture while building businesses, relationships, and community in the South, as featured on CBS Sunday Morning.
Winner of the 2022 James Beard Outstanding Chef -- the first Black woman to receive the honor -- and winner of the 2019 James Beard Best Chef: Southeast, Mashama serves as the chairwoman of the Edna Lewis Foundation, whose mission is to honor and extend the legacy of Edna Lewis by creating opportunities for African Americans in the fields of cooking, agriculture, food studies, and storytelling.

In-town pool report #15 fuller Biden/Sall transcript
Here's a fuller transcript of what President Biden said during his toast. Please check all quotes against the official transcript:
The president welcomed everyone in attendance before discussing what the theme of this year's White House holiday decorations was.
"And the theme this year was, 'We the people.' These are the first words of our Constitution, and the very idea of America. And they're the leading words of many of your constitutions."
The phrase "reminds us that our country's greatest strength lies in just that, our people."
"Our people lie at the heart of the deep and profound connection that forever binds Africa and the United States together. We remember the stolen men and women and children who were brought to our shores in chains, subjected to unimaginable cruelty. My nation's Original Sin was that period."
"We honor their descendants, who ... for generations have helped build this country and propel it to higher heights, leading the charge, blazing new trails and forging a better future for everyone in America."
The president cited the "African diaspora community" in the country, one that includes his "former boss," Barack Obama. He said Obama convened the first U.S.-Africa summit, before saying that a country's people "inspire" its leaders.
"They tell us hard truths that we need to hear. And sometimes we have trouble listening. They challenge us to live up to the values enshrined in so many of our founding documents and to be worthy of the responsibility given to us by that sacred trust, we the people."
Biden said he has "never been more optimistic" about the shared future between Africa and the United States.
"So please join me in raising your glass, if I can find one. Raise your glass to the people of America, to the people of the United States, to the people of Africa, and to the promise and potential of our partnership here."
Biden then introduced Senagalese President Macky Sall, who is also chairperson of the African Union. He thanked Biden for the work he and his administration had put into the summit.
"We want to advance our common agenda with you and take our partnership to the next level in an inclusive approach, bringing together governments, the private sector, civil society and the African diaspora. We have been walking in this direction since our arrival to Washington, D.C., and we are confident that our summit will produce results that reflects our shared commitment."
Sall then toasted President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden.

After a delay, pool was led into the State Dining Room at 8:48 for our glimpse into the night's entertainment.
Gladys Knight was introduced two minutes later, entering the room to applause. The president and First Lady sat in the front row, where the legendary singer gave the couple a little wave.
Knight sang The Best Thing That Ever Happened. Pool could not judge the president's reaction, as he was facing away from our location.
Pool was escorted out after the song even as the performance continued at 8:54.
