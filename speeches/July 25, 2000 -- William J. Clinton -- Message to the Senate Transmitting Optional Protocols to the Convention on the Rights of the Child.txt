    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith two optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, both of which were adopted at New York, May 25, 2000: (1) The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict; and (2) The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. I signed both Protocols on July 5, 2000.
In addition, I transmit for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to both Protocols, including article-by-article analyses of each Protocol. As detailed in the Department of State report, a number of understandings and declarations are recommended.
These Protocols represent a true breakthrough for the children of the world. Ratification of these Protocols will enhance the ability of the United States to provide global leadership in the effort to eliminate abuses against children with respect to armed conflict and sexual exploitation.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to both Protocols and give its advice and consent to the ratification of both Protocols, subject to the understandings and declarations recommended in the Department of State Report.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
