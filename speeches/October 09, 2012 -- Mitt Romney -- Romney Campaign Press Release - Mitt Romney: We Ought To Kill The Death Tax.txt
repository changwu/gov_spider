MITT ROMNEY: "The President has this idea that he wants to raise the tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent. And that won't be good for farms. My own view is I want to take that tax rate down. I want to take it from 35 percent to 28 percent and help American farmers and small business. And, you know, he has a plan for the death tax. He's planning on raising the death tax pretty significantly. My own view is we ought to kill the death tax. You paid for that farm once. You shouldn't have to pay for it again."
