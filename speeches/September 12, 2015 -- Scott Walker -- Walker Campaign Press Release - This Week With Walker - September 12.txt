    Here's a few things you might have missed during the week
For many, Labor Day weekend is filled with barbeques, last trips to the beach, and resting up before the new school year starts. Governor Walker, took to the New Hampshire back-roads with a Harley Road King to tour all ten counties in the Granite State talking to voters and sharing his plan to wreak havoc on Washington.

Governor Walker seemed to be taking it from all sides this week; first President Obama then Hillary Clinton, who traveled all the way to Wisconsin to rally opposition against Walker's commonsense principles. As you're already well aware, Governor Walker doesn't back down from a fight.
On Monday, he issued a scathing rebuke of the President's love of big government labor bosses.

  .@BarackObama is worried because I don't just talk, I get things done. If I can do it in blue state, I can do it in Washington -SW — Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) September 8, 2015


  It's clear @BarackObama stands with big government union bosses. Gov. Walker stands with the working class: http://t.co/nuBYDsHFlq — Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) September 8, 2015

Then on Thursday, while campaigning in Milwaukee, Hillary attacked Governor Walker for protecting life after 5 months, defunding Planned Parenthood and for riding a Harley. Her last attack was most interesting since she hasn't driven a car since 1996! But she has charged taxpayers hundreds of thousands to charter private jets around the country.

  .@HillaryClinton your affinity for flying private jets on taxpayers dime is well known. I for one prefer this ride-SW pic.twitter.com/F9wQKxmQE3 — Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) September 10, 2015

On Thursday, Governor Walker traveled to President Reagan's alma mater to lay out his Day One Plan to reform Washington. At Eureka College, he delivered a series of promises to reform Washington on his first day in office. Governor Walker has been tested like no other candidate in the race and is committed to getting the job done.

  Reagan once said that we needed to drain the swamp in Washington. Since he left the swamp has filled back up. It's time to drain again. -SW — Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) September 10, 2015
