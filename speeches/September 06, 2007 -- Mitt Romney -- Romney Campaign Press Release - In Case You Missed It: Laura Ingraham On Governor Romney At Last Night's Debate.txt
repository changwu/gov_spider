    "The Laura Ingraham Show"
September 6, 2007
GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY (RECORDING): "... could lead to the violent death of Americans. We need to know about that, track them, follow them and make sure that in every way we can we know what they're doing and where they're doing it. And if it means we have to go into a mosque to wiretap or a church then that's exactly where we're going to go. Because we're going to do whatever it takes to protect the American people. And I hear from time to time people say 'Hey, wait a second. We have civil liberties we have to worry about.' But don't forget, the most important civil liberty I expect from my government is my right to be kept alive."
LAURA INGRAHAM: "I thought that was the best moment of the night for Romney. No doubt about it. Without security or safety the whole debate about civil liberties is much ado about nothing. Okay? Simple as that. If we have to into a mosque, we'll go into a mosque. If we have to go into a prison where they're converting people to Islam we're going to go into the prison. If we have to into Starbucks in Northern Virginia where we apparently have a corridor of suspicious activity then we'll go into the Starbucks. If we have to into the 7-11 parking lot we'll go there too. If we have to hit the day laborer centers where illegal aliens hang out we'll go there. That's what people want to hear in this country. They want to hear about how we can keep this country safe and what measures are you going to take to do it."
