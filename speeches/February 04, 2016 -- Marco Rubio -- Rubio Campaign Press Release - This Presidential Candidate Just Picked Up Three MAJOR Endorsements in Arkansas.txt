Team Marco is Growing: Chip in $17
Former Congressman Tim Griffin is now a conservative champion as Lieutenant Governor of the state. Here's why he's backing Marco:
Marco Rubio is the Republican presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Democrats are most scared to run against because his energy, enthusiasm and positive conservative vision for a stronger America contrasts with the Democrats tired, old ideas.
Rep. Steve Womack, who represents Arkansas' Third District and previously served as mayor of Rogers, praised Marco's conservatism:
"With Marco Rubio, we are getting an unabashed conservative that can win a general election and find new solutions to the lingering challenges facing our country.
Rep. Rick Crawford, an Army veteran who represents the First District, cited the debt crisis as a big reason he's backing Marco:
Marco has the ability to unite and expand our party, and also will be able to defeat whomever the Democrats nominate this fall. I'm proud to throw my support behind his candidacy and will be working hard for him in Arkansas and across the country on issues like our debt crisis where we face over $19 trillion in debt and growing. 
These three conservative leaders are going to be a big part of Marco's efforts ahead of Arkansas' March 1st primary. Welcome to Team Marco!
