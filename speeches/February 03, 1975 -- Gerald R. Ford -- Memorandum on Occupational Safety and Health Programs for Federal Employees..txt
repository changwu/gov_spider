    Memorandum to the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
I have issued this Executive Order [11807 of September 28, 1974] to strengthen the occupational safety and health programs of all Federal agencies. It sets forth specific duties for the heads of Federal agencies to establish and maintain effective occupational safety and health programs in these agencies. It also authorizes the Secretary of Labor to assist in those duties and to issue guidelines tailored to individual agency needs.
As the Nation's largest employer, the Federal Government must set an example in the maintenance of safe and healthful working conditions for its employees. The Federal Government has reduced the rate of workplace injuries since 1965, but we cannot be satisfied as long as any avoidable accidents or illnesses occur.
The purpose of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 is to assure safe and healthful working conditions for all workers in the Nation. That Act contains special provisions to afford protection to Federal employees. It assigns responsibility to the head of each Federal agency to maintain an effective and comprehensive program consistent with the standards issued by the Secretary of Labor for private employees.
The issuance of this Executive Order and the attached guidelines of the Secretary of Labor, together with forthcoming actions by the Office of Management and Budget to promote agency awareness of the budgetary aspects of this program, should aid in your efforts to provide safe and healthful working conditions for the employees of your department or agency. Only your personal attention can ultimately achieve the goals we desire. The Secretary of Labor stands ready to assist you in your efforts. I look forward to receiving the evaluations of the Secretary of Labor regarding your achievements under the new Executive Order and the guidelines issued by the Secretary.
