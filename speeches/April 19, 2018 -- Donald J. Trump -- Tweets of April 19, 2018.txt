Thank you San Diego County for defending the rule of law and supporting our lawsuit against California's illegal and unconstitutional 'Sanctuary' policies. California's dangerous policies release violent criminals back into our communities putting all Americans at risk.Retweets: 20044Favorites: 86533

Governor Jerry Brown announced he will deploy 'up to 400 National Guard Troops' to do nothing. The crime rate in California is high enough and the Federal Government will not be paying for Governor Brown's charade. We need border security and action not words!Retweets: 20309Favorites: 84456

Democrats are obstructing good (hopefully great) people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our Government hence the American People. They are 'slow walking' all of my nominations - hundreds of people. At this rate it would take 9 years for all approvals!Retweets: 26579Favorites: 96971

...Hopefully the Senate will not leave Washington until our Ambassadors Judges and the people who make Washington work are approved. The Democrats are Obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our Country!Retweets: 19050Favorites: 73600

Mike Pompeo is outstanding. First in his class at West Point. A top student at Harvard Law School. A success at whatever he has done. We need the Senate to approve Mike ASAP. He will be a great Secretary of State!Retweets: 22576Favorites: 91256

Sanctuary Cities released at least 142 Gang Members across the United States making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed. We are doing a great job of law enforcement but things such as this make safety in America difficult!Retweets: 20391Favorites: 74265

James Comey just threw Andrew McCabe 'under the bus.' Inspector General's Report on McCabe is a disaster for both of them! Getting a little (lot) of their own medicine?Retweets: 21804Favorites: 85311
