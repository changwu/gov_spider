The Vice President emphasized the United States' strong support for Croatia's European Union candidacy.

Vice President Biden underscored our close partnership with Croatia, noted the one-year anniversary of Croatia's accession to NATO, and expressed appreciation for Croatia's contributions to NATO operations, particularly in Afghanistan. The Vice President acknowledged Croatia's efforts to foster stability and good relations within Southeast Europe, and commended the Prime Minister for reaching a solution on the long-standing border dispute with Slovenia through an arbitration agreement. The Vice President also lauded the Croatian government's efforts to develop a closer bilateral relationship with Serbia, to support the Republic of Kosovo, and to assist efforts by the international community to advance reform and improve the functionality of the Bosnian state.
