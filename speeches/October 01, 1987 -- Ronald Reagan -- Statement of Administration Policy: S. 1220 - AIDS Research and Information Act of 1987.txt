    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Kennedy (D) Massachusetts and 20 others)
The administration shares the concerns of the Labor and Human Resources Committee regarding AIDS as a major national and international health problem. We agree with the need for forceful measures to ensure that every effort is made to educate the public and to prevent, treat, and find a cure for this dread disease.
However, the administration disagrees that major, new legislation is needed to accomplish these ends. The administration firmly believes that current authorities give broad managerial discretion to Federal scientists, thereby assuring high quality AIDS research, education, and health services demonstrations. Indeed, the United States Public Health Service alone spent an estimated $494 million in fiscal year 1987, in one of the most intensive and significant disease-related Federal programs in the Nation's history.
In summary, although the administration acknowledges the bipartisan Senate effort to address the tremendous problem that AIDS presents, we believe the new authorities in S. 1220 are unnecessary.
