    Yesterday, First Lady Melania Trump welcomed children from her United States Secret Service detail to spend an afternoon bowling inside the newly renovated bowling alley at the White House.
The White House Bowling Alley, located in the Residence, was first installed in 1973 during the Nixon Administration. Since it's installation, many presidents and first families have enjoyed use of the bowling alley. The original 1973 design lasted until 1994 under the Clinton Administration, which oversaw the last major renovation. Since then, various odds and ends have been refreshed over time. In an effort to preserve this piece of history and family fun, Mrs. Trump oversaw restoration of the original wooden lane, and the bowling alley itself underwent a full renovation with updated electrical wiring, new mechanics, and a fresh interior.
Funding for the renovation was generously provided by the Bowling Proprietors' Association of America.
