    WASHINGTON, D.C. - Earlier today, U.S. Senator and Republican Presidential candidate Rand Paul introduced the Stop Extremists Coming Under Refugee Entry Act (SECURE Act) as an amendment to H.R. 3761. This legislation is based off language first proposed by Sen. Paul in 2013. Sen. Paul introduced S.2329, the SECURE Act, as a stand-alone bill earlier this year.
The purpose of the SECURE Act is to suspend the U.S. visa program for countries that pose a high-risk. The legislation also enhances screenings for high-risk refugees and imposes a waiting period for background checks on visa issuance from other countries.
"I believe that securing our border and monitoring who enters and exits our country is pertinent to protecting the homeland. As president, I will do everything I can to guard America and the ideals upon which our nation was founded," Sen. Paul said.
