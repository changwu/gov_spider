    Today, Second Lady Karen Pence visited military spouse and veteran owned Grey Ghost Bakery in Charleston, South Carolina. Mrs. Pence was first met by owners Katherine Frankstone and her husband Manning, who is a Vietnam veteran. The couple gave a tour of the bakery's production and shipping areas. Following the tour, Mrs. Pence participated in a tasting of the bakery's cookies.
In conclusion of the visit, Mrs. Pence participated in a discussion with Katherine, Manning, and the Small Business Administration's (SBA) South Carolina District Director, R. Gregg White. Gregg shared information on the SBA's connection to the business and the work the SBA does in South Carolina with business owners, including military spouses, veterans, and those impacted by the pandemic. The couple also shared details about the bakery's history, the family's military ties, and the impact the COVID-19 outbreak has had on the business.
Katherine and Manning worked with the SBA to help start their business and participated in a SBA SCORE workshop. They worked with the SBA this year on new temporary programs established through the CARES Act, and the business received Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) loans.
