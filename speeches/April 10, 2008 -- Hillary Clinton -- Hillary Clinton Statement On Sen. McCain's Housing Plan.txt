    Senator McCain is apparently of two minds on the housing crisis and neither seems to know how to steward the economy effectively. Just two weeks ago, Senator McCain said he'd rather do nothing than something about the housing crisis and attacked my plan with tired right-wing talking points.
Today, it looks like he's proposing a warmed over, half-hearted version of the very plan he criticized, to help families restructure mortgages to save homes and keep housing prices from falling further. Apparently, Senator McCain got the message: letting the phone simply ring and ring is not the way to respond to economic crises. So now he's changed positions and is finally responding to a housing crisis that has been going on for months, but unfortunately his actions are only half-measures.
This is all part of a pattern.
Senator McCain admitted not knowing enough about economics. He can't keep his own position on Social Security straight. And now he's shown himself to be dangerously inconsistent on addressing our nation's housing crisis.
For eight years, we've had a President who didn't know enough or care enough to do enough on behalf of the middle class. With a credit crisis, a home mortgage crisis, and an economy facing a potentially deep and painful recession, we can't afford four more years of more of the same.
At a time of economic crisis and uncertainty, Americans need a President with a steady hand and steady positions, not someone whose economic positions are as unpredictable as our troubled economy itself.
