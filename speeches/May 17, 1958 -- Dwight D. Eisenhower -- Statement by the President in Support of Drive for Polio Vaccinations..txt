    I AM HAPPY to join with millions of other Americans in supporting the drive for polio vaccinations this spring.
Now that there is plenty of Salk vaccine, everyone can receive some protection before the polio season starts. Not to do so is to take unnecessary risks of lifetime disability and even death. I especially appeal to parents to take advantage of this great research discovery to protect themselves and their children against this dread disease.
The national campaign being conducted by the Advertising Council, under the sponsorship of the American Medical Association, the National foundation for Infantile Paralysis, and the Department of Health, Education and Welfare has my hearty endorsement. I know this campaign will help the physicians, health officials and community leaders who are now mobilizing local drives and clinics.
The goal of these drives is a polio-protected Nation. If that goal is reached, 1958 can be the first year in which we cease to count by the thousands the new cripples caused by polio.
