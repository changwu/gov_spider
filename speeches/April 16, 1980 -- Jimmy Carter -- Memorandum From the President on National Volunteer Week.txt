    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesSubject: National Volunteer Week
Because of the deep commitment to voluntary action that Mrs. Carter and I share, I am pleased to join in the observance of National Volunteer Week, April 20-26, 1980.
In order to meet the serious economic and social challenges that our country faces today, citizens and communities must take more responsibility for themselves and for each other. This effort requires the help of the millions of volunteers and volunteer organizations across this nation.
Voluntary citizen action is one of the cornerstones of our democracy. Americans have always been willing to lend their talents and energies to assist their communities, their nation, and the world. They have volunteered as individuals, they have volunteered through religious and community organizations, and they have volunteered by the tens of thousands through the government programs administered by ACTION. There is no area of American life—health care, education, the law, housing, religion, the arts, civil and human rights—that has not been strengthened by citizens willing to donate their time and energy to the benefit of others.
I urge every Federal agency to participate in National Volunteer Week with activities that salute and promote volunteerism and self-help. I know that many Federal employees already do volunteer work in their communities. I encourage you to highlight their achievements with appropriate recognition, and to encourage others to follow their example.
Participation in National Volunteer Week will once again affirm our belief that citizen involvement in all aspects of our national life is essential to the health and well-being of the democracy we live in.
JIMMY CARTER
