Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) announced today that he has received the endorsement of two influential New Hampshire social conservative leaders - George Fellendorf and Ellen Kolb.
George Fellendorf of Keene has been an institution in New Hampshire politics for over two decades. A former political appointee of both President Ronald Reagan and President George W. Bush, Fellendorf is a former Chairman of the New Hampshire Christian Coalition. Ever active in his community, Fellendorf has also served as Chairman of the Keene Taxpayers Association, a member of the New Hampshire Republican Committee on School Reform, and a columnist with the Keene Sentinel.
Ellen Kolb of Merrimack is a 30 year veteran of New Hampshire politics and the social conservative movement, and she currently serves as the Legislative Policy Director of Cornerstone - New Hampshire's preeminent pro-life and pro-family organization. In addition to 25 years of work with various public policy organizations to advance the New Hampshire pro-life movement, Kolb served on the campaign staff of 2010 New Hampshire gubernatorial nominee John Stephen.
"I am honored to have the endorsement of both George and Ellen," said Senator Santorum. "They have both been influential and active in not just conservative circles, but throughout their long careers of public service. Their desire to join the fight for the preservation of our founding values is a great boon to our campaign as we build the infrastructure necessary for victory next February."
