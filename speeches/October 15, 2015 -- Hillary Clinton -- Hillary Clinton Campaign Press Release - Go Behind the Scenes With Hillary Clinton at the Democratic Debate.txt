If you tuned into last night's presidential debate, you saw Hillary at her best: a rock-star debater who fights for what she believes. But there's a lot that goes on behind the scenes at these debates that people never see—before the candidates take the stage and after.
As the official Hillary for America photographer, I capture these moments as they happen. And I wanted to give you the same chance to be a fly on the wall for a whirlwind 24 hours in Las Vegas—during the biggest night of the Democratic race so far.
