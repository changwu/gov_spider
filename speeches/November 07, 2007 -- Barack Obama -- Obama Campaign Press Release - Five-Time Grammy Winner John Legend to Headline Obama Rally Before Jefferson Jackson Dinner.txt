Des Moines, IA -- The Obama Campaign's rally before the Jefferson Jackson Dinner will be held at Hy-Vee Hall C in Downtown Des Moines. Five-time Grammy award winning singer-songwriter John Legend will headline a rally of Obama supporters in Des Moines before the annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner on November 10th. A platinum selling R&B artist, Legend announced earlier this year that he was backing the Illinois Senator's campaign for president.
"I'm proud to support Senator Obama for President," said Legend. "I respect his integrity and trust his judgment. I agree with his stances on the major issues, particularly his principled stand to oppose the administration's ill-advised decision to invade Iraq, even when this was not a popular position. I believe he will be the man to restore our pride in this country. He is the kind of leader we need in these trying times."
Legend will perform at the rally on Saturday, November 10th at Hy-Vee Hall C in downtown Des Moines. Obama and his wife Michelle will also address the crowd at the rally, which is free and open to the public. Doors will open at 3:00 PM.
