    The President is announcing two new federal judicial nominees, both of whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution.
This is President Biden's twentieth round of nominees for federal judicial positions and his seventh slate of nominations in 2022, bringing the number of announced federal judicial nominees to 107.
President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal bench, which is why he continues to move rapidly to fill judicial vacancies. And he has won confirmation of the most lower court judges for the first year of a presidency since the Kennedy Administration.
