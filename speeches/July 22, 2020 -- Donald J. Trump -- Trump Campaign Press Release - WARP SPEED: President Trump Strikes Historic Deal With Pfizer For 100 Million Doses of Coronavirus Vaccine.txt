    The Trump Administration plans to provide the vaccine to Americans for free. 
In the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, President Trump took swift action to make sure coronavirus testing was free for every American who wanted one. Then, President Trump launched Operation Warp Speed to guarantee that the American people are first in line for a safe, effective coronavirus vaccine – at no cost – as soon as one is developed.
The Trump Administration just announced a historic deal with Pfizer to secure 100 million doses of a vaccine – with nearly half a billion more to potentially follow – as soon as it is successfully approved and manufactured. According to the agreement, Pfizer will begin delivering the doses, which would be made available to the American people at no cost, to locations at the Trump Administration's direction.
Out of five vaccines that the U.S. has invested in as part of Operation Warp Speed, three have already shown promising results. Thanks to President Trump's leadership, the U.S. now has a portfolio of vaccines that will help the U.S. meet its goal of delivering 300 million doses of a safe, effective, and authorized vaccine by the end of the year, including successful trials from AstraZeneca and Moderna.
President Trump is keeping his promise to develop a vaccine at record speed, and is prepared to mobilize and mass distribute the vaccine to the American people at no cost as soon as its ready.
