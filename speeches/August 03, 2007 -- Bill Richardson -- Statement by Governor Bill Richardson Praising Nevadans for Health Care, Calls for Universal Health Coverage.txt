    Richardson proud that his plan meets SEIU standards
SANTA FE, NM -- Governor Bill Richardson issued the following statement today in response to the visits of SEIU's Nevadans for Health Care to his offices in Las Vegas and Reno:
"Our next President must provide Americans with the quality health coverage they deserve.
"I want to thank SEIU and Nevadans for Health Care for their tireless work on this vital issue. I am proud that my plan meets their strict standards.
"I am also proud to have participated in the SEIU "Walk a Day in My Shoes" program. It is so important for our leaders to experience the quality and character of our nation's great union members firsthand.
"Providing quality health coverage to every American is a goal that can't wait. In New Mexico, we've dramatically increased access to quality health coverage and provided coverage to every child five and under. By the time I am elected President, we will have implemented a plan to provide coverage to every New Mexican.
"As President, my plan will provide insurance to every American without creating massive new bureaucracies or forcing individuals to buy into a single system. My plan gives Americans the coverage they need and the freedom to choose the plan that works for their families. I look forward to being back in Nevada soon to talk more about the future of health care and the other issues that Nevadans face every day."
