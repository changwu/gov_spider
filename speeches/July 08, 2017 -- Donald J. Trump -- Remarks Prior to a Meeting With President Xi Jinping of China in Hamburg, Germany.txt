President Trump. Well, thank you, Mr. President. And on behalf of the United States, I would like to just say that it's an honor to have gotten to know you. We are developing, and have developed, a wonderful relationship. I appreciate the things that you have done relevant to the very substantial problem that we all face in North Korea, a problem that something has to be done about. And I'm sure that whether it's on trade or whether it's on North Korea or any of the many things that we will be discussing, we will come to a successful conclusion.
Trade is, as you know, very, very big issue for the United States now, because over the years, and it's certainly been over a long period of time, many things have happened that have led to trade imbalances. And we're going to turn that around. And I know that with China in particular, which is a great trading partner, we will be able to do something that will be equitable and reciprocal.
As far as North Korea is concerned, I know they will have, eventually, success. May take longer than I'd like. May take longer than you'd like. But there will be success in the end one way or the other.
I want to thank you very much for inviting us. And again, it's an honor to get to know you and your wife, a really wonderful woman. And it's an honor to have you as a friend.
Thank you very much.
