  A Proclamation

National Community Education Day reminds us that schools and colleges are institutions strongly woven into the fabric of our cities and towns and that they should command the sustained interest of the citizenry. Public education is a community project, and the lifelong mission of education involves everyone in the community.
Many areas do use community resources in education. Parents and other citizens examine their schools and determine how they can contribute to learning. Businesses and industries become aware of what local educational institutions are offering students and consider how they can contribute their own resources and practical skills to enhance learning and provide educational opportunities for learners of all ages and educational backgrounds. Through outreach, receptiveness, and cooperation, our communities can and do become more firmly interwoven with our schools in a commitment to better education for all generations.
The Congress, by Public Law 100-103, has designated November 17, 1987, as "National Community Education Day" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this day.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim November 17, 1987, as National Community Education Day. I invite parents, educators, students, State and local officials, and all Americans to take part in activities that recognize and show appreciation for the role of community resources in education.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twelfth.

RONALD REAGAN
