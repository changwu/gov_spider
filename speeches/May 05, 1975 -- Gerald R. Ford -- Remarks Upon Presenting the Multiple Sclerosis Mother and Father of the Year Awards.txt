    LET ME, on behalf of the White House and all of the American people, give to you, Mrs. Smith and Mr. Flader, these two plaques from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, plaques which recognize your courage and your real strength.
I think you both are a great symbol of what people can do despite difficulties and handicaps. We are all very proud of you, and we all are extending to you the very, very best.
I hope and trust that in the years ahead your example will be one for all to follow.
