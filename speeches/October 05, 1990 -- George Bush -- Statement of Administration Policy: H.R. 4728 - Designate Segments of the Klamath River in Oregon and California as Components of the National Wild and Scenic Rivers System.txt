    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(DeFazio (D) OR and 2 others)
The Administration recognizes that the segments of the Klamath River covered by H.R. 4728 have significant values which may warrant their designation and management as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. However, before such a determination is made, consideration should be given to the following issues:

—  Whether such designation is consistent with the Klamath River Basin Compact (particularly the potential elimination of water needed for agricultural use during water-short years and the impact on the Compact's requirement to meet future demands for agricultural irrigation).
—  The potential economic impact of such designation on the Klamath Falls community.
—  The potential impact of such designation on the northern California and south central Oregon farming areas which are supplied by water through the Bureau of Reclamation's Klamath Project.
—  The elimination of future hydroelectric development options.
—  The potential impact of such designation on the ability to improve water quality in the Upper Klamath River systems, particularly through water storage above Upper Klamath Lake.
—  Whether such designation is inconsistent with Federal power land withdrawals along the Klamath River.
—  The potential impact of such designation on future electric power rates for agricultural customers in the Klamath Basin. 
Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4547 until there has been an opportunity to evaluate fully the issues noted above.
