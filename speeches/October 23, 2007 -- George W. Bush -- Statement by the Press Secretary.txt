    The Senate tonight passed an appropriations bill to fund the Departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services, and other agencies. The legislation spends billions more than what is needed to effectively run these agencies and will make balancing the federal budget more difficult.
In passing this bill, Democrats in Congress will say that the President doesn't care about children or education or health research. We've all heard these tired old lines before. The facts demonstrate the President's strong and consistent commitment to children, education, and health research -- and the American people are smart enough to know that there is no such thing as a free lunch.
The Democratic Congress is reverting to form -- failing to identify priorities, increasing spending, and avoiding the hard choices. If the President is presented with this bill in its current form, he will veto it.
