    DR. WILLIAM T. Pecora, Under Secretary of the Interior, was a remarkable civil servant and an internationally respected figure in the scientific community. His death today is a sad occasion for everyone who has had the pleasure of working with him and benefiting from his enormous contributions to our Government.
Dr. Pecora's expertise as a leading authority in the field of geology proved invaluable to our country from the day he joined the Interior Department in 1939. He built a shining record for 6 years as Director of the U.S. Geological Survey, and then for 2 years as Under Secretary of the Department of the Interior.
Mrs. Nixon and I extend our heartfelt condolences to his family in their bereavement for this fine American.
