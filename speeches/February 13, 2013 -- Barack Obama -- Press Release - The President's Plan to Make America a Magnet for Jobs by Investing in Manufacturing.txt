    President Obama will visit the Linamar factory in Asheville, NC to discuss his plan to grow the economy and make America a magnet for jobs and manufacturing. Linamar has recently expanded its investment here in the U.S. and created new American manufacturing jobs. Linamar produces heavy duty engine and driveline components. In 2011, the company announced that its fourth U.S. manufacturing facility would be at the site of a shuttered Volvo Construction Equipment plant in Asheville. To date the company has hired 160 workers and will hire forty more by the end of the year.
