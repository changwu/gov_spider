    The President announced today that he intends to nominate John D. Holum to be the Director of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
"My administration has placed the highest importance on arms control and combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction," said the President. "A revitalized Arms Control and Disarmament Agency will play an important role in achieving new arms control agreements and fighting weapons proliferation. I can think of no finer and more dedicated person to lead ACDA than John Holum, whom I have known for 20 years and who has close working relationships with many senior officials at the State and Defense Departments, the NSC, and throughout my administration. John will be a strong voice for arms control and nonproliferation policies within the councils of Government."
