    It was with great sadness that Anita and I learned of the passing of legendary Aggie football player John David Crow. As the first Aggie Heisman Trophy winner in 1957, his prowess on the field is well known. But Mr. Crow also symbolized a toughness and perseverance that has long characterized the Aggie Spirit. He loved his university, and he will be missed by a great many Aggie faithful. We pass on our condolences to his wife Carolyn, and his entire family. We have lost a legend. May his memory be preserved for generations to come. God bless John David Crow.
