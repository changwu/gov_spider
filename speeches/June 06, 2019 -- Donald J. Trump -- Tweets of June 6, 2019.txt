'The President has received glowing reviews from the British Media. Here at home not so much. MSNBC Ramps up hateful coverage and promotes conspiracy theories during Trump's trip to Europe.' @seanhannity The good news is that @maddow is dying in the ratings along with @CNN!Retweets: 19126Favorites: 80952

Today we remember those who fell and we honor all who fought here in Normandy. They won back this ground for civilization. To more than 170 Veterans of the Second World War who join us today: You are among the very greatest Americans who will ever live! #DDay75thAnniversary https://t.co/n0uIVHlkRLRetweets: 14692Favorites: 62292
