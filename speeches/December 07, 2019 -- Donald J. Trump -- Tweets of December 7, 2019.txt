Fake News @CNN is reporting that I am 'still using personal cell phone for calls despite repeated security warnings.' This is totally false information and reporting. I haven't had a personal cell phone for years. Only use government approved and issued phones. Retract!Retweets: 35819Favorites: 128713

Why is the World Bank loaning money to China? Can this be possible? China has plenty of money and if they don't they create it. STOP!Retweets: 35283Favorites: 134794

Read the Transcripts! Also see where I say 'us' (our Country) as opposed to 'me' (meaning me) and where I then say that the Attorney General (of the United States) will call you. People still remember Schiff's made up and fraudulent version of my conversation. Witch Hunt!Retweets: 24560Favorites: 100978

Hard to believe but if Nancy Pelosi had put our great Trade Deal with Mexico and Canada USMCA up for a vote long ago our economy would be even better. If she doesn't move quickly it will collapse!Retweets: 21533Favorites: 79383

'Why re-elect Democrats when you know that this is what they are doing with their majority. Their case is not strong because first it was Russian Collusion then it was obstruction then it was Ukraine now their pivoting back to Russia. Why would they be doing that?'

@KimStrassel 'Schiff's surveillance (obtaining phone logs) is an unprecedented abuse of power.' To put it mildly. Also it is illegal!Retweets: 7912Favorites: 17629
