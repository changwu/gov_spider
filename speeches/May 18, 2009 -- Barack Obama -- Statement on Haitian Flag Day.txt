    The United States and Haiti share a deeply intertwined history and a long standing friendship. In 1779, freemen from the French colony of Saint Domingue, now the Republic of Haiti, came to the aid of American patriots fighting for freedom at the Siege of Savannah. Today, we remain connected by a Haitian American community that contributes greatly to the economic, social, cultural, scientific, and academic fabric of the United States and by my administration's steadfast commitment to come to the aid of those in Haiti working to ensure that Haiti's future is stable, sustainable, and prosperous. On this Haitian Flag Day, I am proud to send my warm wishes and those of the American people to the people of Haiti and the Haitian Diaspora as they celebrate during Haitian Heritage Month.
