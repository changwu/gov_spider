    Nancy and I were saddened, as were all Americans, by the recent death of Henry Cabot Lodge. Few men have played a more prominent role in the events of the last 50 years. Senator, soldier, diplomat, and political figure, former Ambassador Lodge served his country long and selflessly. Henry Cabot Lodge was celebrated for his eloquence on behalf of the American cause. At a crisis point in the cold war, he spoke for honesty and human freedom in the United Nations; as a Senator and Vice Presidential candidate, he often inspired his countrymen with words of vision and uplift. Yet perhaps the best measure of his dedication to this nation and the ideals for which it stands was his willingness to forsake high political office to defend his country in time of war. His service in uniform was like that of his public career: long, valorous, dedicated.
Henry Cabot Lodge's sense of personal honor and his devotion to country remain an inspiration to those of us who knew him and will remain so for many generations of Americans to come. Massachusetts has lost a loyal son, and America has lost a distinguished public servant and symbol of America's quest for decency in a tumultuous era. On behalf of all Americans, Nancy and I extend our deepest sympathy to the Lodge family.
