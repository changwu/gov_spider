    The President called President Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria this afternoon to discuss the crisis in Cote d’Ivoire. The President congratulated President Jonathan for Nigeria’s resolute leadership in standing squarely behind the people of Cote d'Ivoire and insisting that the internationally-recognized results of the November 28 election be respected. The President expressed admiration for the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in this regard, and informed President Jonathan about the steps the United States has taken recently, including our imposition of travel sanctions on persons supporting or benefiting from former President Gbagbo's efforts to retain power. The two Presidents agreed to continue consulting on this issue, which is so important to regional stability and democratic governance.
