    The President and the Prime Minister's discussion focused primarily upon the dangerous situation that has arisen as a result of Soviet aggression in Afghanistan, its potential impact on other countries in Southwest Asia, and the implications that it has for independent governments everywhere, whether large or small. There will be further discussions at the official level as a result of the subjects covered by the two leaders.
I might say that the discussions ranged over a fairly wide area, including the Third World, obviously the Indian Ocean and Southwest Asia, the ASEAN nations, energy—those were the primary areas. I think I can say—as Prime Minister Fraser, I believe, has already indicated—that the United States and Australia have a very similar view of the gravity of the situation in Southwest Asia and of the steps which need to be taken to deal with it.
The President told the Prime Minister at the beginning of the meeting that it was—this is a quote—"reassuring to have friends like you in a time of trial and testing." The President also complimented the Prime Minister upon the role of Australia in helping to bring about the Lancaster House discussions which resulted in the agreements in Rhodesia.
