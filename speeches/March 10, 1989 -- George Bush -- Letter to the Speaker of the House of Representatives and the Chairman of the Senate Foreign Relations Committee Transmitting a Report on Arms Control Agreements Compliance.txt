    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
I am pleased to transmit the enclosed report on the adherence of the United States to obligations undertaken in arms control agreements and on problems related to compliance by other nations with the provisions of bilateral and multilateral arms control agreements to which the United States is a party.
This report, updating last year's report, meets the requirements of Section 52 of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act, as amended by the Arms Control and Disarmament Amendments Act of 1987. It was prepared by the Director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Director of Central Intelligence.
In previous reports to the Congress, the United States has made clear its concerns about Soviet noncompliance. These concerns remain. The United States Government takes equally seriously its own commitments to arms control agreements and sets rigid standards and procedures for assuring that it meets its obligations. The United States has been and remains in compliance with all current treaty obligations and political commitments.
This report is unclassified and suitable for general release. However, a classified attachment, providing additional information not available in unclassified form, is being provided under separate cover.
Sincerely,
George Bush
