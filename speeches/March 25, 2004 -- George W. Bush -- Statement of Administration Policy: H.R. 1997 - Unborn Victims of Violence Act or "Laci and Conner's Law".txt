    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Rep. Hart (R) PA and 136 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports protection for unborn children and therefore strongly supports prompt enactment of H.R. 1997. The legislation would make it a separate Federal offense to cause death or bodily injury to a child in utero if that offense was committed in the course of committing any one of 68 Federal offenses. The bill also would make substantially identical amendments to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
The Administration strongly opposes the Feinstein amendment to H.R. 1997, the so-called "One-Victim" Substitute, which would define the bill's crimes as having only one victim - the pregnant woman. In addition, although the Administration supports the goal of protecting domestic violence victims from unfair treatment by employers, the Murray amendment has serious flaws and the Administration strongly opposes it. The amendment would inadvertently create confusing and inconsistent requirements with respect to employment leave, employment discrimination and insurance benefits laws and will lead to unnecessary and costly litigation. A more thorough consideration of this important policy issue would help ensure that any changes to the law are necessary, serve the interests of employees, and avoid placing unnecessary burdens on small businesses.
