    Illinois Congressman Aaron Schock made the following statement on the upcoming Illinois primary:
"Last night, Republican voters across the country sent a strong message that Mitt Romney is the only candidate who can unite our party and defeat Barack Obama in the fall.  Governor Romney has a bold plan to reform our tax code, streamline the federal government, and put this country back on a path to prosperity."
"Perhaps more importantly, he has the record and the experience to back it up.  Four years ago, Barack Obama launched his bid for the Presidency from Illinois.  After a first term fraught with chronic unemployment, record deficits, and a skyrocketing federal budget, it's time to unite behind Mitt Romney and bring Barack Obama back home in November."
