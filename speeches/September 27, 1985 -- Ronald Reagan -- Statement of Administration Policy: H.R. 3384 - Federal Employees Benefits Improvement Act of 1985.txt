    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Oakar (D) Ohio and ten others)
The Administration does not object to House passage of H.R. 3384 because of its essential provision allowing annuitants to receive Federal Employee Health Benefits (PEHB) rebates. However, the Administration will seek amendments in the Senate to remove certain costly and undesirable features.
