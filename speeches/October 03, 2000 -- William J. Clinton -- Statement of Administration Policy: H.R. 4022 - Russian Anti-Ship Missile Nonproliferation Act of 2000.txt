    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rohrabacher (R) California and 24 cosponsors)
The Administration opposes H.R. 4022, which would prohibit any rescheduling of Russian debt owed to the United States unless the President certifies that Russia has terminated all transfers of Moskit anti-ship missiles, particularly to China, or the President waives the prohibition because of national security interests. The Administration shares Congress' concerns about missile proliferation, but does not believe that H.R. 4022 would be effective in accomplishing its aim of dissuading Russian arms sales to China, and is concerned that the bill would be inconsistent with other U.S. goals toward Russia.
The security of the American people is the first priority in our relationship with Russia. The Administration closely monitors Russian arms sales, as well as China's military development, as part of its continuing review of regional stability in the area.
A stable, democratic Russia with a successful market economy will contribute to U.S. national security in many important ways, including reducing the risk of weapons proliferation. Russia's economic stability can best be advanced through a reasonable and considered approach to dealing with Russia's indebtedness.
