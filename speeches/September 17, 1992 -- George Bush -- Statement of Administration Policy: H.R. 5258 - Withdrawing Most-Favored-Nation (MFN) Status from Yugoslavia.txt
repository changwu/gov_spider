    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 9/18/92)(House)(Wolf (R) Virginia and 108 others)
The Administration believes H.R. 5258 is unnecessary because economic sanctions and political and diplomatic measures against Yugoslavia have already been implemented by the United States in cooperation with the international community. Under the United Nations embargo, there is no bilateral trade between the United States and Serbia/Montenegro; removing MFN trade status would have no effect. However, the Administration is sympathetic with the intent of the legislation, and therefore, does not oppose enactment of H.R. 5258.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 5258 could affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB estimates that enactment of this resolution would be revenue neutral. Final scoring of this proposal may deviate from this estimate. If H.R. 5258 is enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within five days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all legislation on direct spending and revenue will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to Congress.
