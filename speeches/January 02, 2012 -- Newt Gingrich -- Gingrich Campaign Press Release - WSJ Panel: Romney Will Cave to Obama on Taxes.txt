    Riley: Well, Romney's got a much more modest tax plan. Romney says, "I'll extend the Bush tax cuts." He says, "I'll cut the corporate tax rate, but not as much as--"
Gigot: Thirty-five percent to 25%.
Riley: To 25%. When Romney came in and spoke to The Wall Street Journal recently, he said that "someone with my background can't make an argument for cutting taxes on wealthy individuals." That was sort of why he--his argument for a more modest tax proposal here. What he didn't say is whether he actually believes that cutting taxes on our most productive people would help grow the economy. And I think that's where Gingrich thinks he has Romney. Does he actually believe this stuff?
Gigot: He said basically, "I can't make the argument," as Jason said, "because if I do, they'll attack me as a rich guy, and I'll lose that argument." But if you don't make--but he said, "Well, wait, after I'm elected, I will campaign, I will fight for tax reform with lower rates." But if you don't make the argument in the campaign--
Henninger: It's confusing.
Gigot: --what makes you think that you'll ever make it if you get elected--Jan. 21?
Henninger: Absolutely. It's very confusing to people. I mean, what I have here is Romney's own economic document. This is the first page of tax policy, in which he attacks President Obama for class warfare, saying: "He's calling middle-income Americans 'millionaires and billionaires.' He actually includes every household earning more than $250,000." Page two, his tax proposal, says he will cut capital gains and dividends and interest rates for anyone with an adjusted gross income of under $200,000. It's an obvious contradiction. That's Barack Obama's position.
