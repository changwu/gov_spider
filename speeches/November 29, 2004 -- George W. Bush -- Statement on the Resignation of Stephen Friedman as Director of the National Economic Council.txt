    Steve Friedman has been a trusted adviser and vital member of my economic team, working tirelessly to help make sure that America continues to be the best place in the world to do business.
Steve played a valuable role in enacting the Jobs and Growth Act of 2003 that helped move our economy from recession to the robust growth we are experiencing today. As a key member of my White House senior staff, Steve has led efforts to develop the policies that are strengthening our economy and helping to create jobs. Steve has done an excellent job of coordinating the work of my economic team and has played a key role in developing the economic policies for my second-term agenda.
Steve is a good-hearted man who possesses great wisdom and a can-do attitude. I am grateful for his superb work and wish him and Barbara all the best as they fulfill their plan to return home to New York.
