    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced California Business Leaders for Rudy. The team will be chaired by Kim Quinones, Managing Director of Ramirez & Co., Inc., Los Angeles, and help spread Rudy's commitment to fiscal discipline, ending wasteful government spending and cutting taxes.
"As Mayor of New York, Rudy Giuliani achieved what many said could not be done. Rudy used fiscal conservative principles to turn a $2.3 billion dollar deficit into a multi-billion dollar surplus," said Bill Simon, Giuliani's California State Chairman and Director of Policy. "As President, Rudy will restore fiscal discipline to Washington and cut taxes, as he did in New York 23 times."
