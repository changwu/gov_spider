    The Geneva accords call for four instruments as outlined by Secretary Shultz yesterday in the briefing room. In addition, the Secretary noted our insistence that the obligations of the guarantors be symmetrical. We are satisfied that the Soviets understand our view and intent regarding the guarantees, i.e., that they must be symmetrical. Our position on this issue will be made publicly clear to all parties in a statement the United States will issue at the time of the signing.
