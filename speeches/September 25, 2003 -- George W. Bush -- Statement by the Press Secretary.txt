    The President learned with deep regret of the death of Akila Hashimi, a member of the Governing Council of Iraq, from wounds suffered in an assassination attempt last Saturday. Those who murdered her were attacking the efforts to create a peaceful, democratic, modern Iraq. They must and will not be allowed to succeed.
We offer our condolences to Ms. Hashimi's family, her colleagues, and the people of Iraq, on the death of this brave and talented woman who was working to build a better future for the Iraqi people. Her life will continue to serve as an inspiration to those seeking to build this brighter future.
