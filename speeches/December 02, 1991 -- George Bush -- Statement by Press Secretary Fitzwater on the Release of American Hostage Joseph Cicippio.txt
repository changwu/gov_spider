    We join the family of Joseph Cicippio in their happiness for his release after these many years of unjust captivity in Lebanon.
For their assistance in the release, we wish to thank the United Nations and the Governments of Iran, Syria, and Lebanon.
Our joy is tempered, however, with deep concern for those who remain in captivity. We call once again for the immediate and unconditional release of all those who are held hostage outside the process of law. The two remaining American hostages and the other hostages held in Lebanon must be freed at once and reunited with their loved ones. We call also for a full accounting of those who have died in captivity and the return of their remains. We support the initiative of the Secretary-General of the United ÿ7Eÿ7Eÿ7ENationsÿ7Eÿ7Eÿ7E andÿ7Eÿ7Eÿ7E rejoiceÿ7Eÿ7Eÿ7E inÿ7Eÿ7Eÿ7E theÿ7Eÿ7Eÿ7E progressÿ7Eÿ7Eÿ7E thatÿ7Eÿ7Eÿ7E heÿ7Eÿ7Eÿ7E hasÿ7Eÿ7Eÿ7E madeÿ7Eÿ7Eÿ7E towardsÿ7Eÿ7Eÿ7E endingÿ7Eÿ7Eÿ7E thisÿ7Eÿ7Eÿ7E tragedy.
