    Memorandum for the Secretary of Energy 
Subject: Hanford Reach National Monument
The area being designated as the Hanford Reach National Monument forms an arc surrounding much of what is known as the central Hanford area. While a portion of the central area is needed for Department of Energy missions, much of the area contains the same shrubsteppe habitat and other objects of scientific and historic interest that I am today permanently protecting in the monument. Therefore, I am directing you to manage the central area to protect these important values where practical. I further direct you to consult with the Secretary of the Interior on how best to permanently protect these objects, including the possibility of adding lands to the monument as they are remediated.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
