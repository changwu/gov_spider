    Secretary Brown's success as Secretary of Commerce is unparalleled. Through his service, the Department has expanded opportunities for American businesses in this country and abroad. I know him to be a dedicated public servant. The Attorney General has determined that the facts warrant the appointment of an independent counsel. As I have noted in the past, the legal standard for such an appointment is low. I am confident at the conclusion of the process, the independent counsel will find no wrongdoing by Secretary Brown. In the interim, I value his continued service on behalf of this country.
