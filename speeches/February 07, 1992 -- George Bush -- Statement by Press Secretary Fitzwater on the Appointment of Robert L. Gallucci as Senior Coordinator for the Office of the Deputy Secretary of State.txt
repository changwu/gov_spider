    The President has announced the appointment of Dr. Robert L. Gallucci as Senior Coordinator reporting to the Deputy Secretary of State, with responsibility for coordinating the Administration's cooperation with the States of the former Soviet Union to reduce the risk that their scientists and know-how would contribute to the proliferation of special weapons. For this purpose, he will also assist in the coordination of assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States in the areas of conversion of the state-run defense establishment to peaceful or commercial enterprises, and humanitarian and educational needs. Dr. Gallucci will carry the personal rank of Ambassador.
In order to assume these new responsibilities, Dr. Gallucci has resigned his position as Deputy Executive Chairman of the U.N. Special Commission charged with the destruction or removal from Iraq of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. Ambassador Michael Newlin has been nominated to succeed Dr. Gallucci in that position.
