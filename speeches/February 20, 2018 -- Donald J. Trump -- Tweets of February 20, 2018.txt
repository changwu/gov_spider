The U.S. economy is looking very good in my opinion even better than anticipated. Companies are pouring back into our country reversing the long term trend of leaving. The unemployment numbers are looking great and Regulations & Taxes have been massively Cut! JOBS JOBS JOBSRetweets: 25306Favorites: 120633

Thank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia including Crimea Syria and so much more. We are now starting to win again!Retweets: 14655Favorites: 66368

'There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America's elections there's no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time and so I'd invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes.' .....Retweets: 17403Favorites: 67815

....The President Obama quote just before election. That's because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn't want to 'rock the boat.' When I easily won the Electoral College the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems.Retweets: 20699Favorites: 85341

Republicans are now leading the Generic Poll perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away. Actually they want to raise you taxes substantially. Also they want to do nothing on DACA R's want to fix!Retweets: 17161Favorites: 82044

Matt Schlapp and CPAC are getting ready for another exciting event. Big difference from those days when President Obama held the White House. You've come a long way Matt!Retweets: 10176Favorites: 51701

Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania challenge the new 'pushed' Congressional Map all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary. Your Original was correct! Don't let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes & waste money!Retweets: 20211Favorites: 79178

A woman I don't know and to the best of my knowledge never met is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago. Never happened! Who would do this in a public space with live security......Retweets: 21676Favorites: 96352

....cameras running. Another False Accusation. Why doesn't @washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me? One had her home mortgage paid off. Only @FoxNews so reported...doesn't fit the Mainstream Media narrative.Retweets: 19693Favorites: 79159

Main Street is BOOMING thanks to our incredible TAX CUT and Reform law. "This shows small-business owners are more than just optimistic they are ready to grow their businesses." https://t.co/w9aw68UwOjRetweets: 17507Favorites: 74716
