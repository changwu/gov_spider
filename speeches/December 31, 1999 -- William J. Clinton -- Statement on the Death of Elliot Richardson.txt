    Hillary and I were saddened to learn that Elliot Richardson died today in Boston. Elliot Richardson was a man of uncommon integrity, who put the Nation's interests first even when the personal cost was very high. He was an unparalleled public servant, a lawyer, a diplomat, a soldier, and a prosecutor. America was honored by his service, and we will miss him.
