    IT IS with profound regret that I have learned of the death in Philadelphia of His Excellency Dr. Victor Roman y Reyes, President of Nicaragua. President Roman y Reyes has been a sincere friend of the United States, and we share with the people of Nicaragua a feeling of great sadness at his passing.
