    Dr. Michael Vasovski to lead South Carolina effortLAKE JACKSON, Texasâ€” Today, the Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign announced the appointment of Dr. Michael Vasovski as South Carolina Campaign Chairman.
"As a sole medical practitioner, I am also a small business owner, and know full well the burdens placed on small businesses by the federal government," said Dr. Vasovski in a statement. "Dr. Paul is the only presidential candidate with a serious plan to reduce such regulations and cut $1 trillion from the federal budget in his first year in office. I am honored to support Ron Paul's campaign for the Republican nomination."
The son of a 26-year Air Force veteran, Dr. Vasovski served in the United States Army's Medical Corp from 1981-1987, achieving the rank of Captain. Upon leaving the Army, he moved to Aiken, South Carolina where he began his private general medical practice.
Dr. Vasovski was one of the original founders of the Free Medical Clinic of Aiken. He and Cindy, his wife of 31 years, continue to volunteer there where needy people can partake of health care that is provided completely free of charge and generated by and from the voluntary efforts of a large staff of caring, generous and compassionate citizens of Aiken. Dr. Vasovski still continues to serve the people of Aiken and the surrounding counties to this day.
This announcement comes after a CNN/Time Poll showed Dr. Paul polling in the top three among GOP presidential hopefuls in South Carolina.
