    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement today, praising ONE Vote '08's effort to make global poverty a bigger issue in the 2008 presidential campaign.
"It's simply wrong that billions of people around the globe live on less than $2 per day. Fighting global poverty is the moral thing to do - and it's also the smart thing to do for America, because it will make us safer and more secure. ONE Vote '08 has taken an important step to bring attention to this issue and to rally support for fighting global poverty.
"We don't have to accept a world where billions of people are struggling to survive and instability and extremism thrive. By taking bold steps to reduce global poverty, like those in the plan I laid out in March, we can help to replace hopelessness and radicalism with education, opportunity, and democracy."
