    I commend the House for passing the Department of Defense Appropriations bill. The House action will help strengthen and transform our military to keep America safe from the threats of this new era. The bill also continues my long-term commitment to improving the quality of life for our troops and their families through higher pay and good benefits. I am pleased the House has acted quickly and in a fiscally responsible manner, and I look forward to continuing to work with the Congress to ensure that we have the resources necessary to support our troops.
