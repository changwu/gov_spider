    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Reps. Richardson (D), Lujan (R), and Skeen (R) New Mexico)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5167 because the bill does not require the tribe to pay fair market value for Federal grazing lands which would be held in trust for them. In keeping with longstanding national policy, the Pueblo of Zia, as well as any other entity, should be required to pay fair market value for public lands. Further, we have been informed that the purchase of the land would be within the Pueblo's means.
