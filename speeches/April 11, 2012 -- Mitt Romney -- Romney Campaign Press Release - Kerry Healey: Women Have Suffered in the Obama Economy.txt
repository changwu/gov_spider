    Former Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Kerry Healey today made the following statement on how President Obama's economic policies have failed women:
"If President Obama wants to talk about a â€˜war on women,' he should start by looking at his own economic policies. It is clear that women have become the biggest casualty of the Obama economy. Women account for more than 92 percent of the jobs that have been lost on President Obama's watch. That is simply inexcusable. We need a president who will make sure that women have the opportunity to prosper. The Obama presidency has set women's economic security back twenty years. No amount of political spin or sideshows can hide that fact."
