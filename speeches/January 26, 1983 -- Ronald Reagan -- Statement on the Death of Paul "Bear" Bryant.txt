    Today we Americans lost a hero who always seemed larger than life. Paul "Bear" Bryant won more college football games than any other coach in history, and he made legends out of ordinary people. Only 4 weeks ago, we held our breath, then cheered, when the "Bear" notched his final victory in a game named, fittingly, the Liberty Bowl.
He was a hard, but loved taskmaster. Patriotic to the core, devoted to his players, and inspired by a winning spirit that would not quit, Bear Bryant gave his country the gift of a life unsurpassed. In making the impossible seem easy, he lived what we strive to be.
