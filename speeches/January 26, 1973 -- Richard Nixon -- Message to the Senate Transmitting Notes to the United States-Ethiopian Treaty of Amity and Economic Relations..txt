    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith a note of September 16, 1965 from the Government of Ethiopia and a reply note of October 20, 1972 from the Government of the United States which would terminate notes exchanged on September 7, 1951 concerning the administration of justice and constituting an integral part of the treaty of amity and economic relations between the United States and Ethiopia.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the proposed termination.
The notes which it is proposed be terminated set forth special provisions regarding the trial of cases involving American citizens and regarding the imprisonment of American citizens. The termination of the notes would be in conformity with this Government's policy of 'basing international agreements in general on the principles of equality and reciprocity.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the notes submitted herewith and give its advice and consent to termination of the notes exchanged on September 7, 1951.
