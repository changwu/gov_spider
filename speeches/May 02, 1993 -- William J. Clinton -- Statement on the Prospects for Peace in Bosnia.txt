    The developments in the Vance-Owen process are a positive step, but we have yet to determine whether the Serbs are serious about peace. We will make that judgements based upon their actions on the ground in Bosnia. As Lord Owen said this morning, "We still have a long way to go."
Other agreements in this protracted war have raised hopes but not changed behavior. We will judge intentions by actions. Accordingly, I have instructed Secretary Christopher to continue as planned with his consultations through Europe on the measures we will take if the Serbs do not act in good faith.
I have spoken in the past 2 days with a number of congressional leaders as well as President Yeltsin, Prime Minister Major, Chancellor Kohl, President Mitterrand, Prime Minister Mulroney, and Prime Minister-designate Ciampi. I will continue such consultations.
We all hope for a true and just peace in Bosnia. It must include not only the provisions of peace on paper but also the practices of peace on the ground.
