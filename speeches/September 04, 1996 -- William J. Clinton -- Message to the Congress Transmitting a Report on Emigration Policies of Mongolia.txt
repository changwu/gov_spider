I hereby transmit a report concerning emigration laws and policies of Mongolia as required by subsections 402(b) and 409(b) of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended ("the Act"). I have determined that Mongolia is in full compliance with the criteria in subsections 402(a) and 409(a) of the Act. As required by title IV, I will provide the Congress with periodic reports regarding Mongolia's compliance with these emigration standards.
