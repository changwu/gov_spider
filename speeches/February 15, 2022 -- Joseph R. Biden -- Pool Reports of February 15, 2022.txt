White House in-town pool report #1 - checking in 
Hello,
Good morning from the White House, where it's a cool 30 degrees. I'm your in-town print pool reporter today.
There are no changes to the president's schedule. This White House passes the following along regarding his remarks later today before the National Association of Counties:
"In the President's remarks to the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference, he will highlight the critical partnership between counties and the federal government as they work together across party lines to deliver critical support and services to the American people via the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law."
Here's the schedule for the rest of the day. Feel free to reach out with any questions.

White House in-town pool report #12 - Biden begins speech 
President Biden arrived on stage at 1:19. p.m. to applause among the few hundred in attendance inside the Hilton ballroom.
He was introduced by Commissioner Larry Johnson, President of National Association of Counties, who praised elements of Biden's Infrastructure law.
POTUS began speaking at 1:21 p.m.
"I ran for the Senate because it was too damn hard to be a councilman," Biden said, drawing laughs in the crowd as he turned to one of his favorite jokes he often makes before local officials.
You can watch Biden's speech at all the regular places including whitehouse.gov/live. I will not be transcribing the speech as a result.

White House in-town pool report #13 - Biden's speech over 
Biden ended his 27-minute speech at 1:48 p.m. ET.
There appeared to be a few hundred in attendance inside the hotel's ballroom, seemingly making the event one of the largest that POTUS has addressed since the rise of the omicron variant. The vast majority in the crowd wore face masks as Biden spoke.
"I want to make sure the money goes straight to the counties," Biden said at one point, drawing the loudest applause in the speech. It was a reference to the $350 billion in direct aid for city and state governments provided in Biden's American Rescue Plan that Congress passed last year. "I urge all of you to use the flexibility of that law and spend those funds widely."
POTUS used much of his remarks to tout ways counties are using both rescue funds and federal infrastructure dollars. He also made an emotional appeal for his BBB proposal to reduce prescription drug prices, talked about his Cancer Moonshot initiative and addressed rising inflation. "I'm going to work like the devil to bring gas prices down," he said.
After Biden finished his speech, the pool was rushed out of the ballroom.
