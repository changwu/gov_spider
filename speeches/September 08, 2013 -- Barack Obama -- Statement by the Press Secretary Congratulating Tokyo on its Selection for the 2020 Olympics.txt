    On behalf of President Obama and the United States, I am delighted to congratulate the city of Tokyo, and our close ally Japan, on its selection as host of the 2020 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games.
Tokyo's rich culture, tradition, and energy make it a fitting choice to host the 2020 Games. Just as we did in 1964, we look forward to cheering on Team USA in a city that embodies the Olympic ideals of excellence, respect, and friendship as together we promote international understanding through sport.
