    Ad Highlights Sanders is Only Leading Candidate Funded Exclusively by Grassroots Donations
DES MOINES â€“ Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign on Wednesday ahead of the Democratic debate launched a new TV ad in Iowa calling out a corrupt political system that allows billionaires to buy elections and touting Sanders as the only leading candidate funded exclusively by grassroots donations.
WATCH: "Billionaires"
The ad features footage of Sanders' March to End Corporate Greed, which brought over 1,000 supporters together in Des Moines. Sanders' Iowa polling average is currently at the highest level since May as support continues to expand across the state.
"Billionaires" is Sanders' seventh ad to run in Iowa, following "Fights For Us," "Belongs To Us," "Hope," "Iowa First," "Big Us" and "For All." All seven ads have been produced entirely in-house by Bernie 2020 staff.
The full ad transcript is below:
My opponents would tell you that campaign contributions from the wealthy and the powerful don't have an impact.
Why do you think these CEOs are making contributions? When you make those contributions you're first in line to get your concerns taken care of.
I believe in democracy, not billionaires owning the system.
Our campaign is funded by the working people of this country.
We need to take on all of the corporate elite. We need a government that works for working families, not just big campaign contributors.
I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message.
