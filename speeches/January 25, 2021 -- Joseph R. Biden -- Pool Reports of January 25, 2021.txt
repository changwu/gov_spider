Pool Report #1 -- Checking In
Good Morning from the White House,
Your pooler has received her COVID test and is in position.
There's a 1p.m. press briefing, a 12:05 pool spray with POTUS, VPOTUS, Sec. of Defense & Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and at 3:45p.m. POTUS will sign another pair of Executive Orders.
I'm around if you have questions.
Cheers,Laura

POTUS entered at 3:42 with VPOTUS
