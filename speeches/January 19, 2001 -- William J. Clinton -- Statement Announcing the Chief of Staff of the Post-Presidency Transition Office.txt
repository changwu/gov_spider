    I am pleased to announce that Karen Tramontano will be serving as my Chief of Staff in my Post-Presidency Transition Office. Following that, Karen will direct my staff, work with me to develop a foundation, and manage my other public service activities. She will also serve an integral role in the development of my Presidential Library.
Karen Tramontano has spent the past two decades bringing more opportunity to working Americans. From her work at the Service Employees International Union to her days on the U.S. Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, Karen brought issues such as minimum wage, health and child care, and workers' and civil rights to the political forefront. She continued that effort at the White House, first as Counsel to my then Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles and then as Counselor to my Chief of Staff John Podesta. In that capacity, she also worked tirelessly on the census, global trade, and issues important to the Washington, DC, community. I know that in this new role she will continue to fight for these and other important causes.
Time and again, Karen has demonstrated keen insight and shrewd political judgment. Her energy is infectious, her skill and leadership unparalleled. I know she will bring that same level of commitment and enthusiasm to her work with me in the years ahead. I am grateful that she has agreed to take on one more assignment.
