    Dear Don:
In accepting your resignation I want you to know how deeply grateful I am for all that you have done for this Administration and for our country. As Secretary of the Treasury you planted the seeds for the most far-reaching tax reform in our history. As Chief of Staff you worked tirelessly and effectively for the policies and programs we proposed to the Congress.
I know that you stayed on beyond the time you had set for your return to private life, and did so because you felt you could be of help in a time of trouble. You were of help and I thank you. Whether on the deck of your beloved boat or on the fairway, in the words of our forefathers, may the sun shine warm upon your face, the wind be always at your back, and may God hold you in the hollow of His hand.
Sincerely,
RON
