    Q. Mr. President, is our assistance to that Zaire operation ended, or is it still in progress?
THE PRESIDENT. It's just about over.
Q. It seemed to be a pretty successful operation?
THE PRESIDENT. I think so. From what we hear, the French and the Belgians and the Zairians have been successful. And we provided what logistic support they requested. And barring some unforeseen development, I think that my authorization for help is probably over. But we don't ever know what will happen in the future.
