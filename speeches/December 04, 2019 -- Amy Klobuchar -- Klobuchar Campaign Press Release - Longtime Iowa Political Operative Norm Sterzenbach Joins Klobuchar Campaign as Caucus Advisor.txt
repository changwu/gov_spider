    DES MOINES, IA â€” In its latest sign of strength heading into 2020, Amy for America today announced the hiring of veteran Iowa political operative Norm Sterzenbach as the campaign's Iowa Caucus Advisor.
In his new role, Sterzenbach, an Iowa expert with years of political experience in the state, will advise the campaign on caucus strategy and engagement efforts ahead of the February contest.
"Since entering this race, Amy Klobuchar has built an impressive grassroots campaign equipped to turn out Iowans of all backgrounds from across the state," said Sterzenbach. "As the Senator next door, Amy has been a champion on the issues most important to Iowans -- she knows what it takes to win in the Heartland and beat Donald Trump. I'm thrilled to be joining her campaign and look forward to helping the team prepare for a successful night in February."
"Norm brings a wealth of knowledge and understanding of the caucus process, and his insights and years of experience in Iowa Democratic politics will be an enormous asset as we enter into the home stretch," said Iowa State Director Lauren Dillon. "We're excited to have him on Team Amy, and look forward to continuing to build out our ground game here in Iowa in the coming weeks."
As a Cedar Rapids native, Sterzenbach brings to the campaign extensive knowledge and expertise in Iowa Democratic politics, having been involved in campaigns for Congress, Governor, Senate and President in the Hawkeye state. In 2008, he managed the presidential precinct caucuses, which saw a record-breaking turnout among Iowa Democrats. He then went on to serve as Executive Director of the Iowa Democratic Party and later as a Principal at GPS Impact, a leading national digital strategy firm. Sterzenbach most recently served as state director for Beto O'Rourke's presidential campaign.
