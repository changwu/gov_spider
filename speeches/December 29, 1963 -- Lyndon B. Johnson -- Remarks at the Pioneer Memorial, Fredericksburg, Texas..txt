    My friends:
It is a great honor to be here in Fredericksburg today with one of the great statesmen of the world. For the last several hours we have talked along the banks of the Pedernales about peace for our people, security for our Nation, prosperity for all human beings everywhere.
Our meeting has been most successful, our experience has been quite stimulating, and we look ahead with optimism, hope, and belief that the time will come when all peoples in all lands can love thy neighbor as thyself.
So this morning it is with a great deal of pleasure that I present to you the first citizen of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Chancellor, Mr. Erhard.
