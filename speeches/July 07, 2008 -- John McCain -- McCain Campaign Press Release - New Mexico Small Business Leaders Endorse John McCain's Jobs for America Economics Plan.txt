    ALBUQUERQUE, NM -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced the formation of the New Mexico Small Business Leaders for McCain coalition. Several Albuquerque-area small business owners endorsed John McCain's economic plan today, joining business leaders across the country who have praised John McCain's jobs-first plan to grow the economy as president.
"As a business owner here in Albuquerque, I know how important it is to have a president who understands the contribution small business owners make in providing jobs for Americans," said Carlo Lucero, owner of Sparkle Maintenance. "Senator McCain's commitment to keeping taxes low and his vision to move us toward energy independence will ensure that we continue to create jobs here in New Mexico and across the country for years to come."
Lucero was joined by Rudy Gonzalez of EPKG, Inc, Ty Hise of CEMCO, Inc., Roxanne Rivera-Weist of Syntastics, Bill Miera of FIORE Industries, and dozens of other small business owners and Hispanic business leaders in endorsing John McCain for president and his jobs-first plan in New Mexico.
Gonzalez said that he is supporting Senator McCain's jobs-first plan because he believes it will provide relief for New Mexicans who are feeling the crunch of higher living expenses and higher costs of business. "Among other things, John McCain is proposing immediate relief for American families by calling for a gas tax holiday this summer and I support him in that effort," added Gonzales.
Today in Denver, Colorado John McCain announced his Jobs for America economic plan, kicking off five days of economic themed activity in critical battleground states.
