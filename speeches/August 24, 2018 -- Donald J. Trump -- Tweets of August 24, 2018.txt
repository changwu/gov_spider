Target CEO raves about the Economy. 'This is the best consumer environment I've seen in my career.' A big statement from a top executive. But virtually everybody is saying this & when our Trade Deals are made & cost cutting done you haven't seen anything yet! @DRUDGE_REPORTRetweets: 17389Favorites: 69975

Our Economy is setting records on virtually every front - Probably the best our country has ever done. Tremendous value created since the Election. The World is respecting us again! Companies are moving back to the U.S.A.Retweets: 20612Favorites: 84624

Social Media Giants are silencing millions of people. Can't do this even if it means we must continue to hear Fake News like CNN whose ratings have suffered gravely. People have to figure out what is real and what is not without censorship!Retweets: 53254Favorites: 184573

I have asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to go to North Korea at this time because I feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula...Retweets: 18026Favorites: 79161

...Additionally because of our much tougher Trading stance with China I do not believe they are helping with the process of denuclearization as they once were (despite the UN Sanctions which are in place)...Retweets: 11571Favorites: 53963

...Secretary Pompeo looks forward to going to North Korea in the near future most likely after our Trading relationship with China is resolved. In the meantime I would like to send my warmest regards and respect to Chairman Kim. I look forward to seeing him soon!Retweets: 12928Favorites: 58199
