    President Donald J. Trump spoke yesterday with President Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea. The two leaders discussed North Korea's launch of a ballistic missile that overflew Japan, the second such launch over Japan in less than three weeks. The two leaders noted that North Korea continues to defy the international community, even after the United Nations strongly condemned North Korea's repeated provocations twice in the past week. President Trump and President Moon committed to continuing to take steps to strengthen deterrence and defense capabilities and to maximize economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea. The two leaders noted that they will continue their close consultations next week when they meet on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly.
