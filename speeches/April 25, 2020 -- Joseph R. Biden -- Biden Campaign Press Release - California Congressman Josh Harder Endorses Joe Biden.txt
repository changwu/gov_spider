    Yesterday, California Congressman Josh Harder released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"Joe Biden has the experience, the temperament, and the priorities we need in the next President of the United States. I'm proud to endorse him. Joe was instrumental in the effort to reform our broken health care system and ensure people with preexisting conditions can get access to health care coverage. Without his efforts, nearly 100,000 people in my Central Valley district wouldn't have health care right now.
"But there's more work to do on health care - and Vice President Biden understands that. I look forward to working alongside him to protect the progress we've made on health care while also working to cut costs and expand coverage to everyone."
Harder was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2018. He serves on the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Education and Labor.
Harder's endorsement builds on the wide support for Joe Biden in California, which includes prominent leaders like Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia, Los Angeles County Supervisor and former Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, Congressman Tony CÃ¡rdenas, Congressman Ami Bera, Congressman John Garamendi, Congressman Lou Correa, Congressman Jerry McNerney, Congressman Harley Rouda, Congressman Brad Sherman, Congresswoman Jackie Speier, Congressman Jared Huffman, Congressman Adam Schiff, Congressman Ted Lieu, Congressman Mike Levin, Congresswoman Julia Brownley and numerous others.
Biden for President has previously announced more than 2,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
