    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Canady (R) FL and Scott (D) VA)
The Administration appreciates the bipartisan effort that has gone into the development of H.R. 3117 and has no objection to House passage of the bill. The Administration, however, has concerns about certain provisions of H.R. 3117 and will work in the Senate to address these concerns.
In particular, the Administration is concerned about the Commission's ability to respond to the numerous new requirements that H.R. 3117 would impose. The Commission has already taken a variety of steps to address criticism about its internal management, and is committed to making further improvements. The Administration believes that the new reporting requirements and unrealistic deadlines in H.R. 3117 could impede the Commission as it continues to improve its management and carry out its important mission of illuminating ways to strengthen the civil rights of all Americans.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 3117 would not affect direct spending or receipts; therefore, it is not subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.
