LAKE JACKSON, Texas — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul drew a remarkable 3,000-plus supporters and voters to his Fort Worth town hall meeting tonight, the second of three such events the Texas Congressman is holding this week in his home state of Texas.
Dr. Paul's town hall meeting took place at 7:00 p.m. CST in the Auditorium of the Will Rogers Memorial Center, located at 3401 West Lancaster Avenue, Fort Worth, TX 76107. At the event, the 12-term Congressman the Lone Star State's 14th District discussed his platform of constitutionally-limited government, the bonds that tie economic and civil liberties, and provisions of his path-breaking 'Plan to Restore America,' a fiscal blueprint designed to free America from the current period of economic weakness.
