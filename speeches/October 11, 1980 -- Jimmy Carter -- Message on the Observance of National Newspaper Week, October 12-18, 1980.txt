    A free and unmanaged press is one of the proudest symbols of our democratic government and one of its boldest champions. And, conversely, an open government is one of the staunchest protectors of the free press and of the people whose trust it holds.
During National Newspaper Week, we honor the brilliant and determined individuals who won for the American press the freedom it enjoys in reporting and interpreting current events. We also rededicate ourselves to perpetuating, in a way that would make them proud, the great tradition they have passed on to us. And we applaud those members of our press who have consistently displayed the sensitivity, integrity, wisdom and accuracy which their profession demands.
As a nation we recognize the extent of our dependence on our fellow citizens who gather and report the news. And we are in awe of the grave responsibility they bear as they cover events that affect the lives of millions of Americans and the future of our country.
We believe as they do that the freedom they possess can protect the freedoms we cherish. And we look to them to exercise their freedom wisely, responsibly and with a daily awareness of the tremendous power they wield.
Rosalynn and I are proud to join with all Americans at this time in tribute to our nation's newspapers and to the dedicated men and women behind them.
