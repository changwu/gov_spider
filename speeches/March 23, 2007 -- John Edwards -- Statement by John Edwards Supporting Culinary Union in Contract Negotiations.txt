    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€” Senator John Edwards today released a video statement on his website in support of the Culinary Union's efforts to negotiate a fair contract for their workers in Nevada.
"These negotiations are so important because the Las Vegas economy is booming, and the people who work so hard to make this happen deserve to share in the prosperity," said Edwards. "I am standing with them, as I have with thousands of their brothers and sisters in unions across this country, to guarantee fair wages, health care benefits, and rights on the job."
Edwards believes that workers in Las Vegas and all across our nation deserve fair wages and benefits. He has traveled the country to speak out in support of workers' rights. Over the past few years, Edwards has joined with more than 20 national unions to organize thousands of workers. In 2006, Edwards participated in UNITE-HERE's "Hotel Workers Rising" Tour, which helped ensure decent wages and benefits for hotel workers all across the country.
Edwards has also agreed to participate in a Culinary membership meeting in April in support of their contract negotiations.
