    BOULDER, Colo. â€” Presidential candidate Ted Cruz tonight told the story of his mother Eleanor, excerpt below. Learn more about the woman who raised our next President, through this Mother's Day video from earlier this year.


"You look at working women, I'll tell you, in my family, there are a lot of single moms in my family, my sister was a single mom, both my aunts were single moms, my mom, who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was three years old. Now thank God, my father was invited to a Bible Study and became Born Again, and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together. But the struggle of the single mom was extraordinary, and you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of women, not a one of them mention the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women entered poverty.
"Not a one of them mention the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733. The truth of the matter is big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations, and the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics. That is who I'm fighting for, the people that Washington leaves behind."
