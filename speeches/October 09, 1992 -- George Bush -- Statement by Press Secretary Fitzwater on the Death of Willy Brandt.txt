    The President was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of a great German statesman and patriot, Willy Brandt.
Willy Brandt was a towering figure of the postwar era, a man of vision and courage. History will crown him as a stalwart champion of freedom and democracy, who, as Governing Mayor of Berlin during the city's darkest days, fearlessly faced down a Soviet menace that threatened the lives and ideals of his beloved city and people. History will also record his as a powerful voice for reconciliation between East and West. First as Foreign Minister and then as Chancellor, he actively pursued a relaxation of tension in Europe that made the world a safer place for us all. The collapse of communism and the onward march of democracy in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union soundly vindicate his bold vision of two decades ago.
Americans will remember Willy Brandt not only as a champion of freedom and democracy but also as a steadfast friend of the United States. His strong support of the transatlantic community reflected his belief that close German-American cooperation was crucial to the preservation of peace and promotion of freedom and democracy.
Together with our German friends and all those who fought in the causes to which Willy Brandt dedicated his life, the American people mourn his loss.
