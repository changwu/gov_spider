    We're putting the people and expertise that helped America win the cold war to work on restoring America's industrial competitiveness. We are bringing together private industry, State and local governments, and community colleges to form technology deployment alliances. Together they will see to it that small manufacturers have access to the latest and best information, techniques, equipment, and know-how.
The TRP's industrial outreach program is designed to promote the best in American manufacturing practices and expertise. We mean to recreate in industrial America the same success that the agricultural extension programs had in making America number one in agriculture. The States have pioneered programs to apply technology to industrial needs. With a Federal partner, these programs can help smaller defense firms adjust and compete in commercial markets. The goal is a simple one: more jobs for American workers.
