We had these exchanges. What people don't realize is under Obamacare there is something called a high-risk corridor, it is a bailout fund. What it basically says that if these companies participate in the exchange, and they lose money, they can go after taxpayer money to bail them out for their losses. Last year, I was successful in getting language at the end of the year in the budget bill that took that bailout money away. Because I was able to achieve what we did last year, we saved the American taxpayer 2.5 billion dollars of taxpayers' money.
Marco opposes corporate welfare for any industry, health care included. 
He explained how he'd repeal and replace the law:
We need to replace it with a system that allows every American whether it is through refundable tax credit or their own employers giving them money to buy any health insurance they want from any company in America across state lines that is willing to sell it to them. That is a much better way to help people get insurance than a plan that requires the American taxpayer to bail out private insurance companies who have decided to cozy up to the Obama administration.
Marco will continue leading the fight against any effort to bring back the Obamacare bailout, but the only way to ensure that the whole law is done for good is to elect a conservative President.
