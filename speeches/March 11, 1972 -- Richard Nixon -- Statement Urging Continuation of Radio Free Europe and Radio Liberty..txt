    I AM deeply concerned at the imminent prospect that Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty may be compelled to shut down. With the support of the American government and people, these two unique voices of freedom have for many years been a vital source of uncensored news and commentary for tens of millions of people in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
In this country, we have always set great store by freedom of communication. It is therefore only natural that the American press and the American people, as represented by the overwhelming majority of the Congress, should have expressed strong backing for Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. Large majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate have affirmed their support for a continuing role for these two international broadcasting efforts. It would be a tragedy if their light should now be extinguished because of a parliamentary impasse between the two Houses.
