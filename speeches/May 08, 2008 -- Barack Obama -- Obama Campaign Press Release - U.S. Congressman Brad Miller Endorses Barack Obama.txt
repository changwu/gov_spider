    Chicago, IL - Today, United States Congressman Brad Miller (D-NC) endorsed Barack Obama, citing his commitment to fighting for policies that honor America's working families and his leadership taking on the subprime mortgage crisis.
Miller is a superdelegate from North Carolina. His endorsement brings the total number of superdelegates to endorse Obama to 263. Senator Obama is 168 delegates away from securing the Democratic nomination.
Congressman Miller said, "Senator Obama understands that he has the chance not just to win the election this year, but to be a great president. Americans know that Republican policies have failed because their ideas are wrong. Americans know that our government has not acted, to use Franklin Roosevelt's words, as trustees for the whole people, but have taken the side of powerful economic interests on every issue. Americans want a fundamental change in course. Senator Obama has seized that opportunity.
"If Senator Obama and Democratic candidates up and down the ticket win this year and then deliver next year, we can build a consensus that will last a generation.
"I look forward to serving on a unified Democratic ticket with Senator Obama. He has shown great vision, strength and resilience during a very tough campaign against a worthy opponent."
Senator Obama said, "We are grateful today for Congressman Brad Miller's support. In this time of economic turmoil, Congressman Miller has shown real leadership in fighting to crack down on predatory lenders and provide relief for struggling homeowners. Our campaign was fortunate to have record numbers of voters turn out to support our movement for change this week in North Carolina, and I'm proud to have Congressman Miller's support as we continue this fight to bring about real change for families across the country."
