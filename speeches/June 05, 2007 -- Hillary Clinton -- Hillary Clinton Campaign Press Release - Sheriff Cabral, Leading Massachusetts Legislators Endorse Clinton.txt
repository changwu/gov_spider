    Hillary Clinton received the endorsements of Suffolk County Sheriff Andrea Cabral and 11 leading Massachusetts legislators today, reflecting her growing support in the Bay State. Coming on the heels of Boston Mayor Thomas Menino's endorsement yesterday, Clinton now has the support of Congressmen Jim McGovern and Richard Neal and 30 state legislators.
"This nation is at a critical crossroads and its future will be determined by its next president," said Sheriff Cabral. "I'm supporting Hillary Clinton because I want what's best for the country. She's intelligent, confident and tested. Her grasp of foreign and domestic policy issues is extraordinary, and she has the respect of leaders around the globe. She's ready to do the job right now and that's exactly what we need."
"At a time when we face great challenges at home and abroad, Hillary Clinton has both the experience and the vision to hit the ground running on her first day in the White House," said State Senator Michael Morrissey, Chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunication, Utilities & Energy.
"It's going to take a strong leader to end the war in Iraq and begin repairing our image around the world, and Senator Clinton is that leader," said State Senator Robert Antonioni, Chair of the Senate's Joint Committee on Education.
