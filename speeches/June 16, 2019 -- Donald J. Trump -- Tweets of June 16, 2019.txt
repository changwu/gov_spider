I enjoyed my interview with @GStephanopoulos on @abcnews. So funny to watch the Fake News Media try to dissect & distort every word in as negative a way as possible. It will be aired on Sunday night at 8:00 P.M. and is called 'President Trump: 30 Hours' (which is somewhat....Retweets: 2346Favorites: 8958

....misleading in that I personally spent only a small fraction of that time doing interviews. I do have a few other things to do you know!). Think I will do many more Network Interviews as I did in 2016 in order to get the word out that no President has done what I have in...Retweets: 1712Favorites: 6753

Do you believe that the Failing New York Times just did a story stating that the United States is substantially increasing Cyber Attacks on Russia. This is a virtual act of Treason by a once great paper so desperate for a story any story even if bad for our Country.....Retweets: 21890Favorites: 87740

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis just signed Bill banning Sanctuary Cities in State & forcing all law enforcement agencies to cooperate with Federal Immigration authorities. Bill prohibits local Gov't from enacting Sanctuary policies that protect undocumented immigrants...@FoxNewsRetweets: 21934Favorites: 99276

....More and more states want to do this but their governors and leaders don't have the courage to do so. The politics will soon mandate however because people from California & all over the land are demanding that Sanctuary Cities be GONE.

Yesterday was the Radical Left Democrats big Impeachment day. They worked so hard to make it something really big and special but had one problem - almost nobody showed up.

A poll should be done on which is the more dishonest and deceitful newspaper the Failing New York Times or the Amazon (lobbyist) Washington Post! They are both a disgrace to our Country the Enemy of the People but I just can't seem to figure out which is worse? The good.....Retweets: 19422Favorites: 95319

When will the Fake News Media start asking Democrats if they are OK with the hiring of Christopher Steele a foreign agent paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC to dig up 'dirt' and write a phony Dossier against the Presidential Candidate of the opposing party.........Retweets: 22404Favorites: 94861

Almost 70% in new Poll say don't impeach. So ridiculous to even be talking about this subject when all of the crimes were committed by the other side. They can't win the election fairly!Retweets: 22181Favorites: 97987

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. 'I think we have a very real risk of losing the Presidency to Donald Trump.' I agree and that is the only reason they play the impeach card which cannot be legally used!Retweets: 27321Favorites: 134616
