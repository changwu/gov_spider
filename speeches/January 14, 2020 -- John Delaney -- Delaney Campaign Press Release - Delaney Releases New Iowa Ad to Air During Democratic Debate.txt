    FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD - In a new ad to air tonight during the Democratic Debate, John Delaney delivers a call for "a real plan to bring jobs and entrepreneurship to small towns that are shrinking and aging and being left behind." In the ad which is running statewide Tuesday, Delaney tells Iowa voters that he has stayed in the race to fight for them, and how he is the only candidate with real ideas and practical solutions that can actually get done.
Delaney, who is in the midst of a 40 town tour of rural Iowa, says in the ad:
"I've stayed in this fight for you. I've done more events than any candidate and I know in my heart that our extraordinary nation remains one of unlimited potential and that my unique ideas on infrastructure, trade, climate and national service are needed to help realize it. They are all big ideas, based on facts and they can get done."
"And I'm also the only one running with a real plan to bring jobs and entrepreneurship to small towns that are shrinking and aging and being left behind."
"As the son of a union construction worker and the only one running who was successful in business and in government. I've got a track record of getting things done and bringing people together. I want to do the same for you."
