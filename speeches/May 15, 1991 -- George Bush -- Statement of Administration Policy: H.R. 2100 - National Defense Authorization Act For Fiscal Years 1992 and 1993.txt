    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Aspin (D) Wisconsin and Dickinson (R) Alabama)
The budget authority and outlay levels in H.R. 2100, as reported by the House Armed Services Committee, are consistent with the budget caps for national defense as provided for in the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990. The bill, however, contains a number of objectionable provisions that would severely compromise the Administration's national defense objectives. The Secretary of Defense would recommend that the President veto the bill if it is presented to him in its current form.
Of particular concern, the bill would:

—   eliminate funding for continuation of B-2 stealth bomber procurement, despite the importance of this system in maintaining strategic deterrence;
—   underfund the SDI program, terminating key elements of the Administration's initiative to provide global protection against limited nuclear strikes;
—   fund unrequested or low priority programs, such as the V-22 aircraft and F-14 fighters; and
—   limit planned reductions in Reserve and National Guard forces, which would cause imbalances in the total force structure. 
The Administration will work with the Senate to develop a bill that reflects Administration priorities.
As the review of H.R. 2100 continues, the Administration may propose additional modifications to the bill.
