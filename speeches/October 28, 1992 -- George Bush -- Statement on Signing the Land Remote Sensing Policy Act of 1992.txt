    Today I am signing into law H.R. 6133, the "Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992."
The Act will carry out my proposals for the future of the Landsat satellite program. It will ensure that continuity of Landsat-type data is maintained for the foreseeable future. That data will improve our understanding of the environment, strengthen our ability to manage natural resources, and assist with other activities of scientific, economic, and national security importance.
The Act will also encourage future commercial opportunities in remote sensing by:
-- supporting investments in new remote sensing technologies;
-- removing unnecessary restrictions on the dissemination of privately gathered data;
-- streamlining the licensing process for private remote sensing systems; and
-- encouraging growth of the market for remote sensing data by pricing federally provided data at the cost of fulfilling user requests, but no higher.
Finally, I note that section 203(b) of the Act, regarding review of certain agency actions under the Act, cannot be understood to supersede section 554 of title 5, United States Code, which exempts from review such matters as the conduct of military or foreign affairs functions.
