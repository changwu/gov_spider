    LAS VEGAS – Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign on Thursday released a powerful new digital ad focused on the Americans hit hardest by the foreclosure crisis.
"Having a home means keeping my family together," Magdaleno Padilla says in Spanish as the spot opens. "For me and my wife, it's everything because I worked for it."
"We felt secure," Jessica Kinnaman says. "We had a sense of owning something – having a part of the American dream. Our home meant everything to us. It was our savings. It was our children's future."
In June of 2010, 65 percent of all homeowners with a mortgage in the state of Nevada owed more than their homes were worth. While the economy is better today than it was during the recession, Nevada still has one of the highest unemployment and foreclosure rates and far too many homeowners are still underwater on their mortgages. Las Vegas has the largest share of underwater homeowners of any major market in the country.
"Millions of homeowners losing their property, their marriage gets destroyed, breaking families," Nynoska Briceño says. "Enough is enough."
"I believe in Bernie Sanders because he believes in us," Jessica Kinnaman says as the ad closes.
