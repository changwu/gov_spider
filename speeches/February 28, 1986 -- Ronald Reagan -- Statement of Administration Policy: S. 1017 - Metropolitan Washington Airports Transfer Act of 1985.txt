    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revision)(Senate)(Danforth (R) Missouri and 4 others)
The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 1017 At the same time, the Administration is strongly opposed to any nongermane amendments to S. 1017. Amendments such as delaying the effective date of, or overturning, the Department of Transportation's final rule governing the allocation of landing and take-off slots at four high density airports, are not in accord with the Administration's program.
