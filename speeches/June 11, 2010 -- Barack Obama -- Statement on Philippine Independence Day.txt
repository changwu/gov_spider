    On behalf of the American people, I send my best wishes to all those who celebrate the 112th Anniversary of Philippine Independence Day, here in America, in the Philippines, and around the world. Our two countries share a common history and values, and we continue to partner to promote peace and development. Here in America, many Americans can trace their roots to the Philippines, and they are all an important part of the American identity. I am confident that our nations, sharing in our democratic principles, will continue our strong friendship and cooperation.
