    Edwards Campaign First In Iowa to Announce Chairs in Every County in State
Waterloo, Iowa – As Elizabeth Edwards visited Iowa for the grand opening of the campaign's Waterloo office, the John Edwards for President campaign today announced that it has signed up county chairs for all 99 Iowa counties.
The Edwards campaign becomes the first campaign—Democratic or Republican —to announce county chairs for each of Iowa's 99 counties. These chairs—including elected officials, educators and influential business and community leaders—will work to organize their county for Senator Edwards and spread the word about his detailed and specific plans, from ending the war in Iraq to guaranteeing health care for every American.
In April, Edwards announced that the campaign had signed up a rural chairperson in all 99 counties to focus specifically on organizing the rural portions of every county. The county chairs announced today will work with the rural county chairs and others throughout their county to mobilize support for Senator Edwards.
The announcement comes just days before Senator Edwards will visit Iowa to discuss his plans to end the war in Iraq, pass truly universal health care and revitalize the economy of small towns across America. Mrs. Edwards return to Iowa to accompany him for several stops during the three-day campaign swing.
"All of us—right here in Iowa and across the country—need to take action to start changing our country today," Senator Edwards said. "I appreciate the support of the many business, civic and community leaders who have agreed to lead our campaign effort in every Iowa county. They will also advise me on the issues that matter to Iowans -- because I believe it's time America had a president who put the concerns of everyday Americans first."
"John and Elizabeth Edwards understand the challenges that regular Iowans face—from paying the health care bill to sending your kid to college," said Joy Lowe, a county coordinator for Black Hawk County. "But even more importantly, Senator Edwards is the candidate with the best and most specific ideas about how to help families in Iowa, as well as to end the war and improve our standing in the world. I'm honored to be part of this campaign because I believe he's not only our best candidate, but he'll make a great president who can deliver for Iowa families."
