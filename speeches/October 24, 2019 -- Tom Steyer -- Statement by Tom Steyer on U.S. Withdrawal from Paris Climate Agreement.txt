    (SAN FRANCISCO, October 24, 2019) â€” Presidential candidate for the Democratic nomination Tom Steyer released the statement below in response to President Donald Trump announcing the United States' official withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement.
"Mr. Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement endangers the health and safety of Americans simply to benefit the corporate polluters who funded his campaign. Instead of focusing on reviving fossil fuel industries, we should be working closely with our international allies to drastically reduce global emissions and work towards a greener, more prosperous and healthier future.
"I would declare the climate crisis a national emergency on day one of my presidency to take immediate action to protect the wellbeing of the American people. My administration would implement a justice-centered climate plan to build a sustainable, green economy; prioritize justice for communities harmed by polluters; and create 46 million jobs over the next ten years. The climate crisis demands urgent leadership, and we can't afford to take a back seat."
