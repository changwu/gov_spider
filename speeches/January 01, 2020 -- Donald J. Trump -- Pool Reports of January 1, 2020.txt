Out of Town Pool Report #4 - Arrival at Mar-a-Lago 
The president's motorcade arrived back at Mar-a-Lago at 3:41 PM. We have not received any additional information about the president's activities today.
Close to Mar-a-Lago the motorcade passed a number of people protesting plans to ban some flavored e-cigarettes, with signs that said "Don't ban my vape" and "Freedom to Vape." Many were wearing t-shirts that said "we vape, we vote." It also passed a crowd of Trump supporters waving signs that said "We heart Trump" and "Trump 2020" as well as a number of anti-Trump signs, including one that said "Russian stooge."
At 3:48 PM we have a travel/photo lid. Thanks to co-pooler Seung Min Kim and to Nikki Schwab for their help. Enjoy the rest of your day.
