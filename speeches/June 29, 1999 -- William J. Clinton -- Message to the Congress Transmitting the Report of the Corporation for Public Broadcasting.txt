    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, as amended (47 U.S.C. 396(i)), I transmit herewith the Annual Report of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) for Fiscal Year 1998 and the Inventory of the Federal Funds Distributed to Public Telecommunications Entities by Federal Departments and Agencies for that same year.
Among its many outstanding projects over the past year, CPB has put considerable time and effort into strengthening the teaching and development of America's literary tradition. Working with educators, writers, and experts from all across the country, CPB has launched a companion website filled with exceptional teaching materials and continues to make possible the broadcast of some of the Nation's finest literature over our public airwaves. In addition, CPB is also expanding the availability of teacher professional development in the social sciences, humanities, and literature.
As we move into the digital age, I am confident that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting will continue to act as a guiding force. As the projects above illustrate, CPB not only inspires us, it educates and enriches our national culture.
