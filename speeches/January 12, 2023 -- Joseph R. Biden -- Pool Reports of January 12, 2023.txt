"You lose someone you love so suddenly, someone who should have had so many years ahead of him."
"Thank you for sharing Ash with us," Biden said to the family.
"he did make a difference."
"a force made up of warriors who are safer because of Ash's determination to protect them... a force and a department forever shaped by Ash's far-reaching vision and his relentless, relentless innovation. He believed, as I do, what America can achieve when we put our minds to it."
Said that Carter was a truth seeker, teacher, and that he never let politics color his recommendations
"Above all, Ash had an unmistakable commitment to his troops."
"Ash understood at his core that we had a sacred, sacred obligation to give them what they need, support they need when we send them into harms' way."
"its amazing what he did with his background as a scientist, he got it done and he literally saved I think… hundreds of thousands of lives."
"He protected our servicemembers futures because he was out defending ours. How many servicemembers are alive today, welcoming child of their own, because of Ash Carter?"
"Ash's connection to our troops and their families was more than a professional duty. To him, it was personal."
Biden said that Carter couldn't have been the man or mentor he was without his wife, Stephanie.
"May we continue to carry the legacy of Ash in our hearts… and may we always seek the truth, may we always strive to be of service."

"Ash Carter was both a brilliant speaker and a bold leader."
"Ash's scientific mindset drove him to aways face facts, especially painful ones. So, as the president noted, he took on the DOD bureaucracy whenever it lagged behind."
"Ash always put the troops first," he said, noting that Carter ended the ban on transgender troops.
"America is more secure because of Ash's intellect and leadership. But, above all, Ash's loved ones will remember him for his huge heart."
"Ash was always a man in a hurry but he always made time to teach and mentor."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we lost Ash Carter way too soon and we can never know how much time is left to us. So, let us resolve as he would have wanted, to turn that time into a season of service."
