    I am pleased by the agreement reached with the Nation's Governors to establish a National Education Goals Panel to measure and monitor progress toward these goals. This is an important step in the process which began last September at the education summit in Charlottesville, VA.
As administration representatives on the panel, I have designated Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos, Gov. John H. Sununu [Chief of Staff to the President], Director of the Office of Management and Budget Richard G. Darman, and Assistant to the President for Economic and Domestic Policy Roger B. Porter.
I look forward to working with the members of the panel in the important task of identifying and implementing a fair, constructive way to report to the Nation on the education goals.
