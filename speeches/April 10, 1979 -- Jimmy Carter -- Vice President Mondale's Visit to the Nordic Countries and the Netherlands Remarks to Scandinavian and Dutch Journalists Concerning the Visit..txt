    THE VICE PRESIDENT. Mr. President, we gave a brief report on what this trip is about and the importance we place on our relations with these nations and the fact that right now, I think, in every case our relationships are just about as good as they could be. We have no serious or contentious issues.
THE PRESIDENT. I might say that the lights did not go out in the Oval Office. [Laughter]
Well, I don't think there's anything more important to us, to our country, than to have a good relationship and a strong alliance with those who share common principles and goals with our country. And this is obviously true with the nations that the Vice President will be visiting very shortly.
But it is equally important that we have a chance for quiet and comprehensive discussions between the heads of state and Vice President Mondale, who speaks directly and with authority for me. And I look forward to the report that Vice President Mondale will bring back to our country. I think it will make us much better able to prepare our own Nation's policies in consonance with our friends and allies who will be visited by the Vice President.
So, I want to thank all of you for being willing to come and meet with the Vice President this morning. I think his trip and the impact of it will be very beneficial for our own country, and I hope it will be equally pleasing and helpful to the nations that he will visit.
I think it will be good for you to either report from your own observations or, perhaps, after consultation with some of the American journalists who've covered the White House for many years, the degree of authority that Vice President Mondale enjoys as compared to his predecessors. He's a partner with me. He participates in all of the major decisions of our country-in defense and political affairs, economic and military affairsâ€”and comes to the countries that you represent with absolute authority to speak for our country's Government.
REPORTER. Thank you, Mr. President.
