    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with section 3(f) of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1862(f)), I am pleased to transmit to you the Annual Report of the National Science Foundation for Fiscal Year 1993.
The Foundation supports research and education in every State of the Union. Its programs provide an international science and technology link to sustain cooperation and advance this Nation's leadership role.
This report shows how the Foundation puts science and technology to work for a sustainable futureâ€”for our economic, environmental, and national security.
