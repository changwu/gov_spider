    Dear Herbert:
As the day of your actual departure from Washington comes nearer, I want to repeat my deep regret and, above all, the hope that in due course, and at some not distant date, you will be available again to serve your Government, as you have done so patriotically over the last four years. I want you to know that a hearty welcome always awaits you.
With best wishes to you and Mrs. Hoover,
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
