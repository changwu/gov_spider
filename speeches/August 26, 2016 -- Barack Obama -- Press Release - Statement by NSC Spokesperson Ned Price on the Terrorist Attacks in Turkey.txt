    The United States condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attack today against a police headquarters in southeastern Turkey that left a number of dead and scores more wounded. The PKK has claimed responsibility for this senseless attack and, if confirmed, this is just the latest in a deeply concerning trend of increasing violence by the PKK in Turkey. We also condemn the attack yesterday against the convoy of Republic People's Party chairman Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of Turkey's main opposition party. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones of those killed, and we wish a speedy recovery to those injured. We remain steadfast in our support for Turkey, a NATO Ally and partner that continues to be afflicted by terrorist attacks indiscriminately targeting both security personnel and civilians. We are in close touch with Turkish authorities and reaffirm our commitment to work together with Turkey to confront the evil of terrorism.
