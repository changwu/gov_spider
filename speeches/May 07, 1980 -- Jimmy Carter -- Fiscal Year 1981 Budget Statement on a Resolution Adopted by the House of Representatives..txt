    I applaud the action of the House in adopting a-first budget resolution that moves the fiscal year 1981 budget into balance. The House leadership and Budget Committee Chairman Bob Giaimo deserve particular thanks for their hard work on this difficult issue.
While I would have preferred passage of the Obey amendment in order to provide needed transitional financial assistance to our urban areas, today's action by the House reflects support for the administration's determination to balance the budget. The House has joined solidly in our effort to lower the rate of inflation, strengthen the economy, and improve the well-being of all our people. I hope the Senate will exercise the same necessary restraint.
