    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Florida Congresswoman Sandy Adams.
 
"I'm honored to have Congresswoman Sandy Adams' support," said Mitt Romney. "As one of the history-making freshmen elected to Congress in 2010, she has been a forceful advocate for less government and empowering small businesses to create lasting economic growth. I look forward to working with Sandy in the months ahead to spread this message to all Floridians."
Announcing her support, Congresswoman Sandy Adams said, "Floridians are tired of the failed policies of the last three years. The number one goal for Florida Republicans is to find a candidate who will not only defeat President Obama, but can also put strong conservative principles into action. Under a President Romney, our country will see a return to policies that create jobs and grow the economy, government spending limited, the principles of our Constitution upheld, and the size of government reduced. I call on all Florida residents who are concerned about the direction of our country to join me in supporting Mitt Romney."
