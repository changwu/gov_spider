    The President welcomes the agreement reached yesterday in Luanda between SWAPO and the Western five contact group concerning a peaceful solution to the Namibia question. While we are awaiting a full report of the details we understand that with South African cooperation the way is now open to an early decision by the Security Council to cooperate with all the parties involved to bring Namibia to early independence.
The President appreciates the efforts of all the parties involved, including the frontline states of Africa whose cooperation has been so essential in the important progress which bas been made. The United States will continue to cooperate fully in the implementation of the agreement.
