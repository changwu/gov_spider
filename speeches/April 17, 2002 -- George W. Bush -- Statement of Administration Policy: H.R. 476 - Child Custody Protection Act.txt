    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Ros-Lehtinen (R) FL and 98 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 476, which would protect the health and safety of minors by preventing valid and Constitutional State parental involvement laws from being circumvented. This bill would also guard the rights of parents to be involved in the medical decisions of their minor daughters consistent with the widespread belief among authorities in the field that it is the parents of a pregnant minor who are best suited to provide her counsel, guidance, and support.
