    In response to recent developments in Iraq, Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole issued the following statement.
"The reports of continued strife and killings in Northern Iraq -- to include executions of U.S. backed Iraqi opposition personnel, the apparent entrenchment of Iraqi troops around Iraqi, and the lack of evidence of an Iraqi withdrawal from the North raise questions about whether the administration's strategy has advanced U.S. interests in the region. In Iraq, as in Bosnia, the Clinton administration should be careful about making claims of success that events on the ground may not substantiate, and about giving assurances that it is unable or unwilling to fulfill because, the credibility of the United States is at stake."
