    Ray Nasher was a brilliant businessman, diplomat, and philanthropist. Through his service at the United Nations, he represented the best of his country and his home State of Texas. Through his patronage of the arts, he shared his magnificent collection of modern and contemporary sculpture in countless office spaces and the world-class museums he created in Dallas and at Duke University. Ray served the last three Presidents as a member of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities and served his country by giving all Americans greater access to the arts. Laura and I send our deepest condolences to Ray Nasher's family and friends.
