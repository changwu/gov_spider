    The Senate has now completed action on the budget resolution that funds our priorities and rigorously controls spending. I look forward to working with the full Congress to provide the tax relief necessary to grow our economy and create jobs. The budget resolution provides for a jobs-and-growth package of up to $550 billion, and we will work with the Congress to provide the greatest amount of tax relief to stimulate our economy for American workers.
