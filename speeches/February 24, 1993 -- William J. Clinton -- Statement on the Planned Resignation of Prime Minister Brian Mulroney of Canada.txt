    Prime Minister Mulroney and I had a good conversation following his announcement that he is stepping down as Prime Minister of Canada. Prime Minister Mulroney has been a good friend and partner of the United States, and I wish him well. The Free Trade Agreement, the NAFTA, and Canada's voice in helping to move the world into a more hopeful era are all testimony to his leadership and courage.
It was a pleasure to meet with the Prime Minister earlier this month and to speak with him several times since my election. I greatly appreciated the Prime Minister's insight and wise counsel in tackling the common challenges of promoting world economic growth and peace. My meeting with him reinforced my conviction that Canadian engagement in world affairs remains as vital as ever. That our meeting was my first as President underscores the close relationship between our two countries. Our enduring friendship is based on the common vision we share of peace and democratic principles. From peacekeepers in Bosnia and Somalia to partnership in the G-7 and in NATO, Canada has been a true global ally. Both our people benefit from our important trading relationship, with $200 billion in goods and services alone exchanged each year.
Our steadfast relationship with Canada is an indispensable element in the essential continuity of American foreign policy. As the Prime Minister and the people of Canada prepare for the road ahead, I want them to know that the United States is and will remain their friend and partner. Our cooperation will continue to grow in the years ahead.
