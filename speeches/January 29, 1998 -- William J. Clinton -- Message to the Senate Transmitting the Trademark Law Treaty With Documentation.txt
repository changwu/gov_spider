    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for advice and consent to ratification, the Trademark Law Treaty done at Geneva October 27, 1994, with Regulations. The Treaty was signed by the United States on October 28, 1994. I also transmit for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty, accompanied by a detailed analysis of the Treaty and Regulations, prepared by the Department of State and the Patent and Trademark Office of the Department of Commerce.
Ratification of the Treaty is in the best interests of the United States. The Treaty eliminates many of the burdensome formal requirements that now exist in the trademark application and registration maintenance processes of many countries. Those requirements cause considerable expense and delay for trademark owners. The Treaty is aimed at standardizing and simplifying the application process so that the application will be accepted and processed by the trademark offices of all parties to the Treaty.
I recommend, therefore, that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Trademark Law Treaty with Regulations and give its advice and consent to the ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, January 29, 1998.
