    "President Obama was rightly criticized by small-business owners and entrepreneurs for saying 'you didn't build that, someone else made that happen.' Now he's taken it a step further by saying he wants to get the hand of government driving 'every industry' in America. From his failed stimulus bill and Solyndra-esque boondoggles to picking winners and losers at taxpayer expense in the auto bailout, President Obama has pushed aside free-market principles in favor of bigger and more intrusive government. The results have been disastrous for our economy and for middle-class families. This is just the latest evidence that President Obama hasn't learned from his mistakes and has no idea what it takes to create jobs and turn our economy around." — Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
After Telling Americans They "Didn't Build" Their Businesses, President Obama Promised Today To Bail Out "Every Industry":

'I said, I believe in American workers, I believe in this this American industry, and now the American auto industry has come roaring back,' he said. 'Now I want to do the same thing with manufacturing jobs, not just in the auto industry, but in every industry.'"

FLASHBACK: President Obama: "If You've Got A Business -- You Didn't Build That.  Somebody Else Made That Happen."
