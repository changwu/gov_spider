    Campaign more than doubled fundraising from Q1 Contributions skyrocketed after first debate
SAN ANTONIO, TX (July 15, 2019) – On Monday, July 15, the presidential campaign of former U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary under President Obama and San Antonio Mayor, Julián Castro, announced its second quarter fundraising totals of $2.8 million. That brings the cycle total to $4.1 million through the end of the second quarter.
Buoyed by a huge spike in donations immediately following the first debate, the campaign more than doubled Q1 fundraising. Prior to the debate, the campaign raised $1.7 million and in the four days following the debate raised another $1.1 million. The average contribution was $22.
Secretary Castro recently vaulted into the top five candidates following the first Democratic Primary debate, and is polling even with Mayor Pete Buttigieg in the most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll, at 4 percent. Last week, the campaign announced that it reached 130,000 unique donors, the number required by the Democratic National Committee as part of its qualifications to participate in the September and October debates.
Secretary Castro is currently in Iowa with events Tuesday in Davenport (details here) and will travel to New Hampshire July 18-19
