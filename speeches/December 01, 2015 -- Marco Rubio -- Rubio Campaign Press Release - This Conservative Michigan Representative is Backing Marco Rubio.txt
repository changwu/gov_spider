Michigan Representative Bill Huizenga, who was elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010, has joined Team Marco.
U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga is endorsing Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for president in the crowded 2016 GOP primary field and will co-chair Rubio's campaign in Michigan with Rep. John Moolenaar.
The Rubio campaign announced Huizenga's endorsement Tuesday and the formation of a leadership team in Michigan ahead of a Dec. 9 fundraiser the senator will attend in Bloomfield Hills.
"Marco's plan for a new American economy will create good paying jobs here in Michigan and strengthen our nation's economy," said Huizenga, R-Zeeland, in a statement. "I look forward to helping Marco win Michigan."
Huizenga, a 46-year old rising conservative leader, is a Western Michigan small business owner.
