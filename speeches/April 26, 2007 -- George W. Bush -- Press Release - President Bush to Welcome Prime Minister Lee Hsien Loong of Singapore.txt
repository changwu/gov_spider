    President Bush will welcome Singaporean Prime Minister Lee to the White House on May 4, 2007. Singapore is one of our strongest partners in a critically important region, a Free Trade Agreement partner, and an ally in the war on terror and in coalition efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. President Bush and Mrs. Bush visited Singapore last November. The President looks forward to discussing the full range of regional and global issues with Prime Minister Lee.
