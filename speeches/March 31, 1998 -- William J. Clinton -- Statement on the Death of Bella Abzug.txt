    Hillary and I are deeply saddened to learn of the death of former Congresswoman Bella Abzug.
Bella Abzug was a great American and a true citizen of the world. Her conscience, intellect, and political acumen made an immeasurable contribution to our public life. She raised her passionate and tireless voice demanding the best for women, for all Americans, and indeed, for people all around the world. She will be sorely missed.
Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends.
