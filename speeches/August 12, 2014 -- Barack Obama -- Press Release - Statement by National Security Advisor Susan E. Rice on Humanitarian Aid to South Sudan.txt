    Today, the United States will provide approximately $180 million to help feed the people of South Sudan, who now face the worst food security situation in the world. This food aid includes a release from the Department of Agriculture's Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust as well as funds for the U.S. Agency for International Development to provide aid to those in need. Since the start of this crisis, the United States has provided the South Sudanese with more than $456 million in humanitarian aid. But the scale of the suffering and humanitarian need there is shocking, and the threat of famine is realâ€”so much so that we are using this emergency funding authority for the first time since 2008.
The people of South Sudan are suffering because of the inability of South Sudan's leaders to put their people's interests above their own. President Salva Kiir and Riek Machar must immediately assume their responsibilities to the South Sudanese to prevent further needless suffering. It is more critical than ever that both sides end the violence and ensure the safety of humanitarian aid workers so that they can reach those most in need across South Sudan. The United States will continue to work for the peaceful resolution of the conflict.
