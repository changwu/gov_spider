    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee is organizing grassroots efforts throughout South Carolina for the coming days, beginning today, September 13th. Following the campaign's success of reaching out to voters at the Chapin Labor Day parade, volunteers will be participating in phone banks at the campaign's West Columbia and Charleston offices to spread the word about Rudy's 12 Commitments to the American People. Thousands of phone calls are expected to be made to voters from the Lowcountry to the Upstate.
This weekend, volunteers and campaign staffers will be on hand to meet with supporters and voters before a pair of in-state college football games. Team Rudy will greet folks before the Clemson University vs. Furman University football game and the University of South Carolina vs. South Carolina State football game.
