    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Cranston (D) CA and D'Amato (R) NY)
The Administration has no objection to passage of S.J.Res. 209 and strongly supports an amendment to make the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance authorities permanent. Making these authorities permanent would provide stability for homebuyers and the housing industry and alleviate the need for further temporary extensions.
