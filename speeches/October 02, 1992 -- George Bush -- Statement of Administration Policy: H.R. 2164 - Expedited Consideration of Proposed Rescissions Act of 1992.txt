    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Carper (D) Delaware and 224 others)
The President has consistently supported a constitutional amendment establishing a line-item veto. Such an amendment would enable the President to strike from legislation unnecessary and wasteful provisions unless two-thirds of the Congress voted to override his decision. A line-item veto constitutional amendment would be the most effective mechanism for eliminating "pork barrel" spending by the Congress.
The Administration supports efforts to strengthen the President's current rescission authority. Enactment of H.R. 2164 would temporarily increase congressional accountability for "pork barrel" spending in the appropriations process. The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 2164.
