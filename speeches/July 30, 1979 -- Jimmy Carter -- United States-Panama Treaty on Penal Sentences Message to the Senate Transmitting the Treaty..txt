    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Panama on the Execution of Penal Sentences which was signed at Panama on January 11, 1979.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.
The Treaty would permit citizens of either nation who had been convicted in the courts of the other country to serve their sentences in their 'home country; in each case, the consent of the offender would be required.
This Treaty represents the fulfillment of a commitment undertaken by both nations in the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977. It would complement the wide range of protections and benefits afforded United States Government personnel under the Panama Canal Treaty and related agreements during the life of that Treaty, and would establish a mechanism for other nationals of both countries to serve their sentences in their home countries. Its ratification would provide our personnel stationed in the Republic of Panama further assurance that their interests will be fully protected upon the entry into force of the Panama Canal Treaty.
I recommend that the Senate give prompt and favorable consideration to this Treaty.
JIMMY CARTER
The White House,
July 30, 1979.
