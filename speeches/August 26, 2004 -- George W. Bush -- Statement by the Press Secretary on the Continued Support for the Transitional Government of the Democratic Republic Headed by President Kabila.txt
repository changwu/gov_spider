    The United States notes with great concern the decision by Democratic Republic of the Congo Vice President Azarias Ruberwa to suspend all Congolese Rally for Democracy-Goma (RCD-G) activities in the transition. We continue to support the transitional government of the Democratic Republic headed by President Kabila.
We call upon the Governments of Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Rwanda to support the transitional government and to exercise restraint. It is critical that the Great Lakes countries work together with the assistance of the international community to bring to justice the genocidal forces who have threatened the stability of this region for over a decade. We support the Great Lakes countries' efforts to establish a trilateral mechanism to foster cooperation in the region.
