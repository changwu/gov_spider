    I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 1862, a bill which will provide a 6.6 percent increase in compensation payments for over 2 million disabled veterans and their survivors. These increases will become effective Saturday, October 1, 1977.
The enactment of H.R. 1862 carries out my recommendation that compensation payments be adjusted this year to keep pace with the cost of living.
