    President Diem, my friend.:
Americans everywhere, I am sure, feel honored that they may welcome to this country--to this Capital--indeed to this house, one who has in a very short space of time established himself as an inspirational leader in his own country.
More than this, by his courage, his fortitude and his statesmanship, he has become an example for people everywhere who hate tyranny and love freedom.
I know that all of you will consider it a high privilege to rise with me and to drink a Toast to the President of the Viet-Namese Republic.
President Diem!
