The President commended the Dalai Lama's commitment to nonviolence and dialogue with China and his pursuit of the "Middle Way" approach. Reiterating the U.S. policy that Tibet is a part of the People's Republic of China and the United States does not support independence for Tibet, the President stressed that he encourages direct dialogue to resolve long-standing differences and that a dialogue that produces results would be positive for China and Tibetans. The President stressed the importance he attaches to building a U.S.-China cooperative partnership. The Dalai Lama stated that he is not seeking independence for Tibet and hopes that dialogue between his representatives and the Chinese government can soon resume.
