    Des Moines, IA -- The Obama campaign today announced that former Clinton Energy Secretary Federico Peña and National Campaign Co-Chair of the Obama Campaign will meet with Iowans to discuss Senator Obama's judgment, experience and vision for bringing our country together and challenging the conventional thinking in Washington, D.C. Peña will make stops in Muscatine, West Liberty, Des Moines, Perry on his trip.
"I have spent years working with Presidential administrations and world leaders and what I see in Barack Obama is the kind of judgment this country needs to usher in a new era of global leadership. The challenges we are facing across the country are formidable and it is time for bold and thoughtful leadership in the White House," said Secretary Peña.
Peña was the Mayor of Denver in the 1980's before President Clinton selected him to serve as the Secretary of Transportation and later the Secretary of Energy in the 1990's. In 1983, Peña upset a 14 year incumbent Mayor to become Denver's first Latino Mayor.
Peña proved to be one of Denver's most ambitious mayors working to provide the city with a world class international airport, a major league baseball team, a new convention center and numerous economic development and infrastructure additions throughout the city. Because of his great success he was selected by President Bill Clinton to serve as the Transportation Secretary through the end of the first term and later served as the Secretary of Energy. In those capacities, he supported investments in transit and highway projects, developed a new international aviation policy opening new routes throughout the globe, and helped restore damaged infrastructure during the California Northridge earthquake and Gulf Coast hurricane in the 1990s.
