    The Senate is losing an institution with the decision of Jesse Helms to retire after three decades of distinguished public service. Senator Helms went to Washington but never became a part of Washington. He has always remained true to his conservative principles and to the people of North Carolina who elected him five times. Senator Helms is a true gentleman, known for treating his colleagues with the utmost respect and courtesy, regardless of party or policy differences.
As chairman and ranking Republican of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms has been a tireless defender of our Nation's freedom and a champion of democracy abroad. When Senator Helms retires, the Senate will have lost a respected leader, but I have no doubt we will continue to seek his counsel as a senior statesman.
Laura and I extend our best wishes to Jesse, his wife, Dot, and the entire Helms family.
