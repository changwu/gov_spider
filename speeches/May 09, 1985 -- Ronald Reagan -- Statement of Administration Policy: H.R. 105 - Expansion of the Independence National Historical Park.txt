    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Foglietta (D) Pennsylvania)
The Administration opposes H.R. 105, because (1) the area to be added to the Park, Washington Square, is not nationally significant and, (2) inclusion in the Park would probably lead to Federal acquisition, rehabilitation, and operation of the area, which is unwarranted given the lack of national significance. Rehabilitation would cost about $2.3 million, while annual operations and maintenance costs would be about $161,300.
