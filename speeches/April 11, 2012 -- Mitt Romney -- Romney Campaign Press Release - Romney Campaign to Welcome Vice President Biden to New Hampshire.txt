    On Thursday, Vice President Biden will be in New Hampshire campaigning for President Obama. Former New Hampshire Governor John Sununu today made the following statement on Vice President Joe Biden's visit:
"I don't agree with much of what Joe Biden says, but I completely agreed with him in 2007 when he said Barack Obama wasn't ready to be president. That was true then, and is still true today. I welcome the Vice President to New Hampshire, and I hope he continues to visit our state â€” because it gives us a very visible opportunity to talk about the failures of this administration."
