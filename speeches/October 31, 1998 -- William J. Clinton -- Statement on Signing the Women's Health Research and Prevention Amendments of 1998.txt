    Today I am pleased to sign into law S. 1722, the "Women's Health Research and Prevention Amendments of 1998," which will significantly advance women's health by strengthening national efforts to improve research and screening on diseases with particular impact on women, including osteoporosis, breast and ovarian cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.
This bill will authorize several women's health and research screening activities at the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control for the next 5 years. It will expand coordinated Federal research into heart disease, strokes, and other cardiovascular diseases among women. In addition, life-saving screening for breast and cervical cancer will continue to be made available to thousands of low-income women.
I commend the sponsors of this bipartisan legislation, including Senator Bill Frist and cosponsors Senators Barbara Boxer, Barbara Mikulski, and Patty Murray, for their contributions that will help protect women from these deadly diseases and advance our scientific knowledge.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, October 31, 1998.
