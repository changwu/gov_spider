    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and ordered Federal aid to supplement Commonwealth and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms and flooding during the period of April 25-28, 2011.
Federal funding is available to Commonwealth and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms and flooding in the counties of Bradford, Lycoming, Sullivan, Tioga, and Wyoming.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures for all counties in the Commonwealth.
W. Craig Fugate, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Thomas J. McCool as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
FEMA said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the Commonwealth and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
