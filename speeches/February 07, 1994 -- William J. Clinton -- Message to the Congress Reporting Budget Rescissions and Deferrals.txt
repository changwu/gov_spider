    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report one revised deferral of budget authority, totaling $1.6 billion, three revised rescission proposals, and 27 new proposed rescissions of budget authority. The total of the rescission proposals included in this special messages is $1.6 billion. When combined with rescissions that went to the Congress on November 1, 1993, there are $3.2 billion in rescissions pending before the Congress.
The details of the revised deferral, which affects International Security Assistance, are contained in the attached report. The proposed rescissions affect International Security Assistance Programs; the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, State, Transportation, and the Treasury; the General Services Administration; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the Board for International Broadcasting; the National Science Foundation; and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
