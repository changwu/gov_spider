    I applaud the House of Representatives for soundly rejecting the "Reinstate the Draft" bill, sponsored by Congressman Rangel in the House and Senator Hollings in the Senate. If this bill were presented to me, I would veto it. America's all-volunteer military is the best in the world, and reinstating the draft would be bad policy. We have increased pay and benefits to ensure that our troops have the resources they need to fight and win the war on terror. I want every American to understand that, as long as I am President, there will be no draft.
