    ON BEHALF of the American people I congratulate and commend you and your crew on your successful effort to repair the world's first true space station.
In the 2 weeks since you left the Earth, you have more than fulfilled the prophecy of your parting words, "We can fix anything." All of us now have new courage that man can work in space to control his environment, improve his circumstances, and exert his will even as he does on Earth.
