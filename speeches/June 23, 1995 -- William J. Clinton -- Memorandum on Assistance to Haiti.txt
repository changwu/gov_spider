Memorandum for the Secretary of State; The Secretary of the Treasury; The Secretary of Defense; The Attorney General
Subject: Drawdown of the Commodities and Services from the Inventory and Resources of the Departments of Defense, Justice, Treasury and State to Support Accelerated Training and Equipping of Haitian Police Forces
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 552(c)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2348a(c)(2) (the "Act"), I hereby determine that:
(1) as a result of an unseen emergency, the provision of assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act in amounts in excess of funds otherwise available for such assistance is important to the national interests of the United States; and
(2) such unforeseen emergency requires the immediate provision of assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act.
I therefore direct the drawdown of commodities and services from the inventory and resources of the Departments of Defense, Justice, Treasury and State of an aggregate value not to exceed $7.0 million to support accelerated training, equipping and deployment of Haitian police forces.
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to report this determination to the Congress and to arrange for its publication in the Federal Register.
William J. Clinton
