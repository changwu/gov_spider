Last night's Democratic debate was what we expected — failed policies from the past and calls for a larger, more intrusive federal government.Some Americans took to Google to get their real questions answered, and the questions asked about Hillary Clinton, well:


Two of the top searched questions on Google for Hillary Clinton are likely not about the themes her campaign hopes to highlight.
"Will Hillary Clinton get prosecuted?" is most searched question on Google ahead of the Democratic debate on Sunday night. "Will Hillary Clinton win the nomination?" is second and "What did Hillary Clinton do that is illegal?" is the third.
Marco was right when he said that Hillary Clinton is disqualified from serving as Commander-in-Chief — and it looks like many Americans agree.
