Excerpts from President Donald J.

Hispanic-American unemployment has fallen to the lowest rate ever recorded!…Our agenda is delivering remarkable opportunity and security to millions of hardworking Hispanic-American families. Nearly 40 million Hispanic-Americans live in households benefiting from our expansion of the child tax credit – providing an extra $2,000 yearly for the average family of four....4 out of 5 Hispanic-owned small businesses expect their revenue to increase this year, and half of all Hispanic-owned small businesses plan to hire more workers. In 2019, Latino businesses saw an astonishing 46% increase in revenues!…Since my election, more than 1 million LATINAS have entered the workforce, with their unemployment rate falling to a record low. And I am very proud to report that more LATINAS now own small businesses than ever before!…America stands with the suffering people of Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua in their righteous struggle for liberty—and we continue to work for the day when this will become the first fully free hemisphere in all of human history! Today, we repeat our pledge that America will NEVER be a socialist country.…We are also immensely grateful for the countless Hispanic-Americans proudly serving in local, state and federal enforcement – including the brave Hispanic-Americans protecting our nation on the frontlines as Border Agents. [...] We are immensely grateful for their amazing work seizing drugs, stopping human trafficking, and ensuring a safe, humane and LAWFUL system of immigration.…Our Latino Communities have always been a vital and indispensable part of the American Family. From the beginning of our Republic, the exceptional drive, talent, faith, skill, imagination and devotion of Latino-Americans has uplifted our entire nation.
