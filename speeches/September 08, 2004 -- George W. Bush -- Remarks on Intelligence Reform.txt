    I want to thank the Members who are here. Thank—thank you all for coming today. We are going to discuss intelligence reform. I will be submitting a plan to the Congress that strengthens intelligence re-form—strengthens the intelligence services. We believe that there ought to be a National Intelligence Director who has full budgetary authority. We'll talk to Members of Congress about how to implement that. I look forward to working with the Members to get a bill to my desk as quickly as possible.
It's important we get our intelligence gathering correct. After all, we're still at war. We've got to find the enemy before they hurt us. We've got to do everything we can to protect the homeland. We're still on the offense here in this country. We're chasing down these killers overseas so we don't have to face them here at home. We're making good progress.
Ultimately, we will prevail because liberty changes countries, and liberty changes the habits of people. Liberty promotes peace. And that's why we appreciate the sacrifice of the men and women who wear the uniform. They're serving a great cause. We mourn every loss of life. We'll honor their memories by completing the mission.
Thank you all for coming.
