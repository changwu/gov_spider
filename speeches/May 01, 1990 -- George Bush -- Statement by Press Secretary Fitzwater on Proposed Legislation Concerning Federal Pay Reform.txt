    Today the administration is transmitting to the Congress the Federal Pay Reform Act of 1990. This legislation would reform and modernize the pay system for the Government's white collar civilian employees. The administration's proposal will provide several interim measures to address the most serious recruitment and retention problems and then, over the next several years, will initiate broader reforms of the pay-setting machinery. These changes will help make the system more flexible in responding to the labor market and will strengthen the ties between pay and performance.
The administration feels these changes will enable us to recruit and retain outstanding employees to continue our nation's tradition of excellence in the civil service. We urge prompt congressional enactment of this legislative proposal.
