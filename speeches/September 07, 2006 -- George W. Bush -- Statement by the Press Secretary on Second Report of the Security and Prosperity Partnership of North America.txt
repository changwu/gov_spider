    The President has received the second report of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (SPP) from Secretaries Rice, Gutierrez, and Chertoff.
Canada, Mexico, and the United States launched the SPP in 2005 with the goal of enhancing security, economic growth, competitiveness, and the quality of life of the citizens of our three great nations. The SPP establishes an ongoing dialogue among the neighboring sovereign nations for their mutual strategic benefit.
The "Report to Leaders," signed by the responsible coordinating government agencies of Canada, Mexico, and the United States, outlines progress on specific initiatives of the SPP. The report, which can be found on www.spp.gov, includes an updated version of the work plan reporting on the status of initiatives through mid-June 2006. The report highlights that the SPP constitutes a "comprehensive agenda for cooperation" while "respecting the sovereignty and unique cultural and legal heritage" of each country.
President Bush commends the government agencies involved for their dedication and hard work to achieve the goals of the SPP. The President looks forward to the continuing work of the Partnership as our three countries work to implement the recommendations of the report and continue discussions on other areas of cooperation.
