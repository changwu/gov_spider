    Wednesday, Lt. Gen. John Castellaw released the following statement in response to Trump's comment that he could 'sit down and teach a couple things' to former Army War College dean and retired Army Colonel, Jeff McCausland:
"Donald Trump's disrespect for our military knows no bounds. This week, as brave American troops embarked on a crucial mission supporting anti-ISIS forces in Iraq, Trump was already declaring defeat. He called our leaders stupid for not following his uninformed advice. And now he's personally insulting a military expert and retired Army Colonel who served for 30 years for knocking his 'plan.'"
"A complex operation to take a major city – with hundreds of thousands of civilians, untold traps and IEDs, and the possibility of street-to-street fighting – requires careful planning and methodical execution, not a fly-by-night bum's rush."
"But sadly, none of this is surprising coming from Donald Trump. Over the course of this campaign, he has claimed to know more about military operations than our generals do. He has mocked U.S. prisoners of war. He has insulted Gold Star families. He has joked about how he always wanted a Purple Heart. He has never apologized for any of it. He calls our military a 'disaster' and then turns around and asks the country to make him our Commander-in-Chief. It's a disgrace, and we can never let him assume that sacred role."
Lt. Gen. John Castellaw, USMC (ret) led Marines around the world for 36 years while flying more than two dozen different types of aircraft. Castellaw served with the UN during the Siege of Sarajevo, commanded the American force in the multi-national security and stability operation in East Timor, and as the chief of staff for the U.S. Central Command at the height of the war in Iraq.
