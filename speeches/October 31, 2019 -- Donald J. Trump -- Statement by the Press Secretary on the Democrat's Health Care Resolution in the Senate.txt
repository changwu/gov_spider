    Yesterday, Senate Democrats tried to adopt a resolution that would have rolled back President Donald Trump's policies that encourage States to expand healthcare options through "state innovation waivers." This failed effort on the Senate floor proves that the Democrats' plan is to double-down on unaffordable healthcare and excessive government control.
At a time when Obamacare has already made healthcare too expensive for Americans who buy their own insurance, the Democrats' resolution would have discouraged States from working to make health insurance more affordable for their residents. President Trump's policies regarding state innovation waivers identify flexibilities for States to develop new strategies that help deliver high-quality care.
Everyone knows that Obamacare prices are too high. The average family monthly premium has increased by over $740 since 2013â€”more than the average family's monthly budget for food.
Thirteen Republican and Democrat-led States are already using innovation waivers to provide more affordable health insurance options for Americans. The Administration is doing all it can to help these and other States deliver better options to the American public.
Yesterday's attempt to pass the Democrats' resolution was a show vote and a waste of time. Democrats never had the votes to pass it. These antics will not stop President Trump from continuing to stand against special interests and stand up for American families and workers who deserve affordable healthcare options.
