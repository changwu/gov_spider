    COLUMBIA, S.C. â€” Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign on Saturday released a new television ad that will play in South Carolina ahead of the first-in-the-South primary.
"There is no president who will fight harder to end institutional racism," Sanders says in the spot, which opens with a famous quotation from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. "Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability, but comes through continuous struggle."
Then the narrator recites examples of Sanders' long record on civil rights. "He was there when Dr. King marched on Washington," the narrator says of Sanders. "Unafraid to challenge the status quo to end racial profiling, take on police misconduct and take down a system that profits from mass imprisonment."
