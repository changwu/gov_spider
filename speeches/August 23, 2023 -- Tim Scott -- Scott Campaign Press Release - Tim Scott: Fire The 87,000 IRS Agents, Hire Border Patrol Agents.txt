Tim Scott:  Let's fire the 87,000 IRS agents and hire, or double, the number of Border Patrol agents. I just left Yuma, Arizona about two weeks ago. The most pressing need of the American people, from a national security standpoint, is our southern border. It has led to the death of 70,000 Americans because of fentanyl. Plus, 6 million illegal crossings since President Biden has taken office, and 200 people on our national security watchlists have been caught at our border. How many have not been caught at our southern border? If we just spent $10 billion we could finish the wall. For $5 billion more, we could have military-grade technology to surveil our southern border to stop the flow of fentanyl, and save 70,000 Americans a year. That should be the priority of this government, and as the next President of the United States, I will make that border wall complete.
