    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of John Lindsay. As a Member of Congress, and later as mayor, John Lindsay built a remarkable rapport with the people of New York Cityâ€”people of every race, in every neighborhood, in every walk of life. In times of great change, John Lindsay was a progressive yet pragmatic force for the public interest. New Yorkers and all Americans will miss not only his confident style but his commitment to social progress for all.
