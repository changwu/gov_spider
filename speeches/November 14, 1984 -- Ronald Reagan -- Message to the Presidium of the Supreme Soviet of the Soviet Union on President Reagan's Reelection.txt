    Thank you for your message on the occasion of my reelection as President of the United States. I share your hope that the coming years will be marked by improved relations between our countries.
Despite our different political beliefs and perspectives on international problems, I am confident we can make progress on strengthening peace and resolving our differences through discussions and negotiations. We hope you will join us in the critical work needed to reduce international tensions and to create a safer world.
RONALD REAGAN
