    Rosalynn and I were deeply saddened to learn of the untimely death of our good friend, the Reverend Glendon McCulloch. He was a wise and charitable man whose life and career exemplified the finest qualities of a man of God.
For all of us whose lives he touched, Glendon McCulloch cannot be replaced. We extend our deepest sympathy to Marjorie and the other members of his family.
