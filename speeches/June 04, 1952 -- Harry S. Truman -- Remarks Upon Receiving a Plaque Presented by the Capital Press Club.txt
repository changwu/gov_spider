    I appreciate this presentation very much. It is certainly kind and thoughtful of your Press Club to remember me in this way.
I shall always treasure it, and I hope that I can live up to the sentiments expressed in the sentence which is on the plaque.
I am highly appreciative, and thank you very much.
