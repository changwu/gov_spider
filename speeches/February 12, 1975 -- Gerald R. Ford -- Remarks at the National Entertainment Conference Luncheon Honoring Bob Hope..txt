    BOB, that wonderful ovation sounds just like when I go back up to the Congress of the United States.
Well, Bob, first let me say this luncheon has presented me with some very good news and at the same time some very bad news. The good news, of course, is that my very good friend, Bob Hope, has been named Comedian of the Century, and Bob, I congratulate you for it. Now, the bad news. How am I ever going to explain this to Earl Butz? [Laughter]
Of course, Bob has received a great many honors during his lifetime and deservedly so. In fact, Bob was telling me just last week he received a very special award from a leading student organization, a very special award. They named Bob the George Carlin of the Stone Age. [Laughter]
Bob, I do want to thank you for this constant dedication on your part to humanitarian causes. Just look at what Bob is doing here in Washington. Not only is he getting this award from this great organization but later on he's going over to entertain our fighting forces in the Congress. [Laughter]
Well, the last thing I intend to do is to try to tell jokes in the presence of the master. Bob has spent a lifetime, as we all know, bringing laughter and many happy hours to at least two generations of grateful Americans. Bob is truly the comedian of this century and any other.
Bob, on behalf of all Americans, let me say "thanks for the memory" of all the happiness you have brought to all of us all over the world.
Thank you and congratulations.
