    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee announced today that former Philadelphia Eagles owner and prominent Florida businessman Norman Braman will join Team Rudy. For over thirty years, Braman has led successful businesses in Florida, managed a wide variety of philanthropic activities and been active in the Jewish community.
"I have known Rudy Giuliani for 27 years and have admired his public service record throughout those years. His extraordinary leadership in the aftermath of September 11th is only one example of many that qualify him to be our next president," Braman said.
Braman is one of the original founders and for over 20 years served as President of the Board of Trustees of the Miami Beach Holocaust Memorial. He has served as Campaign Chair of the Greater Miami Jewish Federation and was appointed by President Reagan to the United States Holocaust Memorial Council. Braman is also on the board of directors of various community and civic organizations and is Vice Chairman of the University of Miami Board of Trustees. In 1995, Braman established the Braman Family Foundation, whose annual awards and grants support causes such as the University of Miami Braman Family Breast Cancer Institute. Braman was the owner of the Philadelphia Eagles football team from 1985 to 1994.
"Mr. Braman is a welcome addition to an expanding Florida team that demonstrates the strength of the Mayor's campaign," campaign manager Mike DuHaime said.
