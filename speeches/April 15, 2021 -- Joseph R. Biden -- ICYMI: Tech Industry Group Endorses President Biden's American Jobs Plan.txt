    In case you missed it, Chamber of Progress, a new industry group supported by Facebook, Google, Twitter and Amazon, has announced its support of the American Jobs Plan.
In a Medium post, Adam Kovacevich, CEO and Founder of Chamber of Progress, writes "Better infrastructure makes it easier to do business in the U.S., and investments in people will help more Americans fill the jobs of the future. That's why our organization, Chamber of Progress, supports a corporate tax rate increase to help fund big investments in infrastructure.
While the American Jobs Plan includes a lot of traditional infrastructure like highways and bridges, it also includes a lot of investments to help and train workers; help disadvantaged communities; invest in American growth and manufacturing; and address the climate crisis."
