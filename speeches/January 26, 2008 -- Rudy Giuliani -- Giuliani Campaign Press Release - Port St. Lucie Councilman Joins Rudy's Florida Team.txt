    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that Port St. Lucie Councilman Christopher Cooper is backing Mayor Giuliani for President.
"Rudy Giuliani has proven that he is tested and ready to lead now on issues of importance to our state and nation. He alone will cut taxes, reduce spending, and keep our country safe," said Councilman Cooper.
"Councilman Cooper's experience as a local leader is important to our strong grassroots campaign," said Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum, Giuliani's State Chairman. "We're glad to have his support."
Reflecting the campaign's strong grassroots effort, Giuliani has the support of dozens of current and former local, county and state officials. Today's announcement follows the recent endorsement of former U.S. Representative Clay Shaw.
