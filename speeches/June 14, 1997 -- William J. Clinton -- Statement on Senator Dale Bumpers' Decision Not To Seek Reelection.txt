    I have known and admired Dale Bumpers for over 25 years. He was a great Governor, and he has been a great Senator for the people of our native State and the entire Nation. We will miss his courage to stand against the tide, his vision, and his eloquence. Hillary and I wish him and Betty all the best. We will miss him. So will the Senate. So will America.
