    Will Mitt Romney play the middle class card in Florida tonight? He has in his previous Florida visits.
Though Mitt Romney has a net worth of up to $250 million, he considers himself a member of "the great middle class — the 80 to 90 percent of us in this country."
Yesterday in Florida, Romney called for a tax policy to help "us" in the middle class.
Earlier this year — also in Florida — Mr. Romney told an out-of-work voter, "I'm also unemployed."
Hundreds of millions in the bank. Beach and lake houses around the country. A successful career acquiring and dismantling companies and jobs.
Will Middle Class Mitt again grace the stage in the Sunshine State?
