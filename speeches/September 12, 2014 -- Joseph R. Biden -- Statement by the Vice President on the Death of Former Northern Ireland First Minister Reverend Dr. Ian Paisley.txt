    I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Reverend Dr. Ian Paisley. Dr. Paisley was a man who cared deeply about his faith, his family, and his community. Through the negotiation of the St. Andrews Agreement and then during his tenure as First Minister of Northern Ireland, he demonstrated that one can hold strong convictions and still seek meaningful compromise in service of a lasting peace. In doing so, he helped bring stability and hope to Northern Ireland. I send my condolences to his wife Eileen and the rest of his family as they mourn his loss.
