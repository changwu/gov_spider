    The Pawlenty for President campaign announced today that former Republican congressional nominee Jennifer Horn endorses Gov. Tim Pawlenty for president and will be joining his New Hampshire Steering Committee.
"Jennifer has been an articulate and strong conservative voice calling for much needed reform in Washington," Governor Pawlenty said. "I am honored to receive her support in this campaign to restore America."
"The greatest threat to the future of our nation is a government that's become too big to control, too expensive to sustain and too intrusive to allow men and women to live in freedom. We need a strong, principled, experienced leader and Governor Pawlenty is that person," said Jennifer Horn. "Governor Pawlenty is the only candidate who has already solved the most critical problems we face today. There is no one in this field that I trust as much as Governor Tim Pawlenty to lead our nation forward, to protect our freedoms, grow jobs, stop the spending and return integrity to Washington."
Jennifer Horn was the GOP nominee for the 2nd Congressional district in 2008. Horn is the founder of "We The People: A First-in-the-Nation Freedom Forum" â€“ a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting and preserving the founding principles of the nation. Horn has been an award-winning radio talk show host, newspaper columnist and small business owner. Recently, Jennifer was named the Women of the Year by the Nashua Area Federated Republican Women.
