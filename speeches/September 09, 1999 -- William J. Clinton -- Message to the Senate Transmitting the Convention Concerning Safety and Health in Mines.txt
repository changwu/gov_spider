    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification of the Convention (No. 176) Concerning Safety and Health in Mines, adopted by the International Labor Conference at its 82nd Session in Geneva on June 22, 1995, I transmit herewith a certified copy of that Convention.
The report of the Department of State, with a letter from the Secretary of Labor, concerning the Convention is enclosed.
As explained more fully in the enclosed letter from the Secretary of Labor, current United States law and practice fully satisfies the requirements of Convention No. 176. Ratification of this Convention, therefore, would not require the United States to alter in any way its law or practice in this field.
Ratification of additional ILO conventions will enhance the ability of the United States to take other governments to task for failing to comply with the ILO instruments they have ratified. I recommend that the Senate give its advice and consent to the ratification of ILO Convention No. 176.
