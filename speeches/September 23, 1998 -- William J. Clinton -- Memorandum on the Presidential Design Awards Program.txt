    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Subject: Presidential Design Awards Program
The strength of our economy and quality of life in America owe much to the genius and creativity of designers. From using simple brick and mortar to developing sophisticated computers, designers have turned the dreams of the Nation into reality.
As the single largest purchaser of design services, the Federal Government has been a leader in fostering design excellence. Begun in 1983, the quadrennial Presidential Design Awards Program recognizes successful achievements in Federal design and promotes standards of excellence throughout the Federal Government. By this memorandum, I am pleased to announce the call for entries for the next round of awards. This round will include special Presidential Design Excellence Millennium Awards in recognition of Federal design projects that have made a significant contribution to the environment and quality of life of the Nation during this century.
The National Endowment for the Arts and the General Services Administration will implement the Presidential Design Awards Program. Please designate an individual with an appropriate background and position to serve as your liaison to ensure the success of this important program. Good design combines problem solving with cost-effectiveness and performance with beauty, and I urge all agencies to integrate good design into their programs.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
