    Today's bipartisan budget vote in the House is a victory for fairness and the American people. I commend Republicans and Democrats for joining together to pass a budget framework that will return money to the taxpayers and provide reasonable spending increases. The economy continues to show troubling signs, and we must take decisive steps, like this vote today, to ensure sound fiscal policy. The American people can take heart that tax relief is one important step closer to reality.
