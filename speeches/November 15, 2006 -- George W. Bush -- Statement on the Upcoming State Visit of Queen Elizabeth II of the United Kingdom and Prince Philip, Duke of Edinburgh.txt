    Laura and I welcome Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and His Royal Highness Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, for a state visit in May 2007 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the Jamestown Settlement. The United States and the United Kingdom enjoy an extraordinary friendship that is sustained by deep historical and cultural ties and a commitment to defend freedom around the world. We look forward to Her Majesty's state visit as an occasion to celebrate these enduring bonds.
