    Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart made the following statement on President Obama's remarks at NALEO:
"President Obama's attacks on job creators and small businesses are attacks on the Hispanic community. Like all Americans, the Hispanic community's greatest concerns heading into the election in November are jobs and the economy. President Obama has demonstrated that he would rather change the subject than talk about our nation's suffering economy, but we won't be fooled by the shell games and the last minute political gimmickry President Obama is playing to distract from his record. The Hispanic community values entrepreneurship and family-owned businesses, and we deserve a leader in Washington who is dedicated to creating an environment where our values, our goals, and our dreams of prosperity can become reality."
