    On behalf of the American people, President and Mrs. Bush offer their warmest congratulations to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth and to the people of the United Kingdom on the occasion of the Queen's Golden Jubilee.
The United States has no closer ally than Great Britain. Our nations share an exceptionally close relationship based on innumerable personal and business ties among our people, a common culture, language and civilization, and a political and military alliance that is successfully facing common threats. All Americans send their best wishes to Her Majesty The Queen, and to the people of the United Kingdom, as they celebrate this important event.
