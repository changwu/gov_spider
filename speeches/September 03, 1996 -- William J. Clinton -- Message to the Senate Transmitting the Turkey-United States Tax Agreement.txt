    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Turkey for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, together with a related Protocol, signed at Washington March 28, 1996. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Agreement.
This Agreement, which is similar to tax treaties between the United States and other OECD nations, provides maximum rates of tax to be applied to various types of income, protection from double taxation of income, exchange of information to prevent fiscal evasion, and standard rules to limit the benefits of the Agreement to persons that are not engaged in treaty shopping.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this Agreement and related Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, September 3, 1996.
