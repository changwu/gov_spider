    I am pleased that the House today joined the Senate in passing the "Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act," a bill that will provide limited liability protections for sharing information while protecting consumers from misleading statements. This important bipartisan legislation, based on a proposal by my administration, will help our Nation prepare its computer systems for the new millennium.
By encouraging greater information sharing about Y2K solutions, this legislation will help businesses, State and local government, and Federal agencies in their efforts to address the year 2000 computer problem. I look forward to signing it into law.
