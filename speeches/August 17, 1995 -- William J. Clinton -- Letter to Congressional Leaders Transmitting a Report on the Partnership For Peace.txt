    Dear Mr. Chairman: (Dear Claiborne:) (Dear Lee:)
In accordance with Section 514(a) of Public Law 103-236 (22 U.S.C. 1928(a)), I am submitting to you this report on implementation of the Partnership for Peace (PFP) initiative.
The ongoing adaptation of Europe's security structures to post-Cold War realities remains one of our highest foreign policy priorities. A central element of this adaptation is the extension of NATO's zone of stability and security to include Europe's emerging democracies. Over the past year and a half the Partnership for Peace has made a significant contribution to this goal by forging new cooperative ties between the Alliance and its partners. This U.S. initiative has united NATO Allies with former adversaries and traditionally neutral states in a partnership based on respect for democratic principles, peaceful resolution of disputes, and practical cooperation. Consistent with our broad, inclusive approach to European security, the Partnership embraces 26 partner states, including Russia.
For all Partners, PFP will be an enduring instrument for forging stronger ties with NATO. For those Partners interested in joining NATO, PFP will be the path to membership.
Already, through joint training exercises and other PFP activities, PFP is helping interested Partners improve the ability of their forces to work alongside NATO's for possible future joint missions. As you will see from the attached report, NATO and its partners have made impressive progress in broadening and deepening the Partnership over the past year. We are working with our Allies and Partners to build on the Partnership's early momentum, in the shared conviction that cooperation and common action are among the best means to achieving lasting peace and security throughout the Euro-Atlantic area.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
