    This morning in the Oval Office, the President met with nurses from across the country to discuss commonsense immigration reform. The President underscored his commitment to passing commonsense immigration reform and highlighted the importance of this issue to nurses and medical professionals. The first line of defense between the suffering of an injured laborer and proper medical treatment is a nurse. By reforming our legal immigration system we can bolster public health by providing immigrant nurses an opportunity to stay in the United States legally and grow their skills, while also attracting the best and brightest immigrants from around the globe to help meet the needs of our growing health care industry.
The President reaffirmed he will continue to do what he can to rally supporters because he wants to see immigration reform become a reality. He emphasized that Congress must act to pass commonsense immigration reform and that there is no excuse for House Republicans to continue delaying action. Both the President and the nurses agreed that commonsense immigration reform would benefit communities across the country and boost our economy. The President thanked the nurses for their leadership and for all that they do in their communities.
