I hope you can attend a free campaign rally we are hosting in Des Moines at Wooly's TONIGHT at 504 East Locust Street. The doors open at 6PM.
I am excited to say country music star Josh Turner will be performing at the event. If you don't know much about Josh, I encourage you to search on itunes or google his songs: Long Black Train, Why Don't We Just Dance and Everything is Fine. He is a great musician and a better person and someone I am proud to call a friend.
