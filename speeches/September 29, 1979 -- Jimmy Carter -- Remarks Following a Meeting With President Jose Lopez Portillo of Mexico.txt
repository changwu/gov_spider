    PRESIDENT CARTER. I would like to say to the press that President Lopez Portillo and I have had very friendly and constructive and profitable discussions this last 2 days. We have prepared a joint Communiqu√© to outline the results of our discussions.
But I believe that this visit has been not only a delightful one for us but has served to convince the people of our two countries that we live in a state of harmony, of mutual purpose, and of friendship and of cooperation. And I'm deeply grateful to President Lopez Portillo for his contribution to the outcome of this meeting.
Thank you.
PRESIDENT LOPEZ PORTILLO. Thank you very much, Mr. Carter.
Yes, actually, I do want to say that our meetings have been very good ones. I'm very grateful to President Carter.
The meetings have taken place within the framework within which they have taken place during our other two previous times. There's a framework of friendship and deep understanding. They have served to prove that the lines of communication are alive and working. And this is the only way that it can be and the way that it should be. This is the only way in which we can guarantee our constant contact, communication, for harmonious coexistence and the only manner in which all the countries of the world can live within a system of dignity and peace.
Thank you.
