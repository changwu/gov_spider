    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:) 
Pursuant to the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), I report that I have signed an Executive Order amending Executive Order 13223 (Ordering the Ready Reserve of the Armed Forces to Active Duty and Delegating Certain Authorities to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation), which provided additional authorities to certain executive departments and agencies in furtherance of the national emergency declared in Proclamation 7463 of September 14, 2001 (Declaration of National Emergency by Reason of Certain Terrorist Attacks). This amendment makes available to the Secretaries concerned the authorities set forth in section 688 and section 690 of title 10, United States Code. In the case of the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, such authority shall be exercised subject to the direction of the Secretary of Defense.
I have enclosed a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
