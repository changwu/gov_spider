"It is outrageous and totally unacceptable that aspiring Americans and others in Flint cannot get the clean drinking water they desperately need because they don't have the proper identification. This is a humanitarian crisis. No one should live in fear of being deported for getting a bottle of water for their family. All people, including immigrants, should have access to clean and drinkable water, regardless of immigration status or lack of identification.
"The state of Michigan and the National Guard should provide all emergency services to the approximately 1,000 aspiring Americans that reside in Flint and provide comprehensive bilingual information on the dangers of drinking this poisonous water.
"The federal government must also halt all immigration raids immediately. These inhumane raids are having a chilling effect across the country, especially in Flint, preventing some of the most vulnerable people in this country from stepping out of their homes, let alone seeking clean water for their families."
