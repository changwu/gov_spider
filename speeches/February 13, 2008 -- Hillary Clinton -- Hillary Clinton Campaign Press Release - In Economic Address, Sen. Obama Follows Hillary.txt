Sen. Obama is scheduled to deliver a "major economic address" today in Wisconsin. It appears from excerpts released in advanced that the only new proposal from Sen. Obama is an "infrastructure bank."
This was proposed by Hillary in August, when she also co-sponsored legislation to create the infrastructure bank:
And I'm proud to co-sponsor Senator Dodd and Senator Hagel's National Infrastructure Bank Act that we just introduced to establish a federally-backed independent bank that will evaluate and finance large infrastructure projects by subsidies, loan guarantees, and bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. [Rebuilding America speech, 8/8/07; S. 1926, 8/1/07]
