    The United States condemns in the strongest terms today's terrorist attack in Mohmand Agency, Pakistan, which has killed as many as 25 and injured many more. This attack against civilians at a mosque during Friday prayers is an appalling reminder that terrorism threatens all countries in the region, and we send our deepest condolences to the loved ones of those killed as well as our thoughts and prayers to those injured. The United States stands with the people of Pakistan against the scourge of terrorism and will continue to work with the Government of Pakistan against those who committed such outrageous attacks.
