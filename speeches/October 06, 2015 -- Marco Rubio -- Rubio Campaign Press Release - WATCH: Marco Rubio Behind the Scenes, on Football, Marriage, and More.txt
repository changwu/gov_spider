Marco on what his football career taught him:

To fight through adversity, to execute a plan. You put yourself in the best position possible to win by coming up with the best plan that gives you a chance to win.
On the American Dream:

I just grew up with parents who taught me that I could have the same dreams and the same future as the children of millionaires and presidents and others because this was a great country that rewarded you on the basis of merit and hard work, not connections.
