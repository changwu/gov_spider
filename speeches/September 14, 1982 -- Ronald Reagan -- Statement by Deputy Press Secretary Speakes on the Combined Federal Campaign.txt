    The President today asked Federal workers in the National Capital area to join wholeheartedly in supporting the Combined Federal Campaign to support nearly 300 private, voluntary health and welfare organizations.
The President urged Cabinet officers and agency heads to actively support the 22,000 key workers who will be contacting fellow employees during the CFC.
Drew Lewis, Secretary of Transportation and Chairman of the Combined Federal Campaign in the Washington area, will kick off the drive on September 28 at a meeting to be attended by more than a thousand Federal employees, ranking administration officials, and government labor union leaders.
The goal of the CFC in the Capital area is $15.8 million, $2 million more than last year. More than 50 additional voluntary agencies are participating this year for the first time.
The President noted that he had encouraged corporations, civic groups, and philanthropic, religious, and voluntary organizations to increase their involvement in meeting community needs. He said the CFC is an opportunity to put these practices into effect and help all Americans become less dependent on government and more reliant on private initiatives.
The President endorsed the 1982 CFC drive in a meeting at the White House, where he was joined by Chairman Lewis.
