    Holds Roundtables With Young Undecided Voters In New Hampshire; Launches "Ask Hillary" Feature on Facebook
The Clinton Campaign continued its outreach to young voters Saturday, holding roundtables with undecided Granite Staters and launching an "Ask Hillary" feature on the campaign web site to allow voters to pose questions directly to Hillary.
"I want to hear from young voters about their concerns and encourage them to participate in this incredible process," Clinton said. "I have been making change for 35 years, and with their help, I will go to work on Day One to make change in the White House."
Hillary and Chelsea Clinton will hold a roundtable with four undecided voters ages 18 to 25 on the campaign bus traveling between Penacook and Durham today, fielding a range of questions on the most pressing issues facing young people in New Hampshire. Among the undecideds will be Ben Coleman of Bristol, who celebrates his 18th birthday today and plans to major in science and mathematics at the University of New Hampshire.
In Durham, Hillary will continue her outreach to young voters, holding an hour-long conversation with 30 young undecideds at the Bagelry.
Also Saturday, the campaign launched an "Ask Hillary" feature on its web site, reaching out directly to Hillary's Facebook supporters in conjunction with tonight's ABC/Facebook debate in Manchester. Voters can submit questions to Hillary over the next two days, and she'll post video answers to the top five questions on the site early next week. Questions can be submitted at www.hillaryclinton.com/ask.
