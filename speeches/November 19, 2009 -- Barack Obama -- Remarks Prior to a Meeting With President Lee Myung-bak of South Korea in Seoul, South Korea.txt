    President Obama. Well, Mr. Presidentâ€”I was telling the President, and I think the delegation would agree, that this was the most spectacular ceremony for a state visit that we've been involved with since we've traveled. And I was saying that I especially enjoyed the traditional dress of some of the soldiers.
President Lee. But traditional uniforms are quite difficult to fight in. [Laughter]
President Obama. That's true, that's true.
President Lee. Well, first of all, Mr. President, welcome. And you're bringing very nice weather with you, because up until yesterday it was subzeros, frigid cold. [Laughter]
Well, once again, Mr. President, welcome to the Asian region, and of course, welcome to Korea. I know that your visit to Japan and China has been very successful. And, Mr. President, as we all like to say, you saved the best for last. [Laughter]
President Obama. Well, Mr. President, let me just say that we have been so gratified by the warmth with which we've been received here in the Republic of Korea. And I think there's every indication that the alliance between our two countries has never been stronger.
