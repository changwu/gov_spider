    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Berman (D) California and others)
The Administration welcomes the strong support of Congress for United States' efforts to alleviate the current plight of Kurdish and other refugees and displaced persons in and around Iraq. On April 25, 1991, the President transmitted a supplemental appropriation request for aid for these refugees and displaced persons, as well as for peacekeeping activities.
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2122, which provides authorization for the President's appropriations request, and will work with Congress to conform certain of the bill's provisions more closely to that request.
