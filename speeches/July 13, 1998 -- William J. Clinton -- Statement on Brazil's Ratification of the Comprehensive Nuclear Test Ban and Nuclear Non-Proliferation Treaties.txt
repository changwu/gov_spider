    Today Brazil ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). I want to congratulate President Cardoso and the Government of Brazil for taking this historic step.
Brazil's decision renews momentum for the international effort to halt the spread of nuclear weapons and promote disarmament around the world. At a time when actions by India and Pakistan threaten a nuclear competition in South Asia, Brazil has chosen a different course—to invest in its people, not in a costly arms race.
Brazil's action today to ratify the CTBT makes it all the more important for the U.S. to do the same. I call on our Senate to act expeditiously to approve the CTBT—already signed by 149 nations and supported by the Joint Chiefs of Staff—so that the United States can lead in this vital endeavor.
