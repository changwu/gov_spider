    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revision)(Senate)(Sen. Stafford (R) VT and 39 others)
The Administration supports reauthorization of higher education programs, but has very serious concerns regarding the enactment of S. 1965. The bill expands student aid programs in various ways which would result in increased expenditures, well beyond spending levels reflected in the President's Budget and in the recent Senate Budget Resolution. It also creates new programs, and reauthorizes and expands others at a time when extreme budget restraint is needed. In light of the deficit reduction requirements of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-177), it is not appropriate to authorize higher spending levels of this magnitude.
