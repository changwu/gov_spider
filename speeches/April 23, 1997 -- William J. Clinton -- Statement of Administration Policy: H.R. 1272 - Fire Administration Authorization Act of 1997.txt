    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Schiff (R) NM and 7 cosponsors)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 1272. The Administration will, however, seek amendments in the Senate to delete:

Section 5(a), an overly broad prohibition that, if applied literally, would inappropriately and unnecessarily limit FEMA's ability to advise the Congress and the public of its views on pending legislation. This provision is especially troublesome insofar as it purports to constrain the constitutional authority of the President to communicate his views through subordinates to the Congress and the American people.


Section 5(c), an unprecedented provision that would establish "de facto debarment" of certain grant recipients. (The Administration, however, supports the underlying intent of this provision, which is to provide for increased competition for research and development financial assistance.)


Section 8, a "Buy American" provision that could conflict with U.S. obligations under international trade agreements.
