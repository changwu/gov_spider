    Following today's Supreme Court decision upholding the University of Texas' admissions policies, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement:
"The Supreme Court's decision today in Fisher v. University of Texas is a win for all Americans. It means that universities can continue to make diversity and inclusion central goals of their admissions processes, and means our college campuses will continue to be places where young adults of all backgrounds can learn from each other.
"Having a student body with diverse experiences and perspectives breaks down barriers, enriches academia, and prepares our young people to be leaders and citizens in our increasingly diverse country. We need to guarantee that the doors to higher education are open not just to some, but to all—and that we are giving students equal opportunities to succeed and thrive. Today's Supreme Court decision affirms a basic truth about our country: we are stronger together."
