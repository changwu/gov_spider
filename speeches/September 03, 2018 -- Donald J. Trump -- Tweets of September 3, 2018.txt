Richard Trumka the head of the AFL-CIO represented his union poorly on television this weekend. Some of the things he said were so againt the working men and women of our country and the success of the U.S. itself that it is easy to see why unions are doing so poorly.

Happy Labor Day! Our country is doing better than ever before with unemployment setting record lows. The U.S. has tremendous upside potential as we go about fixing some of the worst Trade Deals ever made by any country in the world. Big progress being made!Retweets: 27895Favorites: 124606

Two long running Obama era investigations of two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge just ahead of the Mid-Terms by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department. Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff......Retweets: 20064Favorites: 79126

....The Democrats none of whom voted for Jeff Sessions must love him now. Same thing with Lyin' James Comey. The Dems all hated him wanted him out thought he was disgusting - UNTIL I FIRED HIM! Immediately he became a wonderful man a saint like figure in fact. Really sick!Retweets: 23819Favorites: 100016

I see that John Kerry the father of the now terminated Iran deal is thinking of running for President. I should only be so lucky - although the field that is currently assembling looks really good - FOR ME!Retweets: 25251Favorites: 111098

According to the Failing New York Times the FBI started a major effort to flip Putin loyalists in 2014-2016. 'It wasn't about Trump he wasn't even close to a candidate yet.' Rigged Witch Hunt!Retweets: 18704Favorites: 72600

President Bashar al-Assad of Syria must not recklessly attack Idlib Province. The Russians and Iranians would be making a grave humanitarian mistake to take part in this potential human tragedy. Hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. Don't let that happen!Retweets: 22823Favorites: 88416
