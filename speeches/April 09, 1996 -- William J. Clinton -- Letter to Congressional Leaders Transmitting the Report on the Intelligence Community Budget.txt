In accordance with section 311(b) of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, I transmit herewith the Report on Executive Branch Oversight of the Intelligence Community Budget. This report describes actions taken: (1) to improve budget formulation and execution for national intelligence agencies, (2) to establish more effective financial management throughout the intelligence community, with particular emphasis on the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), and (3) to reduce the forward funding balances of the NRO.
Sincerely,
BILL CLINTON
