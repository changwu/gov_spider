HOUSTON, Texas - Presidential candidate Ted Cruz released the following statement in response to Donald Trump's foreign policy address today.
"Few speeches in campaign history have raised graver problems of public disclosure and accountability by a presidential candidate. Mr. Trump owes a full and immediate accounting to members of the media and the American public. Mr. Trump must confirm or deny reports in the media that others in the Washington Cartel's industry of foreign policy for personal gain were involved in the drafting of this address â€” indeed, were the principal authors. In addition to the authors of the speech, he must fully identify the role and involvement of Mr. Manafort who is widely recognized for his entanglements with corrupt foreign regimes and anti-Democratic rulers.
"This speech is the most dramatic evidence thus far that Donald Trump fails the presidential test. With this address he is now the foreign policy candidate of the Washington lobbyists, even as he proclaims "America first," he puts K Street lobbyists first. He is never going to fight the system, he is the system. He and Hillary Clinton are two sides of the same coin. She has made her millions from inside and Donald Trump has made his billions buying people like Hillary Clinton. Both are part of the culture of foreign policy for personal gain."
