    Today, I am signing into law H.R. 2970, a bill to reauthorize the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Office of Special Counsel and provide additional protections for Federal employee whistleblowers and other victims of prohibited personnel practices.
I have been advised that one provision in this bill (section 9), which concerns the apparent authority of an arbitrator to discipline a Federal employee who was not a party to the original action, raises serious constitutional questions.
Accordingly, I am directing the agencies to follow appropriate procedures to protect the constitutional rights of such Federal employees and to consider the need for remedial legislation.
