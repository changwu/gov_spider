    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revision)(House)(Stark (D) California)
The Administration supports the provision in H.R. 5595 making the SSI work incentive program (section 1619) permanent, but opposes many of the other amendments to the SSI program in the bill that modify the traditional and time-tested measurement of disability, unnecessarily complicate administration, and would add to costs.
