    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Boucher (D) Virginia and 9 others)
The Administration does not object to House passage of H.R. 5344
It should be noted/ however, that since H.R. 5344 was introduced the NSF has devised a technical solution that will expand commercial access to advanced computer networks without the need for additional legislation. Thus, H.R. 5344 could be unnecessary.
