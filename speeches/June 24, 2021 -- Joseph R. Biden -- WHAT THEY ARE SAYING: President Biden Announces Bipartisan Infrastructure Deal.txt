    Today, President Biden announced a historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework that will make life better for millions of Americans, create a generation of good-paying union jobs and spur economic growth. It's an exciting demonstration that we can come together to deliver progress for the American people.
The framework is the largest investment in our infrastructure in a century, and will position American workers, farmers, and businesses ? small and large alike ? to compete and win in the 21st century.
The announcement was met with praise from economists, unions, community leaders, and state, local, and federal elected officials of both parties who thanked President Biden and the senators who co-wrote the proposal for their collaboration and commitment to delivering for families and communities across the country.
See below for what they are saying:
Unions
Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA) General President Terry O'Sullivan: "The bipartisan infrastructure deal announced by the White House is a bold and transformational investment in our nation's infrastructure that will put Laborers to work and help union families build better lives. The $1.2 trillion package will add significantly to existing investment and create hundreds of thousands of good union jobs building our roads and bridges, upgrading our drinking water and power systems, and improving infrastructure resiliency. These investments will bolster our economic well-being and secure our infrastructure for years to come. LIUNA commends the vision of the Biden Administration and the bipartisan group of legislators who have joined with the President to craft an infrastructure package that will build and restore our nation. The collaboration and cooperation from both parties on this historic legislation is both a testament to the importance of infrastructure and an encouraging sign that lawmakers can come together on issues vital to our way of life. We look forward to continuing to work with the Administration and members of Congress for passage of this legislation and to ensure each and every job created through public spending has the strongest of labor protections." [Statement, 6/24/21]
Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO (TTD) President Greg Regan: "Bold, federal investments in our nation's infrastructure ? the kind that will put millions of people to work rebuilding our country and economy ? have long been a top priority for transportation workers and their unions. The announcement today that President Biden and a bipartisan group of Senators have reached an infrastructure deal looks like a significant step forward in meeting the long-neglected needs of our nation's infrastructure and the working families who rely on it. While much work remains to finalize this agreement, TTD looks forward to working with the Biden administration and Congress to ensure that every dollar spent under this agreed upon framework is paired with the strongest labor protections possible that guarantee good jobs and strong worker protections for the Americans who design, build, operate, and maintain our infrastructure." [Statement, 6/24/21]
Business groups
U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Suzanne Clarke: ""Our nation's economic strength and long-term competitiveness depend on a robust and modern infrastructure. We applaud the White House and G21 group of senators for agreeing on a framework to invest in critical, physical infrastructure. We will continue to work with all members of Congress to get this bill passed and signed into law." [Statement, 6/24/21]
Business Roundtable: "Business Roundtable commends Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle and the White House for their leadership and persistence in achieving bipartisan consensus on a framework for infrastructure legislation. The proposal would generate historic investment in our highways, water, energy and communications infrastructure, which is key to bolstering the economic recovery, sustaining jobs and ensuring the U.S. is competitive over the long run," said Business Roundtable President & CEO Joshua Bolten. "Bipartisan solutions advanced through a regular order process would also help ensure durable policy changes and allow responsible regulatory streamlining. While many details remain to be resolved, this proposal is the right approach. Business Roundtable endorses the bipartisan framework, and we will put the full weight of our advocacy behind advancing it. We are strongly supportive of the scope of this bipartisan framework to ensure our infrastructure can meet the needs and demands of our country and its dynamic economy for generations to come," said Brendan Bechtel, Chairman and CEO of Bechtel Group, Inc., and Chair of the Business Roundtable Infrastructure Committee. "Today's announcement is great news. We look forward to partnering with Congress and the Administration to promote strong support for bipartisan infrastructure legislation." [Statement, 6/24/21]
National Retail Federation President and CEO Matthew Shay: "NRF is encouraged by a bipartisan group of Senators and the Biden Administration finding agreement on a framework for an infrastructure package. Infrastructure has always had strong support across the aisle, so crafting a bipartisan pathway for this essential investment is the surest way to achieve progress. Now more than ever, the U.S. needs significant investment to ensure we remain competitive on a global basis. The retail industry relies on our nation's transportation network to move billions of dollars' worth of merchandise every day to warehouses, distribution centers and stores, and ultimately to consumers' front doors. The ongoing supply chain disruptions that retailers and others are continuing to face highlight the need for investment and reform. As witnessed by the ongoing supply chain challenges facing retailers and others, a major infrastructure package needs to focus on improving the overall system, and prioritize safety, efficiency, resiliency and building for tomorrow's needs. We need to ensure that the legislation includes sustainable funding mechanisms without overburdening the businesses that are leading our economy out of the pandemic." [Statement, 6/24/21]
Small Business for America's Future: "Today's deal between the White House and a bipartisan group of senators to support legislation that would invest $1 trillion in the country's infrastructure is a promising development for small business. We are encouraged that a bipartisan group of lawmakers and the White House are making progress on this important legislation and look forward to reviewing the details of the plan. Small business owners are eager for our leaders to pass an infrastructure plan that will help Main Street businesses recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. In Small Business for America's Future's recent national survey of small business owners, 80% support the American Jobs Plan and 72% say the infrastructure investments it represents will help small businesses." [Statement, 6/24/21]
National Association of Manufacturers President and CEO Jay Timmons: "This is how we build to win. This shows that governing with big ideas is still possible in America. Bold infrastructure investment will secure a better future for our nation and industry and help more Americans reach their full potential. And building it on a foundation of bipartisanship and consensus will help restore faith in our institutions?and prove that America can still bridge party divides to do great things. We look forward to reviewing this proposal with our members as more details are shared so we can provide meaningful feedback to policymakers. And manufacturers commend this group of lawmakers for their commitment to forging this potentially historic agreement." [Statement, 6/24/21]
Business Forward: "President Biden has brought America together, just like he promised. This bipartisan plan addresses longstanding problems and invests for the future. It also looks out for our most vulnerable communities. Its principal pay-for, reducing the "tax gap," is years overdue: The first step in paying for "build back better" should be to make sure America's wealthiest families pay the taxes they owe but have evaded for years." [Statement, 6/24/21]
Consumer Brands Association Vice President of supply chain and logistics Tom Madrecki: "The consumer packaged goods industry (CPG), responsible for one-fifth of all freight in the United States, depends heavily on our nation's highways and railways to deliver essential products to Americans across the country. We are pleased to see that the Biden administration and members of Congress are prioritizing solutions over politics and have come to an initial agreement. We hope that rhetoric becomes reality in the immediate future. The CPG industry needs dependable roads, bridges and railways to ensure people can reliably get the products they need ? both now and for the future. America must ready its infrastructure for extreme events like the pandemic, build highway infrastructure to support electric vehicle fleets and expand broadband access to match the country's increasing reliance on e-commerce. As the legislation moves forward, Congress must also consider establishing a federal office of supply chain, as outlined in President Biden's American Jobs Plan, as well as addressing the ongoing trucker shortage with updated driver age and truck weight regulations." [Statement, 6/24/21]
Airports Council International ? North America (ACI-NA): "It is great to see bipartisan agreement about the pressing need to upgrade America's airports," said ACI-NA President and CEO Kevin M. Burke. "For too long U.S. airports have been underfunded and unable to make many of the terminal, runway, and access improvements needed to keep pace with an increasing number of passengers and flights at their facilities. With airports facing over $115 billion in documented infrastructure needs over the next five years, the $25 billion in new investments called for in today's agreement set the stage for major upgrades at our airports that will help the economic recovery and improve the customer experience in communities nationwide." [Statement, 6/24/21]
Jay Jacobs, Head of Research and Strategy, Global X ETFs: "4+ years ago, we ID'd US Infrastructure Development as a powerful theme - not just bc of the trillions needed to rebuild & repair US infra., but bc of the bipartisan support to tackle this issue. Still a long way to go until this theme is fully realized, but today is a great step." [Tweet, 6/24/21]

As a final plan is further defined and comes together, I urge policymakers to aim high and invest in future-proof fiber technology built to last, to ensure that funding is directed towards connecting those most in need first and to coordinate funding among the existing federal and state programs that support and sustain broadband deployment and help keep services in hard-to-reach rural areas affordable. We look forward to continuing to work with Congress and the Biden administration to ensure that everyone has meaningful and lasting access to high-quality internet service." [Statement, 6/24/21]
