    Thomas Girdler, President of Republic Steel Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio.
The Secretary of Labor has advised me that the Steel Mediation Board, of which Mr. Charles P. Taft is chairman, has requested you not to open your Youngstown plant tomorrow, Tuesday morning. In the promotion of public safety and in the interest of a reasonable and peaceful settlement which should be expected and can be attained, I earnestly join with the Board in this request to you.
