    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee announced today that Boca Raton Mayor Steven Abrams is supporting Mayor Giuliani to be the next President of the United States.
"As a fellow Mayor, I know that it takes more than just talk to be a good leader, it takes a list of real results. I've seen what Rudy Giuliani accomplished as the Mayor of New York, cutting taxes 23 times, balancing the budget, and helping to produce more than 423,000 new jobs. I'm proud to support him to be our next president and to work on his behalf in Florida," Mayor Abrams said.
This latest endorsement comes after a recent swing through the state where Mayor Giuliani addressed the House Republican legislative caucus, met with supporters in St. Petersburg, and picked up several key endorsements from Florida officials.
"It's great to have Mayor Abrams on board," campaign manager Mike DuHaime said. "Mayor Abrams has been consistently recognized as a popular leader and is also a distinguished city official."
