    DES MOINES, IA – Iowans for Hillary today unveiled 38 members of Hillary Clinton's Iowa Education Leadership Council and Apple Corps, a team of 167 Iowa education leaders who will support Hillary Clinton in the Iowa Caucuses because of her hard work and experience working to improve our education system. Apple Corps will conduct outreach to Iowa's educators on behalf of the Senator to increase their participation in the caucuses for Hillary Clinton.
"Hillary understands a student's education is critical to their development and as president, she will put the interests of our children first by funding and reforming No Child Left Behind," said Connie Gronstal. "Her 35 years of advocacy and service make her the most qualified candidate to help our children, and because Hillary Clinton is working for us, I am working for her."
"I am honored to have the support of these incredible Iowa educators in our effort to repair our struggling education system," said Senator Clinton. "American children deserve the opportunity to live up to their potential and a high quality education system is essential to achieving that goal."
For 35 years, Senator Clinton has advocated for children and families in America. In the Senate, Hillary Clinton has fought for universal pre-kindergarten and to make college more affordable for working families. As president she will fund and fix No Child Left Behind by tailoring the program to communities' individual needs, and targeting the most struggling schools with interventions that work. Hillary is the most qualified candidate to improve our education system and on her first day in the oval office, she will use that experience to create a better future for our children.
