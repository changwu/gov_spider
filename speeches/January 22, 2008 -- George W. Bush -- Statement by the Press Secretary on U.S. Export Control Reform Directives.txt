    The President signed today a package of directives that will ensure the United States' export control policies and practices support the National Security Strategy of 2006, while facilitating the United States' continued international economic and technological leadership. These new directives will advance a more efficient and transparent export licensing process and enhance dispute resolution mechanisms. They will also help ensure proper levels of control for continued U.S. economic competitiveness and innovation while protecting national security. The Directives are intended to clarify and strengthen the ability of the U.S. Government to monitor and deny U.S. controlled goods, services or technologies to a potential enemy.
The United States continues to face unprecedented security challenges, including terrorist threats from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and advanced conventional weapons to unstable regions of the world. The United States also faces economic challenges from the increasing worldwide diffusion of high technology and global markets. As a result, the Administration will continue to ensure that our export control system is focused to meet these challenges.
