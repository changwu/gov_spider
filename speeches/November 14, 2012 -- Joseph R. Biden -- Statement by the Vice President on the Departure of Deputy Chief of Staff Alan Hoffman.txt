    Vice President Joe Biden issued the following statement in response to the announcement that his deputy chief of staff, Alan Hoffman, is leaving his post this month:
For more than a decade, Alan has been my trusted advisor. As Chief of Staff in my Senate office and Deputy Chief of Staff in the White House, Alan has managed a diverse staff with tremendous leadership, keen intellect, and unwavering loyalty. From his commitment to strengthening our nation's law enforcement, to his tireless advocacy on behalf of the labor community and building a strong middle class, he has always set the highest standard for public service. Alan has my complete respect and admiration, and I'm deeply in his debt for his contributions. I wish Alan all the best. His wisdom, experience, and passion will be greatly missed.
