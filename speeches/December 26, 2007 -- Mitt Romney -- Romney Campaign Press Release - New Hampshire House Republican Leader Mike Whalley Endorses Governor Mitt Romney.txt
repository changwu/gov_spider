Boston, MA â€“ Today, New Hampshire House Republican Leader Michael Whalley announced his endorsement of Governor Mitt Romney. Representative Whalley represents Alton Bay residents in the New Hampshire Legislature.
"Mitt Romney is the candidate with the experience, vision and values to lead America. He is a true fiscal conservative who will cut taxes, end illegal immigration, and strengthen our military. With a record of turning around institutions, I believe he has the experience to do the same in Washington. I'm proud to support Mitt Romney for President and I encourage other Granite State residents to join me in supporting this great man," Representative Whalley said.
"We're very pleased to have Mike Whalley sign on as the newest member of the New Hampshire Romney for President team. From his past service as Deputy House Speaker to his current role as House Republican Leader, Mike is a proven New Hampshire leader who is highly regarded by his peers and by voters across the state. His support is further evidence that Governor Romney's message of strengthening our economy, our military and our families is resonating with the people of New Hampshire," Romney for President New Hampshire State Director Jim Merrill said.
