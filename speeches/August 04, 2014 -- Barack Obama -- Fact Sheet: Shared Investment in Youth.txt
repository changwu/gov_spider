    Africa has the youngest population in the world, with approximately 200 million people between the ages of 15 and 24 - a number expected to increase to 330 million by 2034. Africa also has the fastest growing population in the world. In fewer than three generations, 41 percent of the world's youth will be African. By 2050, over a quarter of the world's labor force will be African. Between 2010 and 2020, Africa will add 163 million people to its potential labor force. In the 21st century, Africa will be the only continent whose youth population will continue to significantly expand. There is a shared understanding between the United States and African partners that the future success of African nations will depend on the leadership, skills, and ingenuity of the continent's youth.
U.S. Commitments to Increase Investment in the Next Generation
In a town hall meeting with 500 young African leaders on July 28, President Obama announced the expansion of his Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI), which was launched in 2010. Through YALI, the United States is investing in the next generation of African leaders, and has committed significant resources to enhance leadership skills, bolster entrepreneurship, and connect young African leaders with one another, with the United States, and with the American people. These new investments will include the development of four Regional Leadership Centers in Africa, a vast array of online classes and resources, and seed funding, training, and networking opportunities for young entrepreneurs.
The President also renamed his flagship program the Mandela Washington Fellowship, in honor of former South African President Nelson Mandela, and announced that the Fellowship will reach 1,000 young leaders each year by 2016.
African Governments' Commitments to Increase Investment in the Next Generation
Many African Governments have been involved in supporting opportunities for youth. Some made commitments to new activities in the course of the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, while others have ongoing initiatives in place. Below is a sampling of African commitments made in connection with the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit.
•    The African Union Commission committed to redoubling its efforts to advance educational opportunities through the Pan-African University; to carry forward the African Youth Charter by urging Member States to consider the African Youth Decade Plan of Action as a road map for implementation; and to propose for adoption by Member States a Declaration and Plan of Action on Employment, Poverty Eradication, and Inclusive Development with a primary focus on youth and women, at the upcoming Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and Governments of the African Union in Ouagadougou in September 2014.
•    Benin, drawing on its successful Business Promotion Centers, has set up two business-type incubators which have already supported more than 2,500 young professional farmers in agricultural entrepreneurship.
