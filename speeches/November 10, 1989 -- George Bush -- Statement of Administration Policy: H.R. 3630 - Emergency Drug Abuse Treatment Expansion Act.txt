    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Waxman (D) CA)
The Administration will not object to House passage of H.R. 3630 because it contains the President's proposal that States be required to develop Statewide Treatment Plans. However, the Administration is seriously concerned with the bill's provisions expanding some, and creating other, new categorical programs.
For example, the bill includes a city-specific program which is objectionable for administrative reasons, and an increase in set-asides in the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services (ADMS) Block Grant. The Administration will urge the conferees to delete these provisions.
The Administration also objects to taking funds from the State-administered ADMS Block Grant Program to create categorical programs. Where a State has specific needs, it would be far preferable for the State to target key areas, assist special populations, and ensure program accountability through its Statewide Treatment Plans.
