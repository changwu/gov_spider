SEN. THOMPSON: "I think that what you heard today from John McCain was a manifesto for constitutional government. It's going to be in sharp contrast in the general election with whoever the Democratic nominee is. They have marched in lockstep in opposing people like Chief Justice John Roberts and supporting every liberal jurist that comes across the spectrum, and stopping those who would apply constitutional principles to their duties on the bench. So the contrast is going to be stark.
"John laid out today the fact that we've always had a respected federal judiciary, and we're doing great damage to that today. Part of it is because the judges legislating from the bench. Part of it is because the United States Senate that will not confirm good judges unless they pass a liberal litmus test. Our system of justice is suffering because of it. People's respect for the federal judiciary is going down, and it's going to take a president to do this. And John McCain will do this."
