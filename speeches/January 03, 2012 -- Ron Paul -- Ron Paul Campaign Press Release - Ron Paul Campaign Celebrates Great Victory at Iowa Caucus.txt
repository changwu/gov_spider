LAKE JACKSON, Texas – The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign is celebrating a great victory with its strong top-three finish at the Iowa Caucus.  Below please find comments from Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton:
"The Ron Paul campaign is celebrating a great victory tonight.
"There were three tickets out of Iowa, and Ron Paul earned one of them.
"One of the three tickets, the one belonging to Rick Santorum, is a dead-end due to Santorum's weak fundraising and lack of national campaign organization.
"This is now a two way race between establishment candidate Mitt Romney and the candidate for real change, Ron Paul.
"Ron Paul has a top notch national organization, tremendous fundraising prowess, and unequaled enthusiasm among his volunteers and supporters.
"Dr. Paul has taken the first step towards earning the delegates it will take to be the GOP nominee and is the only candidate not named Mitt Romney with the ability to do so.
"Ron Paul is now off to New Hampshire, South Carolina, Louisiana, Nevada, Maine, North Dakota, Washington, Colorado, and beyond.
"See you on the campaign trail."
