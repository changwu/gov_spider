    Today, President Donald J. Trump met with senior staff of the National Economic Council (NEC) to discuss his economic growth agenda and to welcome new NEC Director and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy Larry Kudlow. The President is glad to have Director Kudlow on board, following decades of experience in both the private and public sectors, including at the White House under President Reagan. The economy is booming under President Trump's economic agenda: GDP for the fourth quarter was revised up to 2.9 percent from 2.5 percent. Over four million American workers have received pay raises, bonuses, or other benefits from President Trump's tax cuts. Nearly three million jobs have been created since his election. Unemployment has remained steady at 4.1 percent, a sixteen-year low. The number of Americans rating the economy as good to excellent has surged to the highest level in 18 years. Larry and the NEC team look forward to building on the successes of the President's economic agenda, raising wages, and creating jobs across the country. The President also thanked outgoing NEC Director Gary Cohn for his service to the hardworking American men and women who are seeing bigger pay checks and brighter futures thanks to the Trump economy.
