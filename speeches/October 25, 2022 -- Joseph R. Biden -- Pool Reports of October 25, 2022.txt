Q/A transcript
Q: Mr. President, is COVID still a national emergency?
POTUS: It's a necessity to deal with to make sure it doesn't become one.
Q: What's your reaction to the Saudis on oil urging the US not to use the reserves?
(No answer)
Q: Sir, do you think it's a mistake for New York to withdraw it's mandate for vaccines?
Say again? 
Q: Do you think it's a mistake for New York to withdraw its vaccine mandate for private employers?
No, I don't think — that's a local judgement. Thank you.
Q: What is your next move now that Brittney Griner lost her appeal, Mr. President?
We are in constant contact with Russian authorities to get Brittney Griner out, and so far we are not agreeing (inaudible) but we're not stopping.
(CROSSTALK)
Q: On the dirty bomb allegations from Russia as it relates to Ukraine. Do you believe that this is the beginning of a false flag operation? Is Russia preparing to deploy a dirty bomb itself or a nuclear weapon?
I spent a lot of time today talking about that. Let me just say: Russia would be making an incredible, serious mistake if it were to use a tactical nuclear weapon. I'm not guaranteeing that it's a false flag operation yet. Don't know, but it would be a serious mistake, a very serious mistake
