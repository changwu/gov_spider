    WASHINGTON, DC – The Obama Administration will celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month from September 15th through October 15th with the participation of the President, the First Lady, the Vice President and the Second Lady of the United States, along with members of the Cabinet, Senior Administration officials and community partners at conferences, events, and through online features showcasing the impact Hispanics have had on our national life.
Numbering more than 50 million on the mainland and another 4 million in Puerto Rico, Hispanics are no longer found in a handful of states but all across America, according to the latest census numbers. As the largest and fastest growing minority group in America, the Hispanic community's ability to thrive is vital to the future of our nation and is critical to our out-educating, out-innovating, and out-building the rest of the world. In this spirit, the theme of Hispanic Heritage Month 2011 will be "Renewing the American Dream," and will feature a weekly focus on key issue areas including jobs and the economy, healthy communities and healthy families, an education for the 21st century, and celebrating the heritage and contributions of Hispanics to the fabric of America.
In addition to officials leading events and participating in conferences, the White House will feature Hispanics from throughout the Administration who are contributing to the President's vision for winning the future in a daily blog post on "Renewing the American Dream" at http://www.whitehouse.gov/hispanic. On select White House tours, there will also be brochures on the work of the Administration and the Hispanic community and photographs showcasing the same theme.
