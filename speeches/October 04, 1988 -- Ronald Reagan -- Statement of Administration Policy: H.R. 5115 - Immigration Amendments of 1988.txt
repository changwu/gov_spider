    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rodino (D) New Jersey and Mazzoli (D) Kentucky)
The Administration opposes H.R. 5115 because:

—    changes to the legal immigration system should be undertaken in a comprehensive, as opposed to piecemeal, fashion;
—    the bill would, contrary to fundamental principles underlying our immigration laws, favor particular nations, and likely encourage additional legislation to target countries for preferential treatment; and
—    the two visa allocation programs would impose significant costs on the Federal government.
