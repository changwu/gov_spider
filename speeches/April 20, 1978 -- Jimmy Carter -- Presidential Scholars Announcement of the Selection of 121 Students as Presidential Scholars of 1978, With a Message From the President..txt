    The President has sent mailgrams to 121 graduating high school seniors from every part of the country, naming them Presidential Scholars of 1978.
The group includes a boy and a girl from each State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Americans living abroad, and 15 chosen at large.
The students were selected by the Commission on Presidential Scholars in the only nationwide program for honoring academic excellence, leadership, other evidence of superior attainment and, for the first time this year, outstanding ability in the arts.
This is the 15th anniversary of the Presidential Scholars program, which was established by Executive order of President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. The Presidential Scholars receive no monetary award, but they will be brought to Washington May 21 to 25 for a program during which they will receive the 1978 Presidential Scholars medallions. The visit will include special interest seminars conducted by authorities in many fields, appointments with their Senators and Representatives, and forums, symposiums, and other events scheduled at the State Department, the Smithsonian Institution, and other agencies.
The text of the President's mailgram follows:
"What great pleasure it gives me to notify you of your selection as a 1978 Presidential Scholar! The members of the Commission on Presidential Scholars have made their difficult choices and the chairman informs me that you are one of 121 Presidential Scholars selected from across the nation on the basis of scholarship and leadership.
"Mrs. Carter and I are very proud of your achievements as well as your future promise. We hope you will be coming to Washington May 21st-25th, at which time you will receive the Presidential Scholars medallion."
