    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Gillmor (R) OH and 72 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports enactment of H.R. 1831. The bill will promote the cleanup of Superfund sites and reduce needless lawsuits by drawing a bright line between large contributors of toxic waste and small businesses who disposed of only small amounts of waste or ordinary trash. The Administration commends the bipartisan sponsors of H.R. 1831 for developing legislation that will reduce litigation and thereby increase the time and resources that can be spent on cleaning the environment. The Administration will continue to work in the legislative process to address concerns with the provisions that cut off citizens' access to courts and withhold the benefits of the bill for small businesses unless they comply with all information requests imposed by EPA, whether the law requires the furnishing of that information or not.
