    I FIRST MET Martin Luther King when, as Vice President, I headed the U.S. delegation to the ceremonies marking the independence of Ghana. While there, he and I began a conversation that ran long into the night. We talked about the new African nations, about war and peace, and about our country. We talked a long time about the problems of the races in America. Millions of Americans are observing Martin Luther King's birthday today. I remember Dr. King not only for his dream, but for his personal courage. That courage will remain as an inspiration to the Nation long after his dream becomes part of the reality of American life.
