    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICYThis Statement Has Been Coordinated by OMB with the Appropriate Agencies
(House)(Ortiz (D) TX and Thomberry (R) TX)
The Administration supports the underlying goal of H.R. 3910 to provide appropriate emergency drought relief measures to the affected districts in Texas. However, the Administration cannot support provisions in the bill which would circumvent the National Environmental Policy Act and forgive $4 million in Federal debt in order to enable two Texas water districts to augment their water supplies to prepare for future droughts. The Administration will work with the Congress to address these concerns.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 3910 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimates for this bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
