    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revision)(House)(Fuqua (D) Florida)
The Administration opposes House passage of H R. 4252 in its current form because it authorizes appropriations of $18,300,000 for fiscal year 1987 instead of $9,041,000 as requested in the 19B7 Budget.
Therefore, the Administration urges that the bill be considered under regular order to permit an amendment to lower the authorization level in H.R. 4252 to the FY 1987 Budget.
