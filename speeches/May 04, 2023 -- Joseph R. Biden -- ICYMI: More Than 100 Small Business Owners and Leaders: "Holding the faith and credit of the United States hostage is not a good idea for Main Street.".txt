    This National Small Business Week, more the 100 small business owners and small business organizations — including the National Association of Women Business Owners, Veteran Women's Enterprise Center, and others — wrote a letter to congressional leaders warning, "To foster small business success during this critical period, it is essential to avoid destabilizing political conflicts and increase the debt ceiling without arbitrarily cutting spending that would hurt fellow entrepreneurs, veterans, retirees, and curtail our economic recovery."
These small business owners and leaders urged lawmakers to "focus on preventing a default and minimizing harm to small businesses that provide jobs and economic vitality in every community across the country" because "Past debt ceiling debates have led to increased borrowing costs, stock market turbulence, and diminished consumer and business confidence."
As the small business owners and leaders wrote, Speaker McCarthy and House Republicans are "holding the faith and credit of the United States hostage" by refusing to avoid default without slashing vital programs that support small businesses. It would undo the progress made under President Biden and Vice President Harris, with a historic 3.1 million jobs created by small businesses and a record 10.5 million small business applications over the last two years.
Read the full letter below: 
May 2, 2023  Dear Speaker McCarthy, House Democratic Leader Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Schumer, and Senate Republican Leader McConnell:
As small business owners and leaders, we recognize the remarkable progress the U.S. economy has made since the depths of the pandemic. With low unemployment, robust hiring, and a surge in small business starts, there is reason to believe our economy will continue to recover through prudent investments and careful management. To foster small business success during this critical period, it is essential the country avoid destabilizing political conflicts.
A political fight over raising the debt ceiling will result in economic repercussions and threaten the well-being of small business owners. Past debt ceiling debates have led to increased borrowing costs, stock market turbulence, and diminished consumer and business confidence. Such outcomes disproportionately impact small businesses, which generally have fewer resources to navigate economic uncertainties compared with larger organizations. To foster small business success during this critical period, it is essential to avoid destabilizing political conflicts and increase the debt ceiling without arbitrarily cutting spending that would hurt fellow entrepreneurs, veterans, retirees, and curtail our economic recovery. Debate is good and conversations about the nation's fiscal health should happen in the normal legislative process. Holding the faith and credit of the United States hostage is not a good idea for Main Street.
We implore lawmakers in Washington to embrace action and prioritize swiftly resolving the debt ceiling issue to safeguard the economic progress we have achieved. Lawmakers must focus on preventing a default and minimizing harm to small businesses that provide jobs and economic vitality in every community across the country. With your support, we can continue to expand our economy and empower Main Street to rebuild even stronger.
Sincerely, Small Business for America's Future
