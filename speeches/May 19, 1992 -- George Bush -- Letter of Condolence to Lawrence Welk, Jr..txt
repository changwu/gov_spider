    Dear Larry,
Barbara and I send to you and all your family our most sincere condolences. Your great and admired Dad set a wonderful, wholesome example for this Country. His personal story inspired us all and his music had broad appeal. Lawrence Welk was truly a great American.
Please convey our deepest sympathy and special prayers to all in your family.
Sincerely,
George Bush
