    The Dole for President campaign today challenged Republican presidential primary candidate Steve Forbes' commitment to seniors and social security in a 30-second TV ad now airing in Iowa and New Hampshire.
"Steve Forbes wants to kick older Americans out of the workplace. He supports mandatory retirement in the private sector at age 65. In his column in Forbes magazine, Forbes said forcing seniors to retire will prevent what he calls 'hardening of the managerial arteries.' Clearly, Steve Forbes is no friend to America's senior citizens," said Dole National Campaign Manager Scott Reed.
Reed added: "Forbes may not think so, but senior citizens are a skilled, valuable resource in our work force. They should be allowed to work if they want to and their company wants them to. Of course, if you are a billionaire, you can easily afford to retire at sixty five. But many workers simply cannot afford to retire at that age. Clearly, Forbes is out-of-touch with their daily lives and out-of- touch with middle America."
The more you learn about Steve Forbes, the more you realize he's just not ready for the Presidency," Reed concluded. "Senior citizens and Americans of all ages can't afford his risky ideas and untested leadership."
