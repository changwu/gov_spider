    On the occasion of the High Holy Days, Rosalynn and I welcome the opportunity to greet our fellow Americans of the Jewish faith.
The New Year is a time of selfexamination and moral rededication. The traditional commitments you make on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are an important contribution to the strength and vitality of our nation. The New Year is also a time to reaffirm those common, cherished, ethical principles and values which form the foundation of our democratic society.
We pray with you as you seek sustenance and as you set out refreshed and recommitted to our common effort to defend peace and protect the lives and human rights of all our fellows on this globe. We face a formidable task, but as the great Jewish sages remind us, while we are not required to complete our task, neither are we free to shrink from it. Therefore, let us continue in the pursuit of that which is right for our nation and for people throughout the world.
Rosalynn and I trust you will find personal renewal in these Holy Days and that your prayers and acts will advance our shared hopes for a just and peaceful world.
