    In Jewish places of worship the world over, the stirring call of the ram's horn, the shofar, will be heard symbolizing as it has for centuries the observance of Bosh Hashanah. On this most solemn occasion, Nancy and I express our warmest greetings to the Jewish people and join with you in your prayers for the New Year.
The High Holy Days are a time for introspection, atonement, and renewalâ€”a time when those of the Jewish Faith pause to reflect upon the year which has passed and pray for the year which lies ahead. We join with you in the spirit of this holiday, for it is only by seeking the truth within our own hearts and acknowledging the sacred purpose of human life that we may, in the words of your tradition, "be inscribed and sealed in the book of life."
You have our every good wish that this new year, 5742, will advance your cherished hopes that human understanding and peace take the place of terrorism and violence, that the needs of the hungry and the poor be satisfied meaningfully throughout the world, and that there be progress toward the prophetic ideal that "nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore."
