    Des Moines Register: Kasich ramps up Iowa campaign
By William Petroski â€” Sept. 17, 2015
Ohio Gov. John Kasich is ramping up his Iowa caucus campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, an indication that he plans to take Iowa more seriously.
Cory Crowley, a Cedar Rapids native and former aide to U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has been named state director and strategist for Kasich's Iowa campaign. He directed U.S. Rep. David Young's successful campaign last year in Iowa's 3rd Congressional District.
Meanwhile, state Rep. Mary Ann Hanusa, R-Council Bluffs, has been named Kasich's Iowa campaign chairman. Before she was elected to the Iowa House, Hanusa worked in Washington, D.C., for President George W. Bush as director of the Office of Presidential Personal Correspondence.
Kasich is polling third among GOP presidential candidates in New Hampshire with an average of 10.3 percent, behind Donald Trump and Ben Carson, according to RealClearPolitics.com. Until now, he has placed much less emphasis on Iowa, where he is averaging just 3 percent.
Crowley said Kasich has been endorsed by former Iowa House Speaker Brent Siegrist of Council Bluffs and is planning a more intensive campaign in Iowa than initially envisioned. While Kasich won't campaign in all 99 Iowa counties, he does plan a statewide organizing effort.
