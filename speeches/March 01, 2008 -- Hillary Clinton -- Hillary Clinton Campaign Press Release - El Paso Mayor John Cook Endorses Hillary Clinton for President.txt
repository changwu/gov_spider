    Mayor Presents Hillary with Key to the City for Her Commitment to El Paso, Largest City on the U.S-Mexico Border
El Paso, TX - The Clinton campaign today announced the endorsement of El Paso Mayor John Cook and his wife Tram.
"I'm endorsing Hillary Clinton because only she has the experience we need to bring real change in this country," El Paso Mayor John Cook said. "Hillary Clinton has a long history in our state: Hillary knows Texas and understands the challenges border communities like ours face. I know she will make an outstanding President."
"Since Hillary, President Clinton, and Chelsea Clinton have each visited El Paso and have really taken the time to listen to us, I am thrilled to give Hillary a key to our city," Mayor Cook said.
"I am honored to receive the endorsement of Mayor Cook and I was so touched to receive the key to the City of El Paso," Hillary Clinton said. "As president, I will continue listening to border communities to find real solutions on issues like health care and immigration."
The Clinton Campaign also announced that the Mayor will serve as part of Hillary Clinton's National Mayor's Council. Since being elected Mayor in 2005, Cook has focused on strengthening the El Paso economy. Prior to his election, Cook served as an El Paso City Representative and was the President of the El Paso Health Care Facilities Financing Corporation. He was formerly the Volunteer Executive Director of the El Paso Charities Communities Chest and also served our nation in the U.S. Army.
Mayor Cook's endorsement adds to the strong momentum for Hillary Clinton in El Paso. Hillary has also been endorsed by U.S. Representative and House Committee Chairman Silvestre Reyes, State Senator Eliot Shapleigh, and El Paso County Commissioner Veronica Escobar. Earlier this month, over 12,000 El Paso residents came to Hillary Clinton's rally at the University of Texas El Paso campus.
