    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Howard (D) New Jersey and 15 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5488 because it would interfere unacceptably with the authority of the President to administer the Disaster Assistance Program. If H.R. 5488 were presented to the President in its current form, the President's senior advisers would recommend a veto.
H.R. 5488 would not only prohibit implementation of a particular regulation, but would also prevent the President and FEMA from making any changes in policies or regulations under the Disaster Assistance Program for a period of 18 months.
