    To the Senate of the United States:
I herewith transmit for the advice and consent of the Senate eleven amendments to the Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1960.
Three of these amendments were adopted on November 26, 1968 by the Assembly of the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO) at its fourth extraordinary session held in London November 26-28, 1968 and are annexed to the enclosed certified copy of Resolution A. 146(ES. IV). The other eight amendments were adopted on October 15-19, 1969 and are annexed to the enclosed certified copy of Resolution A. 174(VI).
The three amendments adopted in 1968 are the outcome of studies undertaken by IMCO in 1967 following the Torrey Canyon tragedy. They are preventive measures designed to avoid the repetition of such disasters by requiring that specified navigational equipment be carried aboard certain vessels, specifying conditions of operation that must be met by vessels using automatic pilot, and requiring that all ships subject to the Convention carry adequate and up-to-date nautical publications.
The 1969 amendments are designed to improve requirements for firemen's outfits and personal equipment in cargo ships as well as requirements for lifebuoys, life jackets, radio installations and shipborne navigational equipment.
For the information of the Senate, I am also transmitting the report of the Department of State with respect to the amendments.
I recommend that the Senate give swift and favorable consideration to all of these amendments.
