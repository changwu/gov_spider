  A Proclamation

In this our Bicentennial year, we owe special tribute to the great Italian explorer whose historic voyage to the new world opened the way to the founding of these United States.
Sustained by the vision and financial support of Queen Isabella I of Spain, Christopher Columbus established the first permanent European settlement in the Americas, paving the way for the generations of immigrants from all over the world who came to build a new nation. This great achievement marked the beginning of a new era in the history of mankind.
As the heirs to the sprit and determination of Christopher Columbus, we are proud to honor his memory and unshakable courage and faith which made his epic journey a reality nearly five centuries ago.
In tribute to the achievement of Columbus, the Congress of the United States, by joint resolution approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657, 36 U.S.C. 146), as modified by the Act of June 24, 1968 (82 Stat. 250, 5 U.S.C. 6103(a) and note), requested the President to proclaim the second Monday in October of each year as Columbus Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Monday, October 11, 1976, as Columbus Day; and I invite the people of this Nation to observe that day in schools, churches and other suitable places with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the great explorer.
I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in memory of Christopher Columbus.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and first.

GERALD R. FORD
