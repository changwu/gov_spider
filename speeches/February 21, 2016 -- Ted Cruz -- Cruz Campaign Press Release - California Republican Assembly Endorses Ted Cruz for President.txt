    HOUSTON, Texas – The California Republican Assembly (CRA) formally endorsed Ted Cruz for President during its statewide convention today in Orange County. Cruz was endorsed by the required two-thirds of voting delegates during the first round of voting, an impressive and rare accomplishment. This is the first time in 20 years that a first-round ballot has determined the official endorsement. CRA President Tom Hudson said, "Senator Cruz won the overwhelming first ballot endorsement because he is the proven, consistent conservative."
The California Republican Assembly is California's oldest and largest Republican volunteer organization. Hailed by Ronald Reagan as the "conscience of the Republican party," the California Republican Assembly is one of the oldest and most prestigious conservative institutions in California.
"Cruz is a hero to the conservative movement and he's right in line with what we need in California and nationwide," said Hudson. "The conscience of the Republican Party has spoken."
Michael Schroeder, former California Republican Assembly President and Cruz for President California Co-Chair and Political Director said, "Particularly given the recent passing of conservative icon Justice Antonin Scalia, our choice today was an easy one. Everyone trusts Ted Cruz to appoint Justice Scalia's successor."
The previously announced Cruz California leadership team consists of 118 California leaders chaired by Ron Nehring. Former California Republican Party Chairman Michael Schroeder and former California legislator Ray Haynes serve as California Co-Chairs. The campaign also announced the endorsements of Congressmen Dana Rohrabacher and Tom McClintock, Assemblymembers Shannon Grove of Bakersfield and Matthew Harper of Orange County together with former Chapman University Law School Dean John C. Eastman. Los Angeles investor Dan Palmer serves as California state co-chair.
