"I travelled to Zanesville, Ohio today for an Economic Solutions for America summit. I'm joined by distinguished guests from here in Ohio and across Americaâ€” elected officials, leaders from labor, business and education, and hardworking Ohioans. We've come from different backgrounds but we're here for the same reason, because when it comes to our economy we know we can do better. I'm proud to put forward my Economic Blueprint for the 21st Century. As president I will take back more than $55 billion of George Bush's special interest giveaways from the oil companies, the drug companies and Wall Street and give the middle class a break instead. We'll use that money to rebuild our infrastructure, make college affordable and most importantly help create good, high-paying jobs in Ohio, Texas and across America."
