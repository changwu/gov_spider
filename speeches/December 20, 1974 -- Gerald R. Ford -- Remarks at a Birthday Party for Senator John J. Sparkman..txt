    THANK YOU very, very much for the opportunity of coming to your birthday party, John. It was not on the program as such, but I knew that you were having a party, and I knew I wanted to come.
So, we are here because of the great respect and admiration I have, not only for you personally but for the fine and outstanding job I know firsthand you have done in the Congress.
A 75th birthday is quite a landmark and a milestone. Let me put it in football terms: John, you may be too old for the University of Alabama, but I think you could be too young for the Washington Redskins. [Laughter]
Thirty-eight years in the Congress is something that I never achieved. I, under no circumstances, could have made it.
I do respect those who have served six terms in the House of Representatives and the remainder of that long and constructive record in the United States Senate.
I think the people of Alabama have benefited tremendously from the work that you have done for that State. But those of us who know the .record, that come from different States, can honestly say that your contributions have been national. And I would go one step further--and I know this firsthand--your contributions have been international, for the objectives and the goals and the aims that all Americans want: peace and a good and happy life for all of us.
So, I thank you, as a former colleague of yours in the Congress and now as President, and wish you and your wonderful family the very, very best for another good many years.
