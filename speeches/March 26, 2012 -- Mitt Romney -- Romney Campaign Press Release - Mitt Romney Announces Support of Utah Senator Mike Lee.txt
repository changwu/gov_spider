    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Utah Senator Mike Lee.
"Mike has been fighting on the frontlines to repeal Obamacare and restore fiscal sanity in Washington," said Mitt Romney. "I will need the support and hard work of leaders like him if we are going to be successful in shrinking the federal government and restoring America's promise of freedom and prosperity. I am honored to have Mike's support and look forward to his advice in the coming months."
Announcing his support, Senator Lee said, "If Republicans want to repeal President Obama's unconstitutional health care plan, restore limited government and individual liberty, they must unite behind Mitt Romney. He is the one candidate who will be able to win in November and implement policies that conservatives like me have been fighting for in the Senate. Conservatives can't afford to allow President Obama to have another four years in office. That is why I support Mitt Romney and urge my fellow constitutional conservatives to support him as the nominee of our party."
Background on Senator Mike Lee:
Senator Lee was elected in 2010. Senator Lee sits on the Judiciary Committee, Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Foreign Relations Committee and the Joint Economic Committee.
