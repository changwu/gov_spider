    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Tauzin (15) Louisiana and 2 others)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 729 but will seek an amendment in the Senate to ensure that any review by a Federal court of a Panama Canal Commission decision on a claim for an accident outside the locks is procedural only, and not a trial de novo.
