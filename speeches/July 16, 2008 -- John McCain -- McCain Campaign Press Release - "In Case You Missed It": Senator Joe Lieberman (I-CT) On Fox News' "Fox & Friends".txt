 Senator Joe Lieberman: "Senator Obama throughout the whole primary seemed to be very clear. He was sending a message to the voters in the Democratic primaries. Elect me as president. First day, I'm going to call in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, order him to move one to two brigades out of Iraq every month regardless of what's happening on the ground, basically saying it can't be won, and I guess the consequences of surrender or losing it, we can take it.
"Then somehow miraculously after the primaries were over, he seemed to nuance that, and now saying that no, that wasn't going to be an automatic order when he called in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. He was going to say give me a plan for getting out of Iraq.
"But now, I think he got such a reaction against that from MoveOn.org and a lot of people in the antiwar left of the Democratic party that yesterday the speech he gave basically said the same thing, and though I respect him for coming back finally to where he was and what I think he believes, I think it's terribly wrong because it doesn't acknowledge, one, that we're winning, and we are withdrawing troops now based on our success there.
...
"Two, it's just not what we want in a president. He's going to Iraq, but he's already decided his position. He's not going to listen to Petraeus. He's not going to listen to our troops. He's not going to listen to his own eyes with what he sees there. I think that's not the kind of leadership we need in the Oval Office."
