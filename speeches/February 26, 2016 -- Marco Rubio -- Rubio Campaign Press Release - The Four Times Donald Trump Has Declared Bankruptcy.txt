Bankruptcy #1: The Trump Taj Mahal, 1991: 
The first Trump-tied bankruptcy, in 1991, was of Trump's biggest Atlantic City casino, the Trump Taj Mahal, whose $1 billion construction was financed by junk bonds at a staggeringly high interest rate of 14 percent. Its glitzy unveiling fell flat amid slumps in Atlantic City and the broader U.S. economy, leaving the Trump firm more than $3 billion in debt." (The Washington Post, 8/7/15)
Bankruptcy #2: Trump Plaza Hotel, 1992: 
"Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in New York for $390 million in 1988. By 1992, the hotel had accumulated $550 million in debt. As a result of the bankruptcy, in exchange for easier terms on which to pay off the debts, Trump relinquished a 49 percent stake in the Plaza to a total of six lenders, according to ABC News. Trump remained the hotel's CEO, but it was merely a gesture — he didn't earn a salary and had no say in the hotel's day-to-day operations, according to the New York Times." (PolitiFact, 9/21/15)
Bankruptcy #3: Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts, 2004: 
"Donald J. Trump's casino empire has filed for bankruptcy protection after months of negotiations with bondholders over restructuring a crushing debt.
