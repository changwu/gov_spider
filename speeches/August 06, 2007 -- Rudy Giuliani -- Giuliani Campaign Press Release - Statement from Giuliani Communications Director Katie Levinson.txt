    Katie Levinson, Communications Director for the Giuliani Presidential Committee, made the following statement today ahead of tonight's Democratic Presidential Candidate Forum sponsored by the AFL-CIO:
"Debate after debate, the Democrats ignore the threat of Islamic terrorists and fail to address the Terrorists' War on Us. Yet they have no problem talking about raising taxes on the American people. Each of the leading Democratic candidates has made campaign promises that will lead to tax hikes. It's about time they play it straight with voters and are honest about how much their tax hikes will cost the American public."
