Storms overnight across Ohio and many other States were very dangerous and damaging. My team continues to update me with reports from emergency managers in the States affected. Listen to your local officials and be resilient. We are with you!Retweets: 15366Favorites: 80372

I was actually sticking up for Sleepy Joe Biden while on foreign soil. Kim Jong Un called him a 'low IQ idiot' and many other things whereas I related the quote of Chairman Kim as a much softer 'low IQ individual.' Who could possibly be upset with that?Retweets: 26954Favorites: 129616
