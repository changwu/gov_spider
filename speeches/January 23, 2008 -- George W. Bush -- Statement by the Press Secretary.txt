    The United States welcomes the signing of a peace agreement with the goal of helping bring lasting stability to eastern Congo and addressing the underlying causes of the conflict. The agreement calls for an immediate cease-fire, demobilization or reintegration of all armed groups, and the return of all Congolese refugees and internally displaced persons. President Bush recently met with President Kabila to discuss the importance of bringing peace to eastern Congo and commends Kabila's leadership in securing this important agreement. We call on all parties to ensure urgent implementation of the agreement. The United States, working with the international community, will continue to actively support the Congolese Government's commitment to achieve peace and prosperity in eastern Congo.
