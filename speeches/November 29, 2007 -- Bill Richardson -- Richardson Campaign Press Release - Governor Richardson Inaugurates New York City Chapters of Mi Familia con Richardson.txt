NEW YORK, NY-- New Mexico Governor and Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Richardson today inaugurated the 75 New York City area chapters of Mi Familia con Richardson at a meet and greet event. Mi Familia con Richardson is a nationwide family-to-family grassroots mobilization network designed to target the Latino community.
Governor Richardson spoke of the success of his campaign's outreach program and his support within the Latino community.
"Mi Familia con Richardson is a first in American politics," Richardson said. "It targets organizational efforts around the culture and importance of family connections.
"The program has exceeded our initial goal of 100 chapters in 100 days, all due to the hard work of our supporters, national co-chairs, Mi Familia directors, Latino outreach coordinators, and nationwide staff. It is thanks to everyone's commitment and dedication that we have been able to top all of the other Presidential candidates when it comes to grassroots Latino outreach efforts."
