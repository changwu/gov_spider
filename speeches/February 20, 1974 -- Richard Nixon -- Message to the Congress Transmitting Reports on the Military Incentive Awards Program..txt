    To the Congress of the United States:
In 1965, the Congress authorized participation by military personnel in a program of cash awards for suggestions, inventions and scientific achievements. Nearly 1.5 million suggestions have been submitted since that time, and the program has successfully motivated military personnel to seek ways of reducing costs and improving efficiency. Of those suggestions submitted, 235,378 have been adopted, resulting in tangible first-year benefits in excess of $728 million.
During fiscal year 1973, 131,944 suggestions were submitted and 20,854 were adopted. The adopted suggestions represent tangible first-year benefits of $66,525,250.87, as well as many additional benefits and improvements of an intangible nature. Cash awards in fiscal year 1973 totalled $1,467,531.98, of which 82, percent went to enlisted men.
In accordance with the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1124, I am forwarding reports of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation containing statistical information on this program and brief descriptions of some of the more noteworthy contributions made by military personnel during fiscal year 1973.
