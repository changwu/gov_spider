    Verona, PA - It was reported that President Barack Obama made the astounding remark that he would "have more flexibility" in negotiating the European missile defense system with Russia after the election.
Rick Santorum said: "This is not about an open microphone, and it's not about politics, this is about a fundamentally flawed vision for securing America. When Ronald Reagan was confronted with the Soviet missile threat, he said trust but verify. When Barack Obama is confronted with missile defense negotiations, he says 'wait and I'll have flexibility.' The difference is enormous. The President's retreat from missile defense shows he is comfortable endangering America and her allies. This is not presidential leadership, and as our next Commander-in-Chief I am committed to standing firm on the issue of missile defense and the security of America and her allies."
