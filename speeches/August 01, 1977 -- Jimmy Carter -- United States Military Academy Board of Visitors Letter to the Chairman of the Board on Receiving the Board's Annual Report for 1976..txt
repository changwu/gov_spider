    To General Wilcox
Thank you for the report on the United States Military Academy provided by you and your colleagues on the Board of Visitors. Please convey to each member of the Board my deep appreciation for his contribution to the report.
As you are aware, U.S. law requires the Board to examine academic and administrative procedures at the Academy, as well as physical and fiscal matters. In light of recent difficulties experienced at the Academy, I would hope the Board's report for April 1978 and subsequent years will focus more on academic and other training matters. I believe that your group offers a critical source of outside and expert evaluation, and I count on your judgment to help guide West Point in maintaining the high standards required to produce dedicated leadership for the United States Army.
Please accept my thanks for providing your distinguished and knowledgeable leadership as Chairman of the Board of Visitors.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
[Major General Howard S. Wilcox, USAR, 300 Board of Trade Building, Indianapolis, Indiana 46240]
