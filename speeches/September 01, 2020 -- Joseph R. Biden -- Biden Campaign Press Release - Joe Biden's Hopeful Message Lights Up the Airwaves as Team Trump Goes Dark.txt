    Biden for President Spending $45 Million Across Broadcast and Digital This Week
Today, Biden for President adapted Joe Biden's speech yesterday in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania into a new minute-long ad that will begin airing nationwide on cable channels and in key battlegrounds. As the Trump campaign is still dark in critical states, Biden for President is continuing to ramp up its general election paid media spending, investing $45 million on broadcast and digital this week alone.
"Be Not Afraid" uses Vice President Biden's remarks about how President Trump has fanned the flames of division, failed to unequivocally condemn the violence in American cities, and instilled fear across the country. The ad highlights Joe Biden's message to the country in this moment: we must stop the unacceptable violence, unite the country, and be guided by the words of Pope John Paull II: "Be Not Afraid."

In addition to airing nationwide on cable networks, the new ad will also air in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Biden for President will also expand its Spanish Language programming with "Decepciones" airing on radio and Spanish Language networks in Nevada, North Carolina, and Minnesota.
