    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Mr. President:)
In accordance with section 212 of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) (19 U.S.C. 2702), as amended by the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) (Public Law 106-200), and after considering the criteria set forth in sections 212(b) and (c) and 213(b)(5)(B) of the CBERA (19 U.S.C. 2702(b) and (c) and 19 U.S.C. 2703(b)(5)(B)), I have determined that it is appropriate to designate Curaçao, which is a successor political entity to The Netherlands Antilles, as a beneficiary country for the purposes of the CBERA and CBTPA.
In accordance with section 212(a)(1)(A) of the CBERA, I am hereby notifying the Congress of my intent to designate Curaçao as a beneficiary country for the purposes of the CBERA and CBTPA. After the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) makes a determination under section 213(b)(4)(A)(ii) (19 U.S.C. 2703(b)(4)(A)(ii)) regarding whether Curaçao has implemented and follows or is making substantial progress toward implementing and following the customs procedures required under the CBTPA, and publishes such determination in the Federal Register, Curaçao will be eligible for benefits under the CBTPA on the date that the USTR designates.
Sincerely,
BARACK OBAMA
