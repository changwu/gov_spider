In-Town Pool Report #10
Correction: last pool report should have been labeled #9, apologies for my clumsy typing.
See below for transcript of tonight's Q&A session on South Lawn (only items in "" are direct quotes, otherwise pooler is paraphrasing).
Reporter: Will you go to Mississippi, sir?
POTUS: "I've been talking to Mississippi. I talked to the mayor, I talked to the congressman." "We've offered every single thing available to Mississippi. The governor has to act. There's money to deal with this problem. We've given them EPA. We've given them everything there is to offer."
"I have no plans to go there right now."
Reporter: What is your response to conservatives who want to challenge your student loan plan in court?
POTUS: "They have a right to do that. Do you have a student loan?"
Reporter: "Do I have a student loan?" "I bet a lot of your staff does."
POTUS: "They may, no one has told me they have."
Reporter: Have you been briefed on the response to the U.S. proposal on the Iran nuclear deal?
POTUS: "I've been briefed, but unless something happened in the last two hours."
Reporter: "They replied to the U.S. response."
POTUS: "Then I haven't heard it yet. I'll find out when I walk in the door."
Reporter: Mr. President, what's your response to Afghans that are still stuck around the world and are trying to get here to the U.S. through the refugee program?
POTUS: "They're like everyone else trying to get here. They have a right to try to get here. And if we can, we should accommodate them."

POTUS finished speaking at 8:26. He and FLOTUS embraced at the podium, waved to the crowd and then walked back to the doorway of Independence Hall. They waved to the crowd again and went inside at 8:28.
In his speech, POTUS forcefully criticized "MAGA Republicans" and former president Donald Trump, differentiating them from "mainstream Republicans" who he said he can work with. He also condemned political violence, including the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, as well as attacks on elections workers and FBI agents.
For several minutes, someone (maybe multiple people) outside the park chanted, "Let's go, Brandon" and "F Joe Biden." POTUS acknowledged the heckling, telling the crowd that those people are "entitled to be outrageous. This is a democracy."
During the speech, the crowd applauded at times, with a few cheers and some people taking photos or video on their phones.
Dramatic setup here, with red and blue spotlights coloring Independence Hall and a uniformed member of the military standing on each side of the main door. Several American flags and a long red carpet were behind POTUS as he spoke.
