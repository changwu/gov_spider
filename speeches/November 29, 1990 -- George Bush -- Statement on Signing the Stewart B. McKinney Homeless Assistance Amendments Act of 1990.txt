    It is with great pleasure that I have today signed H.R. 3789, the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1990. Congress first enacted the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act in 1987, and the act signed today will reauthorize a broad array of programs to assist the homeless, amend current programs, and authorize certain new programs to address the continuing needs of homeless, especially the mentally ill and substance abusers.
Since 1987 the McKinney Act has provided over $2 billion for programs to assist the homeless. H.R. 3789 will authorize the new Shelter Plus Care Program, an administration proposal, which will help link rental housing assistance to other supportive services for the homeless.
Under the provisions of H.R. 3789, the Department of Health and Human Services is authorized to establish a Family Support Centers demonstration program that will provide a number of health and related services for low-income individuals who were previously homeless or are at risk of becoming homeless. The act also authorizes additional grants to the States that would be focused on those who are currently homeless and suffer from both substance abuse and mental illness.
H.R. 3789 recognizes that the homeless often have needs that go beyond housing assistance. By providing health services, substance abuse services, and counseling in addition to housing assistance, this act enhances the administration's ability to address the needs of the homeless in all their complexity.
