    This morning the President was informed by national security adviser Colin Powell that the British Department of Transport has determined that the crash of Pan Am Flight 103 was caused by a high explosive device. We have closely cooperated with the British investigation. We agree with the results of their investigation.
The investigation will continue to determine how the explosives were introduced into the plane. The FBI and the FAA are working closely with the British and Scottish authorities on the investigation. We are determined to find out who did it, using all available resources.
