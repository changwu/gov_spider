    Today the Supreme Court granted the Department of Justice's emergency stay application in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA, preventing a lower court decision from going into effect that would have undermined FDA's medical judgment and put women's health at risk.
As a result of the Supreme Court's stay, mifepristone remains available and approved for safe and effective use while we continue this fight in the courts. I continue to stand by FDA's evidence-based approval of mifepristone, and my administration will continue to defend FDA's independent, expert authority to review, approve, and regulate a wide range of prescription drugs.
The stakes could not be higher for women across America. I will continue to fight politically driven attacks on women's health. But let's be clear: The American people must continue to use their vote as their voice, and elect a Congress who will pass a law restoring the protections of Roe v. Wade.
