    I AM leaving this morning with Governor Buford Ellington, Director of the Office of Emergency Planning, to meet with the Governors, other public officials, and private citizens of the States stricken over the weekend by severe tornadoes and costly floods.
The tornadoes in seven States--and the floods in Minnesota--have wrought a heavy toll in human lives, injuries, and property damage. No words or deeds of ours can ease the loss of the bereaved families.
We can, however, hope that the meetings today will serve usefully to make more effective and efficient our Federal assistance to the afflicted States and their citizens for the widespread reconstruction of homes, public facilities, businesses, and industrial plants damaged or destroyed in these natural disasters.
While it will not be possible to visit each afflicted community, I hope that our visit will convey to all residents of these States the concern, compassion, and support their countrymen feel for them in this hour of shock and grief.
