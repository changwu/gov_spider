    First Lady Melania Trump traveled to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to visit Thomas Jefferson University Hospital to deliver welcoming remarks at the National Convening on Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) hosted by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). She was joined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar. The convening was designed to help with the launch of a new HHS initiative with the intention of measuring the long-term health outcomes and needs of infants suffering from NAS.
Following her remarks, Mrs. Trump met with mothers and babies born with NAS. The meeting included leadership from the medical center's Maternal Addiction, Treatment, Education and Research (MATER) program. MATER has been helping mothers and children since the 1970s, offering treatment programs designed to support both mothers and their babies.
Before departing, Mrs. Trump spent time visiting babies in the hospital's neonatal intensive care nursery (ICN). She spoke with ICN nurses and stopped into several rooms to visit and hold babies while meeting with family members.
"Thank you to the dedicated staff at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital for all they are doing to help families affected by NAS," said First Lady Melania Trump. "I enjoyed speaking with the mothers and staff of the MATER program. Programs like MATER are vital in helping mothers and babies have the best opportunities and care in order to overcome NAS. I am inspired by Dr. Loretta Finnegan's lifetime dedication to helping children and look forward to learning more about HHS's plans to develop and implement their new tracking system."
