    Dear Mr. Speaker:
In furtherance of the provisions of Public Law 107-38, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States, FY 2001, today I am notifying the Congress of my intent to reallocate funds previously transferred from the Emergency Response Fund.
This reallocation within the United States Postal Service reflects revised requirements related to the anthrax incidents that affected the Nation's mail. As provided in Public Law 107-38, the reallocation would be effective 15 days from the date of this transmittal.
The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and observations.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
