    ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign on Friday launched a microsite to mark the senator's historic fundraising effort, which includes raising money from more than 7.6 million contributions with more than 2.4 million individual donors.
Sanders' campaign on Friday will also file a report with the Federal Election Commission showing it raised more than $212 million since the start of the campaign. Sanders raised more than $26.9 million in April, out-raising Secretary Clinton for the fourth month in a row.
The average contribution to the senator's campaign is around $27. Only 5 percent of Sanders' total came from donors who have given the maximum $2,700 an individual may donate to a candidate. Almost half of Hillary Clinton's primary campaign committee money comes from maxed-out donors.
