    My administration is committed to working to preserve for America's farming families their way of life in the Missouri River basin, to provide more predictability to the many users of the river, and to protect threatened and endangered species that depend on the river for habitat.
The Army Corps of Engineers and Department of the Interior have succeeded in achieving a balance among interests on the river and resolving a key element of a 15-year-old conflict. Today the agencies are announcing the restoration of the habitat of an endangered species, which is an important milestone in ensuring that the river can remain an affordable avenue of commerce while meeting the habitat needs of the river's many species.
In addition, I am pleased that earlier this week the Federal court approved my administration's operating plan for the river, resolving years of litigation in multiple courts. The citizens who call the Missouri River home can now better plan for their future as they enjoy the many benefits and abundant wildlife that this extraordinary natural resource provides.
