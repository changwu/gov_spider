    President Trump has abdicated America's role as a global leader, making us less safe and less prosperous as a result. American interests around the world require steady leadership — and we can no longer have foreign policy by tweet.
As the commander in chief of the Montana National Guard, Montana Governor Steve Bullock has visited young soldiers and airmen downrange in Kuwait and Afghanistan. He's heard the pride in their voices about serving, and he's seen the sacrifices they and their families make. As President, Governor Bullock will re-engage our allies, deter our adversaries, and promote our values abroad.
Trump Conducts Foreign Policy By Tweet — With Nothing to Show for It:

Iran — He pulled out of the nuclear deal with no strategy to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons.
North Korea — He cozied up to a dictator and granted legitimacy to Kim Jong Un, while getting nothing in return.
Russia — His actions have emboldened Russian aggression while undercutting our strategic alliances in the region.
China — His trade war hurts families and businesses and is escalating with  no end in sight.
