Travel pool report #5 - at Union hall [APP Note: See comment in Report #7 mentioning that this is Report #6.]
?President Biden arrived at the union hall parking lot, where there is a tent and table set up, with a Capriottis box and left it on a table with other food.
He met and shook hands with several members of the local 313. They stood in a circle while he spoke, which was inaudible to pool. They all applauded at two points. One of the Union members wore a Biden 2020 shirt.
"Come on, let's get something to eat," he said and grabbed a sandwich from the Capriottis box to hand to someone.
Some members took selfies with him and then lined up for more photos with him.
One of the Union members, Michael Simmons, called his mother and put the President on the phone.  "I'm with your son," he said. "Mom, I wish you were here. I just stopped by to thank these guys" "Happy Labor Day," he said before hanging up.
The President is now taking more photos and selfies with people.

In town pool report #1 
It's a gorgeous evening here at the White House where we are anticipating a delayed POTUS arrival on the South Lawn. In town pool call time has been pushed one hour to 7:30 p.m. 


September 6, 202120:34

In town pool report #2 arrival/lid 
Marine One touched down on the South Lawn at 8:07 p.m.
POTUS and FLOTUS walked across the lawn toward the White House and just as they hit the edge of the grass, POTUS sharply changed direction to approach the pool.
It seemed he wanted to make a statement and started off by saying "we've got a big day tomorrow" but broke off as members of the pool began shouting questions about Afghanistan.
With the helicopter noise in the background POTUS seemed to not clearly hear or perhaps not understand a question about Afghans trapped in other countries.
In response to another shouted question about whether he will "recognize the Taliban," POTUS said:
"That's a long way off. That's a long way off."
Then he turned and walked into the White House with FLOTUS.
As of 8:15 p.m. we have a travel photo lid.
Have a great night all.
