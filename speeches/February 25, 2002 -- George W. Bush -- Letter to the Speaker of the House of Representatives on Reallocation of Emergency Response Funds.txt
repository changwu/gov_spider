    Dear Mr. Speaker:
In furtherance of the provisions of Public Law 107-38, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States, FY 2001, today I am notifying the Congress of my intent to reallocate funds previously transferred from the Emergency Response Fund to the Department of Defense. This reallocation reflects revised requirements in light of changing security needs in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
As provided in Public Law 107-38, $33 million will be made available 15 days from the date of this transmittal for continued deployment of the National Guard at our Nation's airports through the end of March.
The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and observations.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
