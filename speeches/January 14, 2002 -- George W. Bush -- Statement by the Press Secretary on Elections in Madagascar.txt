    In recent days, up to 100,000 people have protested in Antananarivo and other cities across Madagascar. President Bush believes that there must be a transparent, just and democratic resolution to the disputes about recent elections that are leading to these protests. Candidates, political parties, observers, and especially the electorate must have confidence that the election will be resolved fairly and according to law and that the results reflect the will of the Malagasy people and the process of democratic transition.
Now that the election outcome is in the hands of the High Constitutional Court, the United States hopes the Court will come to a speedy conclusion. In the interim, we call on the Presidential candidates to urge their supporters to ensure that the election process proceeds peacefully. We are certain that the democratic traditions of Madagascar will prevail and the High Constitutional Court will decide these elections on the basis of the Constitution and laws of Madagascar and international standards for democratic elections.
The United States extends our friendship and support to the people of Madagascar and expresses our confidence that the resolution of these elections will reflect their commitment to democracy.
