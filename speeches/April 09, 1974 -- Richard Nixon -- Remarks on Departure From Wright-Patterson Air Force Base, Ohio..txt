    WELL, as you know, I have come here for the purpose of inspecting the tornado damage in the Xenia area. But I didn't want this opportunity to pass without again expressing appreciation to those who are stationed here at Wright-Patterson for your service to the Nation in the various capacities, both civilian and military, in which you are occupied.
I have just talked to Congressman [Clarence J.] Brown and asked him whether he thought this facility should be moved to Florida. [Laughter] He said we decided that a year and a half ago.
I can assure you that we have the greatest of confidence not only in this facility but also in its location, and when we think that aviation really began here, this must always be, as it is now, one of the great Air Force installations for the United States of America.
You have helped to make it great, and we appreciate your service in this particular area.
I have often said, too, that in this period now when we are at peace with all nations in the world, in order to maintain that peace, we have to maintain the strength of America. And having just returned from Europe, where I met with the leaders of most of the nations of the world, I can tell you that America's strength militarily is respected--and we will maintain that strength--but also America's character is respected.
We are the leaders of the free world, and each of you, in your individual capacity in your service either on the military or the civilian side, you help to make America the nation that it is, able to play the great role of peacemaker in the world.
Thank you very much.
