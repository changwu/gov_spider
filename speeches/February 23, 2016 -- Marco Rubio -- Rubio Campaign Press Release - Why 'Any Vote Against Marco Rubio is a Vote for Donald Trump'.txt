Former Minnesota Senator Norm Coleman says that Marco is the candidate who can unite the Republican Party. This is a must-watch video:


CAVUTO: Why Senator Rubio sir?COLEMAN: Because any vote against Marco Rubio is a vote for Donald Trump and that would be a terrible thing for the Republican Party and ultimately the country. Trump's the only guy who has got higher negatives than Hillary Clinton. Marco Rubio is the one guy who can pull the party together.
Coleman notes that Marco is the one candidate who can bring together voters from all factions of the GOP. If you want to unite the conservative movement, Marco's your candidate.
