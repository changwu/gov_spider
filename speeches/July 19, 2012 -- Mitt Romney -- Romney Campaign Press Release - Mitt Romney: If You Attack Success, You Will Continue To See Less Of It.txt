It's because this is the land of opportunity. We welcome people here with dreams and say to them, come build it. Not come here because government will give it to you but come here because this is the place where your dreams will be good for you and good for our entire nation." â€” Mitt Romney

Watch Mitt Romney Discuss Why America Is A Land Of Opportunity

MITT ROMNEY: "My own view is that if you attack success, you'll continue to see what we have seen over the past three and a half years, which is less success. America is a nation which is defined by people coming to achieve, to fulfill their dreams. We're a nation of risk-takers, dreamers, people who want to take a better step for the future, for themselves, and for their kids, and in the process of doing so, they make us better off. They lift one another. I just don't think the President, by his comments, suggests an understanding of what it is that makes America such a unique nation, why people have come here for hundreds of years. It's because this is the land of opportunity. We welcome people here with dreams and say to them, come build it. Not come here because government will give it to you but come here because this is the place where your dreams will be good for you and good for our entire nation."
