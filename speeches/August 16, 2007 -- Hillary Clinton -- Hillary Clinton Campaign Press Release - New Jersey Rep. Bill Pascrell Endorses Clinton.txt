    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of New Jersey Congressman Bill Pascrell and named him co-chair of Italian-Americans for Hillary. Rep. Pascrell will also advise the campaign on Homeland Security and first responder issues.
"Hillary Clinton has been a leading advocate for our first responders affected by 9/11 and for strengthening our Homeland Security," Pascrell said. "She is the experienced leader we need to deliver the change Americans want."
Pascrell was elected to Congress in 1996, and has championed fire safety, authoring the Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement Act to provide federal grants to local fire departments. He has also led efforts to improve our nation's infrastructure as a former member of the Transportation Committee, passing legislation to modernize our region's roads, bridges, airports and mass transit systems.
Pascrell currently serves on the exclusive House Ways and Means Committee under the leadership of Chairman Charlie Rangel. Chosen by his peers, Pascrell has served in the Democratic leadership as a regional whip since 2003.
Prior to his election to Congress, Pascrell served as Mayor of Paterson from 1990-1996, and was named "Mayor of the Year" by his fellow Mayors. Pascrell also served in the New Jersey State Assembly, rising to become Minority Leader Pro Tempore. He began his career as a public school teacher and later served on the Paterson Board of Education.
"No one has done more for our first responders than Congressman Pascrell," Clinton said. "I am delighted that he will help lead our efforts in New Jersey and across the country."
