    Richardson pays tribute to baseball legend Number 42
Today, on the 60th Anniversary of the first African-American to play Major League Baseball, Governor Bill Richardson issued the following statement about the revered baseball legend Jackie Robinson.
"Jackie Robinson was a man of courage and strength," said Governor Richardson. "He paved the way for minority athletes in all sports and he played an instrumental role in America's civil rights movement. We should take today to remember and learn from not only an amazing athlete, but from a man who believed "A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives." Â Jackie Robinson's impact on America has been felt both on and off the diamonds of the baseball field and as we honor his accomplishment, we should do so with a renewed resolve and commitment to continue to demand equal opportunity in the 21st century in all fields of life."
