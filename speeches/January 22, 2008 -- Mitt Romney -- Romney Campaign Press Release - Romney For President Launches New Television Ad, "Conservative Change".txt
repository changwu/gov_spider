AD FACTS: Script For "Conservative Change" (TV :30):
GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: "Today our economy is slowing. Many feel anxious about the future."
- Florida Times-Union: "Jacksonville's unemployment rate jumped to its highest level in 2 1/2 years last month, a sign that the local economy could be faltering along with the national economy. The jobless rate in the Jacksonville metropolitan area – consisting of Duval, Baker, Clay, Nassau and St. Johns counties – jumped from 4 percent in November to 4.3 percent in December, the Florida Agency for Workforce Innovation reported Friday. That's the highest local unemployment rate since it reached 4.4 percent in June 2005." (Mark Basch, "First Coast Jobless Rate Shoots Up," Florida Times-Union [Jacksonville}, 1/19/08)
- Orlando Sentinel: "Figures released Friday show an unfamiliar spike in the area's joblessness, and economic observers say the cause is a huge slump in the housing market that has dampened spending across other sectors of the economy. Unemployment reached 4.7 percent in December, a jump of 1.6 percentage points from a year earlier, according to preliminary numbers released Friday by Workforce Central Florida." (Adrian Uribarri, "Lake County Unemployment Rate Shoots Up," Orlando Sentinel, 1/19/08)
- St. Petersburg Times: "Are we in a recession or just teetering on the edge? Economists are debating the point as conditions deteriorate: Foreclosures, bankruptcy filings and unemployment are rising. Florida reported Friday that the state's jobless rate rose to 4.7 percent last month from 3.3 percent a year ago. Real estate sales and stock prices are tanking. That's the big picture and it's still murky. The little picture is a whole lot clearer. If you've lost your job or your income has fallen, the recession has arrived." (Helen Huntley, "A Recession Touches Many Hands," St. Petersburg Times, 1/21/08)

GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: "I know how America works because I've spent my life in the real economy. I ran a business, turned around the Olympics, and I led a state."
- Bloomberg's Heidi Pryzbyla: "Romney's business record is unmatched by the current crop of leading candidates." (Heidi Pryzbyla, "Romney Finds Classmate Bush's Management Lapses Unlikely Hurdle," Bloomberg, 7/1/07)
- The Boston Globe's Robert Gavin And Sacha Pfeiffer: "In time, Romney would lead the shaky start-up from a staff of seven people managing $37 million to 115 people managing $4 billion in assets. During Romney's 15-year tenure, Bain Capital would post an astonishing record, on average doubling its return on realized investments every year." (Robert Gavin and Sacha Pfeiffer, "Reaping Profit In Study, Sweat," The Boston Globe, 6/26/07)
- Fortune's Marcia Vickers: "He is, after all, the most serious major-party presidential candidate to come out of the business world since ... well, since his father, George Romney, onetime CEO of American Motors, who ran in 1968." (Marcia Vickers, "The Republicans' Mr. Fix-It," Fortune Magazine, 6/27/07)
- The Associated Press' Debbie Hummel: "Romney took over as head of Salt Lake's Olympic organizing committee in February 1999 after it was revealed Salt Lake organizers doled out more than $1 million in cash and gifts to members of the International Olympic Committee to win the 2002 bid. Under Romney's leadership, the Games were lauded as a critical success, a model of post-Sept. 11 security and turned a $100 million profit. Romney, a successful venture capitalist before the Games, wrote a book after titled 'Turnaround: Crisis, Leadership and the Olympic Games.'"

- U.S. News & World Report's Dan Gilgoff: "Hired in 1999 to turn around the scandal – and debt –plagued Salt Lake City Olympic committee, Romney put it in the black and oversaw a successful Olympics in 2002.

(Dan Gilgoff, "A Massachusetts Conservative," U.S. News & World Report, 2/12/07)
- The Weekly Standard's Terry Eastland: "As governor, Romney has scored another turnaround, conservative in both ends and means. Told during the campaign that he would inherit a deficit of between $500 million and $1.5 billion, Romney discovered upon taking office a $650 million deficit in fiscal 2003 and an anticipated one of $3 billion in fiscal 2004. Romney balanced the 2003 budget, and he finished 2004 with a $700 million surplus. A reviving economy helped, but Romney didn't tax or borrow, and he reduced spending through government consolidation and reform." (Terry Eastland, "In 2008, Will It Be Mormon In America?" The Weekly Standard, 6/6/05)
