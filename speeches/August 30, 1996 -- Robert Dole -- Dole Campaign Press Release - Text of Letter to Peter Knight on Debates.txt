    Following is the text of a letter sent today by Dole/Kemp '96 Campaign Manager Scott Reed to Clinton/Gore Campaign Manager Peter Knight regarding the fall debates:
Peter Knight
Campaign Manager Clinton/Gore '96
2100 M Street, NW, Suite #700
Washington, DC 20037
Dear Mr. Knight,
Congratulations on the completion of a well-staged convention and on the renomination of President Clinton and Vice-President Gore.
Now that both of our conventions are over, it is time for us to focus on the fall debates between the candidates.
Bob Dole and Jack Kemp are committed to participating in a set of debates this fall to discuss the issues that affect the lives of all Americans: the economy, crime, drugs, and the security of our nation. We look forward to presenting our agenda for lower taxes, faster economic growth, smaller government, and stronger, safer families.
This next week, a small group of representatives from each of our campaigns should meet to address participants, format, timing, and logistical issues surrounding the debates. Our debate representation team will be led by former South Carolina Governor Carroll Campbell,
We would like to invite you and two representatives of the Clinton/Gore campaign to sit down in an informal setting with Governor Campbell, me, and one additional member of our team next week. The meeting can take place at our Washington headquarters or at some other mutually-convenient location.
Please let us know as soon as possible whether your schedule allows such a meeting and which representatives from your campaign will participate. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Sincerely,
Scott Reed
Campaign Manager
