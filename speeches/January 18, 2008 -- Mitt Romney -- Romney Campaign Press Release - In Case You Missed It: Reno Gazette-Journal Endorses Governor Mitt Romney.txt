"The best candidate – and the one who would give the party its strongest chance in the fall – is former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney.
"Romney is a successful businessman who showed his ability to get voters to cross party lines when he won the governor's office in Massachusetts, home of the Kennedys, Michael Dukakis and John Kerry. He left that office with his reputation and his relationships intact.
"Romney's most remarkable feat, however, was his stewardship of the Salt Lake City Olympics. He showed that he could bring disparate groups together, clean up a mess left by his predecessor, and to put on possibly the most successful games ever.
"Romney's No. 1 opponent since the New Hampshire primary is Arizona U.S. Sen. John McCain. McCain is a genuine war hero. But he's also a government insider who has outlived scandal."
...
"Republicans need a candidate who represents conservative values, builds bipartisan support and signals change for a restless electorate.
"Romney is that candidate."
