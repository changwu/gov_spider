    Rudy Giuliani made the following statement today regarding the confirmation of Michael Mukasey as the next Attorney General of the United States:
"Michael Mukasey has a very deep understanding of the federal justice system, the United States Justice Department, and he has the leadership qualities that are needed to guide the department through this time of war.
"Michael has a long and distinguished career in public service as an Assistant United States Attorney and as a United States District Judge. His 18-year career as United States District Judge was one of the most outstanding in the country and I am certain his tenure as Attorney General will be just as outstanding.
"I am very happy for Michael and Susan."
