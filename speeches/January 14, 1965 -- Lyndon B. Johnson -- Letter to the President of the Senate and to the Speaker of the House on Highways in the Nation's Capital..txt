    Dear Mr. President: (Dear Mr. Speaker:)
I transmit herewith a copy of a letter dated January 8, 1965 to me for transmittal to the Congress by the Administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency in accordance with the provisions of Section 204(b)(2) of the National Capital Transportation Act of 1960.
I know the Congress will be pleased, as I am, to note the consensus of the Highway Departments and the Administrator that, with the contemplated construction of the George Washington Memorial Parkway and a north central freeway, no additional highways need be constructed in this quadrant of the District for the foreseeable future.
Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
