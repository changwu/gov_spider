    I am very pleased to sign H.R. 5316, the "Judicial Improvements Act of 1990." Most important, Title II of this Act provides for 85 new Federal judgeships. These additional judicial resources will provide needed assistance in our fight against crime and drugs by enhancing our courts' ability to provide swift and fair justice. They will also increase civil litigants' access to prompt judicial resolution of their cases. H.R. 5316 also contains other useful provisions. Title I makes valuable suggestions for improving the management of the civil justice system; and Title III establishes a new retirement system for Claims Court judges and assures adequate retirement benefits for the spouses of assassinated Federal judges. I am very grateful to Members of both Houses and both political parties, particularly Senators Biden and Thurmond and Congressmen Brooks and Fish, as well as to the Judicial Conference and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, for the effort they invested in devising this important piece of legislation.
