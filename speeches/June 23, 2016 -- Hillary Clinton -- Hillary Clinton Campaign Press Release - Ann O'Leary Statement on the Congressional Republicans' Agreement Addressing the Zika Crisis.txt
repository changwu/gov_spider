    Hillary for America Senior Policy Advisor Ann O'Leary released the following statement today after House and Senate Republicans agreed on a flawed conference report to confront the Zika crisis:"Yet again, Republicans have chosen to inject partisan politics into the response to Zika â€” a public health emergency. Instead of ensuring crucial funding to address the crisis with the urgency and seriousness that it deserves, Republicans are playing politics by adding provisions that are harmful to public health and women's health, including restricting access to contraception. We urge the Senate to reject this proposal. Republicans in Congress must act immediately to provide needed emergency funds, without harmful offsets or policy riders, so we have all the tools we need to address Zika both here and abroad."
