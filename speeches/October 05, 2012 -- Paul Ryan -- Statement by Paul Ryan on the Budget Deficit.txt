    Paul Ryan released the following statement on today's report of the fourth straight trillion-dollar budget deficit under President Obama:
"President Obama once promised to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term, but today's Congressional Budget Office estimate confirms that he's broken that promise, and has presided over his fourth straight trillion-dollar budget deficit. The President's reckless spending habits have burdened the American people with another $5.5 trillion in debt while failing to bring a real recovery for the 23 million Americans struggling for work or the 15 percent of Americans living in poverty. We can't afford another four years like the last four years, and Mitt Romney and I are offering a new path. Our Plan for a Stronger Middle Class will cut the deficit, put us on track toward a balanced budget, and get our economy growing again. That's the kind of real recovery our economy needs."
