    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, a Protocol Amending the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Australia for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, signed at Canberra on September 27, 2001 (the "Protocol"). I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State concerning the Protocol.
The Convention, as amended by the Protocol, would be similar to recent tax treaties between the United States and other developed nations. It provides maximum rates of tax to be applied to various types of income and protection from double taxation of income. The Convention, as amended by the Protocol, also provides for resolution of disputes and sets forth rules making its benefits unavailable to residents that are engaged in treaty shopping.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this Protocol, and that the Senate give its advice and consent to ratification.
