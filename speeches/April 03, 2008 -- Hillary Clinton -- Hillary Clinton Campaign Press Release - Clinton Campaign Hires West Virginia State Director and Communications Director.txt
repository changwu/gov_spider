    The Hillary Clinton for President Campaign today named Talley Sergent as the West Virginia State Director and Jessica Santillo as the West Virginia Communications Director.
"Hillary Clinton is the only candidate with the strength and experience to tackle the tough challenges facing West Virginia and the nation," said Sergent, a Huntington native.
"West Virginians have patiently waited their turn to head to the ballot box â€“ and now they will have their opportunity to make their vote count. We look forward to engaging West Virginia's voters from every corner of the state in a vigorous grassroots effort to support Hillary in the upcoming primary," Sergent added.
Sergent, the 2007 West Virginia Young Democrat of the Year, previously worked for the West Virginia State Democratic Party as its Communications Director and a regional field organizer. She is also a veteran of the Kerry-Edwards '04 campaign and served as a member of Senator Jay Rockefeller's press team in Washington, D.C.
Santillo joins the West Virginia team after working for the Clinton campaign in Iowa, Colorado and Texas. She is also a veteran of several congressional offices and campaigns.
"West Virginia will play a critical role in choosing the Democratic nominee," Santillo said. "We will continue building on Hillary's momentum throughout the state to ensure that every West Virginian has a voice in this election."
