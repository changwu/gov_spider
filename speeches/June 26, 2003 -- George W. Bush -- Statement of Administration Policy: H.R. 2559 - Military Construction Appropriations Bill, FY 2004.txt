    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Sponsors: Young (R) Florida; Obey (D) Wisconsin)
The Administration supports House passage of the FY 2004 Military Construction Appropriations Bill, as reported by the House Committee. The bill ensures that the Nation's military construction priorities are met, and provides the resources and infrastructure for our fighting forces at home and abroad. In particular, we appreciate the level of support for Base Realignment and Closure and the critical resources needed to improve the quality of life and housing for our service men and women and their families.
The Administration applauds the House Committee for reporting a bill that is fiscally responsible. The President supports a discretionary spending total of $784.7 billion, along with advance appropriations of $23.2 billion for FY 2005 -- in accordance with his Budget and the FY 2004 Congressional Budget Resolution. Only within such a fiscal environment can we encourage continued economic growth and a return to a balanced budget.
The bill provides $9.1 billion for military construction and family housing, $40 million below the President's request. While the bill contains a number of unrequested projects, the bill provides resources critical to improving the quality of life of military families. The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for programs that are necessary to change the overseas basing strategy. The Administration looks forward to working with the House to advance our collective goals as the process moves ahead.
