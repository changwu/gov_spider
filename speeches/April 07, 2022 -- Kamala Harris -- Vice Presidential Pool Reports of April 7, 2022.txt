VP Pool report #1
Pool arrived at the National Gallery of Art at 5:45pm for tonight's VP event for the "Afro-Atlantic Histories" exhibition. She will be getting a tour of the exhibition before giving remarks.
Will be sending more background on the event as soon as I get it.
A podium is set up for remarks in the East sculpture hall as well as tables and cocktail buffets.
We walked through the empty halls to reach our holding location (which was pretty amazing)
We left the WH At 5:29pm but did not ride with the motorcade so your pooler hasn't seen the VP yet.

VP Pool report #4 - event
Kaywin Feldman, Director of the National Gallery kicked off the event at 7:42pm.
She mentionned the fact that the VP earlier presided over the confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson, calling it a historic day, drawing loud cheers and applause.
The Director introduced the VP and the VP started speaking at 7:48pm.
"I would just as a point of personal privilege like to tell you that I was so honored as the Vice President of the United States But as the President of the Senate to sit in the Senate chamber, this afternoon, and witness, America, elevate an extraordinary choice with a black woman to the highest court of our land."
"Yet this history, sadly is rarely taught in our schools, shown in our museums, this moment, and this national galery is leading the way. And this exhibit therefore is so extraordinarily significant and important. And it tells the story of our shared past but also our shared future."
VP wrapped up her remarks at 7:53pm and walked off stage.
VP was wearing a black dress.
Before remarks, She was given a tour of the exhibition by the Director & curators.
As always please check quotes against tape.
The event is ongoing but we are leaving the Gallery at 8pm
