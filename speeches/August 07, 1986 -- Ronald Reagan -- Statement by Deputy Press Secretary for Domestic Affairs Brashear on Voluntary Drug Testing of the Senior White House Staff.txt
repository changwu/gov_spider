    Monday, the White House senior staff, led by the President and the Vice President, will begin voluntary drug testing to set the example and lead the way toward the President's goal of a drug-free workplace. The President has made it clear that he is seeking a drug-free workplace for all Americans. He believes that all Federal employees deserve a drug-free environment and that Federal employees should set the example for State and local governments and the private sector to follow in identifying users of illegal drugs. This is an essential step in helping users free themselves of the drug habit.
