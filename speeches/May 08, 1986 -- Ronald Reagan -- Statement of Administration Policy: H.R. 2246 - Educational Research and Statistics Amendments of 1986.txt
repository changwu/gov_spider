    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Williams (D) MT and 4 others)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2246, which reauthorizes the educational research and statistics activities of the Department of Education, but will seek repeal of section 400A of the General Education Provisions Act in the Senate version of the reauthorization. Repeal of this section, including the Federal Education Data Acquisition Council, would eliminate duplicative reviews, and the resulting unnecessary delays in data collection.
