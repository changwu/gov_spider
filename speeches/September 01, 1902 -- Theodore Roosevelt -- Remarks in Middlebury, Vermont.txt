    I am very glad to be with you in Vermont on Labor Day, because Vermonters have always worked, it is the law of useful life. Some times the work may come on unpleasant lines, but in the world's economy it is necessary. From '61 to '65 the work day to some of you was on the battlefield, but since you have taken up with equal spirit and courage the tasks of field, factory and forge. In the Senate at Washington and other lines of trust and responsibility it has been my pleasure to know men who served through the war as privates, but they did their work well in peace and war. The future of our country depends on those who work and whether they work with an eye to the best or not.
