    Radical Islamic terrorists have declared war on Western Civilization, and this week, President Obama had an opportunity to reassure the nation that he takes this threat seriously by announcing a comprehensive strategy to defeat ISIS.
Instead, he delivered a weak and timid Oval Office address where he doubled-down on his failed foreign policy, signaled no change in direction and politicized the San Bernardino terrorist attack by calling for more gun control.
Jeb responded on Facebook following the President's address:
The following morning, Jeb appeared on Fox and Friends and MSNBC's Morning Joe with more reaction to the President's lack of resolve to lead the fight against ISIS.
By refusing to call this threat for what it is — radical Islamic terrorism — you end up with a weak and tepid strategy. Hillary Clinton and President Obama still refuse to utter those words.

President Obama has weakened our intelligence capabilities at a time when they're needed more than ever. We need to restore the metadata program to protect the homeland.

During his speech, President Obama spent more time talking about what we shouldn't do than what we should. That's not a strategy.

Prior to President Obama's address, Jeb appeared on ABC's This Week and responded to Hillary Clinton's interview that same morning. When it comes to defeating ISIS, the contrast between Hillary Clinton and Jeb couldn't be more clear:
 

The first impulse of @HillaryClinton & @BarackObama is more gun control. My first impulse is to take out ISIS. https://t.co/G0XNeWrGw5

Three months ago, Jeb outlined a comprehensive, detailed strategy to defeat ISIS and address the crisis in Syria. It's time for President Obama to do the same. Read more here.
