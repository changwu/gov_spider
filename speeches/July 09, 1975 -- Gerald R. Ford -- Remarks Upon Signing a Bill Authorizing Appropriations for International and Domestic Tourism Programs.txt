    Distinguished Members of Congress, members of the executive branch, and guests, those interested in travel and tourism:
Let me say it is a great privilege and pleasure to participate in the signing of this authorization for the travel service.
We did have some differences, but I think with some air of responsibility and degree of cooperation we have come up with a good piece of legislation. It provides for the travel service, in the one instance, of $90 million, running from July 1, 1976, to September 30, 1979. That is the program where we try to convince people in other countries to come to the United States in order to enjoy our people and the beauty of America.
The other part of the program, which also runs from July 1, 1976, to September 30, 1978, a total of about $8,125,000, is a program aimed at getting the American people to enjoy the beauties of their own country and to get better acquainted with their fellow Americans.
Both programs, in my judgment, are worthy of support. The department, the executive branch does have more flexibility in the new provision, which I can assure you will be judiciously and properly used.
I want to thank the Members of the Congress who participated in the reconciliation of differences, and I certainly wish to indicate to them that we will use this authority and handle this legislation and the funding to the best advantage of the tourism program in the United States.
And with that, I will thank them all again and sign the bill.
