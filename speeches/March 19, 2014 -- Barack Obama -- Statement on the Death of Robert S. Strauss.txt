    Michelle and I were saddened to hear of the passing of Bob Strauss. Bob was one of the greatest leaders the Democratic Party ever had, yet Presidents of both parties relied on his advice, his instincts, and his passion for public service, not to mention his well-honed sense of humor. As President Carter's Trade Representative, he helped open new markets for American exports. As President Bush's last Ambassador to the Soviet Union and first Ambassador to the Russian Federation, he stood up for our interests and values at a moment of immense change. Bob was truly one of a kind, and our thoughts are with his children, his family, and his friends too numerous to count.
