    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the District of Columbia Code, as amended, I am transmitting the FY 2001 Budget Request of the District of Columbia Courts.
The District of Columbia Courts have submitted a FY 2001 budget request for $104.5 million for operating expenses, $18.3 million for capital improvements to courthouse facilities, and $41.8 for Defender Services in the District of Columbia Courts. My FY 2001 budget includes recommended funding levels of $98.0 million for operations, $5.0 million for capital improvements, and $38.4 million for Defender Services. My transmittal of the District of Columbia Courts' budget request does not represent an endorsement of its contents.
This transmittal also includes information on grants and reimbursements forwarded by the Courts in response to the request in Conference Report H. Rept. 106-479.
I look forward to working with the Congress throughout the FY 2001 appropriation process.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, May 8, 2000.
