    To the Congress of the United States:
In June 1991 I determined and reported to the Congress that Hungary continues to meet the emigration criteria of the Jackson-Vanik amendment to, and section 409 of, the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2432 and 2439). In October 1991 I determined and reported to the Congress that Czechoslovakia also meets the emigration criteria contained in title IV of the Trade Act of 1974. These determinations allowed for the continuation of most favored nation (MFN) status for Hungary and Czechoslovakia without the requirement of an annual waiver.
As required by law, I am submitting an updated formal report to the Congress concerning emigration laws and policies of the Republic of Hungary and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic. You will find that the report indicates continued Hungarian and Czechoslovak compliance with U.S. and international standards in the areas of emigration and human rights policy.
The Administration is taking steps to exercise the authority provided me in section 2 of Public Law 102 - 182 to terminate the application of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 to Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
