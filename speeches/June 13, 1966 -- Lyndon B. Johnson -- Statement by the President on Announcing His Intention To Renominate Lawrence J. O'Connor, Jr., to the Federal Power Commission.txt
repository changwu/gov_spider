    I HAVE thoroughly reviewed and evaluated Commissioner O'Connor's service on the Federal Power Commission since his appointment by President Kennedy. I have been impressed by his integrity, conscientiousness, and the substantial contribution he has made to the Commission's deliberations. As the only member of the Commission who is an accountant, he is of special value in many of the highly technical and involved accounting questions that come to the Commission for decision. His decisions on the critical issues coming before the Commission have reflected a strong commitment to the public interest.
