White House In-Town Pool Report Number 4— June 14th
The White House's press briefing wrapped up after 3 PM. Will make this short due to the briefing being streamed online—but notably, Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to comment when asked a question by a CNN reporter about Mr. Trump's remarks last night aimed at President Biden. The CNN reporter said: Mr. Trump "called his arrest, quote, the most evil and heinous abuse of power in the history of our country…and he accused the current president of having him arrested, effectively directing his arrest…" before asking if the White House had a response. "I'm not going to comment," Jean-Pierre said. The next scheduled POTUS in-town event is his speech tonight, which the pool will gather at the palm doors at 6:55 PM for a departure.

White House In-Town Pool Report Number 8— June 14th
President Biden took to the stage at The Anthem at 7:57 PM to applause from attendees at the League of Conservation Voters' dinner. "Thank you all for your leadership," he told the crowd, calling climate change an "existential" threat. A few minutes into his speech, Biden asked congressional Democratic leaders to stand. Thought-out his address, he made a point to highlight perceived first-term climate accomplishments. "I signed an executive order to make environmental justice the responsibility of every single federal department in the United States," he said. "On day one of my presidency, we moved to re-enter the Paris Accord because the United States should lead the world. Lead the world on climate!"
Next stop TBD.
