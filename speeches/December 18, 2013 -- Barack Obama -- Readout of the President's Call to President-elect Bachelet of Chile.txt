    President Obama spoke by phone this morning with Chilean President-elect Michelle Bachelet to congratulate her on her victory in Chile's second-round election on December 15. The President expressed his desire to continue strengthening the relationship between the United States and Chile, building on the close partnership he enjoyed with President-elect Bachelet during her previous term, as well as with President Pi√±era during his time in office. The two countries enjoy robust cooperation on a variety of important priorities, including in the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations and Chile's nomination this year to the U.S. Visa Waiver Program. The President looks forward to working closely with President-elect Bachelet to advance our shared interests in the years ahead.
