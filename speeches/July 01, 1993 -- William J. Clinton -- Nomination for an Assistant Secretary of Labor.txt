    The President announced his intention today to nominate Joseph Dear, formerly director of the State of Washington's Department of Labor and Industries, to be the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health. In that role, he will serve as the Administrator of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
"With his experience running a major State agency regulating workplace safety and related matters, Joseph Dear is an outstanding choice for this important position," said the President. "During his tenure in Washington, he turned a deficit into a $350 million surplus in the workers' compensation budget. He established a health care cost containment and quality assurance program and overhauled the workers' compensation system to save the taxpayers money while increasing benefits to workers. That is the kind of leadership I want to have at OSHA."
