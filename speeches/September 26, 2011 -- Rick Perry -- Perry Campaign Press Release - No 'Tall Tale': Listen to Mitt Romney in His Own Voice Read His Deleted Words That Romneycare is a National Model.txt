    Romney: "We can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country"
With his campaign continuing to deny that Mitt Romney bragged about Romneycare being a national model in his 2010 book, No Apology, Mr. Romney himself can be heard reading the line he later deleted from the paperback version of his book in the video "Words Have Meaning."
The video is available at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GfdHx9_7rg andhttp://www.youtube.com/user/perrytruthteam.
Mr. Romney deleted: "We can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country."
Despite indisputable evidence, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney said Monday, "Rick Perry's weak claim on Mitt Romney's book is just a tall tale." [1]
"Mitt Romney should tell the truth and just admit that he deleted from his book his claim that Romneycare is a national model," said Perry spokesman Mark Miner. "It is understandable that Mr. Romney is embarrassed that he created the blueprint for Obamacare, yet as Mr. Romney has stressed, 'words have meaning.' "
