- Dear Lew:
The report of your mission following up the financial and economic discussions held in Washington last March between representatives of the United Kingdom and the United States is here and I have now had a chance to read it carefully. It is clearly the product of your own studious attitude and your great understanding of dollar-sterling relationships.
Your study strikes me as a most valuable contribution toward illuminating the still dark corners of this highly significant matter. It has in it a vein of candor, both with respect to the United Kingdom's position and our own, which is, I think, refreshing and very useful. I plan to transmit for study a copy of this report to the head of each department and agency of the Executive Branch concerned with foreign economic policy. It is my intention to release the report when I forward it to the Chairman of the Commission on Foreign Economic Policy upon its formation in the near future. I regard your study as an important document for the consideration of that Commission.
In accepting this report and releasing you from the assignment you undertook in my name and as the Secretary of State's deputy, I want you to know of my genuine gratitude for this new chapter in your long record of dedicated public service. Please convey my thanks also to those who assisted you in this useful contribution to one of the perplexing problems of our time.
With warm regard,
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
