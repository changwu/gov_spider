 In-town pool report #1 
Good morning from the White House!
I'll be your in-town pooler this Memorial Day. It's a cloudy 72 degrees befitting the somber holiday.
Pool this morning undertook the now customary COVID-19 test. As before, White House officials said pool will only be informed of the result if it comes out positive.
Events on the president's public schedule are the annual wreath-laying at Arlington Cemetery and a visit to Fort McHenry in Baltimore. Your pooler will let you know if anything changes.

FLOTUS, wearing a white suit coat and white heels, entered the area at 10:19 and stood at the steps of the ampitheater.
POTUS, wearing a dark suit and red, entered the grounds at 10:31, followed by VPOTUS and Esper, who stood beside him in a line.
POTUS saluted as a military band played the National Anthem, while VPOTUS, FLOTUS and Esper placed their hands on their hearts.
When the band was finished, POTUS approached the wreath positioned at the tomb, then touched the wreath before returning to the line with VPOTUS and Esper.

 Out of town pool report #2: speech excerpts 
Out of town pool is positioned at Fort McHenry, awaiting POTUS' arrival.
Will send some color from the event in a few minutes. For now, here are the speech excerpts the White House sent the pool:
SPEECH EXCERPTS (AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY)
"I stand before you at this noble fortress of American Liberty to pay tribute to the immortal souls who fought and died to keep us free."
"Tens of thousands of service members and national guardsmen are on the frontlines of our war against this terrible virus. [...] We mourn alongside all of the families who have lost a loved one – including the families of our Great Veterans."
"As our Brave Warriors have shown us from our nation's earliest days – in America, we are the captains of our own fate."
"Every time we sing our anthem – every time its rousing chorus swells our hearts with pride— we renew the eternal bonds of loyalty to our fallen heroes. We think of the soldiers who spent their final heroic moments on distant battlefields to keep us safe at home. We remember the young Americans who never got the chance to grow old but whose legacy will outlive us all."
"Today, we honor the heroes we have lost. We pray for the loved ones they left behind. And with God as our witness, we renew our vow to love and protect and cherish this land they gave everything to defend."

 Out of town pool report #3: color from Fort McHenry 
The pool is pre-positioned inside the Memorial Day event at Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine, and not in the landing zone where Marine One touched down at 11:44am EDT, which means we will not get a visual of POTUS exiting the helicopter.
As M1 was making its approach, a fife and drums corps entertained attendees. Pool doesn't have an official crowd count yet, but an approximate 200 people are gathered at the outdoor complex that has been decorated with red, white and blue banners for the event. An American flag is flying overhead near the president, and one has also been affixed to a building to the left of the press section.
Attendees are in socially distanced white chairs, about half wearing masks, behind a row of bike racks separating them from the president, who will speak from a podium more than six feet back from the guest seating area. Press is some 75 feet away from the podium in a filing area.
More TK.

 Out of town pool report #4: POTUS remarks 
The president and first lady at 12:00 pm EDT entered the fort. The fife and drum corps promptly played the national anthem, the president and first lady standing with their hands over their hearts throughout.
The president is delivering televised remarks now on the "determination" of the American people in the context of the War of 1812, telling the story of Francis Scott Key and The Star Spangled Banner.
Before he entered the fort his national security adviser and chief of staff came in and mingled with a few attendees. Rep. Andy Harris, a Republican from Maryland, came over to Mark Meadows and greeted his former colleague with an elbow bump.
Harris is wearing a face shield that is produced by a company in his district. The director of PPE for the company, Hardwire, told reporters that he brought the face shields to get them on the radar of the White House and the president. Will send direct quotes from him as soon as possible.
Pool is already packing up, 13 minutes into the event, for our departure.


 May 25, 2020 12:32

 Out of town pool report #5: departure 
The pool was brought back stage, so to speak, as the president finished his remarks and then rushed on foot to the landing zone for his departure in M1.
He wrapped up at 12:20 pm EDT and traveled by car around the monument to the helicopter, where he and the first lady -- who was wearing cream heels that matched her cream coat --- were dropped off as close to the helicopter --- in the grass -- as allowable.
He gave two sets of fist bumps to onlookers behind him as he exited the vehicle, then turned to press and waved twice. He did not come over.
At 12:28 PM, the president and first lady were airborne. M1 and its accompanying helicopter did an intentional lap overheard before heading back to Washington.
Pool will be lifting off in Ospreys imminently and heading in the same direction.

 Pool report #6: other information and color from the event
Pool is back at McNair, loaded up in vans that will deliver us back to the White House.
A few remainders from the event.
-- BOATS HONKING: during the president's speech, and while he was doing his fly over, a boat or boats could be heard honking in the harbor.
--- REP. HARRIS: Before the president arrived, Congressman Harris, who was seated in the last row of chairs for attendees, up against the bike rack that separated press from the rest of the event, was seen engaging in a dispute with a White House advance staffer. The context of the conversation between Harris, who raised his voice at the advance person, was not clear, but members of the press overheard Harris yelling "bulls***" at the staffer loudly.
--- FACE SHIELDS: Daniel "Charles: Harris, director of PPE sales, told reporters that Hardwire's facilities have been manufacturing the face shields that Rep. Harris and other attendees were wearing for about two months.
"Our competition right now, not only for federal contracts, but also, hospitals and things like that, is mostly Chinese," he said.The company is Maryland based, he said, and every component of the shield is "buy American compliant" and sourced out of the US -- the plastic is from Texas, the tape from North Carolina, and the foam from Michigan -- "every part is American sourced." He said that he brought about 20 shields to the event. " I want the president to see what he's competing with, with the Chinese economy," he said. "We are hand and fist with them, trying to beat them. We can produce them here. We have the means, and we have the manpower to produce them here, and I want to make sure that the president knows we can."
--- MASKS: the president and the first lady, O'Brien and Meadows did not wear masks to the event.
