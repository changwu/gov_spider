WH In-Town Pool Report #10 -- more from small business event
This email has fuller comments from administration officials from the Roosevelt Room small business relief event. I'll send some limited comments from the banks next, but you also got the information sent from the White House.
President Trump and Sec. Mnuchin answered four media questions at the close of the event.
Mnuchin and Trump said their request for more funding for the Paycheck Protection Program is distinct from Phase 4 coronavirus bill negotiations.
Asked about more direct cash assistance for Americans, Mnuchin said “We'll come back on that issue. Right now we're working on execution, making sure small business have all the money they need.”
Asked about Peter Navarro's memo from January 29 regarding coronavirus, Trump said “we'll talk about it at the press conference,” referring to the 5 PM briefing.
Asked about what the administration is doing to allow more community banks to make PPP loans after two community banks on the videoconference said that 1/3 of all community banks could not access the program, Mnuchin said “There's just a lot of new users coming onto the system. They're all getting authenticated. We'll get them all approved.”
-----
President Trump, Ivanka Trump, Larry Kudlow, Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Administrator Carranza all gave statements in the Roosevelt room at the top of the small business event. They sat at a long table facing a television screen displaying video feeds of the bank CEOs participating in the event in a similar style to a Zoom call.
Ivanka Trump, Mnuchin and President Trump made short closing remarks after each bank CEO spoke.
There were two technical glitches. At one point during Trump's opening remarks, the video feed played back a stuttered version of Trump speaking. Also, the last bank invited to speak, Live Oak Bank, was unresponsive and appeared not to be on the call when President Trump called on the CEO.
I already sent you some highlights from President Trump's opening remarks.
Secretary Mnuchin said over 3,000 banks have been participating in the Paycheck Protection Program since Friday.He called the response to the program “incredible.”Over the weekend, he told President Trump it was “so successful we were concerned we would run out of money.”He said he spoke Sens. McConnell and Schumer and Reps. Pelosi and McCarthy today regarding additional funding for the PPP program.“We look forward to the Senate passing that on Thursday and the House passing that on Friday.”
Administrator Carranza said of all the small businesses in the nation, “I think they're all approaching our phone lines as we speak.”She said about 300 new lenders are working with the SBA on the PPP.
National Economic Council Director Kudlow expressed confidence that the economy will return strongly.“I will say that as our mitigation policies have taken hold successfully in dealing with the virus and as we move to what we believe can be a reopening of the economy in the weeks ahead, we started with a strong foundation as the president mentioned and there will be some transitions, but I see no reason why the second of the year cannot resume strong, solid growth.”

WH In-Town Pool Report #11 -- final blast from small business event
Select comments from bank CEOs:
The CEO of Goldman Sachs requested a policy modification from the administration:"We believe the Treasury should work with the SBA to provide a designated tranche of the money that's being earmarked for CDFIs and other mission driven lenders. We believe this could occur through new guidance. Otherwise, businesses served by CDFIs will continue to face an uphill battle receiving the capital they so desperately and urgently need."
The CEO of Bank of America:"We're up to about 250,000 applications at our company. We're beginning to process those through to the SBA. It will take an automated feed that the SBA is working hard to get set up because when it starts coming it's coming with a lot of volume.""We continue to get continue to get several thousand applications every hour and we are not yet to the second part of the program, which you spoke about earlier, the sole proprietors."
And as I wrote earlier, two community banks also requested that the SBA open up PPP lending to more community banks.
