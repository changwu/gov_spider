    Chicago, IL -- U.S. Senator Barack Obama today released the following statement on the United Auto Workers strike.
"I stand with the 73,000 United Automobile Workers who are striking General Motors. The demands the union is fighting for--job security, the health benefits they were promised--are things that all workers should expect and that UAW members deserve. General Motors owes it to the UAW to come back to the bargaining table so that union members can go back to work."
