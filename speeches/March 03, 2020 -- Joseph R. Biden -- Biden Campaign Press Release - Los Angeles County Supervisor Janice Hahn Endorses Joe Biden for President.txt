    Today, Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"Joe Biden is a leader who can unify and heal our country at this unique moment in history. From delivering on the Affordable Care Act and Recovery and Reinvestment Act to helping negotiate the Paris Climate Accords -- Joe Biden has delivered for working families across California and the country. While in Congress, I saw firsthand his unique ability to bring people together to solve problems. That's why I know Joe will bring level headedness, decency, stability and common sense back to our government. As President I know he'll get to work on day one and get our country back on track. I'm proud to endorse Joe Biden for President."
Hahn has served on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors since 2016. Prior to that she served in the United States House of Representatives from 2011 to 2016 and the Los Angeles City Council from 2001 to 2011.
