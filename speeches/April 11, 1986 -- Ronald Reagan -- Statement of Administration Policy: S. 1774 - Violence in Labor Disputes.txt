    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Grassley (R) Iowa and 27 others)
The Administration supports enactment of S. 1774 but recommends an amendment to expand the bill's bar to prosecution to include conduct incidental to peaceful picketing in the course of any legitimate labor dispute, without regard to whether the dispute is subject to the National Labor Relations Act. This amendment would ensure that the peaceful picketing exception contained in the bill would be available to all labor-management disputants, such as employees of the airline and railroad industries, and not just those subject to the National Labor Relations Act.
