    First Lady Melania Trump visited Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C., today to visit with patients, families and staff members. The tradition of First Lady visits to Children's National dates back more than 60 years to First Lady Bess Truman.
Mrs. Trump began her visit by touring the neuroscience center, where she spent time with patients and their families, as well as doctors, nurses, and other staff. After the visit, Mrs. Trump, escorted by two patients, arrived in the hospital's main atrium where she read one of her favorite holiday books, "The Polar Express" and answered questions from some of the patients about the holidays and what they mean to her.
"I was so grateful at the opportunity to spend time with the children and their families today, and want to thank the medical staff at Children's National for their lifesaving work," said First Lady Melania Trump. "The holidays are a time for hope, love, traditions and family, and it is my wish for everyone to be able to celebrate them in good health with their loved ones. Many of the patients and families I visited with today cannot spend the holidays at home this year, so I ask everyone to keep them in their thoughts and prayers as we hope for a speedy recovery and joyous New Year."
