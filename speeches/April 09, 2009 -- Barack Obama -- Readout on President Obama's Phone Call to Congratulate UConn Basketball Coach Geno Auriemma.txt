    Yesterday, President Obama called University of Connecticut women’s basketball coach Geno Auriemma to congratulate him on his team’s victory over Louisville in the NCAA National Championship women's basketball game in St. Louis. Listed below is a readout on the phone call from White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs:
"The President congratulated Coach Auriemma on his team's undefeated year and was impressed to learn that UConn had only one senior who started in the title game. Coach Auriemma put center Tina Charles on the phone, and the President congratulated her on a great game and for going 11 for 13 from the floor, but jokingly asked what happened with the other two shots. The President told Coach Auriemma that he’s looking forward to seeing him and the rest of the Huskies at the White House."
