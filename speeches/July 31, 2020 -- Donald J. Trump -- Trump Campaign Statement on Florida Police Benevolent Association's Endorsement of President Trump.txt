    Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. released the following statement in response to the Florida Police Benevolent Association's (PBA) endorsement of President Donald J. Trump's re-election. Florida PBA is the largest police association in the state of Florida, and their support marks the fourth endorsement of President Trump from law enforcement in the month of July. President Trump will be heading to Florida today to meet with local sheriffs and hold a coronavirus and storm preparedness roundtable.
"Joe Biden and the radical left are using our brave law enforcement officers as punching bags and scapegoats to divide the nation and conceal the truth - you will not be safe in Joe Biden's America," said Bob Paduchik, Trump 2020 Senior Advisor for Law Enforcement and Labor Unions. "The unanimous endorsement from the Florida BPA is proof police officers understand the importance of re-electing this Law and Order President for four more years. President Trump will continue to defend the Thin Blue Line and fight for the safety and security of our communities, and America's law enforcement officers are with him every step of the way."
