'I don't think it's a Whistleblower at all. I think this is an anonymous source for the Democratic Staff in the House of Representatives. This is an insult to real Whistleblowers.

'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters Thursday his controversial July call with President Trump involved no bribe blackmail or quid pro quo as impeachment-minded Democrats claim.' This should immediately end the talk of impeachment! https://t.co/0mOTK4dNC3Retweets: 15052Favorites: 50986

The President of the Ukraine just stated again in the strongest of language that President Trump applied no pressure and did absolutely nothing wrong. He used the strongest language possible. That should end this Democrat Scam but it won't because the Dems & Media are FIXED!Retweets: 21023Favorites: 79057
