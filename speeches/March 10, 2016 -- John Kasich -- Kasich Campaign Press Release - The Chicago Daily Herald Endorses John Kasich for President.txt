It may be said that while Ohio Gov. Kasich has received the least fanfare of the four Republicans still actively campaigning, he is by far the most able.
In fact, this is a public servant who's had a hand in some of the most significant achievements of his time.
As a member of Congress, he led efforts as chairman of the House Budget Committee to balance the budget during the administration of President Bill Clinton â€” a remarkable feat that today seems herculean given the wild-spending ways of our federal government.
Kasich also was prominent in the landmark welfare reform measure passed in that era.
In addition, he became an expert in national security as a member for 18 years of the House Armed Services Committee, where he played a role in setting the stage for the stunning end of the Cold War.
As governor, he was instrumental in eliminating Ohio's $8 billion budget deficit and turning it into a $2 billion surplus, all while cutting taxes and creating jobs.
His record of accomplishments is impressive. As impressive is the spirit of collaboration he brings to his work. In an era of paralyzing intransigence between our two political parties, he has been a breath of fresh air. His philosophy is conservative to be sure, but he has an ability to work across the aisle with those who hold different points of view.
