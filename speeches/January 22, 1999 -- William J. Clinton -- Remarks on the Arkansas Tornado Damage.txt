    Good morning. I was very sad to learn of the terrible losses suffered by the people of Arkansas as tornadoes swept through Little Rock, North Little Rock, and 16 other counties in my home State last night.
As you know, there has been considerable loss of life, and we are still getting reports. The fact that the Governor's Mansion, where Hillary and I raised Chelsea for 12 years, was actually in the path of the storm made it all the more real to me.
Director Witt has just briefed me on the damage. He and I have faced challenges like this before at home because Arkansas gets so very many tornadoes. And we are deeply committed to doing everything we can to help the people there recover.
I have been in touch with the mayor of Little Rock this morning and expect to talk to more of the officials as the day goes on. We will be working with them to get whatever appropriate assistance is required. And our thoughts and prayers are with them. And I expect to get further briefing from Mr. Witt to determine what, if anything else, we should do.
Thank you very much.
