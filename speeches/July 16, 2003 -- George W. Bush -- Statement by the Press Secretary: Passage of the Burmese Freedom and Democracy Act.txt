    The President applauds today's passage of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act by the Congress, and he looks forward to signing it into law. This legislation sends a clear message to the Burmese regime that their continued detention of Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and their assaults on freedom cannot stand. The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act is the result of close cooperation between the Congress and the Administration and is intended to focus the world's attention on the Burmese regime's continuing oppression of its people. The United States fully supports the Burmese people in their struggle for democracy.
