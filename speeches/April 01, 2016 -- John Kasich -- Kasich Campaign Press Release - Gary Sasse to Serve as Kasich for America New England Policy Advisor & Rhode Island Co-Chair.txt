    Today Kasich for America announced that longtime public servant and political advisor Gary Sasse will serve as a campaign co-chair in Rhode Island and policy advisor for New England.
Said Sasse, "I'm proud to join John Kasich's presidential campaign. From my years in state government, I know how skilled of a leader you have to be to balance a budget while cutting taxes at the same time. In Washington and in Ohio, John Kasich has demonstrated an unparalleled commitment to promoting fiscal restraint without leaving anyone behind. He's clearly the best fit for Rhode Island and its neighboring states, and I'm confident voters will agree when they hear our message."

After serving as Executive Director for the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council (RIPEC) from 1977 to 2007, Rhode Island Governor Donald Carcieri appointed him to fill the role of Director of the Department of Administration and Department of Revenue in 2008.
Prior to joining the Kasich for America leadership team, Sasse served as chairman of Senator Marco Rubio's Rhode Island Steering Committee.
Said Kasich, "Gary Sasse is a proven, effective leader and administrator who understands what's at stake in this election. I'm grateful for his willingness to share his vast expertise as we expand our ground game in New England this spring."
