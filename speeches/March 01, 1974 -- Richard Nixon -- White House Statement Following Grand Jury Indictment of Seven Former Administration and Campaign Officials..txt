    THE PRESIDENT has always maintained that the judicial system is the proper forum for the resolution of the questions concerning Watergate.
The indictments indicate that the judicial process is finally moving toward resolution of the matter. It is the President's hope that trials will move quickly to a just conclusion. The President is confident that all Americans will join him in recognizing that those indicted are presumed innocent, unless proof of guilt is established in the courts.
