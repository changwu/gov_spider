    Alexandria, Va. - November 20, 2015 - On Thursday, Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and GOP presidential candidate, submitted to the Republican Party of Virginia more than twice the number of voter signatures required for Virginia's March 1 primary ballot. The Carson campaign's signatures were verified and approved by the Party.
In order to qualify for the primary ballot in Virginia, presidential campaigns must gather at least 200 signatures from each congressional district in the state and 5,000 signatures statewide. In 2012, only two Republican presidential campaigns qualified for the Virginia primary. Dr. Ben Carson submitted over 14,000 signatures of Virginia voters from nearly every county and city.
"I am honored to submit the signatures of Virginians who petitioned to place my name on their primary ballot," said Dr. Carson. "I am especially humbled by the hundreds of volunteers who spent tireless hours gathering these signatures across the Commonwealth. This effort is reflective of the movement our campaign has inspired--a grassroots movement of We the People, united to Heal, Inspire and Revive this great nation."
According to a recent University of Mary Washington poll, Dr. Carson leads the GOP presidential field in Virginia with 29 percent support among likely primary voters.
