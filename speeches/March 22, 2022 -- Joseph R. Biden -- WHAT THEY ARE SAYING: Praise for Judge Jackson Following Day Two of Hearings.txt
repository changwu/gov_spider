Coverage Highlights
Wall Street Journal: Editorial: Ketanji Brown Jackson Likes America[3/22/22]
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson faced hours of questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, and she held up fine, though Supreme Court confirmation hearings are now akin to the Circumlocution Olympics. We'd still like to hear her speak candidly about how she thinks judges ought to interpret the Constitution.
"But it was heartening to hear Judge Jackson affirm the promise of America. Too many on the left seem to think the U.S. is structurally, irredeemably flawed.
Paul Kane, Washington Post Congressional Reporter: "Romney tells me that child-porn angle via Hawley/Cruz is wrong, won't impact how he votes. 'It struck me that it was off course, meaning the attacks were off course that came from some. And there is no there, there.'" [Tweet, 3/22/22]
NBC News: GOP senator predicts Jackson will be confirmed[Sahil Kaput, 3/22/22]
"Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a member of the Judiciary Committee, made a prediction Tuesday evening about Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.
