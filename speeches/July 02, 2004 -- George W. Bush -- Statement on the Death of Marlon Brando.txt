    With the passing of Marlon Brando, America has lost a great actor of the stage and screen. His award-winning performances in films such as "On the Waterfront" and "The Godfather" demonstrated his outstanding talent and entertained millions across the country. Marlon Brando was one of the 20th century's finest actors and will be missed by his many fans and admirers. Laura and I send our prayers and condolences to his family and friends.
