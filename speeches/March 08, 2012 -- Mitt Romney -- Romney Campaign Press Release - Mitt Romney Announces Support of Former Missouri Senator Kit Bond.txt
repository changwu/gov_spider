    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Missouri Senator Kit Bond.
"I'm very thankful for Senator Bond's support," said Mitt Romney. "Kit has been a distinguished public servant and voice for limited government for many years. In the coming months, I look forward to his counsel so that I may bring a message of a smaller, simpler, and smarter federal government to all Missourians."
"I've been listening intently to all the candidates in recent months and have come to the conclusion that there is only one who can defeat President Obama, restore conservative principles to the White House, and provide the leadership our country needs," said former Senator Kit Bond. "That candidate is Mitt Romney and I am proud to support him. Time and again throughout his career, he has shown he can turn troubled enterprises around. That is precisely what we need right now. Unemployment is unacceptably high, home prices have fallen, and the American dream seems to be slipping away. I urge all those who are concerned about the future of this country to stand with me in supporting Mitt Romney."
