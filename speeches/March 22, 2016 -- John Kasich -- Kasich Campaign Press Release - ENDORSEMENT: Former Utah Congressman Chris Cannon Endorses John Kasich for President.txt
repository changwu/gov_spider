    Today former Utah Congressman Chris Cannon announced his support for Gov. John Kasich's presidential campaign and joined the Kasich for America leadership team in Utah.
Said Cannon, "From serving alongside John Kasich in Congress, I know him to be a man of integrity and a capable leader. We haven't had a balanced federal budget since he was Chair of the Budget Committee, and we won't have one again anytime soon if we don't elect John to the Oval Office this November. He is the only candidate who has proven time and again his ability to spur economic growth and bring people together. I'm proud to lend my support to his campaign in any way I can."

Cannon represented Utah's 3rd Congressional District from 1997 to 2009. A business owner, lawyer and venture capitalist by profession, Cannon served as a solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior from 1983-86 and as Utah Republican Party Finance Chair from 1992-94. The Salt Lake City native is the third member of the Cannon family to serve in Congress.
Said Kasich, "Former Congressman Cannon has deep roots in the state of Utah and has a thorough grasp of the issues that matter most to Utah voters. I'm grateful and honored to welcome him to our Utah leadership team as we make the final push toward the caucuses tomorrow."
