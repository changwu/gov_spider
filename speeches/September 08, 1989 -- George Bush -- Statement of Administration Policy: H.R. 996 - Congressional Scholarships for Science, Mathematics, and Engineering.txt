    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revised LA)(House)(Walgren (D) Pennsylvania and 86 others)
The Administration supports the concept of providing scholarships to emerging science, mathematics, and engineering scholars as the President proposed in his February 9th budget.
Instead of H.R. 996, however, the Administration urges adoption of the "National Science Scholars Program," which is part of the President's proposed "Educational Excellence Act of 1989" (H.R. 1675). The President's proposal would provide, under the auspices of the Department of Education, scholarships for students studying mathematics, science, or engineering. The Administration's proposal would be far less burdensome to administer and would more realistically meet the costs of undergraduate study than would H.R. 996.
