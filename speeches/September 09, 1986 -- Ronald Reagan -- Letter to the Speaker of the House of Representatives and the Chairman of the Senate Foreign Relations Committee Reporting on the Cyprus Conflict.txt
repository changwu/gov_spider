    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384, I am submitting to you a bimonthly report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question.
Since my last report to you, the United Nations Secretary General has continued his initiative. He has made clear his commitment to his good offices mission and to helping the two Cypriot sides move forward toward an overall solution. In this regard, he will be meeting with Mr. Denktash on September 16 and with President Kyprianou later in the month. We will give the Secretary General our full support and encourage the parties to cooperate with him and carry forward the work that has been accomplished since the inception of his initiative.
Among other developments in Cyprus of note, Turkish Prime Minister Ozal visited northern Cyprus from July 2 to July 4. During that period, movement through the primary crossing point between north and south Cyprus was blocked by demonstrations on the Greek Cypriot side. On July 4 Turkish Cypriot authorities announced the closure of all crossing points on their side of the U.N. buffer zone and did not reopen them until July 12. We made clear to all concerned our view that actions that could exacerbate tensions and complicate the search for a peaceful settlement should be avoided.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
