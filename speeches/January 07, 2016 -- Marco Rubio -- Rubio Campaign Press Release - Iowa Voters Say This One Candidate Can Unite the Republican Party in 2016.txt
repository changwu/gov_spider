Iowa voters in Burlington are swinging to Marco Rubio after his town hall earlier this week. WQAD covered the event, and noted that voters believe Marco can unite the Republican Party.

Here's what Iowa voter Sue Dyer had to say:
I think he can do it all. We need Republicans to unite, and get around him, and I think he's the one who can do it.

She's not the only Hawkeye Stater who thinks so.
Iowans also praised Marco's positive, issues-oriented campaign â€” and they'll be seeing plenty of Marco this month.
