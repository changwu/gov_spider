    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. DeGette (D) Colorado)
The President unequivocally opposes all forms of human cloning. The Administration is strongly opposed to any legislation that would prohibit human cloning for reproductive purposes but permit the creation of cloned embryos or development of human embryo farms for research, which would require the destruction of nascent human life. Thus, if legislation were presented to the President that permitted human embryos to be created, developed, and destroyed simply for research purposes, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.
