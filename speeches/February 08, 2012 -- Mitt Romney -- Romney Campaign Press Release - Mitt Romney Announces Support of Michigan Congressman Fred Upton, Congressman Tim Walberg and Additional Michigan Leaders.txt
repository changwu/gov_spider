    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Michigan Congressmen Fred Upton and Tim Walberg, as well as additional Michigan elected officials and leaders.
"It is an honor to have the support of Congressman Upton and Congressman Walberg, and so many fine leaders from Michigan," said Mitt Romney. "President Obama's policies have been especially hurtful for Michigan. Michigan is home for me and I will work my hardest with leaders like Congressmen Upton and Walberg to make sure Michigan can reclaim the pride the state felt when I was growing up."
"In order to enact the change we are fighting for in Washington, we must change the Administration," said Congressman Fred Upton. "Whether it is repealing Obamacare or stopping cap-and-trade and other regulations that stifle job growth, Mitt Romney will be the leader we all can trust to fundamentally change Washington."
"Mitt Romney is a strong, successful leader who is best prepared to defeat President Obama," said Congressman Tim Walberg, "I look forward to working with President Romney to repeal the government takeover of health care, move our nation toward a balanced budget and reduce tax rates to encourage job creation."
