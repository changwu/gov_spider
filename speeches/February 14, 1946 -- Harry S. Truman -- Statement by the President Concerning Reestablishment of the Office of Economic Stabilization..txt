    I AM ISSUING an Executive Order reestablishing the Office of Economic Stabilization. The new wage and price policy will place great demands on both the Office of Economic Stabilization and the Office of Price Administration. I plan to appoint as the directors of these respective offices two able and experienced men, Chester Bowles and Paul A. Porter.
I am designating Charles R. Denny, Jr., as Acting Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.
