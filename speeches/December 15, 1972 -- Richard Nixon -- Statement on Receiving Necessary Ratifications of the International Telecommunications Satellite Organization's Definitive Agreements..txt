    I NOTE with special satisfaction today that the number of ratifications necessary to bring the INTELSAT definitive agreements into force has been fulfilled. This marks an historic milestone in international communications, with consequences ranging far into the future. All of the partner-members can take great satisfaction from the progress of this unique multinational venture for the peaceful use of outer space.
With its volume of traffic constantly increasing and with more new earth-stations being inaugurated each year, the global communications satellite system is helping to bring the peoples of the world closer together. It is our hope that the closing of communications gaps will greatly enhance understanding among nations.
We can now look forward to the day when nations around the world will be linked together for instantaneous communications. The implications of this development are enormous, presaging improved international relations in the political, economic, cultural, and scientific spheres.
I am pleased to congratulate the partner-members of INTELSAT and to express my confidence in the continued growth and expanding usefulness of this system.
