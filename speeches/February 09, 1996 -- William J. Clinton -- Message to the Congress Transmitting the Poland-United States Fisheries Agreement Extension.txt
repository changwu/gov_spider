    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Poland Extending the Agreement of August 1, 1985, as amended, Concerning Fisheries Off the Coasts of the United States ("the 1985 Agreement"). The Agreement, which was effected by an exchange of notes at Warsaw on December 15 and 20, 1995, extends the 1985 Agreement to December 31, 1997.
In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the Republic of Poland, I urge that the Congress give favorable consideration to this Agreement at an early date.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
