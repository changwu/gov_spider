While this is the first time we have ever put a major party candidate for President on our ballot, the consensus among independents is that this is the first time a major party has put a true reformer on the top of their ticket." -- Frank MacKay, Chairman of the Independence Party of New York
WOODBRIDGE, NJ -- Yesterday, McCain-Palin 2008 received the official endorsement of the Independence Party of New York at its convention in Albany, NY.
The Independence Party's State Chairman, Frank MacKay, said that the nation's 42 million independents will be a critical voter bloc in the upcoming election, stating that yesterday's vote is indicative that independents are supporting McCain in large numbers.
He stated: "Today, an overwhelming number -- 85 percent -- of the state's Independence Party members voted to nominate John McCain to be our candidate for President of the United States. While this is the first time we have ever put a major party candidate for President on our ballot, the consensus among independents is that this is the first time a major party has put a true reformer on the top of their ticket. Senator John McCain is one of our own."
Upon receiving this important endorsement, Senator McCain stated, "I share the ideals of all who put country first and appreciate the support of Chairman MacKay and the nomination of the New York Independence Party. As someone who has a long history of working across the aisle to get things done, you may be assured that I will always act in the best interest of the people and our country as President of the United States."
