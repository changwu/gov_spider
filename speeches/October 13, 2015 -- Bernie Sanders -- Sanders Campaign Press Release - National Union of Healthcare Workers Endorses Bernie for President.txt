    HENDERSON, Nev. — The National Union of Healthcare Workers— an organization representing 11,000 health care workers at hospitals, nursing homes, and clinics throughout California— on Monday endorsed U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders for president.
"We've had a great relationship with Sen. Sanders for years," said NUHW President Sal Rosselli, in a release announcing the endorsement. "He's the real thing. He's been standing up for working Americans for decades. But no president can go it alone; it will take a bottom-up, grassroots movement to change the direction of our country. NUHW is proud to be part of that movement."
Roselli went on to say it was Sanders' message of reversing economic inequalities; his support for a single-payer health care system, Medicare for All; and his stance of holding HMOs like Kaiser Permanente accountable for failing to comply with mental health parity laws, that resonated with NUHW members.
"As a democratic, member-led union, I am grateful for the support of the National Union of Healthcare Workers," said Sanders. "With their support and the support of hundreds of thousands of union members across the country, we are building a political revolution that will transform American politics."
