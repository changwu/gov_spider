    I KNOW that people in this tri-cities area are aware of our national energy policy announced in my message of June 4, 1971.
At that time I called on the private sector to join Government in financing one demonstration liquid metal fast breeder reactor, to begin to move this Nation into an era of plentiful, clean, and safe atomic power.
Today I am happy to be able to say that private industry has, according to our latest information, subscribed over $200 million for this important project. This assures that our first reactor can go into construction. Further, I have decided to order the authorization of a second liquid metal fast breeder reactor in order that we can move forward as rapidly as possible toward the achievement of our energy goals.
We are not today in a position to announce the locations of these experimental reactors. But those interested in the continued growth of the Pacific Northwest recognize the unique position which the Hanford Reservation occupies in the future of atomic energy in our Nation. I am confident that Hanford will continue to grow and that this area will most assuredly prosper as we move forward with the liquid metal fast breeder reactor and other energy programs.
