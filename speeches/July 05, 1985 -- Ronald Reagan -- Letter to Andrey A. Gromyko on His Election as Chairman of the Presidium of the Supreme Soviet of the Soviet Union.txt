    Dear Mr. Chairman:
Please accept my congratulations upon your election as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
Even though the differences between our nations are many and complex, as I made clear when we met last year, we can and must resolve these differences without threat or use of force, through discussion, patient effort and determination.
I wish you well in the high responsibilities you have now assumed, and I hope that we can cooperate to reduce tensions between our countries.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
