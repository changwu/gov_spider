    The Dole for President campaign today announced that Tom Korologos, a veteran Republican political consultant, will become Senior Convention Advisor for the campaign. Korologos, president of the Washington consulting firm Timmons and Company, will offer strategic guidance in planning the 1996 Republican Convention in San Diego.
"The success of this year's Republican Convention will have a major impact on the shape of the presidential race going into the fall," said Dole Campaign Manager Scott Reed. "That's why we're so pleased that one of the Republican Party's most experienced and creative political strategists -- and a close friend of Senator Dole -- will be on the team as we put it together. With Tom's input and advice, I have no doubt that this year's convention will offer voters a powerful and compelling argument why America needs Bob Dole as President."
"The Republican convention is our best opportunity to show voters the clear difference between Bill Clinton's broken promises and Bob Dole's proven leadership," said Korologos. "It's our chance to tell the American people about Bob Dole's courageous personal story, his solid track record in getting things done, and his clear vision for a better future. From our San Diego launch pad in August, we will put the Dole campaign on a clear trajectory straight to the White House."
Korologos was one of the founders of Timmons and Company in 1975. Prior to joining Timmons and Company, Korologos spent four years in the Nixon and Ford administrations as Deputy Assistant to the President for Senate Relations. He also served for nine years as Assistant to U.S. Senator Wallace Bennett (R-UT). Korologos is a former Chairman of the United States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy and was Director of Congressional Relations for the National Bipartisan (Kissinger) Commission on Central America. He also served as Director of Congressional Relations for President Reagan's 1980-81 transition staff.
