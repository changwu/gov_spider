    The United States condemns the act of violence in Taiwan today. We are thankful to learn that Mr. Chen Shui-bian and Ms. Annette Lu avoided life-threatening injuries, and our prayers are with them and their families for speedy, full recoveries. The calm that has prevailed on Taiwan since the shooting underscores the civic responsibility of the Taiwan people and the strength of their democratic system. We applaud their commitment to moving forward with the March 20 election, and have confidence in Taiwan's prosperity, security, and commitment to democracy.
