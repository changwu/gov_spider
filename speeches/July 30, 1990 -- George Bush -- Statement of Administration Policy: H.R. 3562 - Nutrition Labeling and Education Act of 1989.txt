    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Waxman (D) CA and 18 others)
The Administration recognizes that changes in nutrition labeling are needed. However, the Administration opposes H.R. 3562 as unnecessary in light of the Food and Drug Administration's proposed rules for nutrition labeling published in the July 19th Federal Register. Public comments are currently being accepted on those proposed rules.
