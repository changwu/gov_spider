    As earthquake recovery efforts have continued, the President's contingency fund has enabled our administration to respond to unforeseen problems. Most of the funds I am releasing today will help small business people in southern California who have had difficulty obtaining assistance until now.
With today's action, for the first time ever, a committee in each House of Congress has reported a bill that guarantees universal coverage. They have broken the chokehold of special interests and, by choosing to cover everyone, have stood up instead for millions of hard working middle class Americans.
As we continue to move forward, and as momentum for reform builds, this committee action sends a clear signal to the American people that Congress is well on its way to making health care history this year.
