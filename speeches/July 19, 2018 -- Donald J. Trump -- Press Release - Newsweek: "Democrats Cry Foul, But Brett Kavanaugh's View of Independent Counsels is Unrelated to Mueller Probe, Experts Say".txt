Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh dislikes independent counsels and told a group of conservatives in 2016 that he wanted to "put the final nail" in the ruling that upheld their constitutionality.
Now, leading Democrats including Chuck Schumer and Cory Booker are using Kavanaugh's statement to spark an outcry before his Senate confirmation hearing. The senators have argued that if he were appointed to the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh would aim to declare Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation on Russian election meddling unconstitutional.
But law experts told Newsweek that Kavanaugh's view on independent counsels has nothing to do with special counsels or Mueller's probe and, in fact, the two types of federal investigations are completely different.

Special counsels, on the other hand, are regulated and consistently checked on by the attorney general within the Department of Justice.
While the expert says that there is "no doubt that this is likely to be a significant subject" in Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing, it is important lawmakers recognize these differences before making assumptions that Kavanaugh would automatically deem Mueller's investigation unconstitutional.

David Fontana, a law professor at George Washington University, agreed with Turley and said that there is no way to possibly say that Kavanaugh would automatically view the Mueller probe as unconstitutional. Even if a five-justice majority featuring Kavanaugh were to overrule the Morrison v. Olson decision it is still likely that Mueller's investigation will be found constitutional, Fontana told Newsweek.
