    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Luken (D) Ohio and 2 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1208, and the Secretary of Transportation would recommend that the President veto the bill unless it is amended to:

permit the Department of Transportation to proceed with implementation of its regulations regarding railroad alcohol and drug use (the result of over 6 years of rulemaking and litigation), rather than requiring the Department to promulgate new rules which would be subject to further litigation;
delete the guarantee of reinstatement after treatment to employees who violate alcohol and drug use prohibitions; and
eliminate the requirement that violators complete 40 hours of community service, which is inadequate as a deterrent and also inappropriate for a civil regulatory program.
