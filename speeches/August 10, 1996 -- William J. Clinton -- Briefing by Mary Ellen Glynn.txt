MS. GLYNN: The President and Mrs. Clinton got up this morning about 6:30 a.m. and took a walk around the property. And they ran into a moose -- not physically, not literally, but they saw a moose and watched him eat foliage for a while. And then they went back to -- and that is about it. He's in for the day.
Q: How far away was the moose?
MS. GLYNN: Not too far. Far enough that the Secret Service agents got a little bit nervous.
Q: They usually charge for something like that.
MS. GLYNN: There was no charge. That's what the Service said to me.
Q: -- for the moose because it was too far or too close?
MS. GLYNN: It was fairly close and fairly big.
Q: Was it a male or a female moose?
MS. GLYNN: I have no idea.
Q: How early did you say that was?
MS. GLYNN: They said they got up about 6:30 a.m. and took about an hour's walk. And that is it. They're sitting there reading.
Q: Can it be accurately reported that the President knows about Dole's selection of a running mate?
MS. GLYNN: Yes, it can be accurately reported.
Q: Does he have some -- had any comment on it?
MS. GLYNN: No.
Q: Does he plan to watch the announcement?
MS. GLYNN: I doubt it. I doubt it. It didn't look like they were into turning on the TV today.
Q: What's the place like?
MS. GLYNN: It's beautiful. It's very large. Its wooded and there's a pond and a stream and horses.
Q: Do they have a porch they sit out on or --
MS. GLYNN: There's a big porch and a study -- didn't see any rocking chairs. Nice.
Q: Do they hang out outside do you know?
MS. GLYNN: I think they've been doing that, yes.
Okay, I'm being overtaken by Bob Dole. (Laughter.)
Q: There's a lid on, right?
MS. GLYNN: We've got a lid, yes. Nothing for tonight. We'll try and make pool duty better tomorrow.
THE PRESS: Thank you.
