(House Rules)
(Rep. Ryan, R-WI)
The Administration supports House passage of H. J. Res. 59 â€“ Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. The legislation would replace a portion of the across-the-board sequester that has harmed students, seniors, and middle-class families and has served as a drag on the Nation's economy over the last year. The legislation would allow for critical investments in areas such as education, infrastructure, and scientific research, while keeping the Nation on the path to long-term deficit reduction. The legislation includes targeted fee increases and spending cuts designed in a way that does not hurt the Nation's economy or the Federal Government's commitments to seniors.
The Administration urges the Congress to pass this bipartisan agreement and looks forward to working with the Congress to enact clean, full-year FY 2014 appropriations bills based on this agreement in order to continue growing the Nation's economy and creating jobs. In addition, the Congress should extend unemployment insurance before it expires at the end of this year so more than a million Americans looking for work do not lose a vital economic lifeline right after the holidays, and the Nation's economy does not suffer.
