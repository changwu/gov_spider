    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In order to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency described and declared in Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, and continued on August 15, 1995, and August 14, 1996, necessitated by the expiration of the Export Administration Act on August 20, 1994, I hereby report to the Congress that pursuant to section 204(b) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b) ("the Act"), I have today exercised the authority granted by the Act to issue an Executive order (a copy of which is attached) to revise the existing procedures for processing export license applications submitted to the Department of Commerce.
The new Executive order relates to my decision to transfer certain commercial communications satellites and jet engine hot-section technology from the United States Munitions List administered by the Department of State to the Commerce Control List administered by the Department of Commerce. Specifically, when I made that decision I also decided to amend Executive Order 12981 of December 5, 1995, which set forth procedures for the interagency review and disposition of dual-use export license applications.
The new Executive order is designed to provide that the first-level license determination for the affected commercial communications satellites and jet engine hot-section technology would be made by majority vote, instead of by the Chair of the Operating Committee of the Advisory Committee on Export Policy. This change assures that national security and foreign policy considerations will be fully taken into account with respect to license processing in these two sectors.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
