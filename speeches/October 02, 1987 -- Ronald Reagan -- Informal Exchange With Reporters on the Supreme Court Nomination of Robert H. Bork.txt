    Q. The Republicans say Bork is finished.
The President. I don't think anyone has an answer on that yet, and I'm going to continue working as hard as I can to see that he is appointed, as he should be, that he is confirmed.

Q. Well, even Senator Lugar says that the numbers aren't there and—
The President. Well.—
Q. that you have to face the reality.
The President. Well, I could answer you by quoting from others who've said the other. I don't think anyone is quite sure yet. There is a body of undecided, and that's the ones who hold the key to it. But remember
Q. Do you think you'll know it next week, sir'?
The President. What?
Q. Do you think you'll know next week? The undecided?
Q. the undecided?
The President. Well, we'll know more than we know now, because next week they will vote in the committee. But then it depends on the floor of the Senate, and that will be a few weeks further on.
Q. If he loses in committee, will you take it to the floor? If he loses in committee, will you pull it back?
The President. We don't know what the decision is going to be—or they may turn it out with no decision.
Q. the phone calls this weekend?
Q. How do you feel about that, sir? How would you feel about no recommendations?
The President. Feel about no recommendations? That's all right with me. It's the Senate that's got to make the decision.
