    To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting to the Congress the annual report required by Section 19b of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, entitled "Occupational Safety and Health Activities in the Federal Government." The report summarizes the Government's programs for the protection of the safety and health of its employees during 1976, activities prior to the begining of my Administration, and was prepared by the Department of Labor.
The report indicates that not all agencies. of the Federal Government have in the past fully followed guidelines set forth by the Department of Labor for workplace safety and health programs. This Administration is studying ways to improve the workplace safety and health efforts of all Federal agencies, including those programs that affect Federal employees. I intend that reports covering the years of this Administration will reflect significant progress in that regard.
