    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with section 502(f)(1)(B) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the "1974 Act") (19 U.S.C. 2462(f)(1)(B)), I am notifying the Congress of my intent to add the Republic of Senegal (Senegal) to the list of least-developed beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences program. After considering the criteria set forth in section 502(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)), I have determined that it is appropriate to extend least-developed beneficiary developing country benefits to Senegal.
