    It is an honor to welcome our distinguished guests, His Imperial Majesty, the Shahanshah of Iran, and Her Imperial Majesty, the Shahbanou, once again to our National Capital.
The visit of Your Imperial Majesties reflects the cordial, personal, and close governmental relations between the United States and Iran through many administrations. Ours is an old and tested friendship; it will continue to be so in the future.
Since Your Imperial Majesties last visited Washington, the world has seen many changes. But throughout this period, the United States commitment to peace and progress for the world has remained firm. Our commitment to a continuity of relations and constructive cooperation with friends such as Iran has remained constant, even while the world has changed.
We continue to build on the longstanding foundation of our mutual interests and aspirations. The United States and Iran have expanded and intensified cooperation on many fronts. Together, we can create an example for others to follow in the new era of interdependence which lies ahead.
Iran is an amazing country--an ancient civilization that through the centuries has retained its distinctive national identity and culture. In recent years, Iran has achieved remarkable progress, serving as a model of economic development. Its extraordinary achievements have been inspired by one of the world's senior statesmen, our distinguished visitor, His Imperial Majesty.
I look forward, Your Imperial Majesty, to the talks which we shall have during your visit to review what has been accomplished by our two nations and to explore new dimensions for harmonizing the interests of our two nations and increasing the cooperation between us in the cause of peace and prosperity for our two peoples and for the world.
On behalf of Mrs. Ford and the American people and our Government, it is my pleasure to welcome Their Imperial Majesties to Washington.
