    An agreement satisfactory to all parties has been reached with the Independent Counsel and congressional investigating committees to review the President's notes concerning the Iran-Nicaragua affair. Counsel to the President will review the President's notes from January 1, 1984 (the beginning date of the Independent Counsel's mandate) through December 19, 1986 (the date the Independent Counsel was appointed by the court). Counsel will excerpt relevant material for review by the Independent Counsel and the chairman of the House and Senate Select Committees or their designated staff. The reviewers will have full access to the typewritten excerpts and may take notes, but no copies will be allowed.
