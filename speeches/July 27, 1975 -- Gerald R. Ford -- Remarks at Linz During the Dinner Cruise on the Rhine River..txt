    Mr. Mayor, distinguished citizens of Linz, my good friend, the President of the Federal Republic, and Chancellor Schmidt, and distinguished guests:
It is a great privilege and a very high honor to have the opportunity of being here with Mrs. Ford and receiving your warm and generous hospitality. This pause in our boat trip up and (]own the Rhine is a most pleasant interlude in a very busy day in your country.
The wine town of Linz, with its tradition of some 11 centuries, embodies the characteristic features of the Rhineland--good wine, pleasant people, and a beautiful setting.
I have been told that the local custom in the year 1700 was for each councilman to drink his cup of wine to the bottom, but that the general accounting office objected to the very, very high cost.
The mayor of Linz replied with this letter: "The counsellor's first task is to drink wine. A lamp without fuel cannot shine."
I am also told that the decisions of the council were always unanimous-something politicians of today can certainly envy.
It has been a great pleasure for Mrs. Ford and myself to join you on this wonderful occasion, if only for a few moments, and we extend to all of you the very best wishes from all Americans. We thank you for your graciousness and your hospitality.
Thank you very much.
