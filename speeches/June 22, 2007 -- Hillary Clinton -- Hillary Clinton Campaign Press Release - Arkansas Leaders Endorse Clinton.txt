    The Clinton Campaign announced the endorsements of Senator Mark Pryor and several other leading Arkansas officials today on the eve of Hillary Clinton's first campaign visit to the state to address the Democratic State Party's Jefferson-Jackson Dinner Saturday.
"Hillary Clinton is one of Arkansas' favorite daughters," Sen. Pryor said. "She made us proud as First Lady of Arkansas, and she'll do so again as President of the United States. Hillary has the strength and the experience to hit the ground running from her first day in office."
"Hillary's combination of experience and commitment to Arkansas families is unmatched," said Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel. "She is a leader for all of America and is a candidate who can compete and win in all regions of the country."
"I have such fond memories of my three decades in Arkansas," Clinton said. "I'm delighted to be back visiting with so many old friends and talking about how we can move America forward."
Hillary will address the Arkansas Democratic Party's Jefferson-Jackson Dinner at 7 p.m. Saturday at Alltel Arena in North Little Rock. Free tickets are available through the campaign at www.hillaryclinton.com/arkansas or by calling 501.374.2361.
