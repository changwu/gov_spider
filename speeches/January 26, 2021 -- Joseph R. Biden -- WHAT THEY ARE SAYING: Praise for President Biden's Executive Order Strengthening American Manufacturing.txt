Kevin Dempsey, president and CEO of the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI): "We strongly support President Biden's action today.

We applaud President Biden for affirming his commitment to 'Build Back Better' by enforcing and improving programs to ensure taxpayer dollars are used for products made in America – most significantly, the use of American steel."

Senator Rick Scott: "Last year, the Senate passed my bipartisan resolution calling on families to buy American-made products whenever possible to help support American jobs and manufacturing, and build our supply chain. It's not always easy to buy American, but it's an important step we can all take at home to ensure America remains a leader in the global economy and is self-reliant in our supply chain. Buying American is not partisan, and I'm glad to see President Biden join me in acting to put American interests first." [Statement, 1/25/21]
