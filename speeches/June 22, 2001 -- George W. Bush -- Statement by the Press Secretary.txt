    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and ordered Federal aid to supplement Commonwealth and local recovery efforts in the area struck by Tropical Storm Allison on June 15-17, 2001.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in Bucks and Montgomery Counties.
Assistance can include disaster housing, grants, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
