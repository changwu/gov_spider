Q. Mr. President, are these your "delay in gridlock" friends?
The President. These are my friends. This group had always supported an aggressive approach to deficit reduction, the balanced approach.
Middle East Peace Talks
Q. Are you sure?
Why is Secretary Christopher coming back?
The President. Because I want to talk with him about the Middle East before he goes there.
Q. Do you think the peace process is in jeopardy, sir?
The President. Well, I hope not. I certainly have no reason to believe that it is, but obviously I'm concerned about it. I think the Syrians have shown commendable restraint so far. And I don't think we should let Hezbollah and all these groups that don't want anything good to happen in the Middle East derail the peace process by what they do. I don't think we should, any of us, should allow that. I mean, I really want something to happen there. So I'm very hopeful. But I thought that in view of the events there, that he ought to come home, and we ought to have a conversation about it before he goes to the Middle East.
