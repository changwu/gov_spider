    The United States strongly condemns the cowardly terrorist attack on religious pilgrims in the state of Jammu and Kashmir on July 10. We extend condolences to the victims' families and the people of India. An attack on religious freedom is an attack on the most fundamental right of liberty. The United States and India will continue to fight together against terrorist threats in every part of the world.
