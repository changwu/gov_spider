    I have today signed H.R. 3622, the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986. This legislation is the product of a 4-year effort led by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. It is a milestone in the long evolution of defense organization since our national security establishment was created in 1947. Our thanks go to Senators Barry Goldwater and Sam Nunn, Representatives Bill Nichols, Ike Skelton, John Kasich, and Larry Hopkins, Secretary Weinberger, David Packard, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and many others for their patience and perseverance in this effort.
After long and intense debate, we have set a responsible course of action by taking another important step forward, building on improvements underway since 1981, and affirming the basic wisdom of those who came before us—the Forrestals, Bradleys, Radfords, and Eisenhowers—advancing their legacy in the light of our own experience.
