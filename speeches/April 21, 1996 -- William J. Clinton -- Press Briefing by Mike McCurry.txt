MR. MCCURRY: On balance, the President is delighted with the results of this trip. This is a trip abroad in which the President has advanced the security, economic, and political interests of the people of the United States of America, dealing with difficult regional security issues like the North Korean nuclear problem and peace and reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula; dealing with the most important bilateral trade relationships that we have in this world, obviously the trade relationship with Japan; reaffirming and reasserting the United States' strong security interests in Asia; and managing the complexity of what is arguably the most important superpower relationship we continue to have in this world: the relationship between the United States and the Russian Federation.
The American people expect an American president to effectively manage these types of concerns, and the President feels satisfied that, on this trip, he has tended to their interest effectively when it comes to, as I say, the economic issues and the political issues and the security issues that define America's leadership role in the post-Cold War era.
