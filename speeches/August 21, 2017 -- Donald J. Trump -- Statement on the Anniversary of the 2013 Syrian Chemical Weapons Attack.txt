    Today marks the 4th anniversary of the Syrian regime's deadly chemical weapons attack that killed more than 1,400 people in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta. This tragic event precipitated an international effort that led to the destruction of more than 1,000 metric tons of Syrian chemical weapons. Still, on April 4th of this year, Assad proved beyond a doubt that he still possesses these heinous weapons and is willing to use them against innocent civilians.
It is critical that the international community not forget these tragic events. We must speak with one voice and act with one purpose to ensure that the Syrian regime, and any other actor contemplating the use of chemical weapons, understands that doing so will result in serious consequences. As the President has made clear, the United States will do its part to prevent the use or spread of these weapons. Along with the many other nations that have signed the Chemical Weapons Convention, we commit to work together to create a world without chemical weapons.
Today is an appropriate reminder of the importance of that commitment. We reiterate our call for all countries to stand together and leave no doubt that the use of chemical weapons will not be tolerated.
