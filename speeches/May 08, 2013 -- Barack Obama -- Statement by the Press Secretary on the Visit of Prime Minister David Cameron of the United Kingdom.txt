    On Monday, May 13, President Obama will welcome Prime Minister David Cameron of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the White House. The visit will highlight the fundamental importance of the U.S.-UK relationship -- a relationship through which together we address a broad range of shared global and regional security concerns. The President looks forward to discussing these issues with the Prime Minister, to include Syria, trade and economic cooperation, countering terrorism, and priorities for the upcoming G-8 Summit in Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister's visit underscores the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom that has been crucial in advancing our shared security and prosperity, and the tremendous strategic importance we place on broadening and strengthening our collaboration on global challenges. The President looks forward to visiting Northern Ireland in June, where Prime Minister Cameron will host the G-8 Summit.
