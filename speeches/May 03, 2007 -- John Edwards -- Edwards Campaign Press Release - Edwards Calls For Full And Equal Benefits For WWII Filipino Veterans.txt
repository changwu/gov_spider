    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards today called for full and equal benefits for the Filipino veterans who fought alongside American troops in World War II.
"We owe a debt of gratitude to all veterans who courageously serve and defend our country," said Edwards. "Filipino veterans deserve the same benefits granted to all those who put on the uniform and defend our freedom. We need immediate legislation so that these veterans -- at long last -- receive what has been long overdue."
As a senator, Edwards cosponsored related legislation, the Filipino Veterans Benefits Improvement Act, to improve benefits for Filipino veterans.
The Philippine Islands became a United States possession in 1898 following the Spanish-American War. During World War II, more than 250,000 Filipinos volunteered to fight alongside U.S. armed forces in across the Western Pacific. Filipinos were in the front lines of the battle of Corregidor and Bataan, walked in the Bataan Death March, and were tortured as prisoners of war.
