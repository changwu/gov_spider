I am honored that each and every one of these individuals has joined our effort, said Biden. Together, we will take our message of the need for a change in direction in American foreign policy and a renewed focus on the hopes and needs of our forgotten middle class across the state and country.
Romjue is a true veteran of the Iowa Caucuses having led a number of grassroots efforts organizing the state over the years. Along with his considerable experience in the Iowa caucuses, Romjue also brings to the campaign his experience in several of the other early nominating states. Most recently, he managed the Nevada Governors race during the 2006 election cycle.
I am thrilled that Bill has joined our team and will lead our efforts in the ever-important state of Iowa, said Luis Navarro, Biden's Campaign Manager. He will be an incredible asset as we continue to build our organization in the state. His experience and knowledge of the caucus process is unparalleled.
