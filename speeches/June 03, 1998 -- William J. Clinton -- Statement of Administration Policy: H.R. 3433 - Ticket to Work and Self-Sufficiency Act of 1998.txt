    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Bunning (R) KY and 26 cosponsors)
The Administration supports H.R. 3433, and is pleased that the House is taking action on the critical issue of making it possible for more people with disabilities to return to or enter the workforce. H.R. 3433 would implement a Presidential initiative to increase flexibility and choice for individuals with disabilities who seek services to help them successfully return to work. This is an Administration priority, as reflected in the President's March 13th Executive Order that established a task force of Federal agencies to identify additional actions required to increase the employment of adults with disabilities.
The Administration will work in the Senate to technically amend the bill to ensure that Federal conflict of interest laws will be clearly and uniformly applied to all members of the proposed Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Advisory Panel. Although the Administration is concerned about proposals that have cost implications for the Medicare trust funds, any concern about the modest costs associated with this initiative are more than outweighed by the importance of this policy.
Pay-As-You-Go
H.R. 3433 would affect direct spending and receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The Office of Management and Budget's scoring estimate for the bill is under development.
