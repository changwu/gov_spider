    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to submit to you the second annual report on health matters covered by the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, Public Law 91-173.
The report covers the implementation of the health program carried out by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The report provides a compendium of coal mine health research, medical examinations of coal miners, and other activities of 1971.
It is encouraging to note that, in 1971, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare completed the first round of medical examinations of coal workers required in the act. Many of the X-rays taken in the examination have been completely processed and those miners with abnormal chest conditions have been notified of these conditions and of their rights under the act.
A comprehensive research program, which has as its basic objective the determination of the development and progression of coal workers' pneumoconiosis, continued in 1971 along the lines established in 1970. Significant progress was made in 1971 toward the attainment of this goal.
I commend this report to your attention.
RICHARD NIXON
THE WHITE HOUSE,
September 26, 1972.
