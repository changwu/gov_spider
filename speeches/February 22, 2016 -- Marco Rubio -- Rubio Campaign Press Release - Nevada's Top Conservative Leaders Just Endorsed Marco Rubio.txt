Ahead of tomorrow's Nevada caucuses, Marco is racking up endorsements from conservatives across the state.In addition to Senator Dean Heller, Representatives Cresent Hardy and Mark Amodei are backing Marco. Watch why Rep. Hardy is picking Marco:

Marco also won over numerous activists and leaders in the state legislature. Assembly Majority Leader Paul Anderson says he's backing Marco to unite the party:
I couldn't be more excited to announce my support for Marco Rubio for President of the United States. It has become abundantly clear that Marco Rubio is the only conservative who can unite the Republican Party and beat Hillary Clinton in November. As a business owner and community leader who cares deeply about the future of my state and my country, I am urging my fellow Nevadans to support the next generation of conservative leadership and to caucus for Marco Rubio on Tuesday, February, 23rd.
Marco's team is working hard ahead of tomorrow's caucuses, and it's awesome to see such a great team of leaders joining the cause.Full list of new Nevada endorsements, in addition to Sen. Heller and Reps. Hardy and Amodei:
