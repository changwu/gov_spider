    ATTACHED for the consideration of the House of Representatives (Senate) is the legislative proposal for Federal election campaign reform which I outlined in my message to the Congress on March 8, 1974. This draft legislation covers several areas which I believe must be addressed in any comprehensive election reform measure.
First, enforcement of reporting requirements and restrictions on contributions would be facilitated by the establishment of an independent Federal Election Commission and by requiring each candidate to designate a single campaign committee and a single depository for funds.
Second, by requiring that all contributions to political committees from individuals be earmarked, by insuring full disclosure by all contributors, and by prohibiting the solicitation of contributions by intimidation, we would minimize the undue influence of special interest groups and strengthen the influence of individual citizens over the electoral process.
Third, by outlawing deceptive acts which are calculated to disrupt campaigns or mislead voters and by making it criminal to obstruct or impair an election or registration for an election, the draft bill would rightfully deter improper campaign practices.
I realize that the Congress is now considering a number of other campaign reform proposals, including public financing of Federal elections, but I believe the Federal Campaign Reform Act of 1974 which I am proposing offers the best hope for change that works.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
