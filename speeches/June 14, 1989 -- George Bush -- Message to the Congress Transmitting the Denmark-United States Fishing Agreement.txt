    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94 - 265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an agreement effected by exchange of notes at Washington on March 28, 1989, extending for the period of 2 years from July 1, 1989, until July 1, 1991, and amending to conform with current U.S. law, the Governing International Fishery Agreement between the Government of the United States of America of the one part and the Home Government of the Faroe Islands and the Government of Denmark of the other part Concerning Faroese Fishing in Fisheries off the Coasts of the United States, signed at Washington on June 11, 1984. The exchange of notes, together with the present agreement, constitute a governing international fishery agreement within the meaning of section 201(c) of the act.
U.S. fishing industry interests have urged prompt consideration of this agreement and, similarly, I request the Congress give favorable consideration to this agreement at an early date to avoid disruption of cooperative ventures.
Since 60 calendar days of continuous session, as required by the legislation, will not be available before the current agreement is scheduled to expire, I recommend the Congress consider passage of a joint resolution.
George Bush
The White House,
June 14, 1989.
