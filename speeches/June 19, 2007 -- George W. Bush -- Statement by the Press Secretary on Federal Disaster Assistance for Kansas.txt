    The President today made additional disaster assistance available to the State of Kansas impacted by severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding during the period of May 4-18, 2007, by authorizing an increase in the level of Federal funding for debris removal and emergency protective measures under the Public Assistance program.
The President's major disaster declaration issued for the State on May 6, 2007, initially authorized Individual Assistance, Public Assistance, Hazard Mitigation, and any other forms of assistance under the Stafford Act subject to the completion of Preliminary Damage Assessments. Public Assistance, Hazard Mitigation, and Other Needs Assistance under Section 408 were authorized at 75 percent Federal funding of total eligible costs.
Under the President's order today, for a period of up to 72 hours, the Federal share has been increased to 100 percent of the eligible costs for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct Federal assistance, under the Public Assistance program.
The cost-share adjustment is retroactive to the date of the President's major disaster declaration for the State of Kansas.
