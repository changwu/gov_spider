    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revision)(House)(Reps. Tascell (D) Florida and Broomfield (R) Michigan)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1555 because it:
—authorizes Insufficient funding levels for security assistance programs, while increasing funding beyond the President's request in several development assistance programs;
— unduly limits Presidential discretion and flexibility in the conduct of foreign affairs by earmarking funds for obligation and disbursement for specific countries, projects and accounts;
— mandates disbursement of the entire 1986 Economic Support Fund amount for Israel within the first month;
— raises substantial constitutional concerns regarding the separation of powers principle and the President's powers to conduct foreign affairs;
— unacceptably limits Presidential flexibility concerning Central America;
— includes unacceptable restrictions on the sale and financing of defense articles and services to the government of Jordan;
— contains numerous unnecessary reporting and certification requirements;
— authorizes a potentially costly scholarship program for undergraduate students from developing countries; and
— limits the President's ability to deny funds to foreign non-governmental organizations that promote abortion.
