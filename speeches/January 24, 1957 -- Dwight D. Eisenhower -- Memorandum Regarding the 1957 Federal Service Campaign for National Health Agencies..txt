Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
The search for the causes and cures of diseases is one of the biggest concerns of medical science today. Public support of our voluntary National Health Organizations, through voluntary gifts and service, is one of the brighter aspects of the American scene. Marked by notable dedication toward overcoming health problems, these organizations are taking a major role in furthering scientific research, public education, and service to individuals.
In addition to the overwhelming personal tragedies and the staggering expense of medical and hospital care, the total economic cost of cancer, heart disease, arthritis and rheumatism, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, cerebral palsy, and other crippling diseases among children and adults, runs into billions of dollars a year in goods and services lost.
Tragically, many deaths are premature or unnecessary. With present day medical methods, lives could be saved and much suffering could be avoided if the diseases were discovered in time and given earlier treatment.
Through carefully planned educational programs, our voluntary National Health Agencies are instrumental in getting more and more people to have regular annual medical check-ups and to watch for danger signals which call for medical consultation.
Sherman Adams has kindly consented to serve as Chairman of the 1957 Federal Service Campaign for the National Health Agencies. He will be assisted by Arthur Larson and Maurice Stans as Associate Chairmen. The Campaign will be conducted during the six-weeks period beginning February 25, 1957, concurrently with the campaign for CARE and Crusade for Freedom under the new fund-raising policy approved June 27, 1956â€¢ I urge that everyone give the Chairman and Associate Chairmen his full support in this important and worthy endeavor.
