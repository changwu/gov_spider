    I welcome today's vote in the House of Representatives which clears the way for a speedy end to the arms embargo on Turkey.
Together with last week's vote in the Senate, the House action reflects a bipartisan, statesmanlike recognition that the time has come to turn a new page in our relations with the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean.
In recent weeks, there have been signs of improvement in the web of problems affecting relations among Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus. These developments helped produce the congressional actions which will now enable us to put the embargo era behind us.
Both Greece and Turkey are valued and respected allies of the United States. We are eager to help them strengthen their economies, their democratic institutions, and their contribution to the defense of the West.
My administration will continue to press for a just and lasting solution in Cyprus. We continue to believe that the disputes in the area must be settled through peaceful procedures. Any effort to impose a military solution would be actively and unequivocally opposed by the United States.
Today's decision by the House is a crucial step toward strengthening the vital southern flank of NATO. It will soon make possible the reopening of our military installations in Turkey. And it brings all the parties concerned closer to the goals of peace and security in the Eastern Mediterranean.
