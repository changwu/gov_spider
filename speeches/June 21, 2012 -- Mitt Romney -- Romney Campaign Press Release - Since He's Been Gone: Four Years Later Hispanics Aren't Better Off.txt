    "It's been four years since President Obama last addressed the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, and it's clear why the President hasn't rushed back. President Obama's failed economic policies have left millions of Hispanics unemployed and in poverty. From Day One, Mitt Romney will enact policies that get our economy moving again for Hispanics and all Americans" –Alberto Martinez, Romney Campaign Spokesman
Four Years Ago, President Obama Promised NALEO He Would Deliver Change For Hispanics:
President Obama, At NALEO In 2008: "You And I – Together – Will Change This Country And Change This World." "And I'm proud that my campaign is working hard to register more Latinos, and bring them into the political process. Because I truly believe that if we work together and fight together and stand together this fall, then you and I – together – will change this county and change this world." (President Barack Obama, Remarks, Washington, DC, 6/28/08)
What Type Of "Change" Has President Obama Delivered? Hispanics Aren't Better Off Than They Were When President Obama Last Addressed NALEO:
