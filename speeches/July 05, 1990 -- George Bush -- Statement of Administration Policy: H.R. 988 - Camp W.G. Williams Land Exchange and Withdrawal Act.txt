    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Nielson (R) Utah and two others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 988, but will seek amendments to the bill in the Senate.
Specifically, the Administration will seek to delete certain unnecessary and inappropriate provisions. One such provision would subject all land at Camp Williams to requirements currently applicable only to public domain land reserved for military use since 1958. Most of the Camp was reserved for military use in 1914. These requirements include mandatory renewal of the reservation of the land for military purposes every 15 years, and preparation of an environmental impact statement before each renewal. The Administration will also seek to delete a provision requiring the Secretary of the Interior to manage Camp Williams for recreational purposes. Much of the Camp is contaminated with unexploded munitions, making recreational use impossible.
