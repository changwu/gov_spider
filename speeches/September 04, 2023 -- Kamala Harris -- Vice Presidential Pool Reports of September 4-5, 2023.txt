VP travel 1 - JBA check in
Good morning from JBA,
I am doubling up as your radio and print pooler for VP's trip to my hometown Jakarta, Indonesia where she is scheduled to participate in the U.S. - ASEAN and East Asia Summits.
Apologies if you are receiving my emails twice since I am sending to 2 different distribution lists.
Pool has been swabbed and swept and is awaiting her arrival. Her schedule for your convenience:
At 8:00 AM EDT, the Vice President will depart Joint Base Andrews en route to Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska. This departure will be pooled press.
At 12:15 PM AKDT, the Vice President will arrive at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska for a re-fueling stop. This arrival will be closed press.
At 2:15 PM AKDT, the Vice President will depart Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska en route to Yokota Air Base, Japan. This departure will be closed press.

VP travel 4 - Alaska refuel stop
AF2 wheels down at Elmendorf base in Alaska at 11.40 local. Uneventful flight. CNN on the press cabin screens, focusing largely on Trump and the Georgia case.
VP came to the press cabin for an off the record chat a few minutes prior to taking off at JBA.
Alaska is closed press so I don't expect to be able to share anything during this approximately 2 hours refuel stop. Will send a note when we're about to wheels up for Japan for a second refuel.
