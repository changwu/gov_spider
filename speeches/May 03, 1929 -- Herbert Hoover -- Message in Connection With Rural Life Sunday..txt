My dear Mr. White:
I am glad to send you the following statement which you are at liberty to quote from this letter for publication in connection with the world-wide prayer service in behalf of the farmer and his work:
"The blessing of heaven to be invoked on May 5th by Christian [p.136] churches, of all creeds and in all lands, upon the farmer and his work, will comfort many with the knowledge that their burdens are in the anxious sympathetic thoughts of men of good will everywhere."
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
