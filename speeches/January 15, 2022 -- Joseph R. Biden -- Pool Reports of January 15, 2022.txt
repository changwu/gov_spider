Travel pool report #1 — tested
Good morning from Wilmington. It's currently 23 degrees, slightly warmer than expected!
Pool was just tested ahead of our 9:00am call time, but POTUS currently has an empty schedule. Might we have an OTR brunch with FLOTUS? Perhaps a late afternoon mass? Only time will tell.
As always, free to ping me directly with questions.

One fun bit of color from the ride: a large raptor swooped down and snared what pool assumes was a small animal as the motorcade passed a farm on the route back. Co-poolers think it was an eagle.
