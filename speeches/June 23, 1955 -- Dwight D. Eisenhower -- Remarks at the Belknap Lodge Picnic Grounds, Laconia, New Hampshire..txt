    Senator Bridges, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans:
Until I heard Senator Bridges talk just now, I had thought that there was no promoter of New Hampshire in the world to equal Sherman Adams.
I now think that we should stage a contest and have it done in front of a crowd like this, and by the degree of applause we can find out who can win. But it is going to be a close race, that I assure you.
I noticed that when Senator Bridges was speaking, there were certain interruptions--[laughter]--well, you people seem to find that ridiculous, but I am a farmer now and that was a very sweet sound to me. Now that I find that beautiful calf mine, she is sweeter than ever, and she is going to make some nice noises around Gettysburg, I hope.
I am not only grateful for what I have learned of New Hampshire this evening. I am certainly grateful for the New Hampshires, because they will be the first chickens on my farm. I expect to get all of the benefits that he talked about, of early feathers, and early eggs, and big eggs, and all the rest of it.
I am delighted to be here this evening. I am delighted to see you. To each of you, my thanks for the warmth of your welcome. Indeed, I might say now, that as I have traveled through your State this afternoon, I have seen many people along the road, in the villages, and in the towns and in the country. To you and to them, to every one who has given me a smile, or a "Hi Ike"-[mooing call]--my grateful thanks. [Laughter] Now, you see!--I think that's fine! [More laughter] After all, it's a New Hampshire talking!
Good luck to each of you. Thanks for a wonderful evening, which I have enjoyed to the full.
Goodnight.
