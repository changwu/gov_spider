    On October 17, 1986, I was presented by the Congress with an enrolled resolution designated H.J. Res. 738, a Joint Resolution making continuing appropriations for the fiscal year 1987, and for other purposes. I signed this measure into law on October 18, 1986. I have since learned that H.J. Res. 738 was not properly enrolled, in that a small number of paragraphs of text were omitted due to clerical error.
The provisions I signed into law on October 18 remain the law of the land. The Supreme Court has held that transmission errors of this sort do not in any way vitiate the legal effect of a President's signature. Accordingly, that which was signed became law. H.J. Res. 738 has since been properly enrolled and has been presented to me for signature. My signing of H.J. Res. 738 today will enable the provisions previously omitted to become law as well.
