    Boston, MA â€“ Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell made the following statement on the third quarter GDP report:
"Today's report of anemic 2 percent GDP growth underscores President Obama's broken promise to turn around our economy and highlights the opportunity voters have this November to make a choice for real change. The President's failed policies and failed leadership have let down millions of families across the nation, and it's clear we simply can't afford another four years like the last four years. When Mitt Romney is president, he will work with Democrats and Republicans alike to revitalize our economy, create 12 million jobs, stop the decline in take-home pay and put America back on the path of prosperity."
