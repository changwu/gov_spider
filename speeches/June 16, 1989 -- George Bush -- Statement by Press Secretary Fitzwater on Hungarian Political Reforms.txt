    The United States welcomes the announcement of the Hungarian Government's intention to begin discussions with the opposition as a first step to multiparty elections. On April 17, in Hamtramck, MI, the President pledged support to East European countries which embarked upon the path of fundamental political and economic reform. In view of Hungary's progress, the President will seek legislation to accord Hungary GSP (Generalized System of Preferences) and to permit the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) to operate in Hungary.
