    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit herewith the Seventh Report of the United States Sinai Support Mission. It covers the Mission's activities during the sixth-month period ending April 1, 1979 in fulfillment of obligations assumed by the United States under the Basic Agreement signed by Egypt and Israel on September 4, 1975. This Report is provided to the Congress in conformity with Section 4 of Public Law 94-110 of October 13, 1975.
The Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty signed in Washington on March 26, 1979, which supersedes the 1975 Basic Agreement, calls for the United States to continue its monitoring responsibilities in the Sinai until Israeli armed forces withdraw from areas east of the Giddi and Mitla Passes. This withdrawal is to be completed within nine months from the date of the exchange of instruments of ratification. In the meantime, the United States will continue to discharge its responsibilities in the Sinai in the same objective and balanced manner that has characterized the operations of the Mission since its inception in early 1976.
This year, funding of the Sinai Support Mission is authorized under Chapter 6, Part II of the Foreign Assistance Act, "Peacekeeping Operations". Careful control over program costs is expected to reduce expenditures by at least $500,000 below the amount appropriated for Fiscal Year 1979.
The Mission will be closed sometime next year, thus completing a successful U.S. initiative begun over three years ago. All Americans may be justly proud of the U.S. contribution to peacekeeping in the Sinai, and I know the Congress will continue its support of the Mission until the end of this important phase in the search for peace in the Middle East.
