    WE MUST NOT waste this valuable manpower resource when the need for trained workers in our hospitals, nursing homes, and other health facilities is so great.
The benefits of this program are twofold: We offer civilian job opportunities or training to these service men and women and we help to meet the demand for the best in medical care and service.
