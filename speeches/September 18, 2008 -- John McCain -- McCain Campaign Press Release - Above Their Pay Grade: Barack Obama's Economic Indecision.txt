With the financial security of millions of hardworking Americans at stake, we can't afford a president who just votes 'present.' The next president will need to put country before politics and make tough decisions to secure our economic and national security. John McCain's life is filled with examples of putting country first and doing what's right, regardless of self-interest or political gain. As Barack Obama has shown again this week, he has no such record." -- Brian Rogers, McCain-Palin 2008 spokesman 
INDECISION #1: Barack Obama "Would Not Say If He Supported Or Opposed" The AIG Bailout...
Yesterday, The Most Important Issue Of The Day Was The AIG Bailout And Barack Obama "Would Not Say If He Supported Or Opposed The Government-Backed Rescue Of Insurance Giant AIG." Fox News' Brit Hume:"The Democrat is not coming down one way or another on the AIG rescue. Correspondent Major Garrett explains why." Fox News' Major Garrett:"On the biggest financial issue of the day, Barack Obama would not say if he supported or opposed the government-backed rescue of insurance giant AIG." Barack Obama:"We don't know all the details of the arrangement with AIG and the Federal Reserve must ensure that plans protect the families that count on insurance." Garrett:"Obama also wants taxpayers protected but executives and shareholders exposed but on the central question to intervene or not, Obama sidestepped. Advisers said lack of details forced caution. The larger political truth; adv isors believe anxiety alone is enough to lift Obama in the polls. That is why on the trail, Obama doesn't talk about specifics of the moment but the nation's overall direction." (Fox News' "Special Report," 9/17/08)

I mean there's no good answer because it was the spot the policies of the last eight years that put us in. So it's hard to judge that right now, in my spot right here."

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV): "No One Knows What To Do." "The Democratic-controlled Congress, acknowledging that it isn't equipped to lead the way to a solution for the financial crisis and can't agree on a path to follow, is likely to just get out of the way. Lawmakers say they are unlikely to take action before, or to delay, their planned adjournments -- Sept. 26 for the House of Representatives, a week later for the Senate. While they haven't ruled out returning after the Nov. 4 elections, they would rather wait until next year unless Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, who are leading efforts to contain the crisis, call for help. One reason, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said yesterday, is that 'no one knows what to do' at the moment."
