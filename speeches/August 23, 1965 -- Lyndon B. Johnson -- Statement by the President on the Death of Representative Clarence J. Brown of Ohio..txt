    I AM distressed to learn of the death of Representative Clarence Brown, a distinguished public servant and my longtime colleague in the Congress.
Representative Brown was a principal sponsor of the Commissions on the Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government, known as the Hoover Commissions. To the work of those Commissions he devoted his great energies and his dedication to good Government.
He was a strong partisan, in the best tradition of American politics. He was also a patriot who served his country faithfully during the quarter century of his tenure in Congress.
