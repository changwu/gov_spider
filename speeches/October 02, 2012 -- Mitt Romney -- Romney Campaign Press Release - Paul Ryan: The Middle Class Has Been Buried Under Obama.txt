PAUL RYAN: "Unemployment has been above 8 percent for 43 months. Our economy is limping along right now. Vice President Biden, just today, said that the middle class, over the last four years, has been 'buried.' We agree. That means we need to stop digging by electing Mitt Romney the next President of the United States. Of course the middle class has been buried. They're being buried by regulations; they're being buried by taxes; they're being buried by borrowing. They're being buried by the Obama Administration's economic failures."
