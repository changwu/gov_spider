    Today the Joint Presidents of Bosnia-Herzegovina announced that the national day of their country will henceforth be celebrated on November 21, the anniversary of the Dayton peace accords of 1995. In so doing, the leaders of every ethnic community in Bosnia-Herzegovina have made clear that Dayton marked not merely the end of a war but the beginning of a new country and a blueprint for its future. I am pleased that the date November 21 will be honored as a symbol of multi-ethnic democracy and solidarity between the people of the United States and the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
