    CLEVELAND â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday welcomed the endorsement of the Inlandboatmen's Union of the Pacific. The union represents 4,000 merchant mariner and shoreside workers in the maritime industry from Alaska to Hawaii in freight, towing, and environmental as well as the passenger side of the industry. They also represent fish cannery workers in Alaska, warehouse workers in Portland, and U.S. Navy maritime support specialists in Hawaii.
Sanders spoke to the IBU during its national convention of delegates on Nov. 6th in Seattle. "Senator Sanders hit all our questions out of the park, resulting in a unanimous endorsement," President Alan Cote said. "In particular, we appreciate his very supportive stance on the Jones Act and his strong opposition to 'right to work' legislation."
When President Cote asked if there was a motion for nomination on deck, the entire delegation jumped to their feet and screamed "so moved!" The motion was followed by a thunderous second and an even louder shout of approval for the motion to endorse Sanders for president.
"We have no doubt about 'which side he's on' to paraphrase the late great Florence Reece," Secetary-Treasurer Terri Mast said. "Our members trust him and believe in his candidacy."
