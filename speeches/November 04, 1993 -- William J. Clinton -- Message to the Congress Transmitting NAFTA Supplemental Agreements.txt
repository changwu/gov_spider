    To the Congress of the United States:
By separate message, I have transmitted to the Congress a bill to approve and implement the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In fulfillment of legal requirements of our trade laws, that message also transmitted a statement of administrative action, the NAFTA itself, and certain supporting information required by law.
Beyond the legally required documents conveyed with that message, I want to provide you with the following important documents:

The supplemental agreements on labor, the environment, and import surges;
Agreements concluded with Mexico relating to citrus products and to sugar and sweeteners;
The border funding agreement with Mexico;
Letters agreeing to further negotiations to accelerate duty reductions;
An environmental report on the NAFTA and side agreements;
A list of more technical letters related to NAFTA that have previously been provided to the Congress and that are already on file with relevant congressional committees.

These additional documents are not subject to formal congressional approval under fast-track procedures. However, the additional agreements provide significant benefits for the United States that will be obtained only if the Congress approves the NAFTA. In that sense, these additional agreements, as well as the other documents conveyed, warrant the careful consideration of each Member of Congress. The documents I have transmitted in these two messages constitute the entire NAFTA package.
I strongly believe that the NAFTA and the other agreements will mark a significant step forward for our country, our economy, our environment, and our relations with our neighbors on this continent. I urge the Congress to seize this historic opportunity by approving the legislation I have transmitted.
