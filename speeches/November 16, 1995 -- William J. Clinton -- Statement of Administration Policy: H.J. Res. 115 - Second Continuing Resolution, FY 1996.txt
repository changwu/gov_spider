    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate Floor)(Sponsor: Livingston (R), Louisiana)
This statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views on H.J. Res. 122, the Second Continuing Resolution, FY 1996.
If Congress presented H.J. Res. 122 to the President am it passed the House, he would veto it.
This resolution sets out a framework for balancing the budget that would force the kinds of drastic cuts in Medicare, education, and the environment that Republicans in Congress have proposed as part of their balanced budget plan. As the President has said repeatedly, he will not accept such cuts. Rather, he has proposed a plan to balance the budget that would strengthen Medicare and Medicaid, invest more in education and training, protect the environment, and cut taxes for average Americans.
The Administration supports an extension of the previous continuing resolution, which was in place from October 1 to November 13, to end the government shutdown and give Congress time to finish its work. In addition, the Administration urges Congress to provide pay for those Federal workers who have been furloughed during this shutdown, through no fault of their own.
