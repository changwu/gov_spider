    HOUSTON, Texas — One day after Indiana Governor Mike Pence endorsed Senator Ted Cruz, Presidential candidate Ted Cruz announced his Indiana Leadership Team today.
The team is composed of 38 current and former elected officials and key grassroots leaders, and is led by Senate Majority Floor Leader Brandt Hershman. "We need a strong, principled conservative in the White House," said Hershman. "Throughout Indiana, conservatives are uniting behind Senator Cruz. He has demonstrated himself to be a trusted conservative voice in the U.S. Senate and we need that same leadership in our next President."
Cruz also announced a team of 153 grassroots county chairs with at least one chair in every county across the state of Indiana. "This incredible team has led the grassroots efforts in every corner of the state," said Shelly Blankenbaker, Cruz's grassroots coordinator for the 9th district of Indiana. "Senator Cruz is a man of faith, and that is resonating with the citizens of Indiana. Not only that, but he has a proven record that shows what kind of leader he will be for this country."
"I am thrilled to announce such an outstanding group of courageous conservatives leading our campaign in Indiana," said Cruz. "With our dedicated team of leaders who work tirelessly in Indiana to restore freedom to this country, I am confident that conservatives will continue to unite behind our campaign."
