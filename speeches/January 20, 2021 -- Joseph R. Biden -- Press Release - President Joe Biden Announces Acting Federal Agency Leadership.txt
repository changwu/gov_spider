    WASHINGTON – Today, President Joe Biden announced the acting agency leadership across the administration to assist in the next phase of the transition of government. These individuals, nearly all of whom are career civil servants, will temporarily lead federal agencies while Cabinet nominees continue moving through the confirmation process.
These public servants have significant experience in the agencies they will now temporarily lead. They will play an important role as the Biden administration prepares to coordinate a whole-of-government approach to tackle the challenges facing the nation, restore trust in our government, and ensure the federal government — and its many agencies — serves the American people.
President Joe Biden said, "These public servants, like so many across the federal government, are dedicated to serving the American people, not a political party or agenda. Their experience in government and commitment to service will allow this administration to take the reins as we prepare to get the pandemic under control and our economy moving once again. I am thankful for their willingness to step-up to lead during these difficult times and help us make sure the government continues to operate and serve the American people. Together, we are restoring trust in the federal government and building our nation back better."
Vice President Kamala Harris said, "Protecting our nation’s interests abroad, rebuilding our economy, and confronting the coronavirus pandemic requires a team of dedicated experts. The acting leaders announced today are more than capable of helping with this incredible task. Many of them have dedicated their careers to public service, and I, on behalf of a grateful nation, am thankful for their willingness to temporarily serve in these critical first days of the administration."
