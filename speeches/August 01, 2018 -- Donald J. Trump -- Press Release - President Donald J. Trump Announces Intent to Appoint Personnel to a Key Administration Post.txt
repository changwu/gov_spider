    President Donald J. Trump today announced his intent to appoint the following individual to a key position in his Administration:
Vaughn F. Bishop of Virginia, to be Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
Mr. Bishop first joined the Central Intelligence Agency in 1981 and, over the course of his successful 30-year career, held a number of expert-level analyst and senior management positions across a diverse range of regional and functional mission areas. In the 1990s, he had several opportunities to lead during a number of crises including Somalia and Rwanda. After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, he served in several overseas assignments including as a chief of station where he managed a critical relationship with a key partner focused on counterterrorism operations. Mr. Bishop served as the DCIA Representative to PACOM and later led the Central Intelligence Agency's analytic effort on Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Africa. Later in his career, Mr. Bishop served as the National Intelligence Officer for Africa and ultimately rose to the Vice-Chair of the National Intelligence Council in 2010. Mr. Bishop retired from the Central Intelligence Agency in 2011, but he was later asked to return to the Central Intelligence Agency for four years to serve as the Central Intelligence Agency ombudsman for analytic objectivity during the agency's modernization effort. Mr. Bishop earned a bachelor's degree, master's degree, and a doctorate from Northwestern University.
