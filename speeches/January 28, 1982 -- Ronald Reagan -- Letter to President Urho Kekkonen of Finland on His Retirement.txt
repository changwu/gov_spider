    Dear Mr. President:
Your departure from office marks the end of an era, not only in Finland, but in annals of statesmanship. Your unceasing pursuit, for over 25 years, of the cause of peace, has borne many fruits. Your name is synonymous with the independent spirit of the Finnish people, and you leave office as the
President of a democratic and proud country.
Please accept, Mr. President, my best wishes on behalf of all Americans, for good health in your well deserved retirement.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
