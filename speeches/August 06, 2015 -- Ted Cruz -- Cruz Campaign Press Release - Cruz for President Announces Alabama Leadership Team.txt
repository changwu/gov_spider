"America needs a leader who is bold as a lion and will seek justice and always speak the truth, one who respects the rule of law and our US constitution. We need a leader who will confidently rebuke our enemies both foreign and domestic. One who appreciates and supports our military. We need a leader of integrity who seeks wise council and who will maintain unity and order. One who believes in America's greatness and will do his utmost to preserve and further it... that man is Ted Cruz," said Co-Chair Becky Gerritson.
"Ted Cruz is the courageous conservative we need to lead this country. He has stood and fought for every issue that is important to Americans. Trying to stop the train wreck that is Obamacare, defending our liberties, and fighting back against the Washington Cartel. I am proud to support him and be a part of this team," said Co-Chair Chad Mathis.
"Ted Cruz has proven that he will stand for 'we the people' against those who are in favor of bigger government and the erosion of our rights," said Alabama Co-Chair Ann Eubank. "He is unafraid and we need more like him."
"I am incredibly excited and optimistic to announce this group of courageous conservatives to lead and create a grassroots coalition in Alabama. Alabama is vital in our fight to make this country great again. I am honored to have their support as well as their help spreading our message in Alabama and across the nation," said Sen. Cruz.
