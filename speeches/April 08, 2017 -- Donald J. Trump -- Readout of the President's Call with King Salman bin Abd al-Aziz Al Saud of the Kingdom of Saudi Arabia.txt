    President Donald J. Trump spoke yesterday with Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia. The King reaffirmed strong Saudi support for the United States' military strike against the Sayrat Airfield in Syria and thanked the President for his courageous action, which both agreed was a necessary response to the horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians. Both leaders underscored their personal commitment to strengthening the longstanding relationship between their two countries and committed to remain in close contact on a range of regional and bilateral issues.
