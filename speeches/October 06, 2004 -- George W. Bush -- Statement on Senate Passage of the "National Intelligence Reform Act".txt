    I commend the Senate for acting in a bipartisan way to pass landmark legislation that will help us meet our goal to better protect the American people by strengthening the intelligence community. The "National Intelligence Reform Act" is consistent with my proposal to establish a strong National Intelligence Director with full budget authority and the new National Counterterrorism Center. America is a nation at war, and this legislation is another important step forward as we do everything in our power to defeat the terrorist enemy and protect the American people. I urge the House to act quickly so that Congress can resolve any differences and send legislation to me as soon as possible.
