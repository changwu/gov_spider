Marco is a strong supporter of apprenticeships and on-the-job training programs that promote upward mobility. He wants to de-stigmatize vocational education, have more high school students graduate with the skills and certifications needed for good-paying jobs, and make it easier for all Americans to gain the skills they need for the 21st Century. Marco has proposed a variety of innovative reforms to our education system that will empower young workers, including:

Reform of our outdated accreditation system to better accommodate alternative, non-traditional forms of education;
Equipping students and families with the necessary information to make smart decisions about their education investments;
Simplifying the confusing web of higher education tax incentives and the federal financial aid application;
Policies that encourage the private sector to invest in student success;
Boosting access to state colleges and career and vocational training; and
Reducing the high burden of student loan debt through income-based repayment.
