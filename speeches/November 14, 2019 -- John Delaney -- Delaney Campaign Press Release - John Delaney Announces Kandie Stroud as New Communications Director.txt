    FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD â€“ Today, the Delaney campaign is announcing that Kandie Stroud has joined the campaign as Communications Director. Stroud brings a broad range of experience to the campaign, including a background in print and broadcast journalism working for the New York Times, CNN, and more. Stroud is a best-selling author, spent a decade in DNC Communications, worked on nine presidential campaigns and ran Radio Row at five Democratic National Conventions.
"I'm excited to step into the role of Communications Director for the campaign and to offer what I've learned working on many campaigns, including Michelle Obama's When We All Vote initiative, and the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry and Barack Obama. And I'm deeply honored to work with John Delaney. He is a not just an extraordinary man, he's a fantastic candidate with real solutions, a vision to unify the country and a strong background as both a brilliant executive and elected official who was admired by both sides of the aisle-- which is exactly what we need," said Stroud.
Xan Fishman, Campaign Manager, added:
"We are excited about the expertise and vitality Kandie adds to the campaign. She brings vision and the ability to tell John's story widely and to show that John's not just the pragmatic, solutions-oriented candidate Democrats need to take back the White House, but that he's a smart, truth-teller; a former Entrepreneur-of-the-Year who was the youngest CEO in New York Stock Exchange history and is the only Democrat in the field who has both real-world experience in business and in Congress."
