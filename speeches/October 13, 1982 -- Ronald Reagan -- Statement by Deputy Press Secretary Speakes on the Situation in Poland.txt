    On this sad anniversary of 10 months of martial law in Poland, the apparently spontaneous actions of the workers in Gdansk and elsewhere speak eloquently of their support of democracy and free trade unions. At the same time, the Government's actions speak just as clearly of their position on those issues and underline the validity of the President's views on the situation in Poland as he addressed them Saturday. Clearly the workers are expressing their will and determination to have a say in their own future, particularly in the wake of the Government's de-legalization of an organization which had represented the vast majority of all Polish workers.
