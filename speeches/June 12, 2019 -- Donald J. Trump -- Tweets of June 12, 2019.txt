'Someone should call Obama up. The Obama Administration spied on a rival presidential campaign using Federal Agencies. I mean that seems like a headline to me?' @TuckerCarlson It will all start coming out and the Witch Hunt will end. Presidential Harassment!Retweets: 31877Favorites: 119866

Wow! Just got word that our June 18th Tuesday ANNOUNCEMENT in Orlando Florida already has 74000 requests for a 20000 seat Arena. With all of the big events that we have done this tickets looks to be the 'hottest' of them all. See you in Florida!Retweets: 4497Favorites: 18383

The Fake News has never been more dishonest than it is today. Thank goodness we can fight back on Social Media. There new weapon of choice is Fake Polling sometimes referred to as Suppression Polls (they suppress the numbers). Had it in 2016 but this is worse.........Retweets: 3627Favorites: 14054

.....The Fake (Corrupt) News Media said they had a leak into polling done by my campaign which by the way and despite the phony and never ending Witch Hunt are the best numbers WE have ever had. They reported Fake numbers that they made up & don't even exist. WE WILL WIN AGAIN!Retweets: 7970Favorites: 29588
