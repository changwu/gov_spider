    Republican Members Of Congress Say Speaker Gingrich Lobbied Them On The Medicare Drug Benefit
Former Rep. Jeb Bradley: "Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich says he was never a lobbyist. But three US representatives, including former New Hampshire Representative Jeb Bradley, have said Gingrich did in fact lobby them — whether he met the technical definition of a lobbyist or not. Bradley told the Globe that he remembers Gingrich, in 2003, advocating in favor of the legislation that created the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit before a group of around 10 members of Congress."

Former Rep. Marilyn Musgrave: "Former Colorado Rep. Marilyn Musgrave, now a director at the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List, said Gingrich called her at the height of the 2003 debate urging her to vote for the bill. 'Newt called me to vote yes,' Musgrave told CNN by phone on Wednesday. 'He asked for a yes vote on a Medicare prescription drug benefit,' she said. "Dick Armey" — former House Majority Leader — 'called me and wanted a no. But I had already made up my mind to vote not to expand an entitlement that we were going to have to pay for down the road.'"
