    President Reagan telephoned British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at 1:07 this afternoon to discuss the tragedy of Pan American Flight 103. Prime Minister Thatcher had just concluded a visit to the crash site in Scotland. "On behalf of the American people," the President said, "I want to thank the rescue workers who responded so quickly and graciously. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this accident, both the passengers on the plane and the villagers in Scotland and with their loved ones."
Prime Minister Thatcher informed the President that the "black box" had been discovered, but as yet she had no report on its contents.
