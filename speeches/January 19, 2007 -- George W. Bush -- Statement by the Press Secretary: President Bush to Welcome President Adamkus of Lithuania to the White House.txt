    President Bush will welcome President Valdas Adamkus of Lithuania to the White House on February 12, 2007. Under the leadership of President Adamkus, Lithuania has been a close partner of the United States in advancing freedom in Belarus and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. As one of the newest members of NATO, Lithuania has made substantial contributions to the security and reconstruction of Afghanistan through its leadership of a Provincial Reconstruction Team and participation in other Alliance activities. Lithuania continues as well to help secure freedom in Iraq. The President looks forward to discussing these and other shared global interests with President Adamkus.
