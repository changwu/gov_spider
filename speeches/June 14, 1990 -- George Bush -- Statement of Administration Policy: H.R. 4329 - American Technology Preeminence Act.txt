    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Roe (D) New Jersey and 45 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4329, as reported by the House Science and Technology Committee on May 10, 1990, and as ordered reported by the House Judiciary Committee on June 12, 1990, unless it is amended to:

—  Reduce the appropriations authorizations for the Advanced Technology Program to levels in the 1991 Budget (i.e., from $100, 000, 000 to $10, 000, 000) and authorize "such sums" for FY 1992.
—  Amend the "foreign participation" provisions to ensure that foreign-owned or -controlled companies established in the United States will not be discriminated against with respect to participation in the Advanced Technology Program. The provisions in H.R. 4329 appear inconsistent with U.S. obligations under bilateral investment agreements and other accords. If enacted, they would seriously compromise our bargaining position in urging other nations to adopt similar policies of free and open trade and investment.
—  Delete the provision elevating the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) from Executive Level II to Level I. This provision would be inconsistent with the current Executive Schedule for the Executive branch. Also, the President recently elevated the position of the Director of OSTP to an Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, making further action unnecessary. 
H.R. 4329 contains miscellaneous objectionable provisions which impose, inappropriate new requirements on Executive Branch agencies, restrict agency flexibility in managing programs, or are duplicative of existing programs.
