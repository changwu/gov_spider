    Today, Biden for President is announcing 23 endorsements from elected and community leaders from across the country, expanding Vice President Joe Biden's foundation of support in key early states and growing new support in states in the west. The endorsements include elected officials, state legislators, and union leaders from Iowa, South Carolina, Utah, and Arizona â€” the latter a traditionally red state that is now considered a tossup.
"I am grateful that these dedicated leaders from across the country are supporting our campaign," said Vice President Biden. "Their endorsements are invaluable in the fight for the soul of the nation. I look forward to hitting the campaign trail alongside these influential voices in their communities and speaking with voters about rebuilding an inclusive middle class and unifying America."
Since announcing his bid for the presidency on April 25, Vice President Biden has built a grassroots campaign with robust online fundraising efforts, field teams on the ground in every early state, and a growing list of prominent national and local leaders on Team Joe.
Today's new endorsements include:
Iowa:
