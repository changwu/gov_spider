    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Protocol signed at London on March 31, 1977, amending the Convention between the United States of America and the United Kingdom for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, signed at London on December 31, 1975, as amended by Notes exchanged at London on April 13, 1976, and by the Protocol signed at London on August 26, 1976. For the information of the Senate, I also transmit the report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol.
The Convention, along with the amending Notes and the two Protocols, will effect important and necessary improvements in the imposition of taxes on individuals and corporations falling under both the United States and the United Kingdom taxation systems.
I urge the Senate to give early consideration and its advice and consent to ratification of this Protocol, as well as the Convention, the exchange of Notes, and the Protocol signed on August 26, 1976.
