    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Luken (D) Ohio and 5 others)
After vetoing H.R. 2364, the Amtrak Reauthorization and Improvement Act of 1990, the President indicated that his veto was based solely on the ICC provisions and that he "would sign an Amtrak reauthorization identical to H.R. 2364, but without the ICC provision.... " Because the President's concerns have been addressed satisfactorily by removal of the ICC provisions from H.R. 5075, the current version of the bill is acceptable to the Administration.
