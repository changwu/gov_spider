    Last night and this morning, there have been two very encouraging actions on the Hill on energy.
The Senate Energy Committee has approved, by substantial bipartisan margins, amendments that give them now an energy mobilization bill that is very close to the proposals the President sent up and which we are very happy with. The President asked that I convey publicly his appreciation to the leadership shown in that committee by the chairman, Senator Jackson, also to the leadership and hard work from Senator Johnston of Louisiana, and his appreciation for the bipartisan support for this legislation.
In addition, the Conference Committee on Rationing—although at my last check they had not quite finished their work; there were still some issues to be resolved—appears to be well on their way to a good and acceptable rationing bill. We expect that that progress will continue and that the result will be a good rationing bill.
