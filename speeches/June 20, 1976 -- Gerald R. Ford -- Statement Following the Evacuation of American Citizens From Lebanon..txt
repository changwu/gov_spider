    THE evacuation operation in Beirut today was completed successfully without incident. The success of this operation was made possible through the combined efforts of our Armed Forces and State Department personnel both here and in the field.
I want to express my deep appreciation and pride in the outstanding performance of all the men and women who contributed to this effort. We are grateful as well for the assistance of other governments and individuals that facilitated the evacuation. The United States will continue to play a positive role in seeking to restore stability and bring peace to Lebanon.
I would like to express to all those who played a part in the success of this operation my heartfelt thanks.
