    The President. I have one comment to make before I start the day. You may remember I got criticized for calling Putin a war criminal. Well, the truth of the matter—you saw what happened in Bucha. This warrants him—he is a war criminal.
But we have to gather the information, we have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue the fight, and we have to gather all the detail so this can be an actual—have a wartime trial.
This guy is brutal. And what's happening in Bucha is outrageous, and everyone's seen it.
I'll—I'll——

Sanctions Against Russia/President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia 
Q. What are you going to do about it, sir? Are you going to do more sanctions on Russia?
The President. I'm seeking more sanctions, yes. I'll have time to announce that to you.
Q. Could you offer some specifics, Mr. President?
Q. Can you actually hold Putin accountable though? You called him a war criminal.
The President. He should be held accountable.
Q. Can you actually hold him accountable without sanctions?
The President. Well, no——
Q. What else can you do?
The President. Well, no, no—go—go—the war crimes—yes, I'm going to continue to add sanctions.
Thank you.
