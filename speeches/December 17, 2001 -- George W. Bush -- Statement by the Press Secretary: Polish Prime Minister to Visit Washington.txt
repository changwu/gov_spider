    President Bush has invited Polish Prime Minister Leszek Miller to Washington on January 11, 2002. The visit reflects the close and allied relationship between the United States and Poland. A new and committed member of the NATO Alliance, Poland has given solid support to fighting the war on terrorism. It was in Poland last June that the President spoke of his vision of building a new Europe whole, free, and at peace.
