    At Saturday's foreign policy debate in South Carolina, Gov. Huntsman again showed that he is the only candidate who understands the world's complex challenges and is prepared to lead as Commander-in-Chief on day one.
Gov. Huntsman continued to distinguish himself from Mitt Romney on their level of experience and knowledge of the U.S. - China relationship. Once again, Mitt Romney's basic misunderstanding of foreign affairs came up as he continued to pledge to label China a currency manipulator and slap sanctions in place - a pandering sound bite that economic experts agree would start a trade war.Â 


When Gov. Romney proposed to take action against China through the World Trade Organization, Gov. Huntsman quickly dismissed Romney's "solution" as not even possible before delivering his own thoughtful, informed response.
The Washington Post later confirmed Gov. Huntsman's statement.
We are living in tumultuous times, and America cannot afford a Commander-in-Chief who is forced to learn on the job. While his opponents continue to pander for applause lines, Gov. Huntsman will continue to offer substantive solutions that will strengthen America at home and abroad.
If you agree that Jon Huntsman is the principled, experienced leader America needs, please share this post with your family and friends on facebook and twitter.
