    Today marks 1,000 days since the disappearance of American citizen Robert Levinson, who went missing on March 9, 2007, during a business trip to Kish Island, Iran. The United States calls on the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to assist in providing any information on Mr. Levinson’s whereabouts and in ensuring his prompt and safe return to his family. Obviously this is a deeply painful day for Bob’s family and friends. General James L. Jones met with the family today to reassure them that Bob’s case remains a priority for the United States.
We ask anyone who may have information about the case to contact the Department of State or the Levinson family via their website: www.helpboblevinson.com.
