    THE PRESS is here, and we won't start the business, but I wanted to ask you-Brock and Del and the members of the committee--to come down and talk about the defense budget. It is a very significant part, as you know, of this document in dollars as well as substance.
I have recommended $112.7 billion--a $1.7 billion increase for strategic forces and $4.5 billion increase in general purpose forces--and $1 billion more for conventional readiness and $1 billion more in R. & D. It is an increase, but I think it is important, and I hope we can sit and talk about the pros and cons. But it is something that involves all of us, whether we are Democrats or Republicans.
