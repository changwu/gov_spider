Great progress has been made by NATO over the last three years. Countries other than the U.S. have agreed to pay 130 Billion Dollars more per year and by 2024 that number will be 400 Billion Dollars. NATO will be richer and stronger than ever before....Retweets: 18311Favorites: 82621

....When today's meetings are over I will be heading back to Washington. We won't be doing a press conference at the close of NATO because we did so many over the past two days. Safe travels to all!Retweets: 10434Favorites: 49148

The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to belittle my VERY successful trip to London for NATO. I got along great with the NATO leaders even getting them to pay $130 Billion a year more & $400 Billion a year more in 3 years. No increase for U.S. only deep respect!Retweets: 33874Favorites: 148848

Just read the best Maureen Dowd column in the New York Times EVER (although she treated me great before politics) but it was written by her brother Kevin. Someone in the News Media should hire her wonderful talented and very smart brother! https://t.co/lO9s1qLK8ARetweets: 13517Favorites: 47528
