    From The Christian Post:
"Outspoken Gingrich said Obama's remarks were "extraordinarily dangerous," and further stated that "a president who can't control his own border probably shouldn't lecture Israel about their border."
Gingrich was referring to Obama's comments this week that Israeli-Palestinian negotiations be based on border demarcations from before the six-day war in 1967, in which Israel seized the West Bank, Gaza Strip among other territories. Furthermore, he stated that potential agreements should include land swap deals to reflect changes over recent decades.
Gingrich said on "Face the Nation:" "I think that defining the 1967 border would be an act of suicide for Israel. They are totally non-defensible.
"You have Hamas, which is a terrorist organization whose stated goal is the destruction of Israel. The idea that somehow we're supposed to be neutral between Hamas and Israel is fundamentally flawed and I do not believe that we should have any pressure on Israel as long as Hamas' policy is the destruction of Israel and as long as missiles are being fired into Israel and terrorists are preparing to try to kill Israelis."
