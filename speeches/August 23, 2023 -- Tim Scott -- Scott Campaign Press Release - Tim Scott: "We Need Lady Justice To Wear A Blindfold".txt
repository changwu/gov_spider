    "This DOJ uses their power, uses their authority, not just against political opponents, but against conservatives." - Tim Scott
Watch here
Tim Scott: Absolutely, he did the right thing, number one. Number two, we should be asking ourselves a bigger question about the weaponization of the Department of Justice. When I'm President, the first thing I'll do is fire Merrick Garland. The second thing I'll do, is fire Christopher Wray, because we need Lady Justice to wear a blindfold. Without that, no one has confidence in our justice system. 17% of Republicans have confidence in our Department of Justice. Here's why: We keep seeing not only the weaponization of the Department of Justice against political opponents, but also against parents who show up at school board meetings. They're called out of this DOJ- they're called domestic terrorists....Not only that, in addition to that, we see the SWAT team show up at pro-life activists' homes with guns drawn because this DOJ uses their power, uses their authority, not just against political opponents, but against conservatives and conservative causes. It is time for a change in America, and I will bring that change to the greatest nation on God's green earth.
