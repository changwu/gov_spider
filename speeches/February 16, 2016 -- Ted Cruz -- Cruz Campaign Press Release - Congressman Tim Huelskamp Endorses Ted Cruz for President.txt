    HOUSTON, Texas – Today, Ted Cruz received the endorsement of Congressman Tim Huelskamp of Kansas. Congressman Huelskamp is the Chairman of the House Tea Party Caucus and a leader in the House Freedom Caucus.
Congressman Huelskamp has been an outspoken advocate for traditional marriage, protecting the unborn, and defending our First Amendment liberties. Huelskamp opposed President Obama's illegal executive amnesty, fought back against economy-crippling regulations, and worked to defund Obamacare.
"Ted Cruz is a full spectrum conservative that the people of Kansas should rally behind," said Huelskamp. "I have seen Senator Cruz stand up for conservative principles in Washington time and time again. Whether it's President Obama's illegal executive amnesty, Obamacare, or massive deficit spending, we can count on Ted to start making positive reforms his first day in office. He is not one of those 'campaign conservatives' who are all talk — he is a proven, principled conservative."
"I am thrilled to have the support of Congressman Huelskamp," said Cruz. "He is a man that has stood up to the Washington Cartel and fought for conservative principles. Tim has been a stalwart leader in the House of Representatives on issues that matter most for conservatives. From life, to fighting to repeal Obamacare, I know I can count on Tim's conservative, principled leadership."
