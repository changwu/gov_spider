    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Waxman (D) CA)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5693, which would extend the current family planning program through FY 1994. This bill is inconsistent with the proposal in the President's FY 1991 Budget to change the current family planning program from a categorical grant program to a program of direct grants to States. Continuation of the family planning program as a categorical grant program would thwart the Administration's efforts to provide maximum State and local control over the delivery of family planning services. It would also undermine the Administration's efforts to promote better integration of family planning services with maternal and child health services.
