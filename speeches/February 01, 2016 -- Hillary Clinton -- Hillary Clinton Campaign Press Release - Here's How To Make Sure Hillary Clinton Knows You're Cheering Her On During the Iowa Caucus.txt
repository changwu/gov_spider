    
If you're with her, tweet about it!
After all the calls made, all the doors knocked, all the work of the past 10 months, it all comes down to this: Tonight, the first people in the nation will make their decisions in this presidential election.
I'm so proud of everything this campaign has built so far. I've never been prouder to stand up and let Hillary know I'm with her—and I hope you'll join me.
Here's how you can help keep the momentum up going into tonight's caucus:
No matter where you live, get on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or any other social media site you love, and tell the world why you're standing with Hillary using our hashtag #ImWithHer (#EstoyConElla en espa?ol).
Take a look at some of my favorites—and keep ?em coming!

The clock is ticking, so let Hillary know why you're glad to be in her corner—whether you're in Iowa or anywhere else—and let's get out there and do what it takes to bring home our first win.
