    Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison today made the following statement on Obama Deputy Campaign Manager Stephanie Cutter's comments that women aren't concerned about what's happened over the last four years: Â 
"Women, like men, care most about economic issues: Are there good jobs available? Is the government being responsible about how it spends our tax dollars? Are we better off today than we were four years ago? Unfortunately, the answer to all three questions in the Obama economy is, 'no.' That the President's re-election campaign has written off women's concerns about the last four years is an offense to all of us to whom he broke his promise of hope and change. This is not the real recovery women expect and deserve."
