    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies 
Subject: 1998 Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area
I am delighted that Rodney E. Slater, Secretary of Transportation, has agreed to again serve as the Chair of the 1998 Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area. I ask you to support the campaign by personally chairing the campaign in your agency and appointing a top official as your vice chair.
The Combined Federal Campaign is an important way for Federal employees to support many worthy charities. This year our goal is to again raise more than $38 million. Public servants not only contribute to the campaign but assume leadership roles to ensure its success.
Your personal support and enthusiasm will help guarantee another successful campaign this year.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
