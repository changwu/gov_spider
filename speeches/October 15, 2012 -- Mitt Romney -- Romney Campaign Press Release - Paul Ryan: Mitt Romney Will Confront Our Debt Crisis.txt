    "We have never knowingly given our kids an inferior standard of living, a diminished future, but that is exactly what we are doing by piling up this mountain of debt, by giving these deficits. And it takes leadership to confront this. That's what Mitt Romney and I are offering. We are not going to run away from these problems; we're going to run at these problems to solve these problems before they get out of our control." â€” Paul Ryan

PAUL RYAN: "Look at that debt clock over there. Look at how fast those numbers are running. When President Obama came into office, it was more than $5 trillion lower. The president came into office saying he would cut the deficit in half in his first term. He's given us four years of trillion-dollar deficits. He has added almost more public debt than almost all previous presidents combined. Not only do we have a string of broken promises, not only do we have a string of a lack of leadership, this debt is not only hurting our economy today, it is guaranteeing that these young kids who are getting their Halloween costumes, who are going to go out trick-or- treating, have a diminished future. We have never done that in this country before. We have never knowingly given our kids an inferior standard of living, a diminished future, but that is exactly what we are doing by piling up this mountain of debt, by giving these deficits. And it takes leadership to confront this. That's what Mitt Romney and I are offering. We are not going to run away from these problems; we're going to run at these problems to solve these problems before they get out of our control. That's what leaders do."
