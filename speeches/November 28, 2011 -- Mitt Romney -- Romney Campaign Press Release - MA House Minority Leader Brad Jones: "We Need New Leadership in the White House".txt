    Massachusetts House Minority Leader and Mitt Romney supporter Brad Jones made the following statement on the Democratic National Committee's misleading advertisement and press conference call:
"President Obama's policies have been failures that continue to wreak havoc on the middle class. Instead of creating jobs and helping the middle class, President Obama and his campaign continue to focus on tearing down Mitt Romney. After three years of failed policies, it is clear that we need new leadership in the White House."
