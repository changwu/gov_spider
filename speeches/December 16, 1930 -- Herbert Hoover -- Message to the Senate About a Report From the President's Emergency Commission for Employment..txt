    To the Senate:
I am in receipt of the resolution of the Senate reading as follows:
Resolved: That the President be, and is hereby, requested to transmit to the Senate, if not incompatible with the public interest, the following: The Report of the President's Emergency Commission on Unemployment, Colonel Arthur D. Woods, Chairman.
The President's Emergency Committee has made no report on unemployment. I have received notes and verbal suggestions from Colonel Arthur Woods from time to time, and from the departments in the Government on this subject. These were confined to guidance in formulation of the recommendations which I have already laid before Congress. Such notes and discussions are necessarily passing and tentative, and they represent that confidential relation of the President with Government officers which should be preserved.
