    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the Convention between the United States of America and the Russian Federation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, signed at Washington on June 17, 1992, together with a related Protocol. I also transmit the report of the Department of State.
The convention replaces, with respect to Russia, the 1973 income tax convention between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It will modernize tax relations between the two countries and will facilitate greater private sector United States investment in Russia.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the convention and related protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.
George Bush
The White House,
September 8, 1992.
