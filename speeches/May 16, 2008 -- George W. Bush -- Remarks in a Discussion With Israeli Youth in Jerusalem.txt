    The President. Please sit down. First of all, Laura and I are honored that you'd join us. Thanks very much for sharing some thoughts with us. As you know, we're parents of young professional women. We're interested to know what's on your mind. And if you've got any questions of me, I'll be glad to answer them.
What's on my mind is peace. I hope someday that everybody will be able to coexist and respect each other's religions and work together for harmony. And I believe it's possible. And I know it's going to happen when young people put a—get their minds together and say, "Listen, let's make this work."
So I'm interested in your thoughts, and so is Laura. And we're pleased to be joined by Condoleezza.
And perhaps you'd like to say something to begin with?
Participant. Mr. President, Mrs. Bush, thank you so much for choosing to spend this time with us. This is an amazing opportunity, and I'm very honored and glad to be here. Congratulations, mazel tov for your daughter's wedding. [Laughter]
I think this museum comes to show how unique this land and this region is. It's so rich with history, the Cradle of Civilization. While on the other hand, we see that Israel is such a new, vibrant country, only 60 years old. And we're still building our country; nothing is for certain here. And we— I, my friends, we want peace; we want to see the world like—live in peace, especially in this region. And I do hope—and I guarantee that myself as, hopefully, a future leader will do the best I can, the best of my abilities in order to make it happen.
I think that it's for now. [Laughter]
The President. Thank you. You want to share some thoughts?
[At this point, another participant made brief remarks.]
The President. Thanks.
