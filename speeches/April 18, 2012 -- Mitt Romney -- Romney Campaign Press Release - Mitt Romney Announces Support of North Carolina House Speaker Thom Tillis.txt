    Mitt Romney today announced the support of North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis.
"I'm pleased to earn the support of Thom," said Mitt Romney. "Tar Heel state voters are looking for a president who will reverse this administration's failed economic policies that have hurt small businesses and crushed the middle class. I look forward to Thom's help in what will be a crucial state in November."
"North Carolina families are concerned for their futures," said Speaker Tillis. "We are borrowing money from China, growing government, and jobs are still hard to come by. Our country needs a president that will institute the kind of pro-growth policies that restore economic security for all Americans. Mitt Romney has a bold vision to restore America's promise. He will keep taxes low, scale back the size of government, and repeal President Obama's disastrous healthcare law. I am proud to stand with him and call on my fellow North Carolinians to do the same."
