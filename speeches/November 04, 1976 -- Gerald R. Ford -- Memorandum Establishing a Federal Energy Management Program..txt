    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Since 1973, the Executive Branch of the Federal Government has taken the lead in conserving energy. In fiscal year 1976, Federal agencies' energy conservation efforts resulted in savings equivalent to over 285,000 barrels of oil per day.
These impressive results are due to dedicated and serious efforts to conserve energy. I commend you and your employees for fine achievement and the example it sets for all Americans.
For FY 1977, I am establishing a Federal energy conservation goal of using no more energy than was actually used during FY 1975. I am asking each of you to: (1) establish specific plans for energy savings during the coming year, and (2) examine all of your facilities and operations for both short and longer term energy conservation potential and undertake, within your existing budgetary levels, cost-effective projects wherever possible.
I am also directing the Administrators of the Federal Energy Administration and the General Services Administration to work with you to establish individual agency targets and to identify energy conservation projects so as to assure that overall Executive Branch goals will be achieved. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget will provide guidance concerning budgeting procedures for projects and activities in FY 1979 and beyond.
