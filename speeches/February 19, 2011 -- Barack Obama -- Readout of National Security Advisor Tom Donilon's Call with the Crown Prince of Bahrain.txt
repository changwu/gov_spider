    Earlier this afternoon, National Security Advisor Tom Donilon spoke by telephone with Bahraini Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa to follow up on President Obama's conversation with King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa on Friday evening. Mr Donilon reiterated the President's condemnation of violence used against peaceful protesters, and expressed support for the steps that the Crown Prince has ordered taken to show restraint and initiate dialogue with all segments of Bahraini society. As a long-standing partner of Bahrain, the United States believes that the stability of Bahrain depends upon respect for the universal rights of the people of Bahrain, and a process of meaningful reform that is responsive to the aspirations of all Bahrainis.
