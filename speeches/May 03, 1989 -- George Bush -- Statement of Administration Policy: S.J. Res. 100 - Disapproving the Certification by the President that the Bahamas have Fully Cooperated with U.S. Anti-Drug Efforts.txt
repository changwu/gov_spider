    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Kerry (D) Massachusetts)
The Administration opposes S.J. Res. 100 because it would be counterproductive. On February 28, 1989, the President certified that the Bahamas, among others, has cooperated fully with the United States, or taken adequate steps on its own to control narcotics production, trafficking, and money laundering.
The Administration carefully and thoroughly reviewed all aspects of this certification. It was based on the conclusion that, on balance, our fight against drugs will be more effective if we do not interrupt or jeopardize joint U.S.-Bahamas efforts. The Bahamas have taken steps to further enhance drug enforcement. We are working with the Bahamas to assure that progress continues, particularly in the area of investigating corruption.
