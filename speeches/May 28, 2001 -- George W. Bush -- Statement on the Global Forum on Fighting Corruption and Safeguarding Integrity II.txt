    The corruption of governmental institutions threatens the common aspirations of all honest members of the international community. It threatens our common interests in promoting political and economic stability, upholding core democratic values, ending the reign of dictators, and creating a level playing field for lawful business activities.
A few short years ago, talking openly about corruption was considered taboo. Today, however, officials from many countries are meeting and working together to demand greater transparency and accountability in public affairs. From Asia to Europe to Africa to the Americas, these efforts are exposing corrupt practices to the sunshine of public scrutiny, where, ultimately, they cannot survive.
This week the second Global Forum on Fighting Corruption and Safeguarding Integrity will help to keep the promotion of integrity and transparency high on the international agenda. I want to underscore the United States' support for the Global Forum's work, applaud the large number of participating states, and especially, thank the Government of The Netherlands for hosting this event.
Increasing accountability and transparency in governance around the world is an important foreign policy objective for my administration. The United States is committed to bringing renewed energy to the global anticorruption agenda and to increasing the effectiveness of the American policies and programs that address this important issue.
I salute the work of delegates to the second Global Forum, and I strongly support your important objectives.
