    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report a proposal to rescind $2,000,000 in budget authority previously provided by the Congress. In addition, I am reporting two new deferrals totaling $18,464,000 and a revision to a previously reported deferral, increasing the amount deferred by $4,408,812.
The rescission proposal is for the Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The deferrals affect programs in the Departments of Agriculture and Justice and the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation.
The details of the rescission proposal and deferrals are contained in the attached reports.
