    Detroit, MI — Following Tuesday's Democratic Debate in Detroit, Montana Governor Steve Bullock released the following statement:
"Tonight, I introduced myself to voters across the country as a pro-choice, pro-union, populist Democrat," said Montana Governor Steve Bullock. "I made clear that this election isn't a choice between the left and the center or between ‘wishlist economics' and sacrificing our values in order to win. This election must be about giving Americans a fair shot and making sure we don't forget the people Washington left behind. As the only candidate on stage who won and governed a state Donald Trump won, I will win back the places Democrats lost and rid our system of the corrupting influence of dark money."
