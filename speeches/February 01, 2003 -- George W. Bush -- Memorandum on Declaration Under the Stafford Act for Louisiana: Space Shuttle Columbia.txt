    Memorandum for the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
Subject: Declaration Under the Stafford Act for Louisiana: Space Shuttle Columbia 
I have determined that the emergency conditions in certain areas of the State of Louisiana in connection with the events relating to the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia on February 1, 2003, are of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant an emergency declaration under section 501(b) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121-5206 (the "Stafford Act"). The basis for my decision to make this declaration pursuant to section 501(b) of the Stafford Act includes the fact that the space shuttle and the space program are Federal property and Federal programs. I, therefore, declare that such an emergency exists in the State of Louisiana.
In order to provide Federal assistance, you are hereby authorized to coordinate and direct other Federal agencies and fund activities not authorized under other Federal statutes and allocate from funds available for these purposes, such amounts as you find necessary for Federal emergency assistance and administrative expenses.
Pursuant to this emergency declaration, you are authorized to provide emergency assistance as you deem appropriate under title V of the Stafford Act at 100 percent Federal funding.
Further, you are authorized to make changes to this declaration to the extent allowable under the Stafford Act.
GEORGE W. BUSH
