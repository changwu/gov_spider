    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Cummings (D) Maryland and 10 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports enactment of H.R. 2842, which is an Administration proposal that would enable the Federal Government to enroll an employee and his or her family in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program when a State court orders the employee to provide health insurance coverage for a child of the employee, but the employee fails to provide the coverage.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2842 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary estimate is that the bill would increase direct spending by $1 million in FY 2001 and a total of $10 million during FYs 2001-2005. Offsets for this proposal were included in the President's FY 2001 Budget.
