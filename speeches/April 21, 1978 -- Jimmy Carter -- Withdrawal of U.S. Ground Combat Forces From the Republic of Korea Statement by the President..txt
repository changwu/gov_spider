    Peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia are vital to our national interest. This Nation is fully determined to maintain its commitment to the Republic of Korea (ROK).
In announcing my decision to withdraw our ground combat forces from Korea over a 4-5 year period, I stressed that it was essential to improve South Korea defense forces so as to confidently maintain an adequate military balance on the peninsula. I also announced that we will take other measures to maintain that balance, including increasing our air force in Korea in October of this year. I also asked the Congress last October to approve a program to help strengthen South Korean military capabilities, particularly legislation to authorize the transfer to South Korea of a significant portion of the equipment of our departing ground combat forces.
In view of the crowded legislative calendar, and also because of other matters concerning Korea, there is a possibility that the Congress may not act now on this proposal. In the light of this development, I believe it prudent to adjust the scheduled withdrawals.
—The redeployment of noncombat elements will continue on schedule; 2,600 such personnel will be removed by December 31, 1978.
—One combat battalion from the 2d Division will be withdrawn from Korea in December; however, the other two combat battalions of the brigade slated for withdrawal this year will remain in Korea until 1979.
—The plan to increase the U.S. air forces in Korea will not be changed.
Peace and stability in Northeast Asia are vital to our national interest. I urge the Congress to enact as soon as possible the authorization for $275 million in foreign military assistance credits for the ROK, which I have also proposed, and to move expeditiously to deal with the $800 million equipment .transfer legislation.
