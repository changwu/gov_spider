    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Fields (R) TX, Studds (D) MA, and Beilenson (D) CA)
The Administration supports H.R. 4924.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 4924 would affect direct spending and receipts; the bill, therefore, is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is zero. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
