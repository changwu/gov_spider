    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to acceptance, the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972, done at London October 20, 1972. The report of the Department of State is enclosed for the information of the Senate.
The Convention is designed to revise and bring up to date the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1960, in the light of technological developments and increased use of the marine environment since those Regulations were concluded.
International concern for the protection and effective management of our oceans has been growing in recent years. The international community has also become more aware that the effects of marine casualties are not confined to the men and vessels immediately involved but, through the increased risk of marine pollution, can extend well beyond. I recommend that the Senate give prompt consideration to this Convention and consent to its acceptance.
