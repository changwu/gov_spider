    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced additions to its South Carolina First Responders Team. Lt. Dave Soderberg will serve as the Chairman of South Carolina Law Enforcement for Rudy. He joins Fire Chief Lewis Hayes from Croft, S.C., who was previously announced as the Chairman of South Carolina Firefighters for Rudy. In addition, the campaign unveiled new Co-Chairs of the state's Firefighters for Rudy, including Barry Frost, Chief of the Duncan Fire Department; Joe Palmer, Chief of the Newberry Fire Department; and Michael Sonefeld, Chief of the Irmo Fire Department.
"Throughout his public service career, Rudy has shown great support for law enforcement officers, displaying that he truly understands our needs," said Soderberg, the Criminal Investigations Division Commander with the Goose Creek Police Department. "I'm excited to be a part of this winning team."
"Having Dave aboard will only help us expand our already rapidly-growing group of first responders supporting the Mayor," Hayes said. "Rudy is a strong leader who has worked as a tireless advocate for years for first responders."
To date, nearly 300 South Carolina firefighters are supporting Mayor Giuliani for President.
