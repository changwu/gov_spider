    We regret the decision of the International Olympic Committee to conduct the 1980 Summer Olympic games in Moscow, and rejecting the proposal of the United States Olympic Committee to transfer, postpone, or cancel the games.
Under these circumstances neither the President, the Congress, nor the American people can support the sending of the United States team to Moscow this summer. The President urges the United States Olympic Committee to reach a prompt decision against sending its team to the games. The United States is working with a number of other like-minded governments to take similar action and to consider the practicability of conducting other international games for the teams which do not go to Moscow.
