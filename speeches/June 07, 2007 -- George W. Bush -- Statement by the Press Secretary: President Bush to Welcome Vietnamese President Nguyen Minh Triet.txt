    President Bush will welcome Vietnamese President Nguyen Minh Triet to the White House on June 22, 2007 to continue discussions the two Presidents held in Hanoi last November. The United States and Vietnam have seen enormous progress in their relationship over the past several years. President Bush and President Triet will discuss our robust trade and economic relationship, cooperation on health and development issues, cultural and educational ties, and shared commitment to resolving remaining issues stemming from the war. President Bush will also express his deep concern over the recent increase of arrests and detentions of peaceful democracy activists in Vietnam, and note that such actions will inevitably limit the growth of bilateral ties.
