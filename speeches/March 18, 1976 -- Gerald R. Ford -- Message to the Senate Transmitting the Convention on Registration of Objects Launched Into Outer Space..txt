    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Convention on Registration of Objects Launched Into Outer Space, opened for signature at New York on January 14, 1975. For the information of the Senate the report of the Department of State concerning the Convention is also transmitted.
The Convention is designed to provide the international community with a central and public registry of objects launched into outer space. Pursuant to this Convention launching States would be required to submit certain information to the U.N. Secretary-General regarding objects which they launched into outer space. The Convention builds on the foundation of a voluntary system of notification to the Secretary-General of the United Nations by U.N. Member States of objects they have launched. That voluntary system has now been observed for more than a decade.
The Registration Convention is an appropriate addition to the Outer Space Treaty, the Astronaut Rescue Agreement, and the Liability Convention. The Senate gave its consent to these earlier treaties in the field of space activities by unanimous vote. I hope that, at an early date, the Senate will also give its strong endorsement to this latest Convention.
