    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Rep. Miller (D) CA and 222 cosponsors)
The Administration supports Senate passage of legislation which increases the minimum wage by $2.10 over two years and pairs it with tax relief for small businesses, which are creating most of the new jobs in the United States. Such an approach will help maintain a strong and flexible labor market, assisting both workers and small businesses.
The Administration appreciates the Senate Finance Committee's willingness to respond in a bipartisan fashion to the President's call to enact a minimum wage increase matched with tax relief for small businesses. The Administration does not think it is necessary to tie this small business tax relief to other revenue increases.
