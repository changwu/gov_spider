    Since becoming President in 1993, it has been my good fortune to work very closely with Mayor Kurt Schmoke on issues about which the residents of Baltimore and our Nation care. He has been a wonderful partner in our efforts to improve the quality of education for all children, increase the availability of health care and housing, enhance economic development in our inner cities, and revitalize our neighborhoods. In addition, Mayor Schmoke has been a dependable ally in our efforts to make our streets free from drugs and guns.
I am grateful to the mayor for his public service to Baltimore and our Nation, and I look forward to making the most use of every day remaining in his current term of office to continue our work together.
