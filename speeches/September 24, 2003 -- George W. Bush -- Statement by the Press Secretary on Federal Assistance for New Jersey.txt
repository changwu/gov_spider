    The President yesterday declared an emergency exists in the State of New Jersey and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local response efforts in the area impacted by the power outage that occurred on August 14-17, 2003.
The President's action authorizes FEMA to provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures, authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act, to save lives, protect property and public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe for Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Passaic, and Union Counties.
Specifically, FEMA is directed to provide Federal funds not to exceed $5 million for emergency protective measures to State and local governments at 75 percent Federal share.
Representing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Michael D. Brown, Under Secretary for Emergency Preparedness and Response, Department of Homeland Security, named Justo Hernandez as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The Agency said that more counties may be designated for assistance at a later date if requested by the State and warranted by further evaluation.
