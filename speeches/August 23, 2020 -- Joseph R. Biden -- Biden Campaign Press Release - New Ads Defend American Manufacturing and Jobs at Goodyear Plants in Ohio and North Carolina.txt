    Today, Biden for President released a new ad in Ohio and North Carolina to underscore Joe Biden's commitment to American manufacturing and defend the jobs and dignity of Goodyear workers after President Trump attacked them in a political tweetstorm calling for a boycott.
The new ad, "Trump's Boycott," highlights how Goodyear is a 122-year-old American company that employs thousands of workers, but President Trump is going out of his way to hurt their jobs in an effort to protect his. Pulling from local press clips about President Trump's attacks on Goodyear workers, two versions of the ad will run on television and YouTube targeting areas near Goodyear's headquarter in Akron, Ohio and a manufacturing plant in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The ad is part of the Biden for President's ongoing national paid media program across television, radio, and digital, with $26 million in spend next week.

Last week, Biden shared a statement with the Akron Beacon Journal criticizing President Trump's tweets against the American company, saying Trump "doesn't have a clue about the dignity and worth that comes with good-paying union jobs at places like Goodyear — jobs that can support a family and sustain a community." American manufacturing is also a key pillar of Biden's Build Back Better economic recovery plan for working families — a plan to create millions of good-paying union jobs and ensure the future is "made in all of America" by all of America's workers.
