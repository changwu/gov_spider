    The people of Indonesia held a free and fair election on July 8, and President Yudhoyono has impressively won reelection. I wish to offer my personal congratulations to President Yudhoyono and make clear America's desire to work with him and the Indonesian people in the years to come to build an even stronger relationship between our two countries.
The high voter turnout, spirited campaigns by all contending parties, and high level of interest among Indonesia's media, civic organizations, and voting public are all evidence of the strength and dynamism of Indonesia's young democracy. Indonesia has been playing a greater role internationally in recent years, and we welcome this role. Indonesia has made important contributions in Asia and the world in such areas as peacekeeping, environmental preservation and protection, the development of multilateral organizations in the Asia Pacific region, and the promotion of democracy and civil society, to name a few.
The relationship between the United States and Indonesia is based on common interests and common values, including, tolerance, respect for human rights and diversity, and promotion of economic development. President Yudhoyono and I are committed to working together to develop a comprehensive partnership that builds upon these shared values, interests, and our common aspirations.
