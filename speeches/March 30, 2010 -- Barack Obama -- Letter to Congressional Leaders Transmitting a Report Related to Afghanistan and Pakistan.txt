    Dear ________:
In response to the requirement of section 1117 of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009, and in order to keep the Congress fully informed, I am providing the attached report related to Afghanistan and Pakistan.
My Administration completed a thorough policy review last November, and I announced a new approach at West Point on December 1, 2009. As with the development of that policy, we have continued to consult closely with the Congress on the implementation of this new approach. We are now implementing this policy and do not believe further adjustments are required at this time. Consistent with the statute and given the time necessary to accumulate data, the attached report covers the period ending December 31, 2009. To the extent possible, the report provides an update on our assessment since that date.
As the Congress begins consideration of the supplemental, I underscore our Nation's interests in the successful implementation of this policy.
Sincerely,
BARACK OBAMA
