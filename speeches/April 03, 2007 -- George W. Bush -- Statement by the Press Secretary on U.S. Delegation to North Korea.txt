    At the invitation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), a private bipartisan U.S. delegation headed by Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico and former Secretary of Veterans Affairs Anthony Principi will travel to North Korea from April 8-11, 2007 to facilitate the return of the remains of missing servicemen. The United States Government has invested considerable energy in persuading the DPRK to adhere to the provisions of the Armistice Agreement that cover repatriation of remains. This trip will reinforce progress already achieved in this area. A small number of U.S. officials will accompany the delegation to provide support and technical expertise.
