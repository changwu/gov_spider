    Today a bipartisan majority of United States Senators voted to protect our Nation's most important symbol through a constitutional amendment to authorize Congress to prohibit the desecration of the American flag. Unfortunately, the final count fell short of the votes needed to send this important proposed amendment to the States for ratification.
By showing respect for our flag, we show reverence for the ideals that guide our Nation and we show appreciation for the men and women who have served in defense of those ideals.
I commend the Senators from both parties who voted to allow the amendment ratification process to protect our flag to go forward and continue to believe that the American people deserve the opportunity to express their views on this important issue.
