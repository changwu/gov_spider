    President Obama looks forward to welcoming Prime Minister Tony Abbott of Australia to the White House on June 12, 2014.
The two leaders will discuss a range of issues of mutual interest, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Australia's leadership of the G-20 this year, the future of Afghanistan, and the growing bilateral defense relationship, including the rotation of U.S. Marines through Darwin. They will also address some of the most serious security issues that confront both Australia and the United States, including Syria, Russia's actions in Ukraine, North Korea, and the security and stability of the Asia Pacific region.
Australia is a valued friend and stalwart ally, and the President looks forward to working with Prime Minister Abbott to deepening U.S.-Australia cooperation on these and other issues.
