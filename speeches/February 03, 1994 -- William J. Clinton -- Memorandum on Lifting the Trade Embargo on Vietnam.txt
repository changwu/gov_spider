    Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce 
Subject: Lifting of the Embargo Against Vietnam
I hereby direct the Secretary of the Treasury to take all appropriate actions to authorize prospectively all trade and financial dealings with Vietnam, and the Secretary of Commerce to exempt Vietnam from existing controls implementing the embargo. Vietnamese assets in the United States or within the possession or control of persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction and that are now blocked should remain blocked until further notice.
In discharging these responsibilities, you are directed to consult with the heads of other Executive departments and agencies as may be appropriate.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
