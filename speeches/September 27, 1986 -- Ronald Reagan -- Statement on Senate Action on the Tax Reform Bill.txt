    Today's historic vote on tax reform marks the last legislative hurdle for the American people, who finally have a tax code they can be proud ofâ€”one that is fairer, simpler for most people; one that encourages growth and that is profamily.
Today's action culminates years of hard work and determination by many in the Congress, the executive branch, and most importantly, by numerous dedicated individuals throughout the Nation who believed we Americans deserved better. I look forward to signing the bill when it arrives on my desk.
