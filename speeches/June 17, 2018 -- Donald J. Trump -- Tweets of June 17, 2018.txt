Chuck Schumer said 'the Summit was what the Texans call all cattle and no hat.' Thank you Chuck but are you sure you got that right? No more nuclear testing or rockets flying all over the place blew up launch sites. Hostages already back hero remains coming home & much more!Retweets: 19640Favorites: 85039

Daniel Henninger of The Wall Street Journal: 'This IG Report makes it clear as did Rod Rosenstein's memo that Trump was absolutely justified unquestionably justified in firing Jim Comey. So I think the Mueller Investigation is on pretty weak grounds right now.' Witch Hunt!Retweets: 17300Favorites: 70893

Funny how the Fake News in a coordinated effort with each other likes to say I gave sooo much to North Korea because I 'met.' That's because that's all they have to disparage! We got so much for peace in the world & more is being added in finals. Even got our hostages/remains!Retweets: 17152Favorites: 78676

Holding back the 'war games' during the negotiations was my request because they are VERY EXPENSIVE and set a bad light during a good faith negotiation. Also quite provocative. Can start up immediately if talks break down which I hope will not happen!Retweets: 15119Favorites: 75820

The denuclearization deal with North Korea is being praised and celebrated all over Asia. They are so happy! Over here in our country some people would rather see this historic deal fail than give Trump a win even if it does save potentially millions & millions of lives!Retweets: 18711Favorites: 79452

Our economy is perhaps BETTER than it has ever been. Companies doing really well and moving back to America and jobs numbers are the best in 44 years.Retweets: 15724Favorites: 82528

Washington Post employees want to go on strike because Bezos isn't paying them enough. I think a really long strike would be a great idea. Employees would get more money and we would get rid of Fake News for an extended period of time! Is @WaPo a registered lobbyist?Retweets: 16714Favorites: 70925

WITCH HUNT! There was no Russian Collusion. Oh I see there was no Russian Collusion so now they look for obstruction on the no Russian Collusion. The phony Russian Collusion was a made up Hoax. Too bad they didn't look at Crooked Hillary like this. Double Standard!Retweets: 30555Favorites: 125754
