    I condemn in the strongest possible terms the vicious terrorist attacks in Egypt yesterday. By targeting Muslims and Jews, Egyptians and Israelis, and women and children, the terrorists have shown their total contempt for all human life and for all human values. These acts show yet again why the civilized world must stand together against the forces of terror and defeat this evil.
On behalf of the American people, I express condolences to all who lost loved ones and to the people of Egypt and of Israel. I commend the cooperation between Israel and Egypt to help the victims and their families. The United States stands ready to provide assistance to the Government of Egypt as it brings the perpetrators of these acts to justice.
