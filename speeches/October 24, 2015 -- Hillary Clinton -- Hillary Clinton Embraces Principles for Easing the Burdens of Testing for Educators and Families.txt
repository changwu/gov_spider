    Hillary Clinton released the following statement in response to the Obama Administration's announcement of a "Testing Action Plan"Â to identify ways to ease the burdens of school testing for educators and families:
"Throughout my campaign, I have stood with parents, educators and students calling for Washington to strike the right balance on testing so that we have better, fairer and fewer tests. I embrace the principles laid out today by the Obama Administration because they move us in the right direction. Standardized tests must be worth taking, high quality, time-limited, fair, fully transparent to students and parents, just one of multiple measures, and tied to improving learning.
"While testing can provide communities with full information about how our students are doing and help us determine whether we have achievement gaps, we can and must do better. We should be ruthless in looking at tests and eliminating them if they do not actually help us move our kids forward."
