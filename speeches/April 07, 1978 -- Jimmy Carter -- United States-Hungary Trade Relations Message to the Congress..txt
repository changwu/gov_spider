    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to Section 402(c) (2) of the Trade Act of 1974, (hereinafter, "the Act") I shall issue today an Executive Order. waiving the application of Subsections (a) and (b) of Section 402 of the Act with respect to the Hungarian People's Republic.
I wish to report to the Congress that I have determined that this waiver will substantially promote the objectives of Section 402 of the Act; and that I have received assurances that the emigration practices of the Hungarian People's Republic will henceforth lead substantially to the achievement of those objectives.
