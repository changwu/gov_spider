The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 2710, but will work in the Senate to amend the bill to require payment of fair market value, or land exchange of equivalent value, for conveyance of the land to the Hoopa Valley Tribe, to permit administrative and public access, and to address technical concerns. Failure to require fair market compensation or a land exchange of equivalent value would set a highly undesirable precedent for reopening long-settled land title issues.
