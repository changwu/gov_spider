Sen. John McCain tore into Newt Gingrich Wednesday, accusing the former House Speaker of encouraging an explosion of earmarks that ultimately led to corruption in congress and for having a leadership style that would be problematic as president.
"I saw these earmarks explode. I saw the corruption that resulted from it," the former Republican presidential nominee said on a conference call with reporters organized by Mitt Romney's campaign. McCain endorsed Romney after the Iowa caucuses.
McCain said earmarks "dramatically expanded on Newt Gingrich's watch," and cited a memo he said Gingrich wrote in 1996 directing lawmakers in charge of spending decisions to "consider elections" when doling out earmarks.

McCain's criticism of Gingrich was hardly limited to spending. He said publicly what many of Gingrich's former colleagues have told CNN privately over the past week â€” that Gingrich's leadership troubles as speaker mean he would be a bad choice for GOP presidential nominee.
"The fact is he was a failed speaker and was not sent back. He could not have been re-elected as Speaker of the House and his leadership style was a major factor in giving him lack of support for re-election as speaker," said McCain.
