    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(McCollum (R) FL)
The President has stated he will veto any effort to repeal or undermine the 100,000 police commitment.
H.R. 728 would repeal the President's program to put 100,000 more police on the street in community policing, and replace it with an ill-defined block grant that would not guarantee a single new police officer on the beat. Block grant monies would not go directly to law enforcement agencies, and could be used for any purpose that generally reduces crime or improves public safety. Although, all components of public safety are important, the Administration strongly believes that there is a national interest in increasing police presence and expanding community policing.
The Administration also strongly opposes the bill's indiscriminate elimination of virtually all of the crime prevention programs enacted last year. At a time when our Nation's children are as vulnerable to gangs, guns, and drugs as ever, H.R. 728 proposes to eliminate the after school programs, safe havens, and drug prevention initiatives that offer our youth positive alternatives to crime, and that reinforce the difference between right and wrong.
