    On behalf of the American people, I send my best wishes to all who celebrate Polish Constitution Day here in America, in Poland, and around the world. Since adopting their Constitution in 1791, the Polish people have endured tremendous tragedy and challenges, yet their perseverance has offered hope and inspiration to people around the world. Even today, fledgling democratic movements look to Poland as an example and guide. Here in the United States, Polish Americans are an important part of our national character. As strong NATO allies, the United States and Poland are working together to promote stability, security, and economic opportunity in Europe, Afghanistan, and around the world.
I look forward to deepening the enduring ties between the United States and Poland when I visit Warsaw later this month.
