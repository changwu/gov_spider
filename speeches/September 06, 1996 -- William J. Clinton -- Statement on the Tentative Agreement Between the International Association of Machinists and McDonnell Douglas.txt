    I am pleased that the International Association of Machinists and McDonnell Douglas have reached a tentative agreement and congratulate both parties for working around the clock to settle their differences at the bargaining table. McDonnell Douglas workers are among the best defense workers in the world and I am hopeful that the 6,700 workers that have been on strike will be back at their jobs soon. I also commend Representative Gephardt for initiating this round of talks and for keeping both sides at the table.
When labor and management work together to resolve their differences, the company and the workers benefit. In this case, all Americans will benefit from having an experienced workforce back at their jobs, filling critical aerospace orders for our military.
