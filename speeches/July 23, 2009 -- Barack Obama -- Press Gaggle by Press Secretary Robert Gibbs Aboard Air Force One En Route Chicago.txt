MR. GIBBS: So we told the President as we were leaving the school that Buehrle had taken a no-hitter into the ninth inning, and he was excited. On the drive to the plane he learned in the car via e-mail from someone at the White House that he'd gotten the last three outs.
The President called Buehrle. They pulled the pitcher out of the media room and into Jerry Reinsdorf's -- into his office. The President congratulated him, said it was an unbelievable achievement, something that everyone will always remember. The President told him, maybe it was because he wore the White Sox jacket at the All-Star Game. (Laughter.)
Q: He, the President?
MR. GIBBS: Yes.
As an aside, obviously when we went through the locker room at the All-Star Game he spent a little time talking to Buehrle there. And the President says, "As a fan, it's extraordinary. When you're a White Sox fan and know the guy who did it, it makes it even more fun."
I'm holding if you want to call some of this stuff in.
Q: Are you going to come back to chat with us about the fundraiser?
MR. GIBBS: Yes, I have background on that and will come back.
