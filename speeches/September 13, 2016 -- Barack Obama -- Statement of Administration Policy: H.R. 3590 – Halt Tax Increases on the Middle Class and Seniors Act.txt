(House)
(Rep. McSally, R-AZ, and 17 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 3590. It would repeal a provision of the Affordable Care Act that limits a regressive, poorly targeted tax break for health care spending. This repeal would disproportionately benefit high-income Americans, while increasing national health care spending. Additionally, it would increase the Federal deficit by $32.7 billion over ten years according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The Administration is always willing to work with the Congress on fiscally responsible ways to further improve health care affordability and the Affordable Care Act. The President's Budget offers a number of proposals to do so. However, H.R. 3590 would be a step in the wrong direction because it would increase health care spending and increase the Federal deficit, while doing little to improve the affordability of health care for middle-class families.
If the President were presented with H.R. 3590, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.
