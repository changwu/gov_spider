    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Senator Allen (R) Virginia and 10 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports passage of S. 150 to make permanent the moratorium on taxes on Internet access, regardless of the speed of that access, and on multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. The Administration believes that government should support e-commerce and Internet usage and availability, including the use of broadband technology, and not discourage it through new administrative barriers or taxes. The Administration urges the Senate to pass S. 150 expeditiously so that the moratorium can be made permanent.
