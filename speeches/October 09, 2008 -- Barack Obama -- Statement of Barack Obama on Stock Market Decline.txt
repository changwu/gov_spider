    Chicago, IL - "As millions of Americans lost more of their investments and hard-earned retirement savings today, it is critical that the Treasury Department move as quickly as possible to implement the rescue plan that passed Congress so that we can ease this credit crisis that's preventing businesses and consumers from getting loans and causing dangerous instability in our market. While we face a very serious challenge, now is not the time for fear or panic, but for all of us to come together with resolve and determination that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis and restore confidence in the American economy," said Barack Obama.
