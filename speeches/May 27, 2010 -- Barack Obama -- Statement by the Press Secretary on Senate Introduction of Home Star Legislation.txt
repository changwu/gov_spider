    In the Presidentâ€™s State of the Union address, he asked Congress to pass a set of initiatives for homeowners who make their homes more energy-efficient to continue the energy transformation that's already begun. Earlier this month, this legislation passed the House with bipartisan support, and we are pleased that today a bipartisan group of Senators has reintroduced the Home Star Energy Retrofit Act, a common sense bill that will create jobs, save consumers money, and strengthen our economy.
This rebate program will not only put people back to work in our construction and manufacturing sectors, it will lower costs for homeowners who choose to improve their home with products like energy-efficient windows, water heaters and air conditioners. We look forward to working with the Senate so we can help more middle class homeowners make these investments without delay.
