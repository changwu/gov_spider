    The situation in Nicaragua seems to be progressing very satisfactorily. The operations of Sandino apparently have entirely ceased and the different bands of bandits have pretty much surrendered. It is reported, as I understand it, that Sandino has left Nicaragua. There is no absolute certainty of that, but that is my information. There is no active or armed opposition to what the country is trying to do, so far as we know at the present time.
