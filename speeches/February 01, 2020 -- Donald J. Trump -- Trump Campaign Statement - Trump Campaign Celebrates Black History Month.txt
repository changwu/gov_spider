    In honor of the start of Black History Month today, Katrina Pierson, Senior Advisor to Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., released the following statement.
"February marks the start of Black History Month, a time to celebrate and reflect on the contributions that Black Americans have made to the rich culture and greatness of America. While Black Americans are enjoying the lowest unemployment rate in recorded history and so many families are reunited under the FIRST STEP Act, we remain committed with hope and optimism that our country will always be a place of justice and opportunity for all."
