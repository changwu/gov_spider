    To the Senate of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, the Protocol Amending the Interim Convention on Conservation of North Pacific Fur Seals between the United States, Canada, Japan, and the Soviet Union, signed at Washington on October 12, 1984. I am also transmitting for the information of the Senate (1) a related statement of concerns, and (2) the report of the Department of State on the Protocol.
The Interim Convention was signed in 1957 and replaced an earlier convention concerning fur seals dating back to 1911. Under these conventions, the herds were protected and managed, and though there has been a decrease in recent years, the population has increased significantly from 300,000 seals at the turn of the century to approximately 1.2 million presently. The Interim Convention has been extended previously in 1963, 1969, 1976, and 1980. This Protocol provides for the extension of the Interim Convention for four years until 1988. Accompanying the Protocol for purposes of information is a statement of concerns signed by the four Governments.
I urge the Senate to consider this matter at an early date and give its advice and consent to ratification of the Protocol.
