    Broad coalition of current, retired, and former union members declare their support for Elizabeth Warren and her plans to benefit working families
Manchester, NH – This morning, more than 100 current and former New Hampshire labor leaders and union members announced or affirmed their support for Elizabeth Warren as the 2020 Democratic nominee for President. The broad coalition is all in for Elizabeth Warren because of her commitment to putting power in the hands of working people as President, her plans to empower workers, and her ability to build coalitions and make real change. This support follows the American Federation of Teachers Massachusetts and the Boston Teachers Union endorsing Elizabeth Warren on Monday.
"Across the country, including here in New Hampshire, workers' wages have largely stagnated," said Representative Pat Long of Manchester. "Elizabeth Warren sees that unions have less power than they used to in negotiating compensation for workers – that's what has led to workers having less, and corporate executives having more. Her plan would strengthen and protect collective bargaining rights, and in turn strengthen unions and rebuild our middle class."
Elizabeth's plan to empower workers is the most progressive and comprehensive agenda for workers since the New Deal. She will extend labor rights to all workers and expand protections for part-time workers; prohibit so-called "right to work" laws; strengthen organizing, collective bargaining, and the right to strike; increase worker choice and control; and expand worker protections, combat discrimination, and improve enforcement of labor laws. She will also ban non-compete agreements, empower workers of billion-dollar companies to elect 40% of their company's board members, and amend federal law to promote sectoral bargaining across industries.
As she penned in an Op-Ed late last year, her plan will help workers in New Hampshire by ending worker misclassification, raising the minimum wage, and reviving Obama-era overtime rules.
"I'm grateful to have the support of such a broad slate of labor leaders and union members supporting my campaign and my plans to put power in the hands of working people. Unions built America's middle class and unions will rebuild America's middle class – but to make it possible we need to support and empower workers," said Elizabeth. "The changes I've proposed will shift power to working people, boost America's labor movement, and help create an economy that works for everyone."
