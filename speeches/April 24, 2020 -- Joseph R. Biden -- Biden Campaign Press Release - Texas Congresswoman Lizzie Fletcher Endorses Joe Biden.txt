    Today, Texas Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"Our country needs and deserves a leader with the experience, empathy, and vision to meet this moment in our history. Joe Biden has shown himself to be that leader time and again â€” reminding us that our country is great because it is good. He knows who we are, and he sees who we can be. I am proud to endorse him for President of the United States, and I look forward to working with him to bring our country together in November and in the years to come."
Biden has earned support from more than 130 U.S. Representatives and 25 U.S. Senators, and has received the most endorsements from members of both the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus for most of the Democratic primary.
Congresswoman Fletcher also joins more than 50 Texas endorsers, including former Congressman Beto O'Rourke, Congressional Black Caucus members Eddie Bernice Johnson, Sheila Jackson Lee, Marc Veasey, and Colin Allred; Congressional Hispanic Caucus members, Veronica Escobar, Sylvia Garcia, Filemon Vela, Vicente Gonzalez and Henry Cuellar; Austin Mayor Steven Adler and Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner; as well as Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Carol Alvarado and State House Democratic Caucus Chair Chris Turner.
Biden for President has previously announced more than 2,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
