    The President has today submitted to the Congress the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. The legislation protects Federal employees who blow the whistle on fraud, waste, and abuse in government from reprisals by their supervisors. The administration believes that employees who speak up when they see wrongdoing deserve the thanks and protection of the Nation.
After its last session, Congress presented the President with S. 508, the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1988. The President withheld his approval from that bill because of constitutional and other defects. The bill the President has proposed to Congress extends substantial new protection to whistleblowing Federal employees and is fully consistent with the Constitution. Whistleblowers help ensure that tax dollars are spent efficiently and properly in the conduct of the public's business. Swift enactment of the legislation the President has submitted will serve the Nation well.
