    President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya to address the strong U.S.-Kenyan partnership. Together they discussed their shared commitment to defending democracy and human rights, advancing regional peace and security, and accelerating economic prosperity through climate smart solutions and the use of renewable energy resources. They also discussed greater cooperation on vaccine manufacturing and production on the African continent in responding to the Covid-19 pandemic and preparing for future health security threats, as President Biden announced today's donation of over 17 million doses of Johnson & Johnson vaccine to the African Union. Kenya has received 2.8 million vaccines and is slated to get additional Pfizer doses in the next few months as part of the pledge President Biden made at the G7 earlier this year to donate 500 million vaccine doses globally. Together, President Biden and President Kenyatta underscored the need to bring additional transparency and accountability to domestic and international financial systems and to advance peaceful resolutions to the conflicts in Somalia and Ethiopia.
