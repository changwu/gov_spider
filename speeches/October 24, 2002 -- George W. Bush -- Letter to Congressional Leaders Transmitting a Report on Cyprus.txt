    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with section 620C(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, I am providing a report prepared by my Administration on progress toward a negotiated solution of the Cyprus question covering the period August 1, 2002, through September 30, 2002. The previous submission covered events from June 1, 2002, through July 31, 2002.
Direct talks on the island between Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash continue under United Nations auspices. As in the past reporting periods, Special Cyprus Coordinator Thomas G. Weston provided diplomatic support to the process. Our new Ambassador to Cyprus, Michael Klosson, provided similar support when he assumed his post in August. The United States remains committed to the United Nations effort to find a just and lasting settlement to the Cyprus problem.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
