    Alabama Special Election for U.S. Senate 
Q. Mr. President, are you ready to talk about Roy Moore at all?
The President. Yes, I'll be talking about him. I can tell you one thing for sure: We don't need a liberal person in there, a Democrat—Jones. I've looked at his record. It's terrible on crime. It's terrible on the border. It's terrible on the military. I can tell you for a fact, we do not need somebody that's going to be bad on crime, bad on borders, bad with the military, bad for the Second Amendment.

He says it didn't happen. And you know, you have to listen to him also. You're talking about, he said 40 years ago this did not happen. So you know——
Q. Are you going to campaign for Roy Moore?
The President. I'll be letting you know next week. But I can tell you, you don't need somebody who's soft on crime, like Jones.

We've just put out a release on the call. But we're talking very strongly about bringing peace to Syria. We're talking about very strongly about North Korea and Ukraine.

Q. The AT&T-Time Warner merger, sir, what do you think about it?

Thank you, everybody. Have a very great Thanksgiving.

Q. Do you believe Roy Moore's denials? Do you believe him?
The President. Well, he denies. I mean, Roy Moore denies it. And by the way, he gives a total denial. And I do have to say, 40 years is a long time. He's run 8 races, and this has never come up. So 40 years is a long time. The women are Trump voters; most of them are Trump voters. All you can do is, you have to do what you have to do. He totally denies it.
