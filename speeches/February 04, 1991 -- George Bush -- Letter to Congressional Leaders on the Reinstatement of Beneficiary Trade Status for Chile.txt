    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Chile to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP program is authorized by the Trade Act of 1974, as amended ("the 1974 Act").
Chile previously had its GSP eligibility suspended as a result of a determination that it had not and was not taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights to workers in the country, as required by section 502(b)(7) of the 1974 Act. As a result of a review completed to consider recent changes in law and practice in Chile, I have now determined that it meets the worker rights standard of the law and is otherwise eligible to have its GSP benefits reinstated.
This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended.
Sincerely,
George Bush
