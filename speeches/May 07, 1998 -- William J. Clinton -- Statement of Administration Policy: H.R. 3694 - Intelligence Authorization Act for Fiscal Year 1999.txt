    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Goss (R) FL)
The Administration supports H.R. 3694.
Section 303 would extend the President's statutory authority to stay sanctions, when such a stay is necessary to protect intelligence sources or methods or an ongoing criminal investigation. Section 401 would extend CIA's authority to pay voluntary separation incentives -- which would help the Agency adjust its skills mix to meet the new challenges of the next decades. Section 402 would enhance CIA's authority to protect its personnel and their immediate families when they are threatened as a result of the conduct of official Agency activities. Section 501 would extend the Department of Defense's authority to engage in commercial activities as security for intelligence activities. The Administration notes again that it fully supports these as well as other significant provisions of the bill.
