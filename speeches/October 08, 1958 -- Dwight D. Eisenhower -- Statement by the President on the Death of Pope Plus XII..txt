    THE WORLD is poorer because of the death tonight of Pope Pius XII. His was a full life of devotion to God and service to his fellow man.
An informed and articulate foe of tyranny, he was a sympathetic friend and benefactor to those who were oppressed, and his helping hand was always quick to aid the unfortunate victims of war.
Without fear or favor, he consistently championed the cause of a just peace among the nations of the earth. A man of profound vision, he kept pace with a rapidly changing universe, yet never lost sight of mankind's eternal destiny.
I was privileged to know him personally. With men of good will everywhere, I mourn his passing.
