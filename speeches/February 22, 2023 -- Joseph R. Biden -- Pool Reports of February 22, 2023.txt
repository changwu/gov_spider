Travel pool report 3 - rolling
At 2:27 pm (local) the motorcade is rolling from the RON to the presidential palace. Pool did not lay eyes on POTUS.
We are driving under a heavy grey sky. As we depart, we can hear a small but well organized group across the street chanting through a loud hailer: "F16 to Ukraine."
The White House hasn't yet confirmed the list of attendees, but these are the Bucharest Nine countries:
-Bulgaria,-Czech Republic,-Estonia,-Hungary,-Latvia,-Lithuania,-Poland,-Romania,-Slovakia
Also attending is NATO Sec Gen Jens Stoltenberg.

Travel pool report 5 - greeting + New START quote
POTUS was greeted inside the palace by the presidents of Poland, Romania and Slovakia.
Asked by a reporter for a reaction to Putin announcing Russia will pull out of New START, he at first joked he didn't "have time." Then after a pause he said: "big mistake."
Per White House:
Greeting the President upon arrival at the Presidential Palace, Warsaw, Poland:
Andrzej Duda, President of the Republic of PolandZuzana Caputová, President of SlovakiaKlaus Iohannis, President of Romania



February 22, 202315:09 CET

Travel pool report 6 - meeting starts + quotes
The president's meeting with the B9 leaders began at 2:48 pm after they did a rapid "family photo."
Polish President Duda opened proceedings, saying that they would discuss "support for Ukraine."
The Romanian president spoke next, saying the war had "brought nothing but suffering" and said "we need to stand firm on our commitments" and help Ukraine "to win the war."
Slovakia's president spoke third and then Biden. Please check the broadcast/transcript for fuller quotes - he was rather difficult to hear, speaking quietly in a cavernous room.
He mentioned Finland's acceptance into NATO and said the B9 countries are the "frontline of our collective defense."
He said they knew "What's at stake in this conflict, not just for Ukraine, but for the freedom of democracies throughout Europe and around the world."
Finally:
NATO Gen Sec said: "we must break the cycle of Russian aggression."
"We must sustain and step up our support for Ukraine, we must give Ukraine what they need to prevail."
"We don't know when this war will end but when it comes we must ensure that history must not repeat itself."
Pool was then sent out into a hold.
Side note: a dark smudge is visible on the president's forehead - evidently the ash from the Catholic tradition practiced today each year, Ash Wednesday.
Here is the list of everyone in the family photo:

The "Bucharest Nine" (B9"), which is a group of nine NATO member states located on the eastern flank of the alliance. The Bucharest Nine includes the following countries:
-Bulgaria,-Czech Republic,-Estonia,-Hungary,-Latvia,-Lithuania,-Poland,-Romania,-Slovakia
The B9 was formed in 2015 in Bucharest, Romania, at the initiative of the President of Romania Klaus Iohannis and the President of Poland Andrzej Duda,
in response to the annexation of Crimea by Russia and the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine. The group's main goal is to enhance regional security and to promote cooperation among its members and with NATO as a whole. The B9 advocates for increased NATO presence and deterrence measures in the region. The group as a whole also plays important role in supporting Ukraine, even though some countries are more active (Poland, the Baltics for example), and other less ( e.g. Hungary).

President of Poland Andrzej Duda called Putin's invasion of Ukraine "a brutal, full scale Russian aggression":
"One year later, we met in this hall to discuss the most significant challenges facing our states, facing the entire North Atlantic Alliance, and to speak about the ways to support our friends in Ukraine".
Klaus Iohannis, President of Romania:
"The war has brought nothing but suffering and despair, killing and displacing of millions of Ukrainians, unprecedented destruction and uncertainty. We the leaders of the eastern flank have the duty to stand firm in defense of our peace".
"NATO is standing strong and showing clear commitment towards Ukraine and its people the benign is stronger than ever".
Zuzana Caputová, President of Slovakia:
"President Biden. Your presence here is another proof that our transatlantic unity is stronger as ever, and is an opportunity to discuss our expectations from NATO Summit (…), for example, how we ensure that there are no gray zones in our defense, or how we adapt our defense spending to our security environment, and how we ensure that Ukraine is able to defend itself as long as it takes".

Foreign pool report #5 - POTUS attended a mass in Warsaw
During his visit to Poland President Biden apparemntly attended a Catholic Mass marking the Ash Wednesday. The mass took place at the Marriott Hotel, where POTUS stayed during his trip to Warsaw, and was celebrated by a Polish priest Wieslaw Dawidowski. Your pooler observed a faded cross on President's forehead during the family photo at the B9 summit held at the Presidential Palace.
The Priest informed about the mass on his Facebook page and posted several pictures: of improvised altar in a hotel room, Presidential Seal and himself with President Biden.
"Today is Ash Wednesday. Even the most powerful in this world take ashes - if they belong to the Catholic tradition. I had the honor today of placing ashes on the forehead of the US President Mr. Joe Biden. Everything took place in great secrecy, but now I can speak: in an improvised chapel, next to the President's apartment. We prayed for peace, the conversion of Russia and the light of the Holy Spirit for Mr. President" – he wrote.
Father Wieslaw Dawidowski is an Augustinian, doctor of theology and a publicist. During martial law, as a high school student, he was arrested and sentenced to six months in prison for involvement in anti-communist movement.
Since the Air Force One is already in the air this pool report may arrive with a significant delay to the recipients on the White House Press Office mailing list. For the record: now it's 6:42 PM CET and 12:42PM EST.
It was an honor to be your foreign press pooler during President Biden's visit to Poland. Have a safe trip back to the U.S. and see you all soon at the White House.
