    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification a Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Bangladesh for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income signed at Dhaka on September 26, 2004 (the "Convention"). An exchange of notes is enclosed, and the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention is transmitted for the information of the Senate.
This Convention, which is similar to tax treaties between the United States and other developing nations, provides maximum rates of tax to be applied to various types of income and protection from double taxation of income. The Convention also provides for the resolution of disputes and sets forth rules making its benefits unavailable to those who are engaged in treaty forum shopping.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this Convention and that the Senate give its advice and consent to ratification.
