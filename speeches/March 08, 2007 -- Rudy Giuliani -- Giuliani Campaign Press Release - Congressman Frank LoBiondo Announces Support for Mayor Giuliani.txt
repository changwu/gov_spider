    Mayor Rudy Giuliani is delighted to welcome Congressman Frank LoBiondo to his New Jersey Leadership Team. Congressman LoBiondo is a steadfast leader in strengthening our nation's security, serving on the House Armed Services Committee.
"As a lifelong South Jersey resident and a successful small businessman, Frank LoBiondo has deep, first-hand knowledge of the issues his constituents face. I continue to be impressed by the conviction and passion Congressman LoBiondo shows in representing his District and I am honored to have his support," Mayor Giuliani said.
Congressman LoBiondo said, "As a strong believer in creating jobs through lower taxes, I saw what Rudy Giuliani accomplished in New York City. Coney Island was reinvigorated by the restoration of its beach and the growth of surrounding businesses. So too will South Jersey benefit from a President who shares my conviction that preserving the natural beauty of our shoreline and encouraging compatible businesses helps create jobs and safeguard the environment. I am proud to support Rudy for President."
In 2006, Congressman LoBiondo was elected to his seventh term representing New Jersey's Second District. In addition to serving on the House Armed Services Committee, he is a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, serving on the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, the Subcommittee on Water Resources and the Environment, and the Subcommittee on Aviation.
LoBiondo's endorsement follows the January endorsements of nearly 300 New Jersey elected and party officials from every corner of the Garden State. Congressman LoBiondo leads a "second wave" that includes more than 150 additional New Jerseyans committed to supporting Mayor Giuliani. He is joined by Former Governor Donald T. DiFrancesco, State Senator Joseph Palaia, Assemblyman Steve Corodemus, Salem County Chairman Paul Reed, former Department of Energy Commissioner Len Coleman, Middletown Mayor Gerry Scharfenberger, former National Committeewoman Judy Stanley Coleman, former Mercer County Executive Bob Prunetti, former Mercer County Chairman Phil Angarone, and finance team members Stephen Distler and Dean Geibel.
Governor DiFrancesco said, "I support Rudy because of his leadership qualities, his proven record and an agenda that's right for America. In the days after September 11, 2001, while he was Mayor and I was Governor, we worked closely together and I saw first-hand what a true leader he is."
Assemblyman Steve Corodemus said, "I support Rudy Giuliani because this country needs a leader like Rudy to stand with the people as he did during September 11, 2001 â€“ sharing our fears, concerns and hopes for a better tomorrow."
"I'm ecstatic that Congressman LoBiondo has joined Team Rudy," said George Gilmore, New Jersey Chairman of the Giuliani Exploratory Campaign. "He has an outstanding record in Congress and has been a force for the citizens of his district. He realizes that Rudy Giuliani is the right choice, not only for the state of New Jersey, but for the entire country."
The complete list of 167 New Jersey elected officials newly joining the ranks of Rudy Giuliani supporters appears below. Five weeks ago, a list of 279 names of elected and party officials was released. The Mayor has now been endorsed by 12 of New Jersey's 21 County Chairmen, 10 of 18 Republican State Senators and 13 of 32 Republican State Assemblymen.
