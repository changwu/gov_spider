    THE GREAT TASK of our time is to bring the fruits of economic well-being to all peoples in a world of peace and freedom. The nations of the world have gathered in Geneva for the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to discuss together how to move ahead in accomplishing this task. On behalf of the people and Government of the United States of America, I hereby pledge our strongest cooperation in this great joint endeavor.
