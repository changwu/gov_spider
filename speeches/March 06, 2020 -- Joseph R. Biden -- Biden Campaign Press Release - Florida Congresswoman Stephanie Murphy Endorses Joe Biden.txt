    Today, less than two weeks before Florida's March 17 primary, Florida Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy announced her support for Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"Throughout this nominating process, my priority has been to back a nominee who I believe will lead this country in a better direction. I have always highly respected Vice President Biden and his focus on working families, and I am proud to support him for president. I hope our party unites behind Joe Biden and refocuses our efforts on winning in November and restoring America's standing in the world."
Today's new endorser joins more than 50 leaders across Florida that have endorsed Joe Biden for President, including former Senators Bill Nelson and Bob Graham, and current Members of Congress Kathy Castor, Charlie Crist, Val Demmings, Ted Deutch, Lois Frankel, Alcee Hastings, Al Lawson, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Darren Soto and Frederica Wilson. Biden also has the most support from more Members of Congress of any candidate in the race, with more than 75 members backing him. Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,600 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
Biden's endorsements showcase the diversity of support for Vice President Biden in Florida and across the country, as well as the trust that these leaders have in his ability to beat Donald Trump, restore the soul of this nation, rebuild the middle class, and bring the country together.
