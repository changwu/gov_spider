    For decades, some of our nation's wealthiest individuals and richest corporations have failed to pay what they owe in taxes.
Last year, President Joe Biden and I worked with Democrats in Congress to finally make sure everyone pays their fair share to help fund our schools, hospitals, military, and other critical priorities.
Now, as one of their first acts in the majority, House Republicans are rushing to undo that progress and allow too many millionaires, billionaires, and corporations to cheat the system.
As we have since we took office, President Biden and I will continue to fight to make sure all people in our nation play by the same rules.
