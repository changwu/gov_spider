    First Lady Melania Trump today returned to Texas to visit with some of the people and families effected by the damage resulting from Hurricane Harvey. Upon landing, the President and Mrs. Trump traveled to the NRG Center in Houston to meet and speak with displaced families staying in the shelter due to the flooding. The First Lady dedicated some of her time in the shelter's "Kids Zone" donating books, crayons and games for the children. The President and Mrs. Trump then assisted the Red Cross in serving lunch to the families and people living inside the shelter.
The President and First Lady then traveled to a distribution center at the First Church of Pearland to thank volunteers and pass out supplies to local families who are in the beginning stages of what will be a long road to rebuilding or recovering their homes. While at the church, the First Lady donated diapers, one of the items most requested from the church.
After leaving the distribution center, the President and First Lady made an impromptu stop in a local neighborhood to visit with residents who were cleaning debris from their homes.
Before departing Texas, the President and Mrs. Trump took time to meet with first responders in the Coast Guard to thank them for their heroic recovery efforts.
After a brief flight to Lake Charles, Louisiana, the President and First Lady went to a National Guard Armory to meet with local officials, the National Guard, and the Cajun Navy to receive a briefing on the neighboring state's relief efforts.
After witnessing the effects and devastation for the second time, First Lady Melania Trump said, "our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the people and families so deeply effected by Harvey. After spending the day with children, women and men who have been impacted by the storm, it has only furthered our determination to provide all of the support we can as we pledge to continue our efforts in the long road ahead in the months to come."
