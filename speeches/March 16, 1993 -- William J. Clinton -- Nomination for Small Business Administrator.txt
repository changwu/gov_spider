    The President today announced his intention to nominate North Carolina businessman Erskine Bowles to head the Small Business Administration.
"Small business is the engine that runs the American economy. We need to give a hand up to the new businesses and traditional mom-and-pop stores that provide the jobs in our cities and small towns," the President said. "Erskine Bowles will do an excellent job of making SBA a more efficient operation that works to strengthen the backbone of small business in this country."
