    New Mexicans to share the Richardson record of success with Silver State neighbors
SANTA FE, NM-- The Richardson for President campaign kicks off its Adopt-a-State program this weekend by sending the first group of "Richardson Roadrunners" to Nevada to reach out to voters in the early caucus state.
"Governor Bill Richardson is the candidate of change and experience in this race,‚Äù deputy campaign manager Amanda Cooper said. "This innovative program will greatly increase our ability to advance the Governor's vision: getting all of our troops out of Iraq, building our economy, and establishing universal health care. These traveling New Mexicans can have a significant impact, particularly as Nevadans share Governor Richardson's Western values."
The group of about fifty "Richardson Roadrunners" will canvass, call, and write letters to voters in Clark County, Nevada on September 15-16.
"These New Mexicans have firsthand experience with Governor Richardson's record of creating good jobs, cutting taxes, and investing in health care and education," Adopt-a-State director Michelle Frost said. "Who better than they to take Governor Richardson's message of change and experience to the people of Nevada?"
The founding of the Adopt-a-State program follows the highly successful launch of Mi Familia con Bill Richardson, the Richardson for President campaign's Latino outreach program.
