    Gene Cernan, Commander of Apollo XVII, released the following statement on Mitt Romney's plan for Securing U.S. Leadership in Space:
"America must have a forward-looking, visionary space policy and Mitt Romney has the determination and the focus on technology we need to chart a clear path. Today's U.S. policy lacks direction and along the way we have become completely dependent on the Russians to continue human exploration. That is not acceptable. We have to travel a path that restores American preeminence in space, and I am convinced that Governor Romney will deliver an aggressive program that once again inspires the dreams of going where no human has gone before."
