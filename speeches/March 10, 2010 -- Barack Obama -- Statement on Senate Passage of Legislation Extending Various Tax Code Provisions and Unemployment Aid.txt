    Investing in our Nation's small businesses, cutting taxes for America's businesses, and bringing relief to families hard hit by the economic crisis are key to our economic recovery and long-term growth. This bill helps small businesses get the loans they need to grow and hire, provides tax relief that companies need to support new research and development jobs of the future, and extends relief to Americans looking for work. Jobs are priority number one for my administration, and I won't rest until every American who wants a good job has one. And I am grateful to Senators in both parties who took one more step forward today in getting our Nation back on a solid economic footing.
