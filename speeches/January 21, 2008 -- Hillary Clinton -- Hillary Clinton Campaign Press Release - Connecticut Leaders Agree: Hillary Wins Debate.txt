    Strong Performance Shows She is the Only Candidate Ready to Lead On Day One
Leaders from across Connecticut agree that Hillary Clinton showed the country tonight that she is the only candidate that can deliver results for America starting on Day One.
"Hillary once again demonstrated that she has a strong understanding of the issues that face this country, as well as the vision for how we'll meet those challenges,' said Stamford Mayor Dan Malloy. "We all agree that now is the time for real change. Hillary has 35 years of experience making change happen and, as we saw tonight, she is ready to lead on Day One."
"What we all saw tonight was a candidate ready to be President," said State Representative Jason Bartlett. "The American people are looking for a President that has the right leadership and vision to repair the damage caused in the last 8 years and restore our country's credibility at home and abroad. Tonight, it was clear that Hillary Clinton will be that President."
"Throughout her life and throughout this campaign, Hillary has been standing up for our families, for women, and for our children," said Ridgefield Democratic Town Committee Chair Susan D. Cocco. "She will bring real change to this country and I think everyone watching tonight saw that she will be a President that puts an end to the misguided policies of George W. Bush. There is no better candidate to inspire our dreams and bring them to fruition than Hillary Clinton.
Hillary continues to build momentum here in Connecticut with recent endorsements from AFT CT, George Jepsen, the former Democratic Party Chairman and Senate Majority Leader, Mayor Malloy, Bridgeport Mayor Bill Finch, and a Steering Committee of over 60 leaders and activists from the across the state who support Hillary Clinton for President.
