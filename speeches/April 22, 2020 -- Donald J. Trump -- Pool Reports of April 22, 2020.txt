Print pool report #1
Good morning from the White House. I'm your print pooler for the day.
POTUS has just two public events on his schedule for today – a tree planting on the South Lawn at noon in recognition of Earth Day and Arbor Day and the daily coronavirus briefing at 5 p.m.
POTUS tweeted this morning that he would sign his executive order on immigration today, but pool has not been advised if that will be open. Will let you know when we get guidance on that.

Print pool report #4: Tree planting ceremony
Apologies for the delay in sending this report. Your pooler is having technical issues.
POTUS and the first lady walked out of the Oval Office at 12:05 pm and headed for a stage set up on the South Lawn.
“We're doing something I love to do – plant trees,” POTUS said at the start of the ceremony.
POTUS spoke a few minutes about the importance of Earth Day and Arbor Day. He said the tree they are planting is a maple. The location of the tree is just a few yards from the Oval Office. POTUS noted that years from now many people will admire the tree and wonder who planted it.
POTUS also announced that national parks will reopen soon. He also gave a shout-out to Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who was in the audience.
Vice President Mike Pence spoke for a few minutes and called the new South Lawn addition “a tree of hope.”
Afterward, the president and the first lady walked off the stage, picked up two shovels and threw a couple of shovelfuls of dirt around the base of the tree. The Pences followed and also threw dirt around the tree.
Afterward, POTUS and the first lady chatted for several minutes with the Pences and McCarthy. The pool was unable to hear the conversation. The group then walked back toward the White House, where the conversation continued for a few more minutes just outside the Oval Office door. POTUS re-entered the Oval at 12:29 p.m.

Print pool report #5: Lunch lid and more
We have a lunch lid until 3 p.m.
Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany spoke briefly to reporters in the White House driveway about the upcoming immigration order. She reiterated the president's tweet from this morning that he is expected to sign it today. She declined to provide details about what is in the order, saying, “I don't want to get ahead of the president.”
McEnany said the order is still being finalized. She also pushed back on reports that a rough draft was put together after president tweeted late Monday night that he would be temporarily suspending immigration into the U.S.
“That absolutely is not the case,” she said. “In fact, I read the draft before the tweet event went out. So this has been in the works for quite some time. We're putting the final touches on it. We do expect to have that today.”
