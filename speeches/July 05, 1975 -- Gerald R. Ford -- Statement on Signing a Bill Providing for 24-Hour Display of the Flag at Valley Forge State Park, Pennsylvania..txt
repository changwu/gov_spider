    I HAVE signed S.J. Res. 98, which provides that the flag of the United States of America may be flown for 24 hours of each day in Valley Forge State Park, Valley Forge, Pa.
Enactment of this measure is a fitting tribute to the determination and valor of the men who served in the Continental Army at Valley Forge. These men endured the rigors of cold, disease, and starvation during the winter of 1777-1778, to later fight and win the Battle of Monmouth, an important victory in the struggle for independence. As we approach the year of our Nation's Bicentennial anniversary, this joint resolution by Congress reminds us again of the unselfish sacrifices made by many American men and women who have served in our country's Armed Forces. They have fought to establish and preserve, for Americans and free people everywhere;the right to liberty, justice, and the pursuit of happiness.
