    ORLANDO, FL -- Since announcing his bid to become the first Latino President Governor Bill Richardson has gained significant political support from Latino activists, political organizers, elected officials and senior officials from across the country.
"I am extremely honored and proud of the tremendous support I am receiving from the Latino community," stated Governor Bill Richardson. "As I travel the country and have the opportunity to talk with Latinos, my support continues to grow. This election is about empowering the grassroots to get involved in our electoral process. I am happy that the Latino population will play such an important role in deciding who our next President will be."
Earlier this week polls showed that Governor Richardson continues to build strong upward momentum across the board, particularly in Iowa and New Hampshire.
