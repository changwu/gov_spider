    I commend the House for passing a responsible budget that advances our three highest priorities: defending America, winning the war on terror, and promoting growth and job creation, while cutting the deficit in half within 5 years. I am also pleased that this moves us closer to making the tax relief for America's workers and families permanent.
I urge the House and Senate to reach agreement quickly and pass a budget based on my principles of funding what's necessary to protect America and keep our economy growing, while restraining spending elsewhere.
