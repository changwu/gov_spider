    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Dixon (D) Illinois and eleven others)
If S.J. Res. 113 were presented to the President, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto the resolution. After careful interagency review, the President decided to proceed with joint United States/Japan development of the FSX fighter aircraft. The President's decision was based on several basic considerations. Specifically, that joint, development of the FSX:

is in the strategic and commercial interests of the United States;
will contribute to the security of the United States and a major ally, Japan;
will improve the Japanese ability to carry their share of the defense burden, at no cost to the American taxpayer;
will produce substantial work for the U.S. aerospace industry; and
will not jeopardize our commitment to the continued excellence of the U.S. aerospace industry.
