    President Biden. Well, Mr. President, welcome. It's good to see you.
President Elsisi. Thank you.
President Biden. I'd like to start by thanking you for the incredible assistance you have provided in bringing the Gaza matter to a—to an end. I know there is a lot of work to be done, but you were—you were extremely, extremely helpful.
And I'm looking forward to working with you on a lot of other things. I think, at least from the U.S. perspective, there is a great deal of merit in us working more closely together. You're a valuable, valuable friend.
So I'm looking forward to talking with you about a whole range of issues. But, again, thank you for being here.
President Elsisi. Allow me, Mr. President, to thank you very much for this opportunity and to stress the strategic relationship. And we're standing ready to take it to a whole new level on all fronts.
