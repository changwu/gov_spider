    It was with great regret that I learned of the passing of President John Evans Atta Mills of Ghana. I will always remember my trip to Ghana in 2009 and the hospitality that President Mills and the people of Ghana showed to me, Michelle, Malia, Sasha, and our entire delegation. I was also pleased to host President Mills in the Oval Office earlier this year.
President Mills tirelessly worked to improve the lives of the Ghanaian people. He helped promote economic growth in Ghana in the midst of challenging global circumstances and strengthened Ghana's strong tradition of democracy. Under his leadership, the United States and Ghana deepened our partnership in the promotion of good governance and economic development. He was also a strong advocate for human rights and for the fair treatment of all Ghanaians. On behalf of the American people, I would like to offer my deepest condolences to the people of Ghana and reaffirm the deep and enduring bonds between our democracies that President Mills helped to strengthen.
