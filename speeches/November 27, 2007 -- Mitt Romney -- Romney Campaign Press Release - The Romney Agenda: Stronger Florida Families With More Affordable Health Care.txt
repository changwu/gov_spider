Governor Romney's Conservative Plan To Strengthen And Empower Florida Families With More Affordable Health Care:
Today, In Florida, Governor Romney Discussed His Conservative Plan To Strengthen Families By Putting Conservative Principles To Work In Health Care. Governor Romney has outlined a comprehensive solution to the nation's health care ills that expands access to affordable, portable, quality, private health insurance. Rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all, government-run system, Governor Romney's plan recognizes the importance of the role that states can play in leading reform and the need for innovation in dealing with rising health care costs and the problem of the uninsured.
- Governor Romney's Plan Facilitates The Growth Of The Private Health Insurance Market. Governor Romney believes that by expanding and deregulating the private health insurance market, we can decrease costs and ensure that more Floridians have access to affordable, portable, quality, private health insurance.
- In Florida, 21 Percent Of The Population Is Uninsured. More than 3.7 million people are uninsured. For those with insurance, the average annual individual health insurance premium is $2,949. In 2004 alone, more than $95.2 billion was spent on health care by people in Florida.

Governor Romney's Health Care Reforms Will Strengthen Florida Families:
Governor Romney Will Help Every Person in Florida Get Access To Affordable, Quality Health Insurance, Without New Taxes Or A Government Takeover. Governor Romney's plan institutes market-based reforms that will bring down the cost of health insurance for every Floridian. His plan also redirects existing government spending to help Florida's low-income uninsured acquire private health insurance.
Governor Romney Will Lower Health Care Costs For Florida Families By Making All Qualified Medical ExpIncluding Premiums, Premium Contributions And Co-Payments, Tax Deductible.
- The Average American Family That Acquires Health Insurance Through An Employer Spends $2,585 Each Year On Premium Contributions. Under Governor Romney's healthcare plan, these premium contributions would be completely tax-deductible, resulting in a tax savings of almost $650 a year.
- The Average Florida Family That Acquires Health Insurance Through An Employer Spends $3,497 Each Year On Premium Contributions. Under Governor Romney's healthcare plan, these premium contributions would be completely tax-deductible, resulting in a tax savings of over $650 a year.
- The Average American Family That Acquires Health Insurance In The Non-Group, Or Individual, Market Spends $5,799 Each Year On Premiums. Under Governor Romney's healthcare plan, these premiums would be completely tax-deductible, resulting in a tax savings of almost $1,450 a year.
- The Average Florida Family That Acquires Health Insurance In The Non-Group, Or Individual, Market Spends $4,282 Each Year On Premiums. Under Governor Romney's healthcare plan, these premiums would be completely tax-deductible, resulting in a tax savings of almost $750 a year.
By Encouraging The Use Of Information Technology And Reforming The Malpractice System, Governor Romney Will Reduce Medical Errors, Increase Efficiency And Cut Costs. Our health care system is the best in the world, but Governor Romney believes we can make it even better while cutting health care costs for every American. Frivolous lawsuits make health care more expensive and force doctors to practice defensive medicine. And, many aspects of the health care system remain technologically backwards. Governor Romney will bring a true market dynamic to health care and lead medical liability reform that will both honor the rights of patients and respect the work of physicians.
