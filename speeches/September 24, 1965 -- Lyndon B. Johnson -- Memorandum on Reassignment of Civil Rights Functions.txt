    Memorandum to the Vice President:
I concur in your recommendations to streamline and strengthen the civil rights effort of this Administration.
I share your conviction that it is of paramount importance to attach responsibility for effective civil rights programs to each and every official of the Federal government.
Those who are responsible for our programs in education, in the development of our cities, in employment--indeed, in every area--must also bear the responsibility for administering those programs without discrimination on the basis of race, creed or color. Each official of the government must understand that every program for which he is responsible must be administered to insure equal opportunity for all Americans.
I know that there is no cause to which you have been more devoted than the cause of equal opportunity. The energy and dedication which you have brought to this difficult problem of governmental organization will make even more effective our important civil rights program.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
