    (COLUMBIA, SC, January 27, 2020) –– Today, Greenwood City Councilwoman Edith Childs, the woman President Barack Obama credits for coining his legendary "Fired Up! Ready to Go!" campaign slogan, endorsed presidential candidate Tom Steyer in a new ad released today. Her endorsement comes as Steyer continues to surge in South Carolina, recently moving to second place with 15% support, and in Nevada, moving to third place with 12% support. In the ad, Childs names Steyer as the candidate best suited to beat Donald Trump.
"We need something different to beat Trump," Childs says in the ad. "Tom Steyer can bring it. Watch out –– my guy Tom is fired up, and Trump's got to go."
Childs' endorsement is Steyer's 14th South Carolina endorsement. Conducted by Fox News between January 5 and 8, the most recent polls show Steyer surging to second place in South Carolina and tied for third place in Nevada. These results were followed by the most recent Morning Consult early state tracker which showed Steyer polling at 15% in an average of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada voters.
The ad will run in all four early primary and caucus states.
