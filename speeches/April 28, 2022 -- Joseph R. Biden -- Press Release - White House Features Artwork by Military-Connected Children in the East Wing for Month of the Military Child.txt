    In honor of the Month of the Military Child, First Lady Jill Biden has incorporated a temporary installation to the public tour route of the White House: artwork created by military-connected children. This art was sourced by the Military Child Education Coalition and Kids Rank, non-profit organizations that work to support the social and emotional wellbeing of children of service members and veterans. The installation, which is currently on display in the East Wing through the end of the month, features over 20 pieces of artwork from military children across the country and those stationed around the world.
This exhibit will be open for pre-credentialed media coverage on Friday 4/29 from 9:00 - 9:30 AM ET. For media interested in filming or photographing the exhibit, please RSVP HERE by today, 4/28 at 5:00 PM ET.
