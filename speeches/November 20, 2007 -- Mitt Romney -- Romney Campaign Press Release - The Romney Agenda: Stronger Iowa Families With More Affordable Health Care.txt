Governor Romney's Conservative Plan To Strengthen And Empower Iowa Families With More Affordable Health Care:
Today, In Iowa, Governor Romney Discussed His Conservative Plan To Strengthen Iowa Families By Putting Conservative Principles To Work In Health Care. Governor Romney has outlined a comprehensive solution to the nation's health care ills that expands access to affordable, portable, quality, private health insurance. Rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all, government-run system, Governor Romney's plan recognizes the importance of the role that states can play in leading reform and the need for innovation in dealing with rising health care costs and the problem of the uninsured.
- Governor Romney's Plan Facilitates The Growth Of The Private Health Insurance Market. Governor Romney believes that by expanding and deregulating the private health insurance market, we can decrease costs and ensure that more Iowans have access to affordable, portable, quality, private health insurance.
- In Iowa, Nine Percent Of The Population Is Uninsured. More than 270,000 people in Iowa are uninsured. For those with insurance, the average annual individual health insurance premium is $2,202. In 2004 alone, more than $15.9 billion or $5,380 per person was spent on health care by people in Iowa.

Governor Romney's Health Care Reforms Will Strengthen Iowa Families:
Governor Romney Will Help Every Iowan Get Access To Affordable, Quality Health Insurance, Without New Taxes Or A Government Takeover. Governor Romney's plan institutes market-based reforms that will bring down the cost of health insurance for every Iowan. His plan also redirects existing government spending to help Iowa's low-income uninsured acquire private health insurance.
Governor Romney Will Lower Health Care Costs For Iowa Families By Making All Qualified Medical Expenses, Including Premiums, Premium Contributions And Co-Payments, Tax Deductible.
- The Average American Family That Acquires Health Insurance Through An Employer Spends $2,585 Each Year On Premium Contributions. Under Governor Romney's healthcare plan, these premium contributions would be completely tax-deductible, resulting in a tax savings of almost $650 a year.
  - The Average Iowa Family That Acquires Health Insurance Through An Employer Spends $2,436 Each Year On Premium Contributions. Under Governor Romney's healthcare plan, these premium contributions would be completely tax-deductible, resulting in a tax savings of more than $600 a year.
  - The Average American Family That Acquires Health Insurance In The Non-Group, Or Individual, Market Spends $5,799 Each Year On Premiums. Under Governor Romney's healthcare plan, these premiums would be completely tax-deductible, resulting in a tax savings of almost $1,450 a year.
  - The Average Iowa Family That Acquires Health Insurance In The Non-Group, Or Individual, Market Spends $4,477 Each Year On Premiums. Under Governor Romney's healthcare plan, these premiums would be completely tax-deductible, resulting in a tax savings of almost $1,100 a year.

By Encouraging The Use Of Information Technology And Reforming The Malpractice System, Governor Romney Will Reduce Medical Errors, Increase Efficiency And Cut Costs. Our health care system is the best in the world, but Governor Romney believes we can make it even better while cutting health care costs for every American. Frivolous lawsuits make health care more expensive and force doctors to practice defensive medicine. And, many aspects of the health care system remain technologically backwards. Governor Romney will bring a true market dynamic to health care and lead medical liability reform that will both honor the rights of patients and respect the work of physicians.
