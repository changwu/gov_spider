    It's great to be back in my native State. And it's wonderful to have an opportunity to give a message to my many friends and supporters here in Nebraska and to say to them that the fight to achieve the Presidency for the next 4 years begins anew right here in Nebraska, and it's a fight that's going to be continued until we prevail and are successful in Kansas City in August of this year.
It's a fight that will ensure the continuation of policies that have brought us from the depths of a recession to a new level of prosperity in America. It's a fight that's going to continue the policies of rolling back the bureaucracy, the red tape in Washington, D.C. It's a policy that will preserve and continue the peace that we have and the peace that we must keep for the future. It's a policy that will lead to the continuation of faith and trust and confidence in the Presidency itself.
As I said, this is a campaign that is beginning anew. It's a campaign that's essential for the continuation of the policies of the last 2 years that have been successful. A mandate would be very helpful in maintaining the momentum that we now have for peace, prosperity, and trust. It's a campaign and a fight that will lead to success here in Nebraska and success in Kansas City in November for the country as a whole.
