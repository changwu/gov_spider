    This is a wonderful, wonderful day in Chicago, and Betty and I are deeply grateful for all of you coming out to visit us on our first trip out of Washington since a week or 10 days ago. Thank you so, so very much.
Now, let me just add a word, if I might. I have said it several times, but all of you can contribute so much. We have got a lot of work to do. That includes me as well as you and our fellow Americans. We are going to do that work, and we are going to accomplish what has to be done, both at home and abroad.
There is, I think, a great opportunity for America, for what we can do at home and what we can do abroad. It will take a little belt tightening and sacrificing, but with the spirit that I know exists in America, and you exemplify it here this morning by your warm welcome, I am sure we can do the job, with God's help.
Thank you so very, very much.
