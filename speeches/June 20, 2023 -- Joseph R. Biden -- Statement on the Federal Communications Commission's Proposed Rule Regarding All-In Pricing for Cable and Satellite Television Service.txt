    My administration's top priority is lowering the cost of living for the middle class, and that includes cracking down on companies' use of junk fees to hide true costs from families, who end up paying more as a result. Today the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), under the leadership of Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, proposed a new rule that would require cable and satellite TV providers to give consumers the all-in price for the service they're offering up front. Too often, these companies hide additional junk fees on customer bills disguised as "broadcast TV" or "regional sports" fees that in reality pay for no additional services. These fees really add up. According to one report, they increase customer bills by nearly 25 percent of the price of base service.
The FCC all-in pricing proposal would help consumers comparison shop between providers and increase competition for viewers. This is only the latest action taken by my administration to crack down on junk fees in order to increase transparency and bring down costs for hard-working Americans. Junk fees may not matter much for the wealthy, but they hit working families hard, costing them hundreds of dollars that could be used to help pay their bills.
