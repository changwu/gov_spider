    The President. I really appreciate everybody coming down. And we've got several key issues, but one that I am most interested in getting through is this balanced budget amendment. I think it is critical, and I think it's an idea whose time has come. It's an idea that the American people strongly support. One of the things I want to follow up on with you all now is how we do that. I know we've got problems in the Senate that are different than the House, but we've got to get it done for the American people. I'm very pleased with the way our troops are moving out on it, but that's one of the things on my mind for this meeting.
So let's pass a balanced budget amendment; discipline the Congress as well as the executive branch and everything else. We've got to get it done.
Q. A lot of economists don't agree with you, like 400.
The President. Well, the people, the American people agree with me, and that's what matters. So we ought to get it done and not worry about those who don't. It's out there, and we've got ideas up there before the Congress right now that would accomplish this, too.
Q. What do you hear from the primaries?
The President. I haven't heard anything much there, Helen [Helen Thomas, United Press International].
