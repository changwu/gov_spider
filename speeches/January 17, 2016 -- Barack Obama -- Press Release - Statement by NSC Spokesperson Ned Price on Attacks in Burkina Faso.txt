    The United States condemns in the strongest terms the recent terrorist attacks in Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou, and in the country's northern region. We mourn with the families of those killed in these senseless acts of violence, including Michael James Riddering, an American citizen who had devoted his life to working with the Burkinabé people, and our thoughts and prayers are with those who were injured. We continue to attempt to account for all American citizens in Burkina Faso and assist the victims of the attacks. We commend the bravery of the Burkinabé, French, and U.S. security personnel who responded to the situation and prevented even worse loss of life.
The people of Burkina Faso have time and again demonstrated their strength and resilience, most recently by conducting peaceful and democratic elections after turning back efforts by the previous president to extend his stay in office illegitimately and then successfully resisting the efforts of a few to derail the elections.
The United States continues to stand with the people of Burkina Faso. Acts of terrorism will not stop efforts by brave Americans and others from around the world who travel far and wide to support governments, civil society groups, and others working to strengthen democracy, improve healthcare, and increase economic opportunities for all.
The United States will remain a steadfast partner to the Government of Burkina Faso and others in the region fighting the terrorist groups that seek to undermine peace and democracy in the Sahel. We are prepared to assist the Burkinabé government in the days and weeks ahead as it investigates and works to hold accountable those responsible for these tragic terrorist attacks.
