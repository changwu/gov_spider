  A Proclamation

The one hundred and ninety-second anniversary of the death of General Casimir Pulaski on October 11, 1779, in the battle of Savannah, reminds us of the great sacrifice he made for our national independence.
General Pulaski believed that the cause of human freedom was indivisible. He fought against foreign suppression in his native Poland and he joined the struggle for American independence by volunteering in the Continental Army.
On this anniversary of General Pulaski's death, it is appropriate that we note with gratitude his historic contribution—and that of succeeding generations of Americans of Polish origin—to the freedom and progress of this Nation.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Monday, October 11, 1971, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day. I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day.
I also invite the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies honoring the memory of General Pulaski and the contributions which he and others from his homeland have made to our national life.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 26th day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.

RICHARD NIXON
