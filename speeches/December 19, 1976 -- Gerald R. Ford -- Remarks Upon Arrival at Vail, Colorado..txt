    Thank you very, very much, John.
Betty, Mike, Jack, Steve, Susan, and our daughter-in-law, Gayle, and myself, of course, are just delighted to be here in Vail. There isn't a place that we would rather come at Christmas time than Vail, Colorado, and we have been here, as I best recollect, nine Christmases in a row. And I and all the family look forward to spending many, many more Christmases in this wonderful location.
About a week ago, there were some inquiries made about how snow was in Vail. One of my staff said to me, "Mr. President, why don't we change our plans and go somewhere else where you can play some golf?" I said we were coming to Vail, and between the Indians and myself, we knew very well there would be some snow very shortly.
But let me just thank all of the people who live in Vail, all that come here to seek employment, all who come to ski. We are deeply indebted to all of you for your many courtesies, your hospitality, your friendship. And I hope and trust that we will see you on the slopes, having dinner, walking the streets, just enjoying ourselves in this wonderful atmosphere with so many nice people.
Thank you. Merry, Merry Christmas.
