    "Joe Biden just bragged about a plan that kills more than 10 million American jobs supported by the energy industries and makes sure the United States is once again dependent on foreign countries for energy. His plan is more like a socialist manifesto that promises to massively raise taxes, eliminate jobs in the coal, oil or natural gas industries, and crush the middle class. Now more than ever, it's clear that Biden is beholden to the radical socialist ideology of Senator Bernie Sanders, and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and there is no way he can sell this radical agenda to union workers in energy-producing, manufacturing, or auto industry states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, or Wisconsin. We already know what would happen in a Joe Biden economy because for eight long years the American worker was forgotten and we had the slowest economy since the Great Depression â€“ and now he's pushing extreme policies that would smother the economy just when it's showing signs of roaring back."
