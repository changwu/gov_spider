    I want to commend the Congress for passing the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 today. It is about time that Congress lived by the same laws it places on the private sector. Passage of this bill fulfills a campaign commitment of mine.
However, while this legislation is an important political reform, it is only the first step in what must be a greater effort to change businessas-usual in Washington. Therefore, I reiterate my call for Congress to act swiftly on several much needed reform proposals including real campaign finance reform and the gift ban and a strong version of the line-item veto.
