    America has lost one of its greatest citizens. Milton Friedman was a revolutionary thinker and extraordinary economist whose work helped advance human dignity and human freedom.
A champion of limited government and personal freedom, Friedman proposed bold ideas about school choice, tax reductions, and an all-volunteer army that serve as the foundation of many of America's most successful Government reforms. His work demonstrated that free markets are the great engines of economic development. His writings laid the groundwork that transformed many of the world's central banks, helping deliver economic stability and improved living standards in countries around the world.
Milton Friedman, a recipient of the Nobel Prize, will be remembered as one of the most influential economists in history. The Nation is grateful for his profound contributions.
Our thoughts and prayers are with the Friedman family.
