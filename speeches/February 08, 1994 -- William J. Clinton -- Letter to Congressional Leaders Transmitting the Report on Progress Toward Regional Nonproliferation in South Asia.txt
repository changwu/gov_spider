As required under section 620F(c) of the Foreign Operations Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1993 (22 U.S.C. 2376(c)), I am transmitting a report entitled "Progress Toward Regional Nonproliferation in South Asia." This report is unclassified, with a classified annex. It covers developments between April 1, 1993, and October 31, 1993.
A previous report on this subject was transmitted to the Congress on April 28, 1993.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
