    Mr. Ambassador--yesterday I would have said Mr. Secretary:
I appreciate your coming here so I can tell you that I am more than pleased that you are willing to take the time, the trouble, and the effort to do what you are doing.
You know, the Armed Forces of the country depend entirely on the morale which is given to them from back home. I know, because I was on the frontline when I was much younger than I am now, and I know how it feels to have somebody at home who was interested in what I was trying to do at that time on the front in France.
These young men are just like we were, they appreciate more than you will ever know what you people are doing.
All during World War II, Mrs. Truman was an active participant in all the work that went on here in Washington, and when she was at home the same conditions prevailed.
I just want to say to you that I am very appreciative, and I thank you sincerely from the bottom of my heart in the name of the people of the United States, and officially as President of the United States I am extending my thanks to you.
