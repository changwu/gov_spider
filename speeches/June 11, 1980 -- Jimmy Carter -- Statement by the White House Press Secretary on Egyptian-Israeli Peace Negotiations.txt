    As you know, the United States has been holding discussions with both Egypt and Israel concerning the issues which have impeded a resumption of the autonomy talks. All parties recognize that it is essential to pursue the negotiations to a successful conclusion as expeditiously as possible.
Accordingly, the President is pleased to announce that Egypt and Israel have accepted the invitation of the United States to send their heads of delegation, Dr. Burg and Foreign Minister All, to Washington to meet with Ambassador Linowitz to prepare for the resumption of formal negotiations. A mutually agreeable date will be set for this meeting in the near future.
