    A new poll from Yahoo News/YouGov poll shows that more than two thirds of American's support President Biden's American Rescue Plan. The poll notes the overwhelming support for immediate relief checks, federal spending for vaccinations, and increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.
"Of all 20 policies covered by the poll, the two most popular were the ones at the center of Biden's current COVID proposal: $2,000 relief checks (74 percent favor vs. 13 percent oppose) and increased federal funding for vaccination (69 percent favor vs. 17 percent oppose). A full 58 percent of Americans also support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, another key element of Biden's COVID-19 rescue package. That's almost twice the share of Americans (31 percent) who oppose a wage hike. Nearly identical numbers favor (57 percent) and oppose (32 percent) a national mask mandate."
Today's poll is just the latest evidence that Americans of both parties support the plan. Yesterday, 411 bipartisan mayors sent a letter to Congressional leaders urging immediate action on the plan. The American Rescue Plan has received praise from across the political spectrum â€“ from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable to Senator Sanders and organized labor. And, top economic advisors from the last four presidents: Kevin Hassett, Gene Sperling, R. Glenn Hubbard, and Alan Blinder have all said that additional stimulus is needed to rescue the economy.
Additionally, a long list of economists and economic organizations have recently noted the benefits of immediate relief, including Brookings, Moody's Analytics, and the Chief Economist of the International Monetary Fund. And, a Reuters survey of dozens of economists found that over 90% believed that it would "boost the economy significantly."
