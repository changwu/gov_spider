RUSSELLVILLE, Ark. — The Cruz for President campaign has released its second video featuring Sen. Cruz's #CruzCountry bus tour. Today in Little Rock, the crowd exceeded expectations, drawing nearly 600 attendees. Cruz visits Van Buren, AR later today and concludes the tour on Thursday, August 13, with stops in Oklahoma City, Bartlesville and Tulsa. Combined, all the states he will visit represent 356 of the 1,236 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination.


To date, Cruz has made multiple stops in South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Arkansas — all states where he has released strong leadership teams that will continue to build his robust grassroots network in each state.
