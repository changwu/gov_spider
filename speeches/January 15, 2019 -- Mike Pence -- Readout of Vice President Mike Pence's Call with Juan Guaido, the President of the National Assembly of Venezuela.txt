    Vice President Pence spoke by phone today with Juan Guaido, the President of the National Assembly of Venezuela, to recognize his courageous leadership following his arrest and intimidation this weekend, and to express the United States' resolute support for the National Assembly of Venezuela as the only legitimate democratic body in the country. The Vice President firmly emphasized that the long-standing goal of the United States and all freedom-loving nations is to restore democracy to Venezuela through free and fair elections, and end the unprecedented humanitarian and economic crises in the once-rich cradle of Bolivar. Vice President Pence encouraged Mr. Guaido to build unity among political groups, and pledged continued support from the United States until democracy is restored.
