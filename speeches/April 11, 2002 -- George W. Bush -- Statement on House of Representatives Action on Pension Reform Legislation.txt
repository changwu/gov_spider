    Employees need more information about their pension plans and more control over them. I commend Chairman Thomas, Chairman Boehner, and Congressman Portman, and the bipartisan majority in the House for passing pension reform legislation that accomplishes these objectives. The reforms will give employees better access to investment advice, additional notice of blackouts, and increased ability to diversify. Importantly, the reforms adhere to the principle that what is right for executives is also right for workers. I look forward to Senate action on this critical issue.
