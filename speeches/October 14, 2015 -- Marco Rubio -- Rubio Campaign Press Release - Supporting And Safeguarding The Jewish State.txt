Sadly, even as Israelis are facing daily Palestinian terrorist attacks, that commitment to Israel has been lacking from the current administration.
Israel deserves our support and respect. If we are perceived as not standing with Israel, what realistically could any of our other allies expect from us? It's time to reaffirm our commitment to Israel's continued strength and prosperity.
Marco will:

Strengthen the U.S.-Israel Alliance and Israel's Self-Defense
Revoke President Obama's Flawed Iran Deal
Defend Israel's Efforts to Combat Terrorism
Fight Efforts to Delegitimize the Jewish State
Push to Move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem
