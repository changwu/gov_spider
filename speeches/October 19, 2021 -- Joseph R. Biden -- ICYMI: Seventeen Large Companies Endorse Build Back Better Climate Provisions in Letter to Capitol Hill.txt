    Today, seventeen U.S. companies sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer voicing their support for acting on climate in the President's Build Back Better Agenda. In the letter, they note that "both private-sector and government action are necessary for the United States to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions. To that end, we support the robust climate provisions in the Build Back Better Act and request their inclusion in the final legislation."
The companies write: "The climate provisions in the Build Back Better Act support our own investment in low-carbon innovation and will help us grow our business and remain competitive globally while also meeting our climate goals."
These companies represent 500,000 jobs and half a trillion dollars in revenue annually.
