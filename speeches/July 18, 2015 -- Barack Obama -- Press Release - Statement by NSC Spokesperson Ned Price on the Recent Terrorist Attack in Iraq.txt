    The United States strongly condemns yesterday's abhorrent ISIL attack in Diyala Province which purposefully and viciously targeted Iraqi civilians celebrating the Eid ul-Fitr holiday to mark the conclusion of the holy month of Ramadan. This latest attack is yet another painful example of the atrocities that the terrorist group ISIL continues to perpetrate against the people of Iraq.
The United States remains steadfast in its commitment to work with Prime Minister Al-Abadi and our partners in Iraq and the international community to bring an end to ISIL's depravity. On behalf of the brave people of Diyala Province and all those Iraqis persecuted by ISIL, the United States will continue to support the Government of Iraq and its security forces to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist organization.
