    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Sponsors: Livingston (R), Louisiana; Callahan (R), Alabama)
This Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views on the item reported in disagreement by the conference on H.R. 1868, the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill, FY 1996. Your consideration of the Administration's views would be appreciated.
The conferees have reported in disagreement provisions related to population assistance to non-governmental organizations. This is an issue of the highest importance to the Administration.
The Administration opposes coercion in family planning practices, and no U.S. assistance is used to pay for abortion as a method of family planning. The House provision, however, would prohibit any assistance from being provided to entities that fund abortions or lobby for abortions with private funds, thus ending U.S. support for many qualified and experienced non-governmental organizations providing vital voluntary family planning information and services. The provision would also end U.S. support for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). This would sharply limit the availability of effective voluntary family planning programs abroad that are designed to reduce the incidence of unwanted pregnancy and thereby decrease the need for abortion. The Administration also has serious concerns about the constitutionality of the House provision. If the House language were included in the bill presented to the President, the Secretary of State would recommend to the President that he veto the bill.
