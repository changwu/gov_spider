    ST. PATRICK'S Day lifts the spirit not only of Irish Americans, but of all Americans who cherish those qualities of heart and soul that are so characteristic of the Irish: warmth and wit, originality and openness of heart, faith and fortitude. There is a little bit of the Celt in all of us. That is why Americans of every nationality join in St. Patrick's Day festivities, especially "the wearin' o' the green."
Ireland has invigorated our American way of life---in government, journalism, science, commerce, education; through its music, drama and poetry. Irish charm is found everywhere.
Mrs. Nixon and I value our own Irish heritage and we take special pleasure in greeting our fellow citizens of Hibernian descent--and all those who, on St. Patrick's Day, celebrate America's gratitude for what Erin has given us.
