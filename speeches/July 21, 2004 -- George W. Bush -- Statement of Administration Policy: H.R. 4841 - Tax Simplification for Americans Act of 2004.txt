    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Burns (R) Georgia)
The Administration strongly favors simplifying the tax system for America's families and businesses. To this end, the Administration proposed in its most recent Budget nine specific changes in the law that would significantly reduce tax complexity while having little revenue impact. The Administration appreciates the Congress' interest in tax simplification, which is demonstrated by this legislation, and looks forward to working with the Congress on enacting legislation that would strengthen our economy and increase jobs by simplifying the tax system for the Nation's taxpayers.
