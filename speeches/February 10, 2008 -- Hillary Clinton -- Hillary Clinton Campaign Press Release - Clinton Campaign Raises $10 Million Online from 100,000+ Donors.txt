    The Clinton campaign today announced that it raised $10 million online from more than 100,000 donors since the polls closed on Super Tuesday.
"This is a major development in this race. Hillary has always had millions of strong supporters nationwide -- now those supporters are beginning to give online in large numbers," said Clinton Campaign Internet Director Peter Daou.
The campaign had set a goal of raising $3 million in 3 days -- and exceeded its target in less than a day. The campaign raised more than $4 million online during the first 24 hours after the polls closed in California.
"We are overwhelmed by the response to our fundraising drive and tremendously grateful to our supporters nationwide," said Daou. "In the hours after Super Tuesday's polls closed, contributions began coming in and shortly after Sen. Clinton discussed a loan she had given her campaign in January, there was a massive surge in contributions from small donors across the country. Emails and letters poured in from supporters telling Sen. Clinton that they hadn't realized that she needed their financial support."
"The emails ranged from a conservative veteran who wrote to say that he, his wife and daughters all contributed to the campaign, to a couple who decided to forego their Valentine's dinner to send a donation. With more than a million volunteer hours committed and millions of dollars donated to Sen. Clinton's campaign, our grassroots supporters are the backbone of our campaign. We cannot thank them enough for standing with Sen. Clinton every step of the way and we know we can rely on them to carry us to victory."
