    From May through August, supporters attended more than 400 non-candidate organizing events in New Hampshire
Manchester, NH -- Barack Obama has visited New Hampshire 13 times as a candidate-and returns Monday-and he's held over 40 events here. Think that's impressive? Obama supporters here in the Granite State have planned and attended more than 400 events this summer, building a grassroots organization unlike any other.
Barack Obama made it clear from the beginning that he wanted to run a different kind of campaign-a grassroots movement that would allow regular people to take organizing into their own hands to change the country. From issue forums to book clubs to "eating meetings," that vision has become a reality in New Hampshire this summer.
