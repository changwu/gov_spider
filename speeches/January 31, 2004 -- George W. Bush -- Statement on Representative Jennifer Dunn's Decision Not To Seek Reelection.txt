    Jennifer Dunn is a good friend and an outstanding public servant. For more than a decade, she has delivered results for the people of Washington State. She has championed sound policies that encourage economic growth and create jobs. She has led the way in providing tax relief for the American people; promoting the advancement of small and women-owned businesses; helping America's children, including by sponsoring the Amber Alert bill; and protecting the environment. She is a superb legislator and a strong leader who has stood for the best of Washington State's values and who has improved the lives of its people.
Laura and I are grateful for Jennifer's friendship, and we extend our best wishes to her, her husband, Keith, and her two sons.
