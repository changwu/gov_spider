    To the Congress of the United States:
Forwarded herewith in accordance with the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1124 are reports of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation on awards made during Fiscal Year 1976 to members of the Armed Forces for suggestions, inventions and scientific achievements.
Participation by military personnel in the cash awards program was authorized by the Congress in 1965. More than 1.89 million suggestion submissions since that time attest to the success which the program has had as a means of motivating military personnel to seek ways of reducing costs and improving efficiency. Of those suggestions submitted, more than 296,000 have been adopted with resultant tangible first-year benefits in excess of $929,000,000.
Of the 119,256 suggestions which were submitted by military personnel (including Coast Guard military personnel) during Fiscal Year 1976, 19,375 were adopted. Cash awards totaling $1,343,224 were paid for these adopted suggestions, based not only on the tangible first-year benefits of $52,983,753 which were realized therefrom, but also on many additional benefits and improvements of an intangible nature. Enlisted personnel received $1,104,328 in awards, which represents 82 percent of the total cash awards paid. The remaining 18 percent was received by officer personnel and amounted to $238,896.
Attached are reports of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation containing statistical information on the military awards program and brief descriptions of some of the more noteworthy contributions made by military personnel during Fiscal Year 1976.
