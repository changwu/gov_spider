 "John Gallus has been a leader in the fight to protect the New Hampshire Advantage and has served as a strong voice in Concord for the North Country," said Mitt Romney. "John understands that in order to return fiscal sanity to Washington, our government needs to cut spending and live within its means. I am proud to have earned his support and look forward to campaigning with him across the North Country."
 "In 2012 Republicans need to nominate a candidate who can defeat President Obama and reverse the damage caused by his disastrous fiscal policies. Over the past several months, Governor Romney has clearly demonstrated that he is the most qualified candidate and the strongest Republican to take on the President," said Senator Gallus. "As a successful businessman and a fiscally conservative governor, Mitt knows how to balance a budget and fix our broken economy. I am proud to support Mitt's campaign and will work to ensure that he has the support needed to win the primary."
