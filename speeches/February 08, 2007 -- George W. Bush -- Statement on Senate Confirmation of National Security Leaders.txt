    I am pleased that the Senate, with strong bipartisan support, has confirmed several key members of my national security team. America will benefit from the leadership of Mike McConnell as Director of National Intelligence, General George Casey as Chief of Staff of the United States Army, and Admiral William Fallon as commander of U.S. Central Command.
Mike McConnell is an experienced and proven leader who will continue implementing historic reforms of America's intelligence community designed to ensure we receive timely, accurate information on threats to our country. General Casey's extensive knowledge of our military challenges and capabilities will enable him to lead our soldiers in successful pursuit of their mission. Admiral Fallon is an innovative thinker who will skillfully guide our military commanders as we confront our enemies in the war on terror.
I look forward to working with each of these strong leaders in combating terrorism and protecting the American people.
