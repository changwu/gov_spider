    I applaud the strong, bipartisan vote in the Senate to move forward with consideration of the African growth and opportunity act. This historic legislation will help build a partnership that will strengthen economic and political ties, increase trade, and boost economic growth and opportunity in both the United States and Africa. It will strengthen the relationship between our Nation and a continent entering a new era of democracy and economic progress. I urge Congress to pass this legislation this year.
