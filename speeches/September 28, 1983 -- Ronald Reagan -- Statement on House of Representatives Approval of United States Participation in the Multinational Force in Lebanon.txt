    I want to thank the House of Representatives for its strong, bipartisan vote today supporting our policies in Lebanon and the continued presence of the U.S. peacekeeping force. This vote would not have been possible without the strong leadership of Speaker O'Neill, Majority Leader Wright, Minority Leader Michel, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Zablocki, and Ranking Minority Member Broomfield.
A spirit of cooperation between members of the two parties, and between the executive and the legislative branches of our Government, has been the traditional hallmark of a successful foreign policy. Today, we continue the process of restoring that bipartisan spirit. Now we look to the Senate for a similar demonstration of responsible leadership.
