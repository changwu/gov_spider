    The President will welcome President Valdas Adamkus of Lithuania to the White House on September 29, 2008. President Adamkus has been one of Europe's most principled leaders in defending the sovereignty and independence of all of Europe's nations, including through policies to strengthen Europe's energy security. Under his leadership, Lithuania has supported democracies in Georgia and Ukraine, and worked to advance freedom in neighboring Belarus. A NATO ally, Lithuania contributes significantly to Alliance efforts to support the security and development of Afghanistan, and has been a partner in helping Iraqis secure their freedom. The President looks forward to exchanging views with President Adamkus on these and other global challenges.
