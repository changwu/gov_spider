    Today, I have signed into law H.R. 233, the "Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act." The Act strengthens protection of certain lands in California.
Section 4(i)(2) of the Act purports to give binding legal effect to guidelines in an appendix to a report issued by a congressional committee, which was not incorporated into the Act and for which presentment was not made. Consistent with the bicameral approval and presentment requirements of the Constitution for the making of a law, the executive branch shall, in carrying out the Act, take appropriate account of the guidelines as a matter of comity between the executive and legislative branches.
