    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed requests to change FY 2003 appropriations law and an FY 2004 budget amendment for the Department of Veterans Affairs, none of which will affect budget levels.
The details of these requests are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
