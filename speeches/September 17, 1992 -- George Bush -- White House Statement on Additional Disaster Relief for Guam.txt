    The President today announced that he has amended his August 28, 1992, declaration of a major disaster in the Territory of Guam to waive Territory and local cost sharing requirements, where permitted to do so by law, to allow reimbursement of 95 percent of eligible public assistance costs exceeding $10 per capita, and to waive the cost sharing requirement for the individual and family grant program as allowed under the provisions of the Insular Act.
This additional relief provided by the President was in response to a request made by Gov. Joseph Ada. It was taken in response to the unprecedented damage and destruction caused by Typhoon Omar. By waiving customary Territory and local cost sharing requirements, the President can provide maximum Federal assistance to the people of Guam whose lives have been so severely disrupted by this disaster.
