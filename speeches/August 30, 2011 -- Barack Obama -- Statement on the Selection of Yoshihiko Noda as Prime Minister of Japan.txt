    I offer my personal congratulations to Yoshihiko Noda on his election as Japan's next Prime Minister. The United States will work with him and the Japanese people on initiatives that benefit our two countries, the region, and the world. For the last half century the U.S.-Japan alliance has served as the linchpin of peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region, and together, we can ensure that the next half-century enjoys the same stability and prosperity. The relationship between the United States and Japan is based on common interests and common values, and I look forward to working with Prime Minister Noda to tackle the broad range of economic and security issues that require our attention.
