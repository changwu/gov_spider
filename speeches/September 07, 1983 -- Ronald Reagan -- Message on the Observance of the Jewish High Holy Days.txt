    It is a pleasure for Nancy and me to extend greetings to Jews in this country and the world over as you join in celebration of the High Holy Days.
We know that Rosh Hashanah, the New Year, is a time for introspection, reflection, and renewal. It is also a time when members of the Jewish Faith reexamine the year past and look to the one ahead in a spirit of prayer and hopefulness.
Ten days later, Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, is a solemn period of fasting and penitence which culminates the High Holy Days.
For all of you this is an especially thoughtful season, and we join fellow Americans in sharing your hopes and aspirations for peace and human understanding and for an end to hatred and violence.
As the shofar calls Jews to their places of worship during this period, our thoughts and warm good wishes will be with you. May the year 5744 bring health, prosperity, and peace to you and your families.
