BELLEVUE, Washington â€” 2012 Presidential candidate Ron Paul received today declarations of support from eight Spokane County Republican Party district leaders, party activists capable of coordinating political efforts across the many precincts comprising a district.
Listed below are the names of the leaders, their district, and the number of precincts they lead.
Michael Cathcart of District 3A, 22 precincts
Lesa Baxter of District 3B, 22 precincts
Kirk Smith of District 3C, 22 precincts
Joe Collins of District 4A, 30 precincts
John Charleston of District 4C, 26 precincts
Edie Baxter of District 6B, 24 precincts
Bruce Thomson of District 6C, 24 precincts
Julian Hale of District 7, 18 precincts
For a total of 188 precincts out of 294 led, or 64 percent of all, this leaves five other district leaders with 106 precincts to be uncertainly divided among the four candidates, as Ron Paul is expected to be successful in precincts and districts even in places where leaders in the party have failed to step forward to endorse him.
In summary, as a function of this announcement Ron Paul has won support from a near-supermajority of all Spokane County GOP district leaders representing 63 percent of all precincts in the county with a district leader.
