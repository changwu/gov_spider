Dr. Summers and Mr. Donilon had the pleasure of meeting with President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao, Vice Premier Wang Qishan, State Councilor Dai Bingguo, and Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi. They were also received by Li Yuanchao, Polituburo member, head of Organization Department. Separately, Dr. Summers also held discussions with Governor of the People's Bank of China Zhou Xiaochuan and Finance Minister Xie Xuren while Mr. Donilon met with Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission General Xu Caihou.
In keeping with President Obama's vision for the U.S.-China bilateral relationship, the United States seeks to expand cooperation in the many areas where our countries' interests coincide while we will speak frankly and with respect when we disagree. It is in that spirit that Dr. Summers and Mr. Donilon held extensive meetings that included candid exchanges on a wide range of issues touching on bilateral and international issues, among them North Korea, Iran and global rebalancing. The American delegation was pleased to be able to discuss with Chinese officials economic and security issues from a strategic perspective and further expand the scope and depth of the U.S.-China relationship.
