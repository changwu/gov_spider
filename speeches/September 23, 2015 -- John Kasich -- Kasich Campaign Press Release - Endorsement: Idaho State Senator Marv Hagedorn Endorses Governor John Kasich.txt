Today, Idaho State Senator Marv Hagedorn endorsed John Kasich for President. Hagedorn will serve as the Co-Chair for Governor Kasich's Idaho campaign.
"As a small businessman and veteran I appreciate Governor Kasich's work to balance our nation's budget and create a strong national defense. Not only has John Kasich successfully turned around Ohio, but he is also the chief architect of the last time America balanced it's budget. We know that Governor Kasich has the ability to turn our Country around just like he did Ohio, AND he has the record to prove it!"
Hagedorn is in his second term as a State Senator. He previously served three terms in the Idaho House of Representatives. He retired from the Navy after serving 20 years on active duty and has worked in the private sector from blue collar jobs to being CEO of his own business in the 21 years since. He co-founded and now oversees the operation of the Wyakin Warrior Foundation helping our wounded warriors transition back into the private sector.
"Senator Hagedorn knows the importance of balancing the budget and common-sense conservatism. I'm proud to have him help lead our team in Idaho," Governor Kasich said.
