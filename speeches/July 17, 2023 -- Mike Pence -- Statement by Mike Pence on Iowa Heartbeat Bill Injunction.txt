    Mike Pence today issued the following statement on Judge Seidlin's injunction of Iowa's Heartbeat Bill:
"Iowa's Heartbeat Bill was a huge win for Life, and I am confident the cause of Life will prevail even as the Radical Left seeks to ignore the will of Iowa's people. We will not stop fighting until the sanctity of Life is returned to the center of American law in Iowa and every state in the Land."
