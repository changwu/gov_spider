    Presidential Determination No. 88-7
Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense
Pursuant to Section 152 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987, Public Law 99-661, I hereby certify with respect to the BIGEYE binary chemical bomb that:
(1) Production of the BIGEYE binary chemical bomb is in the national security interests of the United States; and
(2) the design, planning, and environmental requirements for production facilities have been satisfied.
I also certify that this BIGEYE program is, in my considered judgment, vital to our national defense. We will continue to pursue as a national goal a truly comprehensive and verifiable ban on all chemical weapons. Until we can achieve that end, this and other actions to modernize our limited chemical retaliatory capability serve to deter the use of chemical weapons by our potential adversaries.
You are hereby authorized and directed to make the appropriate congressional notifications on my behalf.
This determination shall be published in the Federal Register.
