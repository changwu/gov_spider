    Former Rhode Island Governor Don Carcieri made the following statement on Rhode Island's upcoming primary:
"Last night's decisive victories show that the country believes that Mitt Romney is the only candidate who can defeat Barack Obama and implement pro-growth policies. Under President Obama, we have seen jobs lost and homes foreclosed upon, all while the national debt balloons out of control and gas prices rise. This is simply unacceptable. Mitt Romney has a detailed plan to spur economic growth and restore our nation's fiscal health. If one needs any more proof of his abilities, just simply look at his record: As a conservative businessman, he created jobs for American families. As the head of the Salt Lake City Olympics, he turned a scandal into a resounding success. As Governor of Massachusetts, he inherited a huge deficit and balanced the budget without raising taxes. I cannot think of better qualifications for our next president."
