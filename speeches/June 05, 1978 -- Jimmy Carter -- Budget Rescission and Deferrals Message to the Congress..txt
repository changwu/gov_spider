    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report one proposal to rescind $48 million in budget authority previously provided by the Congress. In addition, I am reporting three new deferrals totalling $8.1 million and revisions to three previously transmitted deferrals increasing the amount deferred by $0.4 million.
The rescission proposal affects the military assistance program. The new deferrals and the revisions to existing deferrals involve programs in the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, the Interior, and the Treasury.
The details of the rescission proposal and the deferrals are contained in the attached reports.
