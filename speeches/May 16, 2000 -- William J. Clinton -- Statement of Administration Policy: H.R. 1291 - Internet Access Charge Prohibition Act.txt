    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Upton (R) MI and 141 cosponsors)
The policy of the Administration and the Federal Communications Commission is to continue to exempt Internet service providers from per-minute access charges. Without such an exemption, Internet access costs to consumers and businesses could increase dramatically, thereby threatening affordable Internet access and expanding the digital divide.
Therefore, although the bill enacts current policy, the Administration supports a permanent ban on per minute access charges and the thrust of H.R. 1291. As the bill continues through the legislative process, however, the Administration recommends that the bill be amended to further clarify that Internet service providers are exempt from all time-based access charges.
