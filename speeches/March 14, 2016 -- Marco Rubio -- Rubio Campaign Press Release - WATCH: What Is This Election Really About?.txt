    Watch: This Election Is About the Future
 
March 14, 2016
Marco released a new video today, highlighting what this election is all about. 
Beyond the sound bites, beyond the back and forth attacks, this is about the future:

Marco sees the stakes of this election in his children every single day. 
As one of Marco's most devoted supporters in Miami put it:
I'm not doing it so much for Marco so much as I am for my kids, because he is the person who's going to give them, and this country, the very best future possible.

That's why Marco's fighting hard for every vote in Florida, and that's why tomorrow is so vitally important.
