(House Rules)
(Rep. Van Hollen, D-Maryland, and 114 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 5175. The Administration believes the DISCLOSE Act is a necessary measure so that Americans will know who is trying to influence the Nation's elections. H.R. 5175 also prevents those who should not interfere in the Nation's elections - like corporations controlled by foreign interests - from doing so. Unless strong new disclosure rules are established, the Supreme Court's decision in the Citizens United case will give corporations even greater power to influence elections. This bill is not perfect. The Administration would have preferred no exemptions. But by providing for unprecedented transparency, this bill takes great strides to hold corporations who participate in the Nation's elections accountable to the American people. As this is a matter of urgent importance, the Administration urges prompt passage of the DISCLOSE Act.
