    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Representative Price (D) Illinois)
The Administration supports the level of MILCON funding authorized in H.R. 1409 which is consistent with the compromise deficit reduction agreement approved by the Senate. The Administration will, however, work in conference to have certain provisions of the bill modified to more closely conform to the details of its request.
