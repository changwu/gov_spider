In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report three new deferrals of budget authority totalling $164.1 million and a revision to a previously transmitted deferral increasing the amount deferred by $1.0 million. The items involve the fossil energy construction and Strategic Petroleum Reserve programs in the Department of Energy and the payment of Vietnam prisoner of war claims in the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission.
