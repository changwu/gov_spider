    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of Sister Isolina Ferre. Her passionate fight, for more than 60 years, against poverty, violence, and despair earned her many awards and countless tributes from all around the world. Armed only with her faith, she taught gangs in New York City to solve their differences without violence. In Puerto Rico, her community service centers, the Centros Isolina Ferre, transformed ravaged neighborhoods by operating clinics and helping residents to empower themselves.
Almost a year ago today, I was honored to welcome Sister Isolina to the White House and present her with the Medal of Freedom. At that ceremony, I said, "Sister Isolina taught people to see the best in themselves and in their communities and made sure they had the tools to make the most of the gifts God has given them."
Her lifetime of selfless commitment to others will remain her greatest legacy. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and many friends.
