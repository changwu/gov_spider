    Federal Trade Commission Chairman Tim Muris will appear on "Ask the White House" today at 11:00 a.m. to discuss the anti-SPAM bill. The online chat takes place at www.whitehouse.gov/ask.
The bill would establish a framework of administrative, civil, and criminal tools to help America's consumers, businesses, and families combat unsolicited commercial e-mail, known as spam.
"Ask the White House" is an online forum which gives people an opportunity to correspond with White House and administration officials via the White House web site.
White House Chief of Staff Andy Card kicked off the inaugural online forum in mid-April. Since that time, online visitors have chatted with cabinet secretaries, senior administration officials, and behind-the-scenes professionals at the White House.
