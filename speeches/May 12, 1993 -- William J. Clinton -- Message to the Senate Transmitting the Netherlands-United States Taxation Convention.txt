    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, signed at Washington on December 18, 1992. An Understanding and exchange of notes are enclosed for the information of the Senate. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
The Convention replaces the existing income tax convention between the United States and the Kingdom of the Netherlands signed at Washington in 1948 and last amended in 1965. It is intended to reduce the distortions (double taxation or excessive taxation) that can arise when two countries tax the same income, thereby enabling U.S. firms to compete on a more equitable basis in the Netherlands and further enhancing the attractiveness of the United States to Dutch investors. In general, the Convention follows the pattern of other recent U.S. income tax treaties and is based on the U.S. and OECD Model treaties and recent income tax conventions of both parties. It will serve to modernize tax relations between the two countries.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Convention and give its advice and consent to ratification.
