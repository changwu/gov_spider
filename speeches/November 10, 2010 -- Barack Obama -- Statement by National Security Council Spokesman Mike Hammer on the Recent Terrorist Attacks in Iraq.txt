    The United States strongly condemns the recent terrorist attacks in Iraq, which were perpetrated by Al Qaida in Iraq against Christians in Baghdad in their homes and in their churches. We also strongly condemn additional attacks against innocent civilians throughout Iraq, to include pilgrims in the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala. We offer sincerest condolences to the families of the victims and to all the people of Iraq who are targeted by terrorism. We remain steadfast in our commitment to stand with the Iraqi people as they reject violence and resist efforts by Al Qaida in Iraq to spark sectarian tension during this critical period in which Iraqis are forming their next government. We pledge our support to the Government of Iraq as it takes all necessary steps to combat terrorism and intensify its efforts to protect all Iraqi citizens, including vulnerable religious minorities.
