    Each year during Secretaries Week, we have an opportunity to express our appreciation to the thousands of individuals who play such an important part in the efficient operation of offices around the country.
Over the years, the role of secretaries has changed considerably. New technologies and innovation have added more complex assignments to traditional responsibilities. All Americans owe a great deal to secretaries for the outstanding job they do and for the dedication they demonstrate every day of the year.
In all facets of our society, whether in business, education, labor, industry, or government, secretaries perform tasks and bring a sense of coordination that is essential to the success of our economic system. Their cooperation and loyalty make our offices a more pleasant place to be. Their professionalism and expertise are worthy of the highest commendation.
I am proud to salute the secretaries of America and wish them the very best for an enjoyable week.
