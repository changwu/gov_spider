    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Brown (D) CA and two others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5215, because replacing the current salinity laboratory in Riverside, California, by constructing a new one would cost $14.8 million, compared with $9 million for renovating the existing laboratory. This extra expense cannot be justified.
