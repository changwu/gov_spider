    The American Rescue Plan is delivering critical tax relief to middle class and hard-pressed working families with children. With today's announcement, about 90 percent of families with children will get this new tax relief automatically, starting in July. While the American Rescue Plan provides for this vital tax relief to hard-working families for this year, Congress must pass the American Families Plan to ensure that working families will be able to count on this relief for years to come. For working families with children, this tax cut sends a clear message: help is here.
