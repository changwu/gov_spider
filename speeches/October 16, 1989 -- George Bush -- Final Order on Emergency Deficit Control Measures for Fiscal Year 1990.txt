(1) Each automatic spending increase that would, but for the provisions of the Act, take effect during fiscal year 1990 is permanently sequestered or reduced as provided in section 252.
(2) The following are sequestered as provided in section 252: new budget authority; unobligated balances; new loan guarantee commitments or limitations; new direct loan obligations, commitments, or limitations; spending authority as defined in section 401(c)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended; and obligation limitations.
(3) For accounts making payments otherwise required by substantive law, the head of each department or agency is directed to modify the calculation of each such payment to the extent necessary to reduce the estimate of total required payments for the fiscal year by the amount specified by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget in his report of October 16, 1989.
(4) For accounts making commitments for guaranteed loans or obligations for direct loans as authorized by substantive law, the head of each department or agency is directed to reduce the level of such commitments or obligations to the extent necessary to conform to the limitations established by the Act and specified by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget in his report of October 16, 1989.
All reductions and sequestrations shall be made in strict accordance with the specifications of the October 16th report of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the requirements of section 252(b).
This order shall be effective immediately and supersedes the initial order issued on August 25, 1989.
