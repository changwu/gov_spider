    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 5118, the Wildfire Response and Drought Resiliency Act, which consists of a package of bills that relate to wildfire, forest management, and drought.
Climate change has led to intensifying droughts, longer fire seasons, and larger wildfires. Over the last 10 years, wildfires have gotten larger, more intense, and lasted for extended periods, resulting in significant damage to infrastructure and property, poor air quality, and, in some instances, post-wildfire flooding in burned areas. This is particularly true in the West, which is experiencing unprecedented drought. This severe drought highlights the need for thoughtful planning and action to make infrastructure and operational decisions more resilient to withstand water resource scarcity and variability.
The Administration appreciates the interest of Congress in the Administration's efforts to address climate change and its effects on wildfires and drought. The Administration would like to work with the Congress to ensure the many provisions in the Act avoid duplication with existing authorities and Administration efforts. We look forward to continuing our work with Congress to advance legislation supporting the President's vision for important and necessary reforms and improvements.
