    During the American Revolution, Morocco was one of the first states to acknowledge the independence of our young Republic. Today I want especially to applaud activities being undertaken by Americans and our Moroccan friends to commemorate the bicentennial of the U.S.-Moroccan Treaty of Peace and Friendship. This agreement, known as the Treaty of Marrakesh, was negotiated in that city in 1786 and subsequently ratified by the U.S. Senate on July 18, 1787. This was the first United States treaty with any Arab, Moslem, or African State. It is the longest unbroken friendship treaty of the United States. In July the United States and the Kingdom of Morocco simultaneously will issue stamps to commemorate this special and historic relationship.
U.S.-Moroccan relations have prospered and grown over time, drawing on shared interests and mutual respect for each other's concerns. We share a commitment to fundamental values including religious tolerance. Our governments and peoples are deeply committed to world peace and the principles of democracy, liberty, and justice. The United States has long supported the moderate and constructive policies of my good friend King Hassan II. We look forward to continued close cooperation in the months and years ahead. I am especially pleased to report that the Moroccan-American Foundation has agreed to assist in commemorative events for this bicentennial. Through the events planned for the celebration of this bicentennial, my hope is that more Americans will come to know and appreciate our close friendship with the Kingdom of Morocco.
