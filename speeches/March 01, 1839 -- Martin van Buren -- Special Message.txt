    To the Senate of the United States.
I have received the resolution of the Senate of this day, upon the subject of a communication made to you by the Postmaster-General on the 27th ultimo,* and have the satisfaction of laying before the Senate the accompanying letter from that officer, in which he fully disclaims any intended disrespect to the Senate in the communication referred to.
M. VAN BUREN.
*Stating that the only reason he had not sent an answer to a resolution of the Senate was because it was not ready which was considered disrespectful
