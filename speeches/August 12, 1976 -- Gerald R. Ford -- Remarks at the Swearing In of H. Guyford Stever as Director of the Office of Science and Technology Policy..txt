    Mr. Vice President, Dr. Stever and Mrs. Stever, distinguished guests:
Ever since I first came to the Congress I have had a great interest in science and technology. I recall very vividly my first exposure, as a member of the Committee on Appropriations, to military research and development programs. And subsequently, I had the opportunity to serve on the select committee that changed NACA to NASA, and subsequently became very interested in the space program itself.
As I recall, the first science adviser to the President was made under President Eisenhower by Executive order. Subsequently, of course, after a few years it was discontinued. But the Vice President and I, quite a few months ago, felt that it would be highly beneficial if we would establish an office of science and technology in the White House by statute.
The Vice President worked very closely with the Members of the House and Senate committees, and finally legislation was recently enacted to establish the Office of Science and Technology [Policy] in the White House, with the man holding that position to be the personal adviser to the President on these important subjects.
I am very pleased to participate in the ceremony today when Dr. Guy Stever will be sworn in by the Vice President to this first office. Dr. Stever was on the faculty at MIT, subsequently served as president of Carnegie-Mellon University, and for some time has been the head of the National Science Foundation.
We are very, very fortunate to have a man like Guy Stever to take this oath of office for this important responsibility. And I want to thank you, Guy, for assuming this job and initiating this program. We are proud of what you have done, and we are extremely fortunate to have someone like yourself undertaking this new responsibility.
I congratulate you and wish you well. And now will the Vice President act in the capacity as a justice or officer of the Government?
