    HOUSTON, Texas – Today, Congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona endorsed Ted Cruz for President. Gosar has spent his time in Congress fighting to uphold our immigration laws, defending the Second Amendment and protecting life and marriage. Gosar is also a small business owner and a dentist who has worked to reform health care and restore jobs and economic growth in Arizona.
"The Republicans are blessed with a very deep and talented bench of candidates," said Rep. Gosar. "I respect all of those who have devoted themselves to the country and a very challenging and personally taxing process. However, this election we need a fighter like Ted Cruz in the White House who stands up for the U.S. Constitution and the rule of law. I am endorsing Sen. Cruz because I have worked with him in the trenches, fought battles with him on the Hill, and he has proven himself to be honorable, tough, and a man of his word. He votes the way he says he will vote. He backs his words with action. I respect that and for that reason I think he will make a great President."
"I am thrilled to have Paul's support," said Cruz. "He has been a fighter for the people of Arizona and worked hard defending the issues important to conservatives like stopping illegal immigration and fighting President Obama's lawless executive actions. We can work together to turn this country around in 2016."
