    Kyle Clark. Mr. President let's begin with the news of the day. Were the Americans under attack at the consulate in Benghazi, Libya denied the request for help during that attack? And is it fair to tell Americans that what happened is under investigation and we'll all find out after the election?
The President. Well, the election has nothing to do with four brave Americans getting killed and us wanting to find out exactly what happened. These are folks who served under me that I had sent to some very dangerous places, nobody wants to find out more what happened than I do. But we want to make sure that we get it right, particularly because I have made a commitment to the families impacted as well as the American people, we are going to bring those folks to justice. So we're going to gather all the facts, find out exactly what happen, and make sure that it doesn't happen again, but we are also going to make sure that we bring to justice those who carried out these attacks.
Kyle Clark. Were they denied requests for help during the attack?
The President. Well we are—we are finding out exactly what happened I can tell you as I've said over the last couple of months since this happened, that the minute I found out—found out what was going on I gave three very clear directives: number one make sure that we are securing our personnel and doing whatever we need to, number two we are going to investigate exactly what happened to make sure it doesn't happen again, number three find out who did this so we can bring them to justice. And you know I guarantee you that everybody in the state department, our military, CIA you name it, had number one priority making sure that people were safe, these are our folks. And we are going to find out exactly what happened, but what we are also going to do is make sure that we are identifying those who carried out these terrible attacks.
