    Memorandum for the Secretary of the Interior
Subject: Preservation of Japanese American Internment Sites
The internment of Japanese Americans was a tragic episode in American history. The recent publication of the National Park Service report on the condition of the former internment camp sites, coupled with our Fiscal Year 2001 budget initiative, will help focus attention and resources on preserving the historical values of these sites.
The National Park Service report, entitled "Confinement and Ethnicity: an Overview of World War II Japanese American Relocation Sites," describes the current condition of the internment camps and other relocation sites. To follow up on this report, I direct you to develop recommendations to preserve the existing Japanese American internment sites and to provide more opportunities for the public to learn about the internment. These recommendations should be developed within the next 60 days in consultation with other Federal agencies, as appropriate.
I also direct you to consult with Members of Congress, States, tribes, local officials, and other interested parties as you develop these recommendations. You should also consider expanding partnerships with private organizations and landowners and explore the creation of an interagency team to coordinate the work of Federal agencies. Your recommendations should include proposals for administrative and legislative action to help preserve these sites, within existing budget resources.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
