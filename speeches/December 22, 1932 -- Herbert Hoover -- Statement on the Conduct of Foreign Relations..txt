    THE PRESIDENT said:
"Governor Roosevelt considers that it is undesirable for him to assent to my suggestions for cooperative action on the foreign problems outlined in my recent message to Congress. I will respect his wishes.
"Situations will no doubt develop and will be dealt with by the administration as they arise, but of course no commitments will be made for the next administration.
"The correspondence between myself and Governor Roosevelt is attached hereto."
