    Today, Second Lady Karen Pence visited Base Alameda to deliver remarks and meet with over 130 Coast Guard military spouses. Mrs. Pence recognized the enduring strength of military spouses and the vital contributions they give to the Alameda military community. She was welcomed by Rear Admiral David Throop, Deputy Commander Pacific Area, U.S. Coast Guard, and introduced by his spouse, Mrs. Marina Throop.
Mrs. Pence recognized the employment challenges they face and the difficulty in having a stable career amidst the constant moves and frequent state licensure requirements. The City of Alameda is one of 12 cities in the U.S. designated as a Coast Guard City, which is designated to communities showing outstanding support for Coast Guard personnel and their families.
"Military spouses deserve great recognition, and it was an honor and privilege to provide encouragement to the spouses of Alameda," said Mrs. Pence. "They do so much for our nation and make so many sacrifices. Military spouses are greatly appreciated."To stay updated on Mrs. Pence's visits and events, follow the Second Lady on Twitter and Instagram.
