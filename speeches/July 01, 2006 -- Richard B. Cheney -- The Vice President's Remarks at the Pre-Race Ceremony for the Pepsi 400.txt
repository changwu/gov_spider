THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. It's a great day to visit Daytona. I'm honored to be with all of you, and I bring greetings to you from the President. On Independence Day weekend, we're reminded how fortunate we are to live in freedom, and to call this nation our home. (Applause.) We're grateful above all to the men and women who defend us. (Applause.) And I'd like to ask all the members of our military and all of our veterans here tonight to stand and be recognized. (Applause.) Now I want to say good luck to the drivers and the crews. Have a great race and a safe race. Thank you very much, and may God bless America. (Applause.)
