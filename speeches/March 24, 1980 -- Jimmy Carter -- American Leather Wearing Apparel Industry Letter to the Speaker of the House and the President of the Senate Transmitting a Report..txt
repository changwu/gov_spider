    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with section 203(b) (2) of the Trade Act of 1979, enclosed is a report to the Congress setting forth my determination to direct expedited consideration of adjustment assistance petitions from workers and firms in the U.S. leather wearing apparel industry and my decision that import relief is not in the national economic interest, and explaining the reasons for my decision.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
IMPORT RELIEF ACTION LEATHER WEARING APPAREL
As required under section 203 (b) (2) of the Trade Act of 1974, I am transmitting this report to Congress setting forth the action I will take with respect to import relief for leather wearing apparel. On January 24, 1980, the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) reported to me its affirmative finding on injury to the industry under section 201 of the Trade Act. As my action differs from that recommended by the USITC, I have included the reasons for my decision.
After considering all relevant aspects of the case, including those considerations set forth in section 202(c) of the Trade Act of 1974, I have determined that provision of import relief is not in the national economic interest for the following reasons:
1. Import relief would have an inflationary impact and a consumer cost that I consider unacceptable in light of the strong emphasis that this Administration is placing on its anti-inflation efforts.
2. There is serious doubt that import relief would help the domestic industry effectively adjust to compete with imports once the relief has expired.
Although relief has been denied, I have directed the Secretaries of Commerce and Labor to give expeditious consideration to any petitions for adjustment assistance filed by firms producing leather wearing apparel, by their workers, and by communities impacted by imports of such articles.
