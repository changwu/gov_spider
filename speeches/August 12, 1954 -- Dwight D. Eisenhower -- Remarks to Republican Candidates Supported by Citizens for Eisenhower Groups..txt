    IT IS A PLEASURE to greet you, gentlemen. I understand that each of you is a Republican candidate for the Congress, and that each of you is supported by the Citizens for Eisenhower groups in your respective districts.
These groups, of course, are reorganized from the groups of similar names of the 1952 Campaign. I hear they have picked you out for support because you believe in what they believe; that they are going to get behind the legislative program that has been drawn up and submitted in furtherance of the pledges made in 1952, and which still constitute the platform of this Administration, and will continue to do it until it is all enacted into law.
Now, if you people are intending to come here and help on that--and that is what I understand--then I want to say to each one of you a hearty welcome. I believe it is that kind of thing, that kind of program which will make Americans stronger at home in every way--economically, politically, spiritually. And certainly it will make us more secure abroad.
Now that, I think, is our duty to our country, and it will be a great privilege to work with all of you.
I hear I am to have the fun of shaking hands with each one of you.
