    President Trump has abandoned the people of Michigan, and there's nothing he can say on the eve of this election that can undo the damage he's caused. His failure to meet this moment — his utter inability to lead — has let this pandemic spiral out of control, crushed Michigan's economy, and left so many families barely hanging on. More than eight months into this pandemic, his Administration has simply given up and waved the white flag.
Michiganders deserve a leader who will always have their backs and never give up on them. Tomorrow, they can put an end to this President's failures, excuses, and broken promises so that we can begin the work of bringing this country together and winning the battle for the soul of our nation — but only if you vote.
