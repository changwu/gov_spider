    Mr. Prime Minister and distinguished guests, Laura and I thank you for joining us tonight, and we welcome you to the White House. This room has hosted many honored guests, and tonight it also hosts a treasured friend.
Mr. Prime Minister, our strong friendship has grown out of the strong alliance between our two nations. Japan and America share a common belief in the power of freedom to bring hope to millions who have not known it. And we share a common commitment to meet the challenges of our time and lay the foundations of peace for generations to come.
In our meetings today, you have once again demonstrated the qualities of character that both the Japanese people and the American people admire. You have an optimistic view of the world. You welcome hard work and big challenges, and you are determined that your great nation will continue to make a positive contribution to our world.
Mr. Prime Minister, more than 25 years ago, the White House welcomed another distinguished visitor who shared much in common with you. Like you, he had great hair. [Laughter] Like you, he was known to sing in public. [Laughter] And like you, he won admirers in countries far from home. That man was Elvis. [Laughter] And Laura and I are looking forward to joining you tomorrow in our visit to his home in Memphis.
But tonight, Mr. Prime Minister, it's my honor to offer a toast to you and to our friends and allies, the people of Japan.
