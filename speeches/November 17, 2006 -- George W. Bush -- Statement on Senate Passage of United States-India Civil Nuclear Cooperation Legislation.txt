    The United States and India enjoy a strategic partnership based upon common values. Today the Senate has acted to further strengthen this relationship by passing legislation that will deliver energy, nonproliferation, and trade benefits to the citizens of two great democracies.
The U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation agreement will bring India into the international nuclear nonproliferation mainstream and will increase the transparency of India's entire civilian nuclear program. As India's economy continues to grow, this partnership will help India meet its energy needs without increasing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. It will also help reduce India's dependence upon imported fossil fuels. By increasing India's demand for civil nuclear technology, fuel, and support services, this historic agreement creates new business opportunities for American companies and enhances our trade relationship.
I appreciate the Senate's leadership on this important legislation and look forward to signing this bill into law soon.
