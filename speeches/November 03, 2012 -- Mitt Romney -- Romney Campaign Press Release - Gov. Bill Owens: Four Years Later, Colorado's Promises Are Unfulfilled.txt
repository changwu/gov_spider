    Former Colorado Governor Bill Owens made the following statement on Mitt Romney's plan for real change:
"Four years ago, then-candidate Obama accepted the Democrat nomination for President right here in Denver. In doing so, he made promises to Coloradans and the nation that we have not forgotten. The promises of falling unemployment, rising income, a lower tax burden and reduced national deficit have not only been unfulfilled by the President, but have been made much worse. Our country is facing a near 8 percent unemployment rate, falling household incomes, skyrocketing taxes and a $16 trillion debt. It is clear that we cannot sustain another four years of an Obama Administration. Over the course of this campaign, voters have come to know Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan and believe they have the plan and the vision to bring real recovery, ushering in a stronger middle class and the jobs America has been waiting for. This Tuesday, a new era of leadership will be elected to Washington and Colorado voters will play a crucial role in bringing change to Washington."
