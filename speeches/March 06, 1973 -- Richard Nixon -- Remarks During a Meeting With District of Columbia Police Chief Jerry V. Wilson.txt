    I AM meeting with the Chief, incidentally, ladies and gentlemen, for two purposes. He has already given us his written report, and he is updating greatly on what he is doing in the law enforcement field, because we want to pass some of his experience on to other cities in the country who are interested in techniques which have worked here.
I am also meeting with him for the purpose of trying to prevail upon him to continue in this very arduous and important task where he is probably the most overworked, underpaid law enforcement official in the country, considering the importance of his job. I am not going to ask him to give his answer publicly here, but after I work him over, I hope he says yes. [Laughter]
CHIEF WILSON. Don't you work me over. [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT. I don't have a rubber hose. [Laughter] You don't have one either, do you?
CHIEF WILSON. Everyone gets these middle-age blahs, you know. Most people have to go to a psychiatrist, and I get to go to the President. [Laughter]
