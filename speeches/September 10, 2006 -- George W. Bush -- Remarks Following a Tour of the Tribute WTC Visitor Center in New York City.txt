    Laura and I approach tomorrow with a heavy heart. It's hard not to think about the people who lost their lives on September the 11th, 2001. You know, you see the relatives of those who still grieve—I just wish there were some way we could make them whole. So tomorrow is going to be a day of sadness for a lot of people.
It's also a day of remembrance. And I vowed that I'm never going to forget the lessons of that day. And we spent time in there looking at some of the horrific scenes—inside this fantastic place of healing—and it just reminded me that there's still an enemy out there that would like to inflict the same kind of damage again.
So tomorrow is also a day of renewing resolve. I asked—today at the church service I asked for God's blessings on—of those who continue to hurt.
Thank you.
