    Former Kansas Senator Bob Dole made the following statement on the upcoming caucuses in Kansas:
"I've known Governor Romney for some time and Kansas would be well-served if he wins in our state on Saturday.  He is a man of high standards.  He is a main street conservative and knowing the Congress as I do I believe he will have great success in working with Republicans and Democrats once he is inaugurated.
"It's also a time when Kansans have an opportunity to make a difference.  Every delegate is important because of the timing of the Kansas caucus.  Governor Romney holds a lead after winning six states on 'Super Tuesday.' If Governor Romney can do well here, he'll be much closer to his goal.  Do Kansas a favor in voting for the best candidate on Saturday, March 10.  Thank you and give Governor Romney your vote."
