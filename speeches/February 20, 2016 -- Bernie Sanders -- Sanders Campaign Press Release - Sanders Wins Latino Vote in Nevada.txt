    LAS VEGAS â€“ After trailing by as many as 50 points in Nevada, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders pulled within 4 points of former Secretary Hillary Clinton in the Nevada caucuses.
A key factor in Sanders making up so much ground in Nevada was his strong showing with Latino voters. According to entrance polls Sanders won among Latino voters by 8 points.
"What we learned today is Hillary Clinton's firewall with Latino voters is a myth," Arturo Carmona, deputy political director for Bernie 2016, said. "The Latino community responded strongly to Bernie Sanders' message of immigration reform and creating an economy that works for all families. This is critically important as we move ahead to states like Colorado, Arizona, Texas and California."
