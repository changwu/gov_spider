    Ohio Senator Mike DeWine today announced his support for GOP Presidential frontrunner Bob Dole. DeWine becomes the 28th Republican Senator to back the Senate Majority Leader. DeWine, who formerly served as Lieutenant Governor under Governor George Voinovich, was elected to the Senate as part of the Republican landslide of 1994.
"Bob Dole has been a leader in the fight to bring real conservative change to Washington," said DeWine, "The people of Ohio want a President who is committed to restoring the 10th amendment and returning power to the states. A Dole administration will mean lower taxes and less regulation -- the kind of changes so important to Ohio voters."
"It's an honor to have Mike's support," welcomed Dole. "Since his election last year, Mike has been an integral force in bringing commonsense conservative reform to Washington. Our mission in this election is to complete the Republican revolution voters demanded in 1994. We need to reconnect the federal government with the values of the American people, reassert America's leadership abroad and return power where it belongs -- the states and the people."
Dole remains the hands-down favorite, to win the GOP Presidential nomination. The most recent national surveys show Dole leading the Republican field by a huge margin and as the only GOP candidate with the support to beat President Clinton. The latest CNN/USA Today poll shows Dole leading the Republican field with 55% of the vote -- 43 percentage points ahead of his newest rival. The same survey showed Dole beating Clinton in a head-to-head match-up.
Ohio will send 67 delegates to the Republican National Convention next August.
