    Today, Governor Walker released the following statement on President Obama's trip to Kenya and Ethiopia:
"Sadly, like many of President Obama's policies toward Africa, his visit to the continent is only symbolic. His and Secretary Clinton's approach to Africa has lacked the strategic vision and consistent engagement needed to achieve progress and stability in the region. As epidemics like Ebola and the spread of radical Islamic terrorism demonstrate, the U.S. needs a new policy.
"The next President must treat Africa as an opportunity. After decades of conflict and poverty, African countries are showing signs of promise. We should focus on helping these countries fully embrace democracy and reduce rampant corruption. In the face of increasing evidence of China's often-exploitative involvement on the continent, America has to compete for political and economic influence in this part of the world. We must also provide the leadership needed to resolve Africa's long-running conflicts and work with governments in the region to help them combat terrorist groups like Boko Haram and al-Shabaab that have pledged loyalty to ISIS and al-Qaeda."
