SCRIPT - "Conventional"
We are a beacon of light around the world. At least that's what we can be again. That's what we should be again.
When we break out of the conventional thinking and we start reaching out to friend and foe alike, then I am absolutely confident that we can restore America's leadership in the world.
We're going to lead with our values and our ideals by deed and by example. I want to go before the world and say America's back. America is back.
