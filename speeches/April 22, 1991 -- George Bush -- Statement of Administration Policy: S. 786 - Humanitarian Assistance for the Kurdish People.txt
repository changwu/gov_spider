    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Moynihan (D) New York and 21 others)
The Administration believes S. 786 is premature. On April 16, 1991, the President announced an expansion of Operation Provide Comfort, which has become the largest U.S. relief effort mounted in modern military history. This effort was undertaken using existing authorities, which are sufficient to provide assistance to the Kurdish people at this time. In addition, the Administration is in the midst of a detailed and expedited review to identify what further assistance may be required and what legislation, if any, is necessary.
