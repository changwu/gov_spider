    SAN ANTONIO, TX (December 18, 2019) – Following the House vote to impeach Donald Trump, presidential candidate, former Obama Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Mayor of San Antonio, Texas, Julián Castro reacted with the following statement:
"Mitch McConnell has already said he's "not an impartial juror" and is in cahoots with the White House. He should recuse himself, and the Senate should do its constitutional duty. Remove Donald Trump from office."
Earlier in the day, Secretary Castro tweeted about the vote, "Today Congress must put patriotism over politics, hold this president accountable for his actions, and send a message that no one is above the law. The evidence is clear. Donald Trump violated his oath of office and abused his power. Impeach him."
The House vote came on the first article of impeachment, abuse of power and a second article of impeachment, obstruction of Congress. Secretary Castro was the second candidate to deliver a reaction, via Twitter, following Senator Bernie Sanders.
