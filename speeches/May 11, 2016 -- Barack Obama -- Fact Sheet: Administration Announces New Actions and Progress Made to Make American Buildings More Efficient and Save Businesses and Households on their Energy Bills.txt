President Obama is committed to taking commonsense actions to reduce carbon pollution and save taxpayers money on their energy bills. Cutting energy and water waste not only drives carbon reductions, but creates a stronger building infrastructure, improves community resilience, and spurs American job growth. Through President Obama's Better Buildings Initiative, the Department of Energy is partnering with leading organizations in every state across the country to drive increased investment in energy efficiency and overcome the barriers that prevent many organizations and consumers from capturing these benefits. Over the last five years, Better Buildings partners and energy savings have more than tripled.
Today there are more than 750 organizations engaged in the Better Buildings Initiative, which brings together leaders across the residential, education and business sectors to engage in ambitious energy goal setting and solution-sharing programs. Through their commitments to efficiency, all of these partners are helping better position the U.S. to combat climate change, make our businesses most competitive, and ensure efficiency provides a lasting strategy for enhancing resilience of our nation's building infrastructure and communities. But the Administration continues to look for new opportunities reduce carbon pollution and save consumers money on their energy bills.
That is why, today, the U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz and the U.S. Secretary for Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro are announcing new commitments and progress updates on innovation-driven solutions shared by Better Buildings partners at the third Better Buildings Summit. Today's announcements include:
Ø Launching three new programs in collaboration with 50 states, communities, and organizations to improve the resilience of our buildings, increase energy efficiency in low income communities, and make our wastewater systems more efficient.
Ø Announcing 17 businesses, states, and cities achieved Better Buildings challenge goals four years early by improving the efficiency of their buildings or water systems by 20 percent or more.
Ø Announcing 32 new cities, universities, K-12 school districts, multifamily housing organizations, and manufacturers committed to achieve 20 percent in energy savings by 2020 - altogether representing 300 million square feet.

In 2011, 60 organizations representing almost two billion square feet of commercial and industrial building space took the Better Buildings Challenge to improve the efficiency of their building portfolios by 20 percent or more, and the financial community committed to almost $2 billion in energy efficiency financing. As Better Buildings Challenge partners continue to increase in reach and numbers, the program grows stronger, with more energy efficiency commitments and influence than ever before. Since the Better Buildings Challenge was launched, the program has:
• Catalyzed more than $10 billion in public and private sector financing commitments to improve energy efficiency.
• Expanded the partners working to improve the energy efficiency of buildings from 60 to 750 organizations, including 310 organizations representing 4.2 billion square feet - which is equivalent to 73,000 football fields - that have stepped up to the Better Buildings Challenge to improve their energy efficiency at least 20 percent in five years.
• Saved businesses and communities $1.3 billion dollars total savings on their energy bills.
• Avoided 10 million tons of avoided carbon emissions and 160 trillion BTUs of energy.
• Saved 2.1 billion gallons of water in 2015 alone.
• Contributed proven approaches with over 400 solutions shared online in the Better Buildings Solutions Center.
