    THE PRESIDENT has been following closely the reports from Rapid City, and is deeply distressed at the loss of life and the widespread destruction. He has directed General Lincoln, the Director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness, to keep personally in touch with the situation and to ensure that all appropriate help is given. The President feels that the hearts of Americans everywhere will go out to the families of those who have been lost, to those who have been left homeless, and to the many others who have suffered from this sudden and terrible disaster.
