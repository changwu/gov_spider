"The people of New Hampshire are serious about their role in the nominating process. I know that because our organizers are talking to voters every single day about the issues that matter to them. Whether it's equal pay, more secure retirement or affordable health care, the people of New Hampshire will go to the polls Tuesday and vote for the candidate they believe will fight for them. To repeatedly suggest otherwise is an insult to voters in the Granite State."
