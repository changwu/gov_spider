    I have decided to sign S. 233, which authorizes appropriations for the United States Travel Service.
At the beginning of the year I recommended that the Service be eliminated, for its function can and should be performed by the private sector. I have not changed my view.
I have signed S. 233, however, because the appropriations for the Travel Service have already been enacted as part of a separate bill. I will work to restructure the Federal Government's travel program in order to conform its operation with what I believe to be an appropriate Federal role in tourism promotion.
