    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 9/24/92)(House)(Sen. Simon (D) IL and 12 others)
The Administration supports S. 1530, but will seek, during further congressional consideration of the bill, amendments to ensure project accountability. Specifically, the Administration will seek amendments that: (1) require each demonstration project to describe specific, measurable goals; (2) include exact, meaningful standards for Federal review and approval of projects; and (3) provide for the termination of projects that do not make acceptable progress toward meeting their stated goals.
Scoring for the Purpose of PAYGO and Discretionary Caps
S. 1530 could increase direct spending; therefore, it would be subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is that it would have a zero PAYGO effect.
