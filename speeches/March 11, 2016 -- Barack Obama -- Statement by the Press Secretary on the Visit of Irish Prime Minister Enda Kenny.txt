    President Obama will welcome Prime Minister (Taoiseach) Enda Kenny of Ireland to the White House on Tuesday, March 15th, to celebrate St. Patrick's Day and to discuss issues of mutual concern. The United States and Ireland enjoy a strong relationship; deep cultural, historic, and people-to-people bonds; and a shared commitment to advancing global peace, security, and prosperity. In the morning, the Vice President will host the Taoiseach for breakfast at the Naval Observatory, and the President and Vice President will meet with the Taoiseach in the Oval Office. That afternoon, the President will host a reception to celebrate his eighth St. Patrick's Day at the White House. During the reception, the President and Taoiseach will participate in the annual Shamrock ceremony started by President Truman. Also on March 15th, the Vice President will meet with First Minister Arlene Foster and deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness of Northern Ireland at the White House to discuss the Stormont House and Fresh Start agreements and progress being made toward building a peaceful and prosperous future for the people of Northern Ireland. St. Patrick's Day is being celebrated at the White House early this year as the Taoiseach must attend an important European Council meeting in Brussels on March 17th.
