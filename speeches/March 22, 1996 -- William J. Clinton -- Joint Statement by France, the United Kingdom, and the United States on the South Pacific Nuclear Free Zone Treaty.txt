    The governments of the French Republic, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America will sign on Monday, March 25, 1996 the three additional protocols to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, which is also known as the Treaty of Rarotonga.
Last year's NPT Review and Extension Conference agreed that internationally recognized nuclear weapon free zones, based on arrangements freely arrived at among the states of the region concerned, enhance international peace and security. The Conference also agreed that the cooperation of all the nuclear weapon states and their respect and support for the relevant protocols is necessary for the maximum effectiveness of such zones and the relevant protocols.
Our decision to sign the protocols to the Treaty of Rarotonga demonstrates our clear support for a nuclear weapon free zone in the South Pacific.
It is also an important further milestone in demonstrating our commitment to nuclear nonproliferation.
It underlines our wish to see a permanent end to nuclear testing throughout the world. It will give a further boost to the negotiations for a comprehensive test ban treaty, which we believe should be completed in the first half of 1996.
