    Today I have signed into law H.R. 2295, the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, which includes $2.5 billion in assistance for Russia and the other new independent states of the former Soviet Union. I am grateful for the bipartisan cooperation by the leadership and many other members of Congress who acted quickly to pass this package of assistance.
Enactment of this bill marks a major advance in our strategy to enlarge the world's free community of market democracies.
This bill also contains vital support for Israel and Egypt and other measures related to the Middle East peace process. The Congress's timely passage of these provisions, soon after the dramatic advances of the past few weeks, shows our Nation's commitment to peace in the Middle East.
The elements of the bill supporting Russia, Ukraine, Armenia, and the other new independent states include: the U.S. contribution for a multilateral Special Privatization and Restructuring Program, a G-7 initiative that will support the privatization of large Russian enterprises; financing for joint projects in the energy and environmental sectors, including programs to increase the safety of nuclear reactors; expansion of the President's Democracy Corps initiative begun at the Vancouver Summit; and humanitarian assistance for those parts of the former Soviet Union where food and medicines are still desperately needed.
Recent events in Moscow highlight the urgency of helping Russia and the other states of the former Soviet Union sustain the momentum of democratic and economic reform. This bill makes a solid investment in our own national security and prosperity, enabling us to reduce the amount we spend for national defense while offering a hand of partnership to former adversaries who are making the difficult transition to the institutions of market democracy.
