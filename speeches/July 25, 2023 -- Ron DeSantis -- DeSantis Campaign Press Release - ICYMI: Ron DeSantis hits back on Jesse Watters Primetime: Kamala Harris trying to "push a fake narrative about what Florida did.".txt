On VP Kamala Harris' fake narrative about Florida's education curriculum:
"Well, she hopped on that plane very quickly on Friday to come down to Florida to spew this hoax. She wasn't going down to the border to actually do the job there to secure it. She wasn't working on all the cities that are decaying because of Soros-backed prosecutors. She's not worried about the military running low on ammo and weapons stocks. No, she's here to try to push a fake narrative about what Florida did. The interesting thing about this is, Florida eliminated critical race theory from our K-12 schools. We've got to stop indoctrinating kids in this country, and we can't be teaching them to hate America. But in that bill, we were accused of not wanting to teach African American history. [The bill] actually required that that be done, including talking about racial discrimination, and these standards really were born out of that. These are very thorough standards done by African American history scholars. There is no agenda here. It is just the truth. And they talk in gory detail a lot of the bad in American history, including, of course, the injustice of slavery. But she is trying to perpetuate a hoax, and I know they're using it to attack me because Biden's administration and Harris have been attacking me since they got in office and they [are] always attacking Florida, but they're really impugning the work of people like Dr. Allen, who were not involved politically, were just trying to do a good job and produce really robust standards." _
