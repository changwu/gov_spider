Conservative writer John Hinderaker was one of the first writers at Powerline Blog back in 2002. (Their work helped bring down Dan Rather over falsely reporting on President Bush's military service.)
Now, Hinderaker has made his pick for President:
For president in 2016, I support Marco Rubio. Here's why: https://t.co/dEA7K1poHP @powerlineus #tcot @marcorubio

His four big reasons for backing Marco. 
1. He's conservative:
If elected, Rubio would be the most conservative president since Calvin Coolidge. He is squarely in the tradition of Ronald Reagan's three-legged stool: foreign policy, the economy and social issues.
2. He understands foreign policy:
Marco Rubio is, in my opinion, as knowledgeable about foreign policy as anyone in Washington. I have interviewed him on foreign policy topics numerous times, and the breadth and depth of his knowledge is impressive.
3. He can beat Hillary Clinton:
Marco Rubio has, I think, the ability, unique in the current crop of Republican candidates, to reach out to the broader electorate and bring new voters into the Republican orbit.
4. And he has good character:
But who follows a pessimistic leader? No one. Rubio's vision of America's future is always positive, always optimistic, always inclusive, never spiteful or divisive. In this, too, he stands in Ronald Reagan's big shoes.
John, the rest of us at Team Marco couldn't agree more. Thanks for the strong endorsement!
