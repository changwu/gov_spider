    (SAN FRANCISCO, August 30, 2019) â€” Today, presidential candidate for the Democratic nomination Tom Steyer released the following statement on the Democratic National Committee decision to reject plans to hold virtual caucuses in Iowa and Nevada. The virtual caucuses were proposed by the states in order to enable absentee voter participation.
"I am extremely disappointed in the DNC's decision to reject plans to hold virtual caucuses, and I stand shoulder to shoulder with Iowans and Nevadans who want their votes to be counted in such an important election. Virtual caucuses would also make participation easier for parents who can't afford childcare and workers juggling two jobs and night shifts. Democrats should rally behind ideas that increase voter participation, not suppress them. I call on the DNC to reconsider their decision and work with officials in both states to come up with a plan that guarantees security while expanding voter participation."
