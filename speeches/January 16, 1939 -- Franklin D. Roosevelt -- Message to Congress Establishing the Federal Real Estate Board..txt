    To the Congress:
At a meeting of the National Emergency Council held December 17, 1935, I designated the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Acting Director of the Bureau of the Budget to serve as a committee to make a study of Federal ownership of real estate and of its bearing on State and local taxation. This study has been completed and I am transmitting herewith for your information, and such further use as you may deem desirable, the report of the committee and the accompanying tables and charts.
It will be noted that the report concludes with the following recommendations:
(1) That all branches of the Federal Service be directed to declare completely, accurately and promptly their surplus land and improvements in order that a prudent use for such properties may be found or that they may be offered for sale. (2) That the Procurement Division of the Treasury Department continue to maintain a current permanent record of all Federal real estate in order that there may be constantly on file available and dependable information with respect thereto.(3) That there should be constituted a Federal Real Estate Board composed of a representative from each of the governmental agencies in charge of considerable holdings of Federal income-producing property, a representative from the Procurement Division, and a representative from the Bureau Of the Budget. The duty of this Board should be to study and make recommendations regarding the situation existing in individual communities adversely affected by the purchase of substantial amounts of land and their consequent removal from the regular tax rolls of the county or other taxing district; to advise with Federal agencies contemplating the acquisition of additional real estate; and to submit recommendations regarding the disposition of lands that are essentially in the nature of surplus property.
I have approved of the recommendations of the committee and, in order to put them into effect, I have issued an appropriate Executive Order establishing the Federal Real Estate Board, and providing for the maintenance by the Procurement Division, Treasury Department, of a current record of all Federal real estate. I am enclosing herewith a copy of this Executive Order.
