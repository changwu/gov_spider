    Helena, MT – Following billionaire Tom Steyer's qualification for the DNC debates in October after spending $12 million on advertising in his first six weeks, Montana Governor Steve Bullock released the following statement:
"At this point, there isn't much left to be said regarding a set of rules that have allowed a billionaire to bankroll his way onto the debate stage, while Governors and Senators with decades of public service experience have been forced out of the race," said Montana Governor Steve Bullock. "This process is failing Democrats and does nothing to help us beat Donald Trump next November. People deserve a democratic process that elevates candidates based on the strength of their experience and ideas — not the size of their bank accounts. At the end of the day, this race is going to be decided by voters on the ground and not party leaders in Washington. I will continue taking my case directly to the voters as we fight for a fair shot for every American."
