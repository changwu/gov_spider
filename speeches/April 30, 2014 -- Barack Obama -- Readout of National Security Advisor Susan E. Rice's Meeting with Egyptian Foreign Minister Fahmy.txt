    Today, National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice met with Egyptian Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy to discuss Egypt's political transition and regional security issues. Ambassador Rice reaffirmed U.S. support for Egypt and underscored our commitment to maintain cooperation on shared security interests such as countering extremism and maintaining regional stability. She also reiterated our deep, growing concerns about recent developments in Egypt, including the mass trials and death sentences handed down this week, the continued detention of journalists and activists, and ongoing restrictions on freedoms of expression, assembly, and association. The United States values its relationship with the Egyptian people and will continue to support a transition to democracy that respects their rights, and enables the stability and success of the Egyptian government.
