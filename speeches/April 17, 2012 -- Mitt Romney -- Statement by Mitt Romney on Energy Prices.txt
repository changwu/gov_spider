    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on President Obama's failure to lower energy prices:
"President Obama's government by gimmick is reaching another new low today. While American families struggle to pay gas prices that have doubled on his watch, the President's only solutions are to target oil and gas producers for higher taxes and now to dramatically increase federal regulation. These policies will do nothing to reduce energy prices, expand domestic production, or strengthen the American economy. And they will not distract the American people from the President's consistent record of sacrificing America's energy future to appease the environmental extremists in the Democratic Party."
