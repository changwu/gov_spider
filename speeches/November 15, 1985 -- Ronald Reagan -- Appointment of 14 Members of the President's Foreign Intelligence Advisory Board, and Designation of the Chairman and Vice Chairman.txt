    The President today announced his intention to appoint 14 members to the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) for 2-year terms. The Board was recently reconstituted by the President on October 28, 1985, by Executive Order 12537. The most significant change in the new Board is that it establishes a limit of 14 members. The existing PFIAB, with 21 members, had grown to a size that made it difficult to carry out its advisory responsibilities.
The PFIAB is a permanent, nonpartisan body of distinguished Americans who perform a continuing and objective review of the performance of the intelligence community. The Board reports directly to the President and has full access to all information necessary to advise the President on the conduct, management, and coordination of the various agencies of the intelligence community.
The PFIAB (then known as the Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Activities) was first established by President Eisenhower in 1956. The Board was continued by each President thereafter until its termination in 1977 by President Carter. The PFIAB was reconstituted by the President on October 20, 1981, by Executive Order 12331.
