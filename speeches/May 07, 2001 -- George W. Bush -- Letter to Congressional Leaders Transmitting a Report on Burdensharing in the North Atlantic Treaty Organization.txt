    Dear Mr. Chairman:
Pursuant to section 3(2)(B) of the Senate's resolution of April 30, 1998, providing its advice and consent to ratification of the Protocols on the Accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949, I hereby transmit to you the report concerning NATO membership, burdensharing in the Alliance, and other matters.
The report is comprised of two sections that provide the required information to the extent that such information is available. An unclassified section covering common NATO budgets, national defense budgets, costs incurred to date in connection with the membership of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, and the status of discussions concerning NATO membership for Partnership for Peace countries. A separate, confidential section covers NATO members' capabilities to deploy and sustain combat forces and the adequacy of European defense budgets to meet the requirements of NATO force goals and capabilities initiatives.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
