    Today, I have signed into law S. 756, the "First Step Act of 2018" (the "Act").
A new 18 U.S.C. Section 3634(4)(C), added by section 101(a) of the Act, purports to require the Attorney General to submit to the Congress an annual report that includes discussion of legal authorities useful or necessary to achieve certain goals. My Administration will treat this provision in a manner consistent with Article II, section 3 of the Constitution, which provides the President the discretion to recommend to the Congress only "such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient."
