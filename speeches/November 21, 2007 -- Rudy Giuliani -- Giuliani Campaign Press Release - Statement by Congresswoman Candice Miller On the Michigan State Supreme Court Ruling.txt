    Congresswoman Candice Miller, Mayor Rudy Giuliani's Michigan State Chair, made the following statement today regarding the Michigan Supreme Court's decision to allow a January 15 primary vote in the state:
"The state Supreme Court ruling is welcome news that rightly upholds the prominent role Michigan voters deserve in choosing our next President. Rudy Giuliani continues to be the only Republican candidate who can compete and win in Michigan on both January 15 and November 4."
