    Middle East Peace Process
Q. What's your message for Chairman Arafat this morning, Mr. President?
The President. Well, first of all, I'm delighted to start this trip with President Mubarak. After all, Egypt has been the leader in the peace process all the way and has set a standard for many years now and has helped all the parties, including the United States, to pursue this peace process.
I'm looking forward to having a chance to talk with the President. And then we're going to talk with Chairman Arafat about what we can do to keep the process going and the importance of condemning terrorism and working together to go forward.
Q. Do you have any ideas on the subject?
The President. A few. We'll be talking about it.
Have you been to sleep, Helen [Helen Thomas, United Press International]? Have you all had any sleep?
Q. No.
