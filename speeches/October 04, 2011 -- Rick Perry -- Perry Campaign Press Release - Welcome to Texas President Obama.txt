AUSTIN - With President Obama set to arrive shortly, the Perry campaign is welcoming him to Texas with the video, "Jobs 101."


"If President Obama was serious about job creation, he would use the Texas model of low taxes and limited government that has created almost forty percent of all jobs in America since June 2009," said Perry spokesman Mark Miner. "Billions of dollars in spending is not the answer to turning around the nation's economic troubles created by the President."
