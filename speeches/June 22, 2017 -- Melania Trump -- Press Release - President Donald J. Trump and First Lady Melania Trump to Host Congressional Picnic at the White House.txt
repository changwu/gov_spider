    President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are pleased to host their first Congressional Picnic on the South Lawn of the White House this evening at 6:00 p.m.
Vice President and Mrs. Pence will join the First Family in welcoming Members of Congress and their families for a bipartisan evening of music and traditional picnic fare. The theme, Picnic in the Park, is modeled after a summer evening in Central Park in New York.
"My husband and I are pleased to welcome Members of Congress and their families to the people's house. I look forward to an evening together that will highlight our New York home by bringing a piece of New York City to Washington, D.C.," said First Lady Melania Trump. "With the recent and tragic shooting at the Congressional baseball game practice last week, it is more important than ever that we spend time together not as politicians, but as colleagues and friends. We will continue to keep Congressman Scalise, his family, and all who were injured in our thoughts and prayers as we come together tonight united through this unthinkable tragedy."
The Congressional Picnic is an annual bipartisan event that began under President Reagan. In years past, first families select themes that pay homage to their home states.
This year's picnic will include racing sailboats in the South Lawn Fountain, as well as a carousel. The full United States Marine orchestra will perform and President Trump will make remarks. The menu will consist of traditional picnic fare.
