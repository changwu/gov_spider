    By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including Section 1 of the International Organizations Immunities Act (59 Stat. 669; 22 U.S.C. 288), and having found that the United States participates in the World Tourism Organization as a party to the Statutes of the World Tourism Organization (27 UST 2211, TIAS 8307), I hereby designate the World Tourism Organization as a public international organization entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred by the International Organizations Immunities Act. This designation is not intended to abridge in any respect privileges, exemptions or immunities that such organization may have acquired or may acquire by international agreements or by Congressional action.
