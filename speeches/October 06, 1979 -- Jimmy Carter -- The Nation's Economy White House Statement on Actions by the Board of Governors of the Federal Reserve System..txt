    The administration believes that the actions decided upon today by the Federal Reserve Board will help reduce inflationary expectations, contribute to a stronger U.S. dollar abroad, and curb
unhealthy speculations in commodity markets.
Recent high rates of inflation, led by surging oil prices, other economic data, as well as developments in commodity and foreign exchange markets, have reinforced the administration's conviction that fighting inflation remains the Nation's number one economic priority.
The administration will continue to emphasize a policy of budgetary restraint. Enactment of effective national energy legislation to reduce dependence on foreign oil is vital to long-term success in this effort.
The administration believes that success in reducing inflationary pressures will lead in due course both to lower rates of price increases and to lower interest rates.
