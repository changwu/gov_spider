    Davenport, Iowa â€” Bachmann for President Press Secretary Alice Stewart issued the following statement in response to comments by the Pawlenty campaign that there is very little difference between Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann and former Governor Tim Pawlenty:
"Governor Pawlenty would have us believe that there is 'very little difference' between his positions and those of Michele Bachmann.
"But in fact, there is very little difference between Governor Pawlenty's past positions and Barack Obama's positions on several critical issues facing Americans. On issues such as unconstitutional healthcare mandates, climate change regulations, and Wall Street bailouts, there's very little daylight, indeed, between Governor Pawlenty's record and the Obama administration's policies.
"And of course, President Obama would surely applaud Governor Pawlenty's 2006 statement that the 'era of small government is over,' and that the government will have to be 'more proactive and more aggressive.'
"Governor Pawlenty has changed his positions in recent years, but he can't run from his big government record as governor of Minnesota that left the state's budget in a multi-billion dollar mess. That's not executive experience we need.
"As Michele Bachmann said earlier today, she 'has a lifetime record of success and action in the real world. Real-world actions speak louder than his words as a career politician.' And so the more Republican voters examine Michele Bachmann's record and Governor Pawlenty's record, the more they will see that there is a world of difference between the two."
