    YOU'RE so much in our thoughts that an expression like this is hardly necessary. Millions of Americans who regard you with such high affection and respect, joined by millions of people throughout the world who share that feeling, are saying, "Get well, Mr. President."
LADY BIRD AND LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[The Honorable Dwight Eisenhower, Fort Gordon Army Hospital, Augusta, Georgia]
