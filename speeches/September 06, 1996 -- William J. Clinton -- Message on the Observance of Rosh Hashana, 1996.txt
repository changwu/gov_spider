    Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Rosh Hashana in this season of redemption and renewal.
On this holy occasion, the resonant sound of the shofar summons Jews around the world to remember and reflect upon the triumphs and tragedies of the previous year. This call, celebrating the year 5757, asks all of us, Jews and non-Jews alike, to reassess and appraise our lives and to seek deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us. During this time of introspection, Jews pray for a sweet new year, symbolized by dipping bread and fruit in honey.
In this age of possibility and promise, let all who celebrate this holiday work to strengthen the bonds that tie person to person, neighbor to neighbor, and community to community. As we continue our efforts to broaden and strengthen the fragile Middle East peace, let us pray for a brighter world for our children.
Best wishes for a joyous Rosh Hashana and for a healthy and peaceful new year.
