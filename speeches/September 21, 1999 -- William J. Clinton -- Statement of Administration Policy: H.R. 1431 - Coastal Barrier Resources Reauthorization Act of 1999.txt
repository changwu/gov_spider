    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Saxton (R) New Jersey)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1431.
The Administration understands that the managers of H.R. 1431 will introduce an amendment that would: (1) authorize annual appropriations of $2 million to implement the Coastal Barrier Resources Act; and (2) adopt a series of maps, dated July 1, 1999, that make certain technical corrections, including the designation of approximately 3,000 acres of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore as an otherwise protected area. The Administration would support such an amendment.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 1431 would affect direct spending, therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is that it would increase direct spending by less than $500,000 per year. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
