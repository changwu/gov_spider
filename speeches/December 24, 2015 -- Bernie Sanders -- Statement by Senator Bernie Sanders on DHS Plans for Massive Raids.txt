    BURLINGTON, Vt. â€“ U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders issued the following statement Thursday regarding plans of the Department of Homeland Security for immigration agents to start large-scale raids to deport families who have fled violence in Central America:
"I am very disturbed by reports that the government may commence raids to deport families who have fled here to escape violence in Central America. As we spend time with our families this holiday season, we who are parents should ask ourselves what we would do if our children faced the danger and violence these children do? How far would we go to protect them?
"Our nation has always been a beacon of hope, a refuge for the oppressed. We cannot turn our backs on that essential element of who we are as a nation. We need to take steps to protect children and families seeking refuge here, not cast them out."
