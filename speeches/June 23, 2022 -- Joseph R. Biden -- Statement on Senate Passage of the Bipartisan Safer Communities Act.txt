    Tonight, after 28 years of inaction, bipartisan Members of Congress came together to heed the call of families across the country and passed legislation to address the scourge of gun violence in our communities. Families in Uvalde and Buffalo—and too many tragic shootings before—have demanded action. And tonight we acted.
This bipartisan legislation will help protect Americans. Kids in schools and communities will be safer because of it. The House of Representatives should promptly vote on this bipartisan bill and send it to my desk.
