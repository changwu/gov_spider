    ARLINGTON, VA -- McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds today issued the following statement on Senator Barack Obama's refusal to personally condemn Senator Rockefeller's smear on John McCain's character and military record:
"Why does Senator Obama refuse to personally condemn this type of despicable attack? Senator Obama has run for president on the basis that he represents a new kind of politics, yet every day there is another smear that Obama refuses to repudiate." 
Background On Senator Rockefeller's Attack:
Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) Today: "McCain was a fighter pilot, who dropped laser-guided missiles from 35,000 feet. He was long gone when they hit. What happened when they [the missiles] get to the ground? He doesn't know. You have to care about the lives of people. McCain never gets into those issues." (Paul J. Nyden, "Jay Defends Endorsement Of Sen. Obama," The Charleston Gazette , 4/8/08)
