    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit herewith the Eighth Report of the United States Sinai Support Mission. It covers the Mission's activities during the six-month period ending October 1, 1979. This Report is provided to the Congress in conformity with Section 4 of the Public Law 94-110 of October 13, 1975.
The Peace Treaty which Egypt and Israel signed in Washington on March 26, 1979 calls for the United States to continue monitoring responsibilities in the Sinai until January 25, 1980, when Israeli armed forces withdraw from areas east of the Giddi and Mitla Passes. This mission will be completed on schedule.
Trilateral talks in Washington on September 18 and 19 resulted in tentative agreement for the United States, using the Sinai Field Mission, to verify force levels specified in Annex I of the Treaty, in the area of the Sinai west of the Interim Buffer Zone. Administration officials have been in touch with appropriate Congressional committees on various aspects of the U.S. undertaking and will provide Congress with all agreements and understandings to which the United States is a party.
This year's funding of the Sinai Support Mission is authorized under Chapter 6, Part II of the Foreign Assistance Act, "Peacekeeping Operations." A request has been made to Congress to restore $6.1 million of the Sinai Support Mission funds for FY 1980, to cover anticipated outlays associated with the new U.S. undertaking in the Sinai.
The American peacekeeping initiative in the Sinai has been highly successful. I know the Congress will continue its support of the Mission, as part of United States efforts to meet our goal of permanent peace in the Middle East.
