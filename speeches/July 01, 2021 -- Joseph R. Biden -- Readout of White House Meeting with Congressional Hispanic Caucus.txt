    Today, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese met with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) to discuss the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework and the President's legislative priorities. During a productive meeting, Deese and members of the CHC spoke about how elements of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework, including investing in clean drinking water, public transit, and high speed internet, would directly benefit the Latino community. Deese underscored the President's two-track strategy and commitment to the rest of his agenda being pursued in the budget resolution and a reconciliation bill, and thanked the members for being partners in the fight to advance racial equity in underserved communities.
