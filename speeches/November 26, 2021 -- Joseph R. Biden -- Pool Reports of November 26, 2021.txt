He said the recommendation was to start the ban Monday, rather than right away.

Travel Pool report #9 - Tree Lighting
Apologies folks I sent two reports labeled #6. Fixing the numbers here.
The rain has cleared somewhat and it is sprinkling and and cold now. The tree is at the top of a cobblestone street. The crowd, behind barricades, stretches deep down the street and some people are watching from store windows.
The President arrived at 4:55 PM. He and his family are off to one side behind a barricade.
At 5 pm the town crier - in a top hat and coat with tails - rang a bell and a chorus in Santa hats sang Joy to the World and the First Noel. An official from the local Chamber of the Commerce said it was the 47th tree lighting.
At 5:06 PM the town crier led a count from 10 to zero and the tree lit up with colored lights and a white star on top. The Bidens applauded. The President and First Lady stood close together. Hunter and baby Beau joined them.
The chorus sang Deck the Halls, Oh Come all Ye Faithful, Silent Night, We Three Kings and Oh Christmas Tree. Some of the Bidens appeared to sing along to Jingle Bells.
At 5:20 PM the ceremony concluded. Biden came up to the barricade to greet the town crier. The chorus also came over and he took a photo. At 5:23 PM they moved us to the press bus.
At 5:26 PM we are rolling.

Travel Pool Report #11 - More Gaggle 
Here are some fuller quotes from the gaggle earlier. Please check against official transcript:
On the variant:
"We're going to be cautious, make sure there is no travel to and from South Africa and six other countries in that region. Except for American citizens who are able to come back. We don't know a lot about the variant except that it is of great concern. It seems to spread rapidly. I spent about a half hour this morning with my COVID team led by Dr. Fauci and that was the decision we made.
Markets dropping:
Said it was "expected."
The Ban going into effect Monday:
"That was the recommendation coming from my medical team."
Do bans de-incentivize info sharing from other countries:
"That's ridiculous. Because you can't hide the variants."
Should Americans be concerned about the variant:
"Here's the deal. Every American that has not been vaccinated, should be responsible and be vaccinated from age five years and up, number one. Number two, everyone eligible for the booster shot, should get the booster shot immediately upon being eligible. That is a minimum that everyone should be doing. And you know, we always talk about whether this is about freedom and I think it's a patriotic responsibility."
On the Fed and Inflation:
"I've talked to the Fed about a whole range of things from monetary policy to inflation and I have confidence that the appointees that I've made, and I'm going to have three more, are going to reflect that.
Situation in Ukraine:
"I am concerned. Look, we support Ukraine's territorial integrity. We support Ukraine's ability to govern itself."
WIll you talk to Zelensky or Putin: "In all probability."
