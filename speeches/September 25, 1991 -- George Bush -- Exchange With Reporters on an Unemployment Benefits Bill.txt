    Q. Mr. President, are you going to do anything about the stand off in Iraq?
The President. This is a photo op today, a serious one with no questions.
Senator Dole. We guessed right, though.
Q. How about on the unemployment legislation? Are you going to be able to turn around the veto?
The President. We've got a very good proposal on unemployment. And it extends benefits, and it's paid for. And we're not going to give up on that approach. We call it the Dole Substitute, I call it the Dole Bill, and it's got very strong support by good, thinking people. And I support it. And yes, we want to help people, but also we want to see that what we do is fiscally sound. And that's what this approach is all about.
Q. Are you going to be able to turn around the veto override?
The President. We'll cross those bridges when we get to them.
