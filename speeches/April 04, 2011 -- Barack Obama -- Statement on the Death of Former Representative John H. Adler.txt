    Michelle and I were deeply saddened to learn of the premature passing of former Congressman John Adler today.
John was a dedicated public servant who fought tirelessly for the people of New Jersey for more than two decades. John always stood by his principles and served with an unwavering energy for the causes he believed in: creating jobs, providing tax relief for New Jersey families, and standing up for seniors and veterans.
Our hearts and prayers go out to John's wife Shelley and his sons Jeffrey, Alex, Andrew, and Oliver. John was taken from us far too soon, and he will be greatly missed.
