    I welcome the news that Slavko Dokmanovic, an indicted war criminal, has been apprehended by investigators for the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), working with the UN Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES). Dokmanovic was one of a group of suspected war criminals who are under sealed indictment. He has been transported to The Hague. He will stand trial there for his role in the beatings and executions of Croatian soldiers and civilians taken from a hospital in Vukovar in November 1991.
I congratulate the ICTY and UNTAES on their successful apprehension. The United States continues to support fully the work of the Tribunal to bring indicted war criminals to justice. Cooperation with the Tribunal by all the parties is a cornerstone of the Dayton accords.
