    DUBUQUE, Iowa – Barnstorming through eastern Iowa, Bernie Sanders drew 1,300 supporters to a Friday night rally at the Grand River Event Center here where he delivered an impassioned message about how to cure the country's rigged economy propped up by a corrupt campaign finance system.
Sanders' Friday began with a pep talk for volunteers in Mount Pleasant and included stops in Washington, Muscatine and Davenport as part of a weekend flurry of meetings ahead of Monday's precinct caucuses.
"Are you ready for a radical idea?" Sanders asked the Dubuque audience. "Together we are going to create an economy that works for working families, not just the 1 percent."
The crowds on Friday pushed to 62,866 the total turnout at Sanders' rallies and town meetings in Iowa since his bid for the White House officially began last April 30.
Across the United States – from the Trailblazers arena in Portland, Oregon, to small house parties in New Hampshire – more than 507,100 people have packed into events hosted by the Sanders campaign.
"We are running a simple, straightforward grassroots campaign. We are discussing the major issues facing our country and hearing what Iowans have to say," Sanders said. "We sense growing momentum here in Iowa and we think we have a great opportunity to win."
