    Iran Arms and Contra Aid Controversy
Q. Mr. President, the hearings are about over on Capitol Hill. Have you heard any evidence that any laws were violated in the Iran-contra affair?
The President. You know I don't take questions at these photo opportunities, but when you ask a question like that, I haven't heard a single word that indicated in any of the testimony that laws were broken.
Q. In that case, do you think Colonel North, Admiral Poindexter, or others deserve pardons at this point just to prevent any kind of prosecution?
The President. I am going to speak out on that whole subject and the subject of this whole affair.
Q. When?
The President. When the hearings are over.
The President's Health
Q. Are you at all worried about your surgery this afternoon, Mr. President?
The President. What?
Q. Are you at all worried about your surgery this afternoon?
The President. No, it seems a little overdignified to call what's going to happen surgery. They're going to scrape a little patch on my nose.
