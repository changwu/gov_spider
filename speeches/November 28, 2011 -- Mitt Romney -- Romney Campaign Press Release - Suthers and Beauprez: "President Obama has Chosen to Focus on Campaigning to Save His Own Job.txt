    Former Colorado Congressman Bob Beauprez and Attorney General John Suthers, both Romney supporters, made the following joint statement on the Democratic National Committee's misleading advertisement and press conference call:
"President Obama's policies have failed to create jobs in Colorado and across the country. As millions of Americans remain unemployed, instead of leading on the economy, President Obama has chosen to focus on campaigning to save his own job. The latest attack on Mitt Romney launched by the Obama campaign and Democrats confirms that the last thing they want to do is run against him in the general election. After three years, it is time to hold this administration accountable for its dismal record."
