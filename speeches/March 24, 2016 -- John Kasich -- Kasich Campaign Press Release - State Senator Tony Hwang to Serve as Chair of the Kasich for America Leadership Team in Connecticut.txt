    Today, Kasich for America announced that State Senator Tony Hwang will serve as Ohio Governor John Kasich's campaign chair in Connecticut.
"Governor John Kasich's proven record of responsible governing makes him the only candidate with wide appeal to Connecticut Republicans," said Hwang. "He has the demonstrated ability to balance our federal budget along with revitalizing Ohio's economy to achieve growth and sustainability, while maintaining a safety net to protect the most vulnerable and at-risk. We need to elect leaders who have made positive differences in governing, not just rhetoric and anger to raise false hopes. Let's make our state matter in selecting the best choice for president, and I hope you will join me in supporting Kasich for president."'

Senator Hwang represents Connecticut's 28th state senate district which includes the towns of Easton, Fairfield, Newtown, Weston and Westport. He was elected in 2008.
Said Kasich, "I welcome Senator Hwang to our team. He is a fiscal conservative with a proven record of bringing results to his community. He fits right in and I thank him for his hard work and commitment to our cause."
