(House Rules)
(Representative Salmon, R-Arizona, and 10 cosponsors)
The Administration supports passage of H.R. 3136, Advancing Competency-Based Education Demonstration Project Act of 2014, which promotes innovative higher education approaches that would help Americans obtain the education and skills that are needed in today's economy. This legislation would build on the work announced by the President last August to promote better innovation and competition in our higher education system, and help ensure that more Americans have access to high-quality, flexible higher education opportunities that meet their needs, particularly for adult learners who may be struggling to manage work and family responsibilities along with their educational pursuits.
While the bill provides a modest step forward to help students access new higher education models, it does not provide any additional financial resources. The Administration urges the Congress to do more to ensure that college is affordable for American families. This is particularly important today, when a college education is critical to ensuring that our workforce has the skills needed to meet the demands of the Nation's growing economy. The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to improve the legislation.
