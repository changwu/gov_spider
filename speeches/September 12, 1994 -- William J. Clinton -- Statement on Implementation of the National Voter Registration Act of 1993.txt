    This law creates the opportunity to include millions of Americans in the political process who have previously been excluded because of difficult and confusing voting rules. I urge all Americans of all political parties to register to vote, and I urge the voter registration groups to continue and expand their efforts to ensure as many of our citizens as possible are registered.
