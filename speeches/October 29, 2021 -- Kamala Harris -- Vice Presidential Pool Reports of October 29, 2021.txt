VP in-town pool report 1: Link for afternoon event 
Good afternoon!
The Vice President is scheduled to give remarks at 2:30 at a DNC grassroots virtual event.
The event will be livestreamed here: https://www.live.democrats.org/
As this has become a livestreamed event, there will be no further pool coverage. The VP's office should be sending a transcript in due course.
That's all for me – if you're in DC, hope you're staying dry in the deluge.

VP Pool Report #5: VP Remarks + Event head count 
"Who is governor matters," Vice President Harris declared as she highlighted how the results of the governor's race will impact setting a tone for the national political agenda and her administration's ability to enact the agenda.
A crowd of 915 people, many holding Terry McAuliffe signs filed the room.
"Tuesday is a critical day that will determine whether we turn back the clock or move it forward," Vice President Harris said.
She highlighted that the Virginia Governor face is historically a tight election and a bellwether for the rest of the country.
"What happens in Virginia will determine what happens in 2022, 2024 and so on."
"By extension giving the importance of this election" Virginia will determine how the country will move forward. "Lives will be forever impacted by what you do in this election. The power is in your hands."
She championed that if Virginians didn't turn out the vote in 2020, she would "not be standing here."
Elections matter was the overall theme of the Vice President's remarks. She challenged voters to "remember what happened in the election four years before" 2020.
"We can take nothing for granted," Vice President Harris cautioned. "Progress never comes without hard-work, and often a fight."
"Don't let Virginia be an experiment," the Vice President said as she highlighted the nation is watching Virginia in the same vein it watched races in Texas.
The battle between democracies and autocracies was also mentioned in the Vice President's remarks. She said around the world she has had conversations with international leaders about the topic.
"What's going on," is what Vice President Harris's says Angela Merkel asked her when they discussed the state of the American democracy.
"I have power" is the inspiring quote of the evening that closed out the remarks at 6:34.
