    The President has declared a national emergency under the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and ordered that the United States Government take steps in addition to those announced on March 11 and March 31 to increase economic pressure on the Noriega regime. The President, by Executive order, has ordered the following steps, effective immediately:
—blocking assets of the Government of Panama in the United States;
—prohibiting payments by all people and organizations in the United States to the Noriega regime; and
—prohibiting payments to the Noriega regime by all U.S. people and organizations in Panama, including U.S. branches and subsidiaries.
These measures will provide further support to the efforts of the people of Panama and President Eric Delvalle to restore democratic government and constitutional order in Panama. Passed in 1977, the IEEPA is available to the President to deal with an unusual and extraordinary external threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.
