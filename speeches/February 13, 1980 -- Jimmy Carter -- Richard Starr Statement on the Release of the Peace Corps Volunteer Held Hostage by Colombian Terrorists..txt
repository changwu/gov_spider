    Richard Starr went to Colombia to share both his knowledge and his concern for the people of that developing country. He wanted to share his skills as a botanist. He wanted to share his energies. He wanted to share his hopes.
In joining the Peace Corps, Richard demonstrated the same caliber of commitment that has characterized thousands of others before him. But he had to pay a special sacrifice for his commitment. Three years ago, while working at his job, he was kidnaped by a Colombian terrorist group and for these 3 years has been held captive by this group.
Richard is a remarkable American. It is good to have him home with us again. I know that it is a particular joy for Richard's family, which has had to share his long ordeal. Rosalynn and I, along with Congressman Al Swift, have been aware of their suffering as we have worked to bring this ordeal to an end.
On behalf of the American people, I would like to thank Richard for his service as a Peace Corps volunteer. I want him and his family to know that his country admires his service .and appreciates his extraordinary ordeal.
I am proud of Richard Starr, my fellow American. I wish him much success in his future endeavors.
I also want to thank the Government of Colombia for its cooperation and assistance.
