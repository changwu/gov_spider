    Attorney General Baker, Agriculture Commissioner Irvin, Labor
The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsements of all three statewide elected Democratic officeholders, Attorney General Thurbert Baker, Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin and Labor Commissioner Michael Thurmond.
"We need a tested leader, someone who is willing to fight for the change we need and has the ability to deliver," said Attorney General Baker. "Hillary Clinton is that leader."
Baker has focused on fighting crime, corruption and consumer fraud since he was named Attorney General in 1997, winning election in 1998 and reelection in 2002 and 2006. Baker is the immediate past President of the National Association of Attorneys General.
"Hillary Clinton understands the challenges our communities face and has outlined a detailed agenda to revitalize rural America," said Commissioner Irvin. "For 35 years she's been fighting for children and families and working to expand opportunity for all Americans."
Commissioner Irvin is the longest serving statewide official in the country, representing Georgia as Agriculture Commissioner since 1969, and now serving his 10th term. He is the former president of the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture and the Southern United States Trade Association.
"Hillary is the change agent Georgians are looking for," said Commissioner Thurmond. "She has the strength and experience to rebuild the road to the middle class and begin creating jobs instead of exporting them."
Before being elected Labor Commissioner in 1998, Thurmond helped created the "Workfirst" program as a state legislator, helping over 90,000 welfare-dependent families move into the workforce and saving Georgia taxpayers over $200 million.
"I'm honored to have the support of these distinguished Georgia leaders," Clinton said. "I look forward to reaching out to Georgians in every corner of the state and spreading our message of change."
