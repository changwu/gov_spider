    Yesterday, Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer participated in a virtual roundtable with leading LGBTQI+ human rights activists from around the world as part of the broader White House celebration of Pride Month. Mr. Finer emphasized the Biden-Harris Administration's strong commitment to protecting and defending LGBTQI+ human rights globally, in line with President Biden's February 2021 Memorandum on this issue and June 15th Executive Order on Advancing Equality for LGBTQI+ Individuals. Participating activists highlighted the resilience of the LGBTQI+ community in the face of both incremental gains and increasing repression in various contexts, as well as sustained societal discrimination, violence, and criminalization. Activists also highlighted increasing online attacks and state surveillance as a priority concern. Mr. Finer was joined by Jessica Stern, U.S. Special Envoy to Advance the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons; Jay Gilliam, USAID Senior Coordinator for LGBTQI+ Issues; and senior members of the National Security Council staff.
