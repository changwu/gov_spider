    HOUSTON, Texas – Today, the Cruz for President released an endorsement video from Judge Paul Pressler, a longtime conservative and evangelical leader and activist.
Pressler is influential in conservative presidential politics and recently sat down to explain why he's endorsing Ted Cruz for President:


PRESSLER: "I think that people are genuinely upset with the directions in Washington. I believe if we do not have good people in Washington we are not going to save our nation.
"I met Ted Cruz when he was a teenager. I have observed personally the dedication, the integrity, the principle. Ted Cruz believes it is more important what happened to the country than what happens to Ted Cruz.
"It's easy to be liked. It's hard to stand on principle. He always stands by his convictions.
"The appointment of judges is probably the most important thing that a president does. I know a number of the people running this time. I think very highly of them. But I think Ted' legal experience, his knowledge of the judiciary, and of the principles that will be dealt with probably make him the most outstanding person for appointing good judges.
"I've dedicated my life to the conservative principles on which our country was founded. And I know Ted Cruz has done the same thing, and that he will stand firmly.
"Ted is a fighter. He is trustworthy. You can rely on his doing what he tells you he's going to do.
"I'm encouraging all of my friends to get behind Ted Cruz for President. I promise you that Ted Cruz will not let us down."
