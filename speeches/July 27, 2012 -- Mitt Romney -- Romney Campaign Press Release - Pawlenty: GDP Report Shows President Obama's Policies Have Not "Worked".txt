    Former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty today made the following statement on the disappointing GDP report:
"President Obama has been claiming that his economic policies have 'worked.' This morning's GDP numbers suggest otherwise. It seems that the President's poor stewardship of the economy is only going to come to an end when his term comes to an end. Instead of generating growth and jobs, he has only generated uncertainty. Let's hope that the President finds the time amid his busy fundraising schedule to meet with his Jobs Council at least on one more occasion in what remains of his failed presidency."
