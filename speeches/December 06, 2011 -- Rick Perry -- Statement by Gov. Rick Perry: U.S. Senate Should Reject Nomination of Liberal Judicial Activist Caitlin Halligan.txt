    AUSTIN — Gov. Rick Perry today issued the following statement:
"As New York Solicitor General, Caitlin Halligan used her liberal interpretation of the law to target pro-life Americans, gun owners, and gun manufacturers, and otherwise use the law as a liberal political tool. The last thing the American people need on the second highest court is another liberal judicial activist, like Ms. Halligan, who lacks respect for the U.S. Constitution.
"The nomination of liberal activist Caitlin Halligan to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals should be immediately withdrawn by the President. If the President refuses to withdraw this misguided nomination, the U.S. Senate should reject her appointment to the second-most powerful court in the country."
Ms. Halligan's confirmation has been vigorously opposed by the National Rifle Association, Gun Owners of America, and Committee for Justice. Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously rejected her confirmation earlier this year. In 2003, as Solicitor General of New York, Halligan attempted to hold gun manufacturers liable for criminal acts committed with handguns. She filed briefs in federal court arguing for the unconstitutionality of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which the National Rifle Association described as providing "essential protection…for the Second Amendment rights of honest Americans[.]"
Halligan also filed an amicus brief in arguing that federal RICO laws should be used against pro-life groups. She repeatedly attempted to hijack the federal court system in order to impose her own political beliefs on the general public.
