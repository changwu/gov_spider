    President Trump has repeatedly called on Congress to pass legislation to end surprise medical billsâ€”first in May 2019 with the release of principles for surprise billing legislation, and again this September when he signed an Executive Order calling on Congress to act by the end of this calendar year. Congress should act swiftly to protect patients from surprise medical and air ambulance bills and send the compromise announced this afternoon to the President's desk for signature.
