    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Archer (R) TX)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 668.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 668 would affect receipts; therefore it is subject to the pay-as-you-go provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The Administration's scoring of this legislation is under development.
