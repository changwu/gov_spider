    Today, Julio Fuentes, President & CEO of the Hispanic Council for Reform and Educational Options, made the following statement on Mitt Romney's proposals for reforming education:
"Mitt Romney's plan for education is exactly what this country needs to close the achievement gap between students nationwide. To give students of all backgrounds access to a great education, we must increase school choice, improve standards and accountability, and reward the best teachers. Rather than catering to special interests, Mitt Romney has demonstrated he will pursue bold education reform that gives all students the opportunity to succeed."
