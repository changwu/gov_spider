The Woodward book has already been refuted and discredited by General (Secretary of Defense) James Mattis and General (Chief of Staff) John Kelly. Their quotes were made up frauds a con on the public. Likewise other stories and quotes. Woodward is a Dem operative? Notice timing?Retweets: 23494Favorites: 83890

Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Fake NBC News said it's time for the Press to stop complaining and to start fighting back. Actually Chuck they've been doing that from the day I announced for President. They've gone all out and I WON and now they're going CRAZY!Retweets: 26168Favorites: 107623

The already discredited Woodward book so many lies and phony sources has me calling Jeff Sessions 'mentally retarded' and 'a dumb southerner.' I said NEITHER never used those terms on anyone including Jeff and being a southerner is a GREAT thing. He made this up to divide!Retweets: 22078Favorites: 87246

Isn't it a shame that someone can write an article or book totally make up stories and form a picture of a person that is literally the exact opposite of the fact and get away with it without retribution or cost. Don't know why Washington politicians don't change libel laws?Retweets: 25541Favorites: 114928

Almost everyone agrees that my Administration has done more in less than two years than any other Administration in the history of our Country. I'm tough as hell on people & if I weren't nothing would get done. Also I question everybody & everything-which is why I got elected!Retweets: 28860Favorites: 118462

Just like the NFL whose ratings have gone WAY DOWN Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts. I wonder if they had any idea that it would be this way? As far as the NFL is concerned I just find it hard to watch and always will until they stand for the FLAG!Retweets: 27547Favorites: 121039
