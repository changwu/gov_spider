    Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum issued this statement in response to President Obama's rejection of the Keystone XL Pipeline.
Today's decision by the Obama Administration is another betrayal of the American worker, American manufacturing, and American security. Workers are struggling and our enemies are on the march. More than 15,000 manufacturers and 2 million manufacturing jobs have been lost, jobs that require cheap, secure energy sources. Yet President Obama has decided to again abandon them and our security to appease the fringe environmental Left.
Under my Administration, we will commit to an all-of-the-above energy policy that will not just bring cheap energy prices to consumers at the pump, but will lower prices upstream for manufacturers and processors that depend on energy to make the products we use every day. And just as important, we will make our nation energy secure so we will not be held hostage by rouge regimes and radical groups with access to energy resources.
