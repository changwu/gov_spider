    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am writing concerning the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and six current beneficiary developing countries. The GSP program is authorized by the Trade Act of 1974, as amended ("the 1974 Act").
I intend to suspend indefinitely Liberia from its status as a GSP beneficiary for failure to comply with section 502(b)(7) of the 1974 Act concerning internationally recognized worker rights. In addition, I intend to designate current beneficiaries Kiribati, Mauritania, Mozambique, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu as least-developed beneficiary developing countries, in accordance with section 504(c)(6) of the 1974 Act.
My decisions will take place at least 60 days from the date of this letter.
Sincerely,
George Bush
