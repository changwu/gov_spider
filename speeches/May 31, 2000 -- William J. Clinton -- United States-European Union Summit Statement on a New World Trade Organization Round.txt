    Since the last U.S.-EU Summit in December, we have worked together in Geneva to rebuild confidence in the WTO and the multilateral system, with particular reference to developing countries. With our trade partners, we have agreed to a short-term package on market access for the least developed countries, an implementation work program, and on the high priority to be accorded to effective delivery of technical assistance.
The U.S. and EU reaffirm their conviction that the early launch of an inclusive new Round of WTO trade negotiations would offer a major boost to global economic growth, employment and sustainable development, but must address in a balanced way the concerns of all WTO members.
The U.S. and EU pledge to build on the constructive work of the last six months to try to launch such a new Round during the course of the year. We have reiterated our common view that the WTO agenda should include the social issues of labor and environment, not as a matter of protectionism, but as a matter of social justice and sustainability.
