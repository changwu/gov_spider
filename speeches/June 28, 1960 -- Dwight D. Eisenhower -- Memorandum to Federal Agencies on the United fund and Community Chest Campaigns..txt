    To the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
Last year, Government personnel demonstrated their individual concern for the health and welfare of their fellow men by voluntarily helping to raise part of the record $455,000,000 collected throughout the Nation during the United fund and Community Chest campaigns.
Again this coming fall the United Community Campaigns will seek our support for 27,000 national--and local health, welfare and recreational organizations. The American National Red Cross will be included in a number of these, along with other national organizations, such as the' Salvation Army, the USO, the Scouts and the Y's. By united charity, we are able to support the work of hospitals, clinics, visiting nurses' associations and homes for the sick and aged in our local communities. We are also able to strengthen various recreational and character-building groups working among our youth.
The Honorable Thomas S. Gates, Jr., Secretary of Defense, has agreed to serve as Vice Chairman of the United Community Campaigns for the federal Government. He merits our heartiest cooperation.
We, in Government, must bear our full citizens' share in the great humanitarian efforts which advance the welfare of our fellow citizens and communities. The support given by you and your personnel in the past has been heart-warming. I know that Government employees will continue their fine record of voluntary giving.
