WH pool report #1 - delay
Good afternoon all.
Pool has been covid tested and masked.
Reporters have gathered in the East Room of the WH for POTUS remarks on prescription drugs. The WH says POTUS remarks are unlikely to start for another 30 minutes. They were initially sked for about 11:15 am.
A teleprompter has been set up for Biden's remarks. There is also a lectern for POTUS. Next to it is a lower side table that holds a glass of water capped with a white covering.
Later today POTUS will depart for Wilmington from Ft. McNair. He's leaving from there rather than the South Lawn due to construction on the South Lawn, per the WH.

Pool report 5 - Biden departs from Ft. McNair
POTUS motorcade arrived at Ft. McNair at 3:10 a.m. after a swift drive through DC. We passed curious bystanders and also a pool full of swimmers. At Ft. McNair we passed by what appeared to be a birthday party picnic.
