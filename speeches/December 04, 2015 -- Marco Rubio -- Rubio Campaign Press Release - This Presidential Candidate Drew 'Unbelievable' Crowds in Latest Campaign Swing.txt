SCOTT BROWN: Yeah, it was unbelievable . . . .
Marco was over 500 [attendees]. And they were literally packed in like, I'll be honest with you, they loved him. He took the time, answered every question thoroughly, thoughtfully. He has a wide range of knowledge.
In South Carolina, Marco spoke as part of the College of Charleston "Bully Pulpit" series, and outlined his view of this election.

REPORTER: He calls it a 'generational choice.' Rubio went on to say this election will help determine what path the country takes. He says it will determine the fate of future generations and the success for them.
Finally, Marco drew a huge crowd in Guntersville, Alabama, where attendees braved the rain to see him speak.

All across the country, momentum continues to build for Marco's campaign, and these latest events are proof of that.
