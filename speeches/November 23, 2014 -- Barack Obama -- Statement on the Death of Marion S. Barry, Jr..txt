    Michelle and I were saddened to hear of the passing of Marion Barry. Marion was born a sharecropper's son, came of age during the civil rights movement, and became a fixture in DC politics for decades. As a leader with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Marion helped advance the cause of civil rights for all. During his decades in elected office in DC, he put in place historic programs to lift working people out of poverty, expand opportunity, and begin to make real the promise of home rule. Through a storied, at times tumultuous life and career, he earned the love and respect of countless Washingtonians, and Michelle and I extend our deepest sympathies to Marion's family, friends, and constituents today.
