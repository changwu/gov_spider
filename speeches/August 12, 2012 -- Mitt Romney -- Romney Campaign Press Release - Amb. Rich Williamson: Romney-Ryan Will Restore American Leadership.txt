    Ambassador Rich Williamson today made the following statement on the selection of Congressman Paul Ryan as Mitt Romney's Vice Presidential running mate:
"Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as his running mate reaffirms that this election is a choice between their vision of American leadership abroad and President Obama's vision of American decline. Congressman Ryan is an unequivocal defender of American values, believes in America's exceptional role in the world, and understands that our influence internationally depends on our economic and fiscal strength at home. A more peaceful and prosperous world for America and her allies depends on American leadership.Â  That leadership will be restored in a Romney-Ryan administration."
