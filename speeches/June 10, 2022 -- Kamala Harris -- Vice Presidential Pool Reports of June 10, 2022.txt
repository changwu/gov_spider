The drive from the airport was uneventful.

VP Travel Pool #3 Harris speech/Jan 6 comments
Harris took the stage at 7:55 pm to loud applause. She wrapped at 8:15 pm. Cyburn then got on stage with her to thank her for coming. They hugged. She got off stage at 8:17 pm.
Turns out there was not a livestream link, so here are some quick quotes (comments on Jan 6 in bold below), color and an otter link of her speech. Please check against transcript.https://otter.ai/u/doUSn-CXZOj4lLVPFa7QDFpaKAY
She opened with the time she spent in SC during the Dem primary shared a quick story about buying bags of collard greens from the state before leaving to cook thanksgiving dinner while she was running for president
She shared a message from POTUS: "South Carolina, we see you."
She ran through the admins accomplishments. Mention of Ketanji Brown Jackson's SCOTUS nomination and Michelle Childs nom got big applause.
"We heard you. We heard you and because of your efforts to get us elected in 2020, we were able to issue an executive order to increase accountability in policing including a ban on chokeholds for federal law enforcement."
We knew what you sent us to Washington to accomplish. And what did we do? Well, hundreds of millions of Americans got vaccinated. What did we do? Record job creation, record declining unemployment, record increases in labor participation and an historic rate of small business creation.
"We have made progress..we know people are still hurting. There is no question. We still face serious challenges. As we saw today, inflation is still too high. We are seeing higher prices at the store from supply chains that slowed down dramatically during the pandemic and higher prices at the gas pump because of Putin's war in Ukraine. Families across South Carolina and the nation are feeling the pinch."
"friends, I believe when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for."
"As Democrats, we fight for a future where working families can get ahead and stay ahead where every child can reach their God given potential and where every community is safe and healthy. We fight for a future where all people can live without fear. Because no 86 year old grandmother should be afraid to go to the grocery store. No 41 year old pastor should worry about welcoming a stranger to Bible study. No nine year old child should fear for her safety at school. And no 18 year old should be able to buy a weapon of war."
That last line about guns got a loud applause with many getting up on their feet.
"These are the values Democrats stand for. And let's be clear. And so much of this is what the Republican Party stands against… The Republican Party wants to criminalize and punish women and their doctors for making healthcare decisions."
"Republican leaders has shown that they have no interest in making progress on the issues that matter most to the American people."
"Some extremist leaders even promoted conspiracy theories that lead to an attack on our nation's capital. An attack that far too many elected Republicans still refuse to condemn."
"As I'm sure most of us saw during last night's hearing, what happened on January 6 was not just an assault on a building. It was an assault on the institution's values and ideals that generations of Americans marched, picketed and shed blood to establish and defend. South Carolina we are not going to let arsonists set a fire to our democracy."
Harris was introduced by Jaleel Johnson, who met Harris in 2019 and has worked in SC politics.
Also, per WH, upon arrival the Vice President met w/ officials below.
- House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-SC-06)- Governor Dick Riley, former Governor of South Carolina (D) and former U.S. Secretary of Education- Chair Trav Robertson, South Carolina Democratic Party
