    Rudy Giuliani made the following statement today regarding President Bush's intention to nominate Michael Mukasey to be the Attorney General of the United States:
"The President could not have picked a person with greater integrity than Michael Mukasey to be the next Attorney General. As in everything Michael does, he will meet and exceed all expectations in his new role.
"He is a great lawyer with vast experience and during his 18 years on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York – six serving as Chief Judge – Michael was considered to be one of the best judges in the country."
