BOISE, Idaho — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul attracted more than double the number of expected attendees of his large Moscow, Idaho campaign rally held at the University of Idaho.
The Moscow Rally took place at 4:00 p.m. PST at the campus' Student Union Ballroom, located in Moscow, ID 83884. Campaign officials planned to accommodate 1,000 guests — roughly a room capacity crowd — yet more than 1,000 additional people arrived. At stops along his Pacific Northwest campaign tour, the 12-term Congressman from Texas has made every effort to greet overflow crowds of voters outside speaking venues.
