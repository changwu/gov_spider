In-town pool report 1: Lid
At 11:29 a.m., 31 minutes before the scheduled call time, the White House called a travel/photo lid.
Your pooler had an opportunity to marvel at the extensive security perimeter downtown surrounding the White House and would like to thank everyone keeping us safe. I wish all of you at home well.
