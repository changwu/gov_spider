It is a crisp and sunny morning at the White House.
The Press Office informs me POTUS did participate in the virtual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Economic Leaders' Meeting at 6:50 a.m. in the Situation Room. It was closed press.
Trade advisor Peter Navarro talked at the sticks (or stick) at 8:40 after appearing on Maria Bartiromo's show. He called Democratic governors' lock downs "an aggressive tax on the poor" and "a regressive tax" that hurts low-income workers.
Navarro also praised the rapid mobilization of vaccines as one of Trump's "greatest legacies."
