    Based on a petition submitted to me by the Governor of the State of Indiana, pursuant to Section 110 (f) of the Clean Air Act, I determined on February 15, 1978, that a regional energy emergency existed in the State of Indiana of such severity that a temporary suspension of certain particulate and sulfur dioxide control regulations and regulations governing reserves of low sulfur coal under the Indiana Air Quality Implementation Plan might be necessary. I ordered the determination to be in effect for not more than 30 days unless I rescinded it before that time or extended it. Because of continuing energy supply problems throughout the State, I hereby extend the regional energy emergency determination for the State of Indiana for a second 30-day period. During this extension, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency retains full authority to disapprove temporary suspensions of regulations in Indiana on a case-by-case basis and to exercise his emergency powers authority under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act, when and if necessary.
I urge the Governor to continue to act with due care if he further suspends any air pollution regulations under the authority provided by the extension of this determination, since such regulations are important to protect public health.
