    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Ford (D) Kentucky and 1 other)
The administration opposes enactment of S. 623 unless it is amended to:

— Authorize appropriations for the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) of $23.6 million, $23.9 million, and $24.2 million for fiscal years 1988, 1989, and 1990, instead of $26.2 million, $27.5 million, and $28.8 million. (Over three years, S. 623 authorizes appropriations which exceed the President's 1988 Budget request by $10.8 million.)
— Credit NTSB receipts to the General Fund rather than the Board's appropriations account.
