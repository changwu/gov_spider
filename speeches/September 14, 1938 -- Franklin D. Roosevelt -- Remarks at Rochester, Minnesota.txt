    My friends of Rochester:
I know that I can really call you friends for all that you have done in these past few days for my family and myself.
I am going away not only with a full realization that every care will be taken with my oldest boy, but also with a better knowledge of the very wonderful work that is being done for humanity as a whole here in Rochester.
I want to thank all of you for what I can best describe as an understanding heart on the part of the people of Rochester. You have understood that I have come here not as President but as a father; and you have treated me accordingly. I am going away knowing that you are still going to pull for that boy of mine, and that his wife and my wife are going to be in very good hands during the period of recovery.
I am going back now, not to my home on the Hudson River but straight through to Washington; because, as you know from the newspapers, the condition of affairs in other parts of the world is extremely serious. That is why, as President, I have to go back to the National Capital.
Again I want to thank you. I am leaving here with a light heart. I am leaving not only with a most kindly feeling but with a most affectionate feeling for all of you good people in Rochester.
