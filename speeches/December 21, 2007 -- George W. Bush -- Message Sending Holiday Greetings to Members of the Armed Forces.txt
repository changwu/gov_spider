    To the Men and Women of the United States Armed Forces
On behalf of a grateful Nation, Laura and I send our best wishes for the holidays.
In this season of giving, we remember our duty to others, and we see that sense of duty fulfilled in the men and women who wear our Nation's uniform. Our country owes you a debt of gratitude for your courage and resolve to serve the cause of peace. Americans are proud of your dedicated service, and I am proud to be the Commander in Chief of the greatest force for freedom in the history of the world.
Our Nation is thankful for the many sacrifices you and your families make every day. During the holidays and throughout the coming year, we ask the Almighty to bestow His protection and care on you and your loved ones. We pray for your safety and for liberty, justice, and peace on Earth.
Laura and I wish you a joyful holiday season. May God bless you, and may God continue to bless America.
GEORGE W. BUSH
