    To the Congress of the United States:
Through the World Weather Program, man is acquiring a means not only to cope with his atmosphere and its vagaries but also to understand and assess the impact of his activities on the quality of the global atmosphere.
As a result of recent technological improvements, we are continuing to show substantial progress in furthering the goals of this program:
--Operational geostationary satellites will soon provide a nearly continuous view of storms over a large part of the earth's surface, strengthening our ability to predict and warn of potential natural disasters. Polar-orbiting satellites making vertical measurements of the global atmosphere are already an important aid to weather forecasting.
--Significant advances in computer science are now helping to extend the range, scope and accuracy of weather predictions and to assess the impact of pollution on climate and weather.
--Intensive planning is nearing completion for a large-scale international experiment to be conducted in 1974 in the tropical Atlantic. This experiment will seek a better understanding of the effects of the tropics on global weather patterns. As a result, we expect to gain new insight into the life cycle of hurricanes that affect the coastal areas of the United States.
--Nations are planning to combine their resources in 1977 to observe the entire earth's atmosphere for the first time as a single physical system.
The World Weather Program is a distinctive example of what nations of the world are capable of achieving when united in a common purpose. A recent United Nations Conference on the Human Environment acknowledged the vital contributions of this program. It is most heartening that a program which means so much to the safety and well-being of the American people can at the same time assist in providing these same assurances to other peoples.
In accordance with Senate Concurrent Resolution 67 of the 90th Congress, I am pleased to transmit this annual report describing the current and planned activities of Federal agencies participating in the World Weather Program.
