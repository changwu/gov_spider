(House Rules)
(Rep. Rogers, R-KY)
The Administration supports House passage of the House Amendments to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 2029, making appropriations for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016, and making permanent vital improvements to tax credits that benefit more than 24 million working- and middle-class families each year.
The Administration appreciates the bipartisan effort to provide full-year appropriations legislation consistent with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, which provided significant relief from sequestration for both defense and non-defense priorities. The legislation would help to grow the economy and build middle-class economic security by investing in education, job training, advanced manufacturing, infrastructure, and research while keeping America safe. Additionally, the legislation is largely free of new unrelated ideological riders.
In addition to making permanent vital improvements to tax credits for working- and middle-class families, this legislation also would bring certainty to small businesses, companies investing in U.S. innovation, and charities, while extending important incentives for hiring and investing in low-income communities. The agreement would extend tax incentives for investments in wind and solar energy, driving significant reductions in carbon pollution and other dangerous air pollutants and providing certainty for investments in clean energy. The agreement also would phase out bonus depreciation, which was intended to be a temporary incentive, saving over $200 billion over the next decade relative to its indefinite continuation.
The Administration appreciates the bipartisan effort to provide full-year appropriations legislation for FY 2016 largely free of new unrelated ideological riders, and take a critical step toward a simpler, fairer tax code and a stronger economy, and urges the Congress to pass this legislation.
