    The Vice President visited his doctors at George Washington University Hospital this afternoon for evaluation and treatment of atrial fibrillation (an abnormal rhythm involving the upper chambers of the heart) which was discovered incidentally this morning during examination for a lingering cough from a cold.
An electrical impulse was used to restore the upper chambers to normal rhythm. The procedure went smoothly and without complication. The Vice President has returned home and will resume his normal schedule tomorrow at the White House.
