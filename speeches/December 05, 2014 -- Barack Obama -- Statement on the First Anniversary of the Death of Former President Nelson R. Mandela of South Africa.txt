    On this first anniversary of the passing of Nelson Mandela, Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to the Mandela family and all South Africans. One year ago, the world lost a leader whose struggle and sacrifices inspired us to stand up for our fundamental principles, whose example reminded us of the enduring need for compassion, understanding, and reconciliation, and whose vision saw the promise of a better world. As we pause today to remember the legacy of Madiba, I hope we can all take a moment to reflect on how Mandela's life has inspired our own and will impact the paths of generations to come, including the next generation of world leaders, as while Mandela left behind a world more just and free, there is much more work to be done. On this day, and on every day, we honor his spirit and his memory.
