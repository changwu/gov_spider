    Following his first trip to Virginia since announcing his candidacy for president, Gov. Scott Walker today announced that former Virginia Attorney General Jerry Kilgore will serve as Finance Chairman for his campaign in the commonwealth.
"I am eager to do what it takes to help Gov. Walker succeed in Virginia in March and beyond," said Kilgore. "His message of fighting and winning for the hard-working taxpayers is one I believe Virginians - and all Americans - are yearning to hear, and his record of accomplishment following through on that message is second to none. Gov. Scott Walker is the leader our country needs, and I am honored to support his efforts in this campaign."
Jerry Kilgore served as Virginia Attorney General from 2002 to 2005 and was the Republican nominee in the 2005 Virginia governor's race. He is a former chairman of the Republican Attorneys General Association. He has also served as Virginia Secretary of Public Safety and was a member of Gov. George Allen's cabinet.
