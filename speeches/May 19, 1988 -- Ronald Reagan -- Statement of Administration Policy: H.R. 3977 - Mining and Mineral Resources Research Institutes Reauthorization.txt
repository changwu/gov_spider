    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rahall (D) WVA and 2 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3977, which would authorize appropriations for State mineral institutes. Each mineral institute is associated with a major college or university that is well-established and capable of maintaining a firm financial base of funding through State and private sector resources. In addition, the institutes are eligible to receive grants and contracts, under on-going Federal research programs. Accordingly, this program is no longer an appropriate recipient of scarce Federal funds as other resources exist to continue the program at an appropriate level.
