    WASHINGTON -- In this week's Democratic Radio Address, President-elect Barack Obama announced that he will nominate Shaun Donovan, currently New York City Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
In the address, President-elect Obama praised Donovan's long record on housing reform issues and his leadership in expanding access to affordable housing. As Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development in New York City, Donovan has helped create the largest municipal affordable housing plan in the nation. Donovan served at HUD during the Clinton Administration, and also worked in both the business and non-profit sectors where he helped make responsible homeownership and access to affordable housing a reality for American families.
