    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I herewith transmit for the consideration of the Congress proposed legislation "To amend and reauthorize the Export Administration Act of 1979," together with a section-by-section analysis and supporting justification.
The Export Administration Act provides authority to the President to control exports for reasons of national security, foreign policy, and short supply, and to oppose foreign boycotts. The amendments that we are proposing to this Act provide a balance between strengthening our efforts to protect our national security and foreign policy interests and our efforts to ensure that the business community is not unreasonably constrained in its operations by export controls. In addition, these amendments are intended to improve the administration of the provisions of the Export Administration Act through the reduction of controls where appropriate and through the enhancement of the violation sections of the Act.
I consider enactment of this legislation of great importance to the legislative and budgetary program of this Administration. I would appreciate your efforts in seeing that it is enacted.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
