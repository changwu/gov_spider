    In response to a March 12 request from the Government of Greece, NATO has agreed to provide security assistance for the Athens Olympics, and the subsequent Para Olympics. NATO will provide:

Airborne Early Warning Aircraft (AWACS) to help coordinate air surveillance;
Naval forces; and
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) response units.

NATO remains in consultation with the Government of Greece about possible additional security assistance.
NATO's contributions to security at the Olympics are in keeping with the Alliance's highest priority, which is protecting the citizens and territory of NATO members. Providing assistance with security at high-profile events such as the Olympics is part of NATO's contribution to the global fight against terrorism.
