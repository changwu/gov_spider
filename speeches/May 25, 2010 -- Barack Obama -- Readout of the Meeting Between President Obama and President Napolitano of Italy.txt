    The President was pleased to welcome President Giorgio Napolitano of Italy to the White House today. The President thanked President Napolitano for his strong leadership in Europe and his personal efforts to further advance strong U.S.-Italian bilateral relations and transatlantic ties. The two leaders discussed a range of important strategic issues, including Iran, Afghanistan, the Balkans, Middle East peace efforts, counterterrorism efforts, and the global economic recovery. The President also expressed his support for a strong, integrated Europe capable of advancing our shared interests around the world, and for efforts to further strengthen the transatlantic relationship through the NATO Strategic Concept process which will help prepare NATO to address 21st century challenges.
The President expressed his deep appreciation to President Napolitano for Italy’s contributions around the world to promote peace and stability - including significant Italian deployments to Afghanistan, Lebanon, and the Balkans - as well as Italy’s hosting of the 13,000 American service men and women and their families who call Italy home. The President said he looked forward to seeing Prime Minister Berlusconi at the upcoming G8/G20 meetings, and looks forward to furthering the already close cooperation between the United States and Italy in the months and years ahead.
