Columbia, SC - Fred Thompson was endorsed today by South Carolina Comptroller General Richard Eckstrom. This endorsement is one more clear indication of Thompson's building momentum in the state.
"Senator Thompson's clear leadership on social, fiscal, and defense issues, as well as his strong and proven stance for border security and the rule of law make him a leader like Mark Sanford," General Eckstrom said. "I proudly and fully support his candidacy for President, and I ask all conservatives to do the same. Senator Thompson is the only conservative candidate who is now strongly surging in the polls. Momentum is crucial and Senator Thompson has it."
General Richard Eckstrom is serving in his second term as South Carolina Comptroller General. Prior to that he served one term as South Carolina Treasurer. He is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). General Eckstrom is also a Brig adier General in the South Carolina State Guard, having previously served 3 years in the US Navy, and another 22 years in the Navy Reserve. He is a member of First Presbyterian church in Columbia.
"It is always gratifying when an elected official chooses to support my campaign for President, but even more so when that official is known as a 'Watchdog for the Taxpayers' and a leading voice for conservative principles as is General Eckstrom," said Senator Thompson. "I am also humbled that General Eckstrom joins so many other veterans of our armed forces that are supporting our campaign."
