    The President has asked Secretary of Defense Weinberger to head the official American delegation to the October 13 memorial service in Seoul for the Korean victims of the tragic incident in Burma. Other members of the delegation, representing the Government and people of the United States, will include the Deputy Secretary of State Kenneth W. Dam, Army Chief of Staff Gen. John Wickham, the American Ambassador to Korea, Richard L. Walker, the Commander of U.S. Forces Korea, Gen. Robert Sennewald, Congressman Claude Pepper of Florida, and Congressman Tony P. Hall of Ohio.
The United States deplores this vicious attack, as it does acts of terrorism whenever and wherever they occur. The President and all Americans share the grief and the deep sense of loss of the Korean people at the tragic death of these fine public servants. We admired their profound contributions to the relationship between the United States and Korea, and we knew them as friends. We mourn their loss.
