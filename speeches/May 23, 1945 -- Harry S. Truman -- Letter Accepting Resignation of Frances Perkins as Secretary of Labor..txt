    Dear Frances:
I accept your resignation as Secretary of Labor with great regret and with deep appreciation for all of the untiring service which you have rendered to our country.
During your administration unsurpassed progress in position, influence and prestige has been made by American organized labor.
During this period, such far reaching legislation as the Fair Labor Standards Act, the National Labor Relations Act, and the Social Security Act have been enacted--carrying out the social philosophy you have so often expressed.
The rights of labor as a partner in the system of private enterprise in the United States have been more firmly established than ever before. There has been created a cooperative relationship between industry and labor in the United States which has been largely instrumental in turning out the weapons of war--weapons which brought about the unconditional surrender of the Axis powers in Europe, and will inevitably bring the same defeat to the Japanese.
You have certainly carried out the principle of the basic act creating your office--"to promote the welfare of the wage earners of the United States".
I am grateful to you for the leadership and energy and hard work which you have shown in this difficult and important field of human relations during the past twelve years.
I should like to make your resignation effective July 1, 1945.
With kindest personal regards,
Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
