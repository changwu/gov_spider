 In Town Pool Report #12 - POTUS Emerges 
A masked President Trump emerged from Walter Reed at about 6:38 pm. Staffers held open the doorsfor his exit. He briefly stood at the top of the steps before walking past the pool.
As the president walked by, he ignored questions about how many of the White House staffers are "sick" and whether he is a "superspreader."
"Thank you very much everybody," Trump said, giving a slight wave.
In the hour leading up to the president's departure, staffers and Secret Service agents cane in and out of the hospital. Several wore prominent N95 masks and carried safety goggles. At one point, a pair of masked staffers walked through the pool and quipped, "We've been tested."
The pool is now in the press vans for the quick motorcade trip to the Walter Reed Emergency Landing Zone where POTUS is boarding Marine One.
