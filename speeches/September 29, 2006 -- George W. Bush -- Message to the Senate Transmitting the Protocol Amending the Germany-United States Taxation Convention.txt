    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, a Protocol Amending the Convention Between the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Germany for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital and to Certain Other Taxes, Signed on August 29, 1989, signed at Berlin June 1, 2006 (the "Protocol"), along with a related Joint Declaration. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol.
The Protocol eliminates the withholding tax on certain cross-border dividend payments. Like a number of recent U.S. tax agreements, the proposed Protocol provides for the elimination of the withholding tax on dividends arising from certain direct investments and cross-border dividend payments to pension funds. The Protocol also provides for mandatory arbitration of certain cases before the competent authorities. This provision is the first of its kind in a U.S. tax treaty. In addition, the Protocol also modernizes the Convention to bring it into closer conformity with current U.S. tax-treaty policy, including strengthening the treaty's provisions preventing so-called treaty shopping.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Protocol, along with the Joint Declaration and give its advice and consent to ratification.
GEORGE W. BUSH
The White House, September 29, 2006.
