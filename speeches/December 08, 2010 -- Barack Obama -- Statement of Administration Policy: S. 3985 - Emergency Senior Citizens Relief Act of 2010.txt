(Senate)
(Sen. Sanders, I-Vermont, and 11 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 3985, the Emergency Senior Citizens Relief Act of 2010. This bill would ensure that seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities receive a one-time $250 payment in 2011 and would support individuals struggling in the face of the economic downturn. Over 2009 and 2010, most of these individuals also benefited from a similar one-time payment. Passage of this legislation would help approximately 58 million of those Americans hit hardest by the recession.
