    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. Frelinghuysen, R-NJ)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1301, making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes. The bill funds critical national security needs.
The Administration is committed to working with the Congress on a sustained effort to rebuild the military. In the coming weeks, the Administration plans to request additional FY 2017 appropriations to improve the warfighting readiness of the military and provide the resources needed to accelerate the defeat of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).
The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations process moves forward.
