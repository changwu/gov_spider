    Yesterday, President Biden announced his intent to nominate Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, one of our nation's brightest legal minds, as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. President Biden sought a candidate with exceptional credentials, unimpeachable character, and unwavering dedication to the rule of law. Judge Jackson formerly clerked for Justice Breyer, and has broad experience across the legal profession – as a federal appellate judge, a federal district court judge, a member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, an attorney in private practice, and as a federal public defender. She has been confirmed by the Senate on a bipartisan basis three times – most recently last year for her current seat. If confirmed, Jackson will be the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court.
A broad range of elected leaders at the tribal, local, and state levels issued statements applauding her qualifications and acknowledging her historic nomination.
See below for what they are saying:

As a current federal appellate judge, and former vice chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, public defender, and Supreme Court clerk to Justice Breyer, Judge Jackson's experience, perspective, and voice will be a valuable addition to the bench. I applaud President Biden's choice and commend his commitment to ensuring that our nation's highest court better reflects the nation itself." [Press Release, 2/25/22]

At a time when state and local officials are on the frontlines of a struggle for our democracy, Judge Jackson's unwavering commitment to the rule of law and our democratic values will make her a welcome addition to our highest court.
