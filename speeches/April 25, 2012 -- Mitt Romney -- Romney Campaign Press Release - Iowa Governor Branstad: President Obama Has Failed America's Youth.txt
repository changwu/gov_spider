    Iowa Governor Terry Branstad today made the following statement on President Obama's visit to the University of Iowa:
"Today, President Obama will bring his broken promises and failed policies to the University of Iowa. Young voters should see this tour for what it really is: an election-year gimmick that will do nothing to bring much-needed jobs to our nation's young adults and recent graduates. America's young people have been especially hard hit by the Obama economy - half of new college graduates are unemployed or underemployed - and they will face an ever-growing debt burden from his policies. This is simply unacceptable. Mitt Romney has a bold plan that will grow our economy, create jobs, and reduce our debt burden. Young voters across the country will face a clear choice this fall: they can choose President Obama - and his record of fewer jobs and higher debt - or they can choose Mitt Romney, who will lead us to greater prosperity and a bright future."
