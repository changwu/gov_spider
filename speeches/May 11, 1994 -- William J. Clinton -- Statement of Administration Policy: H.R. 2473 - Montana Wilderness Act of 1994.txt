    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 5/12/94)(House)(Williams (D) Montana)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2473.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2473 could reduce collections that offset spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary PAYGO estimate is zero.
