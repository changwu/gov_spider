South Carolina Friends,
I am campaigning today in South Carolina for Mike's campaign. I have stops today in Columbia, Rock Hill, Boiling Springs and tomorrow I will be in Lexington and Cayce. I hope I will see you at one of my stops. I am including the details below.
Mike is fighting hard in Iowa. His crowds are growing and we are now getting reports of voters switching their support to our campaign in this final sprint to the Caucus.
Stay firm here in South Carolina and keep spreading the word.
God bless you.
Janet
