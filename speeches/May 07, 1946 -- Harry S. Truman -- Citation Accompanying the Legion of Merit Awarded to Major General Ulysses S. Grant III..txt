    CITATION FOR THE LEGION OF MERIT
MAJOR GENERAL Ulysses S. Grant III as Director of Civilian Protection and Chief, Protection Branch, United States Office of Civilian Defense from July 1942 to April 1944 displayed marked ability in devising programs for the safety of civilians in case of disaster or enemy attack. Under his leadership and supervision, sound doctrines were devised and disseminated throughout the country, and the voluntary cooperation of thousands of agencies both within and outside the government was enlisted in carrying out measures of broad and lasting significance.
