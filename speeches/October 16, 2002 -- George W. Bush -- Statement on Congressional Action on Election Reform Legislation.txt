    The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy. I commend the House and Senate for passing legislation to improve our election process. The legislation is consistent with the principles outlined by the bipartisan Ford-Carter Commission that respect the primacy of State and local governments and envision a limited but responsible role for the Federal Government. I look forward to signing these important election reforms into law.
