    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Gray, (D) Pennsylvania)
The Administration commends the House Budget Committee for its timely action on the Budget Resoluti6n for FY 1989. The Administration strongly supports meeting the various constraints of the Bipartisan Budget Agreement of November 20, 1987, and the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law.
The Administration is concerned that certain assumptions made by the House Budget Committee may be in conflict with the Bipartisan Budget Agreement, and emphasizes that appropriations measures must be consistent with the understanding reached last November.
The Administration hopes that these issues can be resolved quickly, and looks forward to working with the Congress to achieve the deficit reductions agreed to last November.
