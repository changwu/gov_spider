  A Proclamation

Section 104(b)(5) of title 17 of the United States Code provides that when the President finds that a particular foreign nation extends, to works by authors who are nationals or domiciliaries of the United States of America or to works first published in the United States, copyright protection on substantially the same basis as that on which the foreign nation extends protection to works of its own nationals and domiciliaries and works first published in that nation, the President may extend protection under that title to works of which one or more of the authors is, on the date of first publication, a national, domiciliary, or sovereign authority of that nation, or which are first published in that nation.
Satisfactory assurances have been received that as of March 17, 1992, as provided in Article 3(9) of the Memorandum of Understanding Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Intellectual Property (hereinafter the "Memorandum of Understanding"), China will grant to works of United States nationals and domiciliaries and works first published in the United States protection in the People's Republic of China on the same basis as works of Chinese nationals and domiciliaries and works first published in China which are not in the public domain.
Now, Therefore, I, George Bush, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by section 104 of title 17 of the United States Code, do find and proclaim that effective March 17, 1992, the conditions specified in section 104(b)(5) of title 17 of the United States Code have been satisfied in the People's Republic of China with respect to works of which one or more of the authors is, on the date of first publication, a national or domiciliary of the United States of America, or which are first published in the People's Republic of China are entitled to protection under title 17b of the United States Code.
I hereby request the Secretary of State to notify the Government of the People's Republic of China that the date on which works of Chinese nationals and domiciliaries and works first published in the People's Republic of China are entitled to protection under title 17 of the United States Code, is March 17, 1992, 60 days after the date of signature of the Memorandum of Understanding.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixteenth.

GEORGE BUSH
