    The U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) plans to recruit U.S. businesses for an investment mission to Panama, February 23 - 28. The OPIC mission will familiarize investors with the economic and political climate in Panama by providing direct access to representatives of Panama's new government and business community. The purpose of this mission is to help rebuild the Panamanian economy.
Panama's business infrastructure retains attractive features, such as transportation, communications, and financial services. It has excellent potential in agriculture, aquaculture, light industry, and tourism.
Preparation for the mission will begin with a preliminary trip to Panama by OPIC CEO and President Fred M. Zeder on January 31.
OPIC is the U.S. Government agency responsible for encouraging investment in some 110 developing countries worldwide. An increasingly vital tool of American foreign policy, OPIC encourages investors to explore overseas business opportunities. In the past year, OPIC has led investment missions to Poland, Hungary, Bolivia, sub-Saharan Africa, and other developing nations.
