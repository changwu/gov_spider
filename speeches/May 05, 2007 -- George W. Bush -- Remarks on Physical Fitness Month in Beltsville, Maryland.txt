    Thank you all for coming. This is Physical Fitness Month, and I'm with members of the President's Physical Fitness Council. Their job is to encourage all Americans, young and old, to exercise.
I love exercise. Today I'm going to ride with a group of friends on a mountain bike. But the message to all Americans is to find time in your schedule to walk, run, swim, bike, to take care of yourselves.
I appreciate Mike Leavitt, who is the Secretary of Health and Human Services, is joining us today. He knows what I know, that if someone takes care of their body through good exercise, that it is—it's the beginning of really good health policy for the United States.
It doesn't take much time to stay fit— 30 minutes, 5 days a week: 30 minutes of walking, 30 minutes of running, 30 minutes of biking, 30 minutes of swimming on a regular basis will help deal with a lot of health issues here in America. I have found that exercise not only is a good excuse to get outdoors; it helps relieve stress as well. And so, on behalf of the President's Council on Physical Fitness, I say to America: Get outside, take time out of your life, schedule yourself, be disciplined, and exercise.
Thank you all for coming.
