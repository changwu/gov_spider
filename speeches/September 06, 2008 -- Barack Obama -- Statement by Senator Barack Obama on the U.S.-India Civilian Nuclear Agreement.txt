    Chicago, IL - "I welcome news that the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) has now reached a consensus to adopt an exception to its rules that would permit its members to engage in nuclear cooperation with India. It is a positive development. I look forward to reviewing what the NSG has agreed in Vienna, and urge the Administration to submit the U.S--India Agreement for Civil Nuclear Cooperation to the Congress quickly."
