    Laura and I are saddened by the death of Don Regan. He leaves behind a lifetime of service and achievement, in both the private and public sector. He served his country with distinction. Don was a devoted husband, father, and grandfather and will be sorely missed. We send our deepest sympathies to Ann and the entire Regan family.
