    In response to Donald Trump's new ads in Wisconsin and Minnesota, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield released the following statement:
"While Joe Biden has forcefully made it clear that there is absolutely no place for violence, looting, or burning, Donald Trump has failed to say what Americans need to hear from their president: a condemnation of violence of all kinds. Trump is a weak and failed leader who stokes division and chaos as a political strategy to distract from the massive economic, racial justice, and public health crises occurring under his watch. America needs Joe Biden's unifying leadership â€“ not more divisiveness and destruction."
