Arizona Governor Jan Brewer On Mitt Romney:
ARIZONA GOVERNOR JAN BREWER: "I have had my debate there in Arizona, and I have looked over all the wonderful people that have put themselves up for nomination, and I have decided that I am going to publicly endorse Mitt Romney. I think he's the man that can carry the day, and I am going to get out there and work as hard as I know how to make sure that he wins Arizona and work in other places of our country to see that he wins those places, too."
NBC'S DAVID GREGORY: "What was decisive for you here in the debate?"
GOVERNOR BREWER: "I think that he handles himself very, very well, but more than that I think that he has that pro-business background and he has that political history that I think that he would serve America the best of all the candidates. So it was a difficult decision, but I think Mitt is by far the person that can go in and win."
