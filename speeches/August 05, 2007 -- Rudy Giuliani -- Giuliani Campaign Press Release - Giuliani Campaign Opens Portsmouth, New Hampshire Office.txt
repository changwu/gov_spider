    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced the opening of the campaign's office along the Seacoast in Portsmouth.
The office will be staffed full-time by a field representative and will serve as the base of operations for volunteers and supporters in Rockingham and Strafford Counties.
"This is yet another illustration of Mayor Giuliani's commitment to campaigning here and winning New Hampshire," said Wayne Semprini, Giuliani's New Hampshire State Chairman. "We look forward to continuing our work of spreading the Mayor's optimistic vision and his track record of strong leadership to the residents of the Seacoast."
The campaign's New Hampshire headquarters is located in downtown Manchester.
