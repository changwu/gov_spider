Gun Violence Prevention Groups and Advocates
Everytown for Gun Safety: Today, Everytown for Gun Safety, Moms Demand Action, and Students Demand Action celebrated a major win for gun violence prevention as the Biden-Harris Administration finalizes a rule that will require ghost guns to be treated like the deadly weapons they are. The final rule updates the definitions of "firearm" and "frame or receiver" to cover kits and components easily assembled into untraceable ghost guns. [Tweet, 4/11/22]
Brady: Today, Brady applauds President Biden and the Biden-Harris Administration for nominating a common-sense law enforcement professional to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) and announcing the finalization of a rule to stop the proliferation of untraceable ghost guns across the country. This new rule will stop the spread and sale of these dangerous weapons, which have become a desirable avenue for gun traffickers and prohibited purchasers, when they seek firearms for criminal activity. This new rule will help to save lives across the country and will need to be successfully implemented by ATF, further underscoring the need for a Senate-confirmed director. President Biden's nominee, Steve Dettelbach, is a prudent choice who will steward the agency well. Brady urges the Senate to confirm him without delay. [Statement, 4/12/22]
Giffords: Giffords, the gun violence prevention organization led by former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, applauds the Justice Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) for taking a decisive step to stem the flow of dangerous ghost guns into communities across the country. Today the White House announced that the Department of Justice is finalizing the rule to amend its definitions of "frame or receiver" and what constitutes a firearm. [Statement, 4/11/22]
Fred Guttenberg: "As I reflect on yesterday's visit to the White House, it was my honor to be amongst so many amazing warriors who fight every day, to save lives. It is because of the work of so many truly amazing people that something historic happened yesterday. The actions by @POTUS @JoeBiden on ghost guns to get in front of a quickly growing threat to our safety was very significant. This was the first time in 50 years that the federal government has redefined what a firearm is. In the failure of action by Congress, the President had no choice but to act and this action will save lives. The importance of the announcement of a nominee to lead the ATF as a permanent director was also very significant. We currently live in a country where approximately 90% of crime guns come from about 5% of gun dealers. We need a person with crime fighting experience to fix this and @SteveDettelbach is that person. I plan to do everything I can to work for his nomination. Your life may depend on it." [Tweet, 4/12/22]
Brandon Wolf: "Yesterday was important. Thank you to all the powerful advocates for your unrelenting demand for a better, safer America. And to @POTUSfor the actions announced yesterday. Progress is progress — and it will save lives." [Tweet, 4/12/22]

Debbie Mucarsel-Powell: "Today is a great day for many of us who've lost a loved one to gun violence. Thanks to President Biden's leadership "ghost guns" will be regulated so our nation can prevent more crimes with the use of these untraceable arms. Our work @GiffordsCourage is helping save lives." [Tweet, 4/11/22]
Sandy Hook Promise Co-Founder and CEO Mark Barden: ""The Biden administration is taking a strong step forward to protect kids from gun violence by regulating ghost guns like all other firearms under the jurisdiction of the ATF. It's been nearly 10 years since my sweet little Daniel was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School, and there is still so much to be done to keep our children safe from gun violence. Today's announcements are an important step forward in keeping guns out of the hands of people who are prohibited from owning them. We appreciate the administration's efforts to continue to ensure our gun laws are properly enforced." [Statement, 4/11/22]
Executive Director of the Health Alliance for Violence Intervention (the HAVI) Fatimah Loren Dreier: "During this critical time, when gun violence has traumatized generations, we commend President Joseph Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for reinforcing their comprehensive approach to ending the pandemic of gun violence. Their moves today to nominate Steven M. Dettelbach to lead the ATF and to address the issue of ghost guns are consistent with and support a comprehensive approach to address this public health crisis. The President's actions reinforce the building of an overall community violence intervention ecosystem that represents crucial components of cities' public health. For us to end this often "normalized," inhuman level of violence in our communities—HVIPs (Hospital-based Violence Intervention Programs) are one key part of it, as are the frontline workers who intervene, prevent, and defuse potentially violent encounters. These components work together—and complement law enforcement—and when combined with economic opportunity, jobs, and access to healthcare and a good education, we create sustainable, healthy community ecosystems that attack violence at its roots. We also commend the record level of funding by this administration and its commitment to provide several additional billions of dollars to support a comprehensive CVI ecosystem as well as their scaling up of their 16-jurisdiction CVI (Community Violence Intervention) collaborative designed to help communities examine the gaps within their CVI ecosystems and plug those gaps with resources and funding. Solutions exist, it is our responsibility to embrace them, apply them, and create the healthy communities we want." [Statement, 4/11/2022]
Law Enforcement
Jim Pasco, Executive Director, National Fraternal Order of Police: "The fact that these guns are untraceable means that the perpetrators continue to inflict further damage even after they've dropped those ghost guns," Pasco said on the sidelines of the White House event.

Major Cities Chiefs Association Gun violence continues to plague major cities across the nation & tackling it takes all stakeholders. Thank you @POTUS for inviting the MCCA @PhxPDChief & @PPDCommish to witness what we hope will be groundbreaking regulation of #ghostguns. [Tweet, 4/11/22]

Members of Congress
New York Senator Chuck Schumer, Senate Majority Leader: . @POTUS and AG Garland are taking strong executive action on ghost guns. I've been working for action on these dangerous gun kits for years. They're too easy to build and too hard to trace. This will help exorcise ghost guns from our streets and crack down on violent gun crime. [Tweet, 4/11/22]
Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, Senate Majority Whip: I strongly support POTUS's administrative actions, which include critical steps to help stop the proliferation of untraceable ghost guns and the announcement of a well-qualified nominee for ATF Director who will enforce the laws on the books to combat gun crime. [Tweet, 4/11/22]
Rhode Island Senator Jack Reed, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee: About 20,000 suspected #ghostguns were recovered by law enforcement in criminal investigations last year.

New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: I'm glad to see @POTUS using the Admin's executive authorities to close the ghost gun loophole. Finalizing this ghost guns rule as soon as possible is the single most important thing we can do to shut down the ghost gun marketplace once and for all. Time is of the essence. [Tweet, 4/11/22]
California Senator Dianne Feinstein: "I support the Biden administration's actions to ban untraceable firearms. Ghost guns have become the weapon of choice for criminals because they provide anonymity for the shooter and can be obtained without a background check – they have no business on our streets. "Ghost guns are homemade firearms that are built using kits or 3-D printed parts. Because the guns are built from parts, they don't have a serial number or require a background check. "The proposed rule closes these loopholes by requiring parts that can easily be converted into a gun to receive a serial number. The rule also requires manufacturers and sellers of these parts to follow the same laws as other gun manufacturers and sellers, including background checks for purchases. "This rule is a commonsense approach to stop the flood of ghost guns into our communities. I applaud the administration for taking action and hope Congress will follow suit and pass similar legislation to end the epidemic of gun violence." [Statement, 4/11/22]
California Senator Alex Padilla: "Ghost guns," or guns without serial numbers, are too easy to build, too hard to trace, and too dangerous to ignore. This new rule will update regulations on ghost guns and help keep our communities safe. [Tweet, 4/11/22]
Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen: More & more crimes are being committed w/ 'ghost guns' b/c they're untraceable.

If Republicans are too afraid to stand up to the gun lobby, we will. [Tweet, 4/11/22]
Nevada Senator Jacky Rosen: Nevada unfortunately knows far too well the devastation caused by gun violence in our country. Today's actions announced by @POTUS , joined by Nevada's own @sandra4nv , to crack down on ghost guns are critical steps to reduce violence in our communities. [Tweet, 4/11/22]
Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse: Technology has made it easy for criminals & terrorists to produce untraceable firearms. I am glad to see the Biden Administration institute commonsense safeguards to rein in ghost guns. [Tweet, 4/11/22]
California Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House: "President Biden's actions today are strong steps forward in Democrats' fight against the epidemic of gun crime. The Administration's life-saving new rule builds on strong earlier executive orders to help stop the spread of 'ghost guns,' untraceable weapons posing a growing threat to families' safety. In nominating Steve Dettelbach to serve as ATF Director, the President has selected a highly respected former prosecutor with deep experience working to reduce community violence and crime. "Tragically, the horrors of gun violence continue to reach into communities across the country: causing families unthinkable anguish and devastation. Enough is enough — and with the proud partnership of courageous survivors and advocates, Democrats are working to end the bloodshed. Our Democratic House Majority has twice passed H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446, bipartisan and commonsense background checks legislation, and we will not relent until we enact them into law. Meanwhile, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic action to implement a whole-of-government approach to help keep guns out of dangerous hands, reduce gun crime and improve community safety around the nation. "Thanks to the President's bold actions today, our nation moves another step closer to our fundamental promise of security, opportunity and justice for all. Democrats are focused on Building a Better America, one where every child can enjoy a safer, brighter future." [Statement, 4/11/22]
South Carolina Congressman Jim Clyburn, House Majority Whip: I applaud the Biden-Harris Admin for their efforts to address the troubling number of ghost guns in our streets.

Massachusetts Congresswoman Katherine Clark, Assistant Speaker of the House: Ghost guns are untraceable, sold without background checks & are extremely easy to buy or build. @TheJusticeDept is right to require background checks, inventory & serial numbers for all commercial firearm sales. This is a step toward reducing violence & saving lives. [Tweet, 4/11/22]

These guns have been increasingly recovered at crimes scenes across the U.S. & must be regulated so that law enforcement can hold perpetrators accountable. These steps that @POTUS is taking as part of his comprehensive gun crime reduction strategy will go a long way towards preventing & fighting gun crime. In Congress, we must work together to enact additional commonsense solutions that will promote the safety of our communities. [Tweet Thread, 4/11/22]
