    Today the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted to enact the biggest Medicare and Medicaid cuts in history, unprecedented cuts in education and the environment, and steep tax increases on working families. I will veto this bill. I am determined to balance the budget, but I will not go along with a plan that cuts care for disabled children, reduces educational opportunity by cutting college scholarships, denies preschool to thousands of poor children, slashes enforcement of environmental laws, and doubles Medicare premiums for the elderly. We should balance the budget in a way that reflects our values.
