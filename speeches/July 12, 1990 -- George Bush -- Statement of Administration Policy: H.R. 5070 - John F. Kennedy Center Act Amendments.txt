    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Bosco (D) California and 2 others)
The Administration support's the authorization of appropriations of $30 million over fiscal years 1991 and 1992 for rehabilitation and deferred maintenance of the Kennedy Center. The Administration is concerned with one provision of H.R. 5070, however, which requires the Secretary of the Interior to provide all services necessary for the operation of the building. Currently, the Secretary is responsible only for services necessary to the nonperforming arts functions of the Center.
Accordingly, the Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 5070, but will seek an amendment in the Senate to limit the services provided by the Secretary to those needed for nonperforminq arts functions.
