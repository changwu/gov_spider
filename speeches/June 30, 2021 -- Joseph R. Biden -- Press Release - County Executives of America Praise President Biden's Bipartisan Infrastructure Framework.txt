    Today, the County Executives of America, a coalition of more than 700 bipartisan elected officials who serve as their county's chief elected executive, announced their support of the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework that President Biden and bipartisan senators agreed to last week.
In a statement, CEA President Dan McCoy (Albany County NY Executive) said, "This historic bipartisan infrastructure agreement includes investments that will make life better for millions of Americans by creating a generation of good-paying union jobs, promoting local and national economic growth and better positioning American workers, farmers and business-owners for success in the 21st century."
CEA Co-Executive Director Kelly Griffin added, "The County Executives of America appreciates the leadership of President Biden and his Administration as well as the bipartisan Congressional group who negotiated this historic compromise. Our county leaders are eager to move forward with local infrastructure projects that will be made possible with funding from this critical infrastructure legislation."
The County Executives of America joins a growing list of bipartisan state and local elected officials across the country who praised the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework for the investments it will make toward strengthening their communities, including the US Conference of Mayors, National League of Cities, and National Governors Association. They are joined by a bipartisan majority of Americans and business leaders including the Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable, and labor unions including the AFL-CIO, Ironworkers, United Steelworkers, and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
