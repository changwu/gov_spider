    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Molinari (R) NY)
The Administration opposes the enactment of H.R. 3396, which would mandate rehiring of former air traffic controllers (ATCs) who engaged in the illegal strike against the Government in 1981. If H.R. 3396 were presented to the President, his senior advisers would recommend that it be vetoed.
Forced rehiring of the illegal strikers (1) is opposed by current ATCs as a threat to good morale and staff cohesiveness; (2) would require expensive retraining of the former ATCs due to changes in the system, although, because of their age, they will be unable to serve as long as new hires; (3) introduces a contentious issue into critical aspects of air safety; and (4) gravely threatens the Federal Aviation Administration's management of the air traffic control system.
