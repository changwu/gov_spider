Pool report #1/pool in place on Ellipse 
The Bidens are scheduled to depart for Camp David at 11:30 am.
Marine One and its doppelganger were already on the lawn when pool arrived after about 1,200 steps.
It is hazy, warm and somewhat humid.
The shrill whistle of the choppers -- a steady 70 decibels as measured in the pool pen nearby -- completely drowns out any Brood X cicadas, whose song was vaguely audible on the north side of the White House, albeit far muted compared to the red- eyed invasion in suburbia.
