    Yesterday, the Department of Health and Human Services released the United States Health Security National Action Plan (the Plan), which will help the United States Government prepare for and respond to public health emergencies. Building off the strategic guidance of the National Security Strategy and the National Biodefense Strategy, this Plan describes the actions the United States Government will take to increase domestic preparedness to protect America's health, safety, and well-being. The Plan was crafted in response to gaps identified through the United States Joint External Evaluation in 2016. It describes a common approach across more than 13 departments and agencies to protect America's health security.
Infectious disease threats – whether naturally occurring, deliberate, or accidental – have the potential to kill or sicken Americans, to disrupt travel and trade, and to impact our national security. Today, the Trump Administration is taking further action to protect the American people from biological threats, as well as chemical, radiological, and nuclear hazards.
