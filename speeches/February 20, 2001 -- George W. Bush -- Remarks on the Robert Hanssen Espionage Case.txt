    This has been a difficult day for those who love our country, and especially for those who serve our country in law enforcement and in the intelligence community.
Allegations of espionage of an FBI counterintelligence agent are extremely serious and are deeply disturbing, particularly disturbing for the thousands of men and women who work for the FBI, whose mission is to protect our national security and who now must deal with allegations that one of their own may have undermined it.
I have the utmost confidence in Director Louis Freeh and the men and women who serve in the FBI, those who represent our country in the CIA and in the Justice Department. I thank them for their service. I commend them for their sacrifice. Allegations of espionage are a reminder that we live in a dangerous world, a world that sometimes does not share American values.
I thank the men and women who proudly serve our country. But to anyone who would betray its trust, I warn you: We'll find you, and we'll bring you to justice.
Thank you.
