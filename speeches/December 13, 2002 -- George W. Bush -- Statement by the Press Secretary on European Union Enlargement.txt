    Today's decision by the members of the European Union to offer membership to ten countries of Central Europe and the Mediterranean is a bold and historic step. In parallel with the historic NATO summit in Prague, the European Union's decision further unites the new and the established democracies of Europe, and advances the creation of a Europe whole, free, and at peace. Today's action strengthens the enduring partnership between the United States and Europe. It also strengthens our common commitment to the values and interests that underlie our partnership -- both within Europe's borders and beyond.
