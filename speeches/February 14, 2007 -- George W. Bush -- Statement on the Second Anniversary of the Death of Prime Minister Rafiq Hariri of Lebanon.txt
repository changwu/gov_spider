    On the second anniversary of the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, the United States reaffirms its support for a free and democratic Lebanon that is able to chart its own course. The United States joins the Lebanese people in demanding the truth behind Prime Minister Hariri's murder and calling for the establishment of a special tribunal for Lebanon to bring to justice those who murdered Rafiq Hariri and others who stood for Lebanese sovereignty and independence.
Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of yesterday's bus bombings outside Beirut. The evil perpetrators of these attacks will not silence the Lebanese people's demands for justice and democracy in an independent Lebanon.
The Lebanese people's greatest tribute to Rafiq Hariri, Minister Basil Fuleihan, and others who gave their lives for a free Lebanon would be to come together across sectarian divides to build the free, stable, and prosperous Lebanon that Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri dedicated his life to create.
