    The President has said that he wants Federal programs to promote self-sufficiency for disabled persons and reduce barriers to employment, and that Federal programs should not perpetuate dependency.
We are today taking an important step in this direction through a regulation being proposed by Secretary Sullivan. Effective January 1990, this regulation would increase by two-thirds the amount an individual can earn and still receive benefits from the Federal Government's disability insurance and supplemental security income programs. This increase -- from $300 to $500 per month -- will provide an incentive for the 5.2 million workers on the disability rolls to take significant steps toward work and economic independence.
