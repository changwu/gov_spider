    The White House today announced that the annual Easter Egg Roll will be webcast live on the White House web site (www.whitehouse.gov) on Monday, April 1.
The President's opening remarks and the beginning of the Egg Roll will be webcast at approximately 9:30 a.m. Monday morning.
At 11:30 a.m., Laura Bush is scheduled to read a book to children from the South Lawn. This event will be webcast from the White House web site as well.
In addition to the live webcasts, the White House site features historical material on the Easter Egg Roll dating back to the 19th century. The site features photos of decorated eggs from state artists, historical photos, a narrative history of the annual event, and a children's trivia quiz and activity book.
Eggs representing each state and the District of Columbia are featured on the web site. The 2002 Easter Egg Collection continues the tradition that began in 1994 where each state sends a decorated egg to the White House for display. The display includes a painted cracked egg representing Virginia and the Sept. 11 attack on the Pentagon.
