    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976, as amended (Public Law 94 - 265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq., "the Act"), I transmit herewith an agreement effected by exchange of notes, October 6, 1989, extending for the period of 2 years from December 31, 1989, until December 31, 1991, the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Japan Concerning Fisheries off the Coasts of the United States, signed at Washington on September 10, 1982. The exchange of notes, together with the present agreement, as amended, constitute a governing international fishery agreement within the meaning of section 201(c) of the Act.
Several U.S. fishing industry interests have urged prompt consideration of this agreement. Because of the importance of our fishing relationship with Japan, I urge that the Congress give favorable consideration of this agreement at an early date.
Since 60 calendar days of continuous session, as required by the legislation, will not be available before the current agreement is scheduled to expire, I recommend the Congress consider passage of a joint resolution approving the extension.
George Bush
The White House,
October 30, 1989.
