    HOUSTON, Texas – After seeing more than 2,500 attend Friday's Rally for Religious Liberty in Des Moines, IA, the Cruz for President campaign announced that there were more than 200 watch parties held around the country to view the rally. Those hosting the parties were given special access to watch online and invite their friends and neighbors to their homes or churches.
"It was important for us to have our nationwide leadership use this opportunity to invite their communities to hear more about religious liberty from Senator Cruz," said Campaign Manger Jeff Roe. "We couldn't be more pleased with the response. It shows there is widespread interest in Cruz's message and his fight to protect Americans' religious liberty."
Several watch parties in the early election states of New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada drew several dozen participants. More than two dozen activists from South Carolina visiting Ohio for a separate event took the time to gather and watch Cruz and his religious liberty heroes online.
