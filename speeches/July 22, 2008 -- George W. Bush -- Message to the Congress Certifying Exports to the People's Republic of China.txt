    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the provisions of section 1512 of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Public Law 105-261), I hereby certify that the export of 22 accelerometers for incorporation into railway geometry measurement systems and one 20-inch fluid energy mill for production of nutritional supplements is not detrimental to the United States space launch industry, and that the material and equipment, including any indirect technical benefit that could be derived from such exports, will not measurably improve the missile or space launch capabilities of the People's Republic of China.
