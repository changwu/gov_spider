Manchester, NH – Yesterday, Ann Romney joined local Romney supporters at the grand opening of the Romney for President New Hampshire Seacoast Office. The office is located at the Parade Mall, 195 Hanover Street in Portsmouth, and will serve as a primary location for Seacoast area Republicans to help elect Governor Romney.
'It is encouraging to see support for Mitt growing across the country, and especially, right here in New Hampshire. This Seacoast office will be a hub of activity for supporters who will help make the difference for Mitt on Election Day. As we move closer to the Primary, the campaign activity in this office and across the state will be vital to our campaign efforts and I am so glad I could be there for the official opening,' said Ann Romney.
'By opening this new office we will able to continue to grow our grassroots support throughout the state and reach more voters in this important area.
