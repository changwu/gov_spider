    I appreciate that the Senate today unanimously confirmed Ed Schafer to be our next Secretary of Agriculture. As a two-term Governor and business leader, Ed has distinguished himself as an executive with a proven record of results.
Ed will lead a department that oversees our food, agriculture, natural resources, food safety, and health and nutrition programs. He will be an advocate for farmers, ranchers, and consumers as he works to open new markets for their products. And he will work with the Congress to pass a responsible farm bill that will provide a safety net for farmers and protect our lands and the environment while at the same time ensuring Federal tax dollars are spent wisely.
I look forward to seeing Ed take his seat along with the rest of my Cabinet at this evening's State of the Union.
