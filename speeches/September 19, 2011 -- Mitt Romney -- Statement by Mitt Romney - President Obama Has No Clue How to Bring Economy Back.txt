    Mitt Romney today issued the following statement on President Obama's plan to raise taxes:
"President Obama's plan to raise taxes will have a crushing impact on economic growth. Higher taxes mean fewer jobs – it's that simple. This is yet another indication that President Obama has no clue how to bring our economy back. I encourage President Obama to look at my detailed economic plan to create long-term growth and prosperity for our nation. The only way to get our economy moving again is to elect a president who understands how to create jobs and rein in spending – that is why I am running."
