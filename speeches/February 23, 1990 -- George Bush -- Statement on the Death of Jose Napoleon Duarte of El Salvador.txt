    The President and Mrs. Bush are deeply saddened to hear of the death of former President Duarte. President Duarte was the father of Salvadoran democracy, a dedicated servant to the people of El Salvador, and a firm friend of the United States. His wisdom and dedication to the growth of democracy in Central America will be long remembered. President Duarte was also a strong supporter and exponent on behalf of human rights and social justice and has left a strong legacy in this area.
President Bush enjoyed a warm, close working relationship with President Duarte. President Bush admires the courage he exhibited in building the foundation of democracy in El Salvador and the message of hope he brought to all of Central America. The American people join the people of El Salvador in mourning their loss.
