    I am pleased that the United States has reached an agreement with France significantly increasing air service between our countries. The U.S.-France aviation market is our third largest in Europe. Until today, it was also our largest aviation market not governed by a bilateral agreement. This agreement will eliminate all restrictions on airline operations between the United States and France in 5 years. It will allow many more flights between our two countries and give U.S. airlines extensive new rights that will enhance their capacity to serve this market. This increased competition means more choice for American business travelers and tourists alike.
This agreement continues my efforts to open the world's markets in areas where American companies are most competitive. We have already concluded important aviation agreements with Japan, Germany, Canada, and many other nations. These agreements are part of our strategy to replace restrictions with opportunities and move international aviation into a 21st century where consumers, not governments, determine how passenger and cargo needs are served.
I want to thank Secretaries Albright and Slater and the negotiators at the Departments of State and Transportation for their sustained efforts in reaching this agreement.
