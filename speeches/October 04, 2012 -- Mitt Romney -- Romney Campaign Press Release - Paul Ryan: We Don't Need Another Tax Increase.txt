PAUL RYAN: "You know another issue that came up: taxes. Last night, President Obama made it very clear he's going to raise taxes. Today, Vice President Joe Biden made it even more clear. In Iowa, he said, he asked himself a question and he asked if he and President Obama want a trillion-dollar tax hike. And his response to himself was 'Yes, we do.' That's a direct quote, friends. Well, Virginia, no, we don't. Mitt's going to talk about this in a minute. But what we don't need is a trillion-dollar tax increase -- actually, it's a bit more than that. He was half-right. What we don't need is a tax increase on our successful job creators that will cost us 700,000 jobs."
