    To the Congress of the United States:
I take pleasure in transmitting the enclosed report for the Pemigewasset River in New Hampshire. The report and my recommendations are in response to the provisions of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, Public Law 90- 542, as amended. The Pemigewasset River study was authorized by Public Law 101-357.
The study was conducted by the National Park Service with assistance from a local study committee. The National Park Service determined that the 32.5-mile study segment is eligible for designation based upon its free-flowing character and outstanding scenic, recreational, geologic, fishery, and botanic values. However, in deference to the wishes of local adjoining communities, six of seven of whom voted against designation, and the State of New Hampshire, I am recommending that the Congress not consider designation at this time. If the local communities and/or the State should change their position in the future, the question of designation could be reevaluated.
