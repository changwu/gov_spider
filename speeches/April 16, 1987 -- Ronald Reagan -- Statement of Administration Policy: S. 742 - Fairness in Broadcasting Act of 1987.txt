    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Hollings (D) SC and three others)
The administration opposes enactment of S. 742, because the fairness doctrine: (1) is unnecessary in light of the dramatic increase in the number of information sources in recent years; (2) does not promote, but actually inhibits, the free and open discussion of important and controversial issues; and (3) may contravene important constitutional principles by inappropriately restricting the journalistic freedoms of broadcasters.
