    New ad, "American Dream," gives New Hampshire voters a look at Governor Patrick's life and professional experience
MANCHESTER, NH - During tonight's debate, Deval Patrick's campaign for president will air a new 30-second ad on CNN. The ad will offer New Hampshire voters an overview of Governor Patrick's life and professional experience. This ad placement comes on the heels of the campaign's announcement of its six-figure ad buy last week. The ad will continue to run in New Hampshire after the debate.
"There's no frontrunner in this race, and our campaign continues to build momentum in New Hampshire as other campaigns have started to wind down," Campaign Manager Abe Rakov said. "As more voters hear Deval's story, they are convinced that he's the candidate with the life and leadership experience to defeat Donald Trump and renew the American Dream for everyone, everywhere."
Entitled "American Dream" the 30-second spot was shot in Boston and Governor Patrick's hometown, on the South Side of Chicago. In the ad, Governor Patrick tells the story of his experience living the American dream. "I've led the Civil Rights division in the US Department of Justice, worked to make businesses more fair and socially responsible, and delivered first in the nation results as the only Democrat elected Governor of Massachusetts in 30 years. I'm living my American Dream, and I'm running for president to be sure you get to live yours," Governor Patrick says in the ad. In closing the ad, he says, "I approve this message because where other candidates have ideas, I have results."
