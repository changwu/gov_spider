    Today's terrorist bombing in Omagh was a barbaric act intended to wreck Northern Ireland's aspirations for peace and reconciliation. On behalf of every American, I condemn this butchery and hope that the culprits will be brought to justice quickly. I extend our deep sympathy to those affected by this tragedy. I renew my pledge to stand with the people of Northern Ireland against the perpetrators of violence; they will find no friends here.
Now is the time for the parties of peace in Northern Ireland to redouble their efforts.
