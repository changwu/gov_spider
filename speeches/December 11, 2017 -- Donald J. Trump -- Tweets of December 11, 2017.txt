Another false story this time in the Failing @nytimes that I watch 4-8 hours of television a day - Wrong! Also I seldom if ever watch CNN or MSNBC both of which I consider Fake News. I never watch Don Lemon who I once called the dumbest man on television! Bad Reporting.Retweets: 34018Favorites: 138768
