    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Mica (R) FL and 7 cosponsors)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 2675. The bill would provide Federal employees more options under the Federal Employees Group Life Insurance program and require the Office of Personnel Management to prepare legislation and a report on making universal life and additional accidental death and dismemberment insurance available to Federal employees.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2675 would affect direct spending; therefore, is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary estimate is that H.R. 2675 would increase direct spending by less than $500,000 annually.
