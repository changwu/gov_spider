But never mind that he has no idea how he'll do it (Marco does) — he used to sing a very different tune, praising the outsourcing of American jobs.
Here's what he had to say in a post on the blog of Trump "University" (the scam that ensnared thousands of working Americans), entitled "Outsourcing Creates Jobs in the Long Run":
We hear terrible things about outsourcing jobs—how sending work outside of our companies is contributing to the demise of American businesses. But in this instance I have to take the unpopular stance that it is not always a terrible thing.
I understand that outsourcing means that employees lose jobs. Because work is often outsourced to other countries, it means Americans lose jobs. In other cases, nonunion employees get the work. Losing jobs is never a good thing, but we have to look at the bigger picture.
Now that Trump wants to win a political office, he's abandoned the position he called unpopular, and promises he'll just stop outsourcing without any specific ideas whatsoever.
It's just one more reason we know he's a con artist, not the truth teller he's trying to campaign as — and that working Americans are the marks.
