    I am pleased the Senate voted to sustain my veto of H.R. 3, the Omnibus Trade bill. As I said in my veto message on the bill, I am committed to enactment of a responsible trade bill this year. I am directing my senior advisers to stand ready to assist the congressional leadership on a new trade billâ€”one that will strengthen America's international competitiveness and create even more new jobs for Americans.
