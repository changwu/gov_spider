    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced New Hampshire Small Business Leaders for John McCain, a coalition group of more than 80 small businessmen and women from a range of industries representing all ten counties. Dozens of Granite State small business owners and executives endorsed McCain's economic plan today, joining business leaders across the country who have praised his Jobs for America proposal to grow the economy as president.
"John McCain understands that small businesses represent the best of America's entrepreneurial spirit. In New Hampshire and across the country, smaller firms perform an irreplaceable community function and account for much of the nation's hiring," said Jim Burke, President of Burke Advertising in Bedford and Chair of New Hampshire Small Business Leaders for John McCain. "There is a lot on the line in this election for New Hampshire's small business owners and would-be entrepreneurs. It is important for the small business community to know that while John McCain will keep taxes low and fight burdensome regulations that stifle innovation, Barack Obama promises higher taxes that will make it harder for small businesses to grow and create jobs."
New Hampshire Small Business Leaders for John McCain gathered in the Legislative Office Building in Concord today to explain why McCain is the best candidate for the state's small business community. Highlighting the fact that small business is the backbone of the state's economy, the group will work to spread the word about McCain's pro-growth economic vision.
Karen Cervantes, an owner of Harrison Insurance in Lebanon said, "As a small business owner, I see firsthand how government decisions impact a company's bottom line. There's no question that higher taxes and government mandates drive up the cost of doing business and restrict a company's ability to thrive. In an election that many say is about change, it is critical for voters to cut through the rhetoric to see how the candidates' plans will affect their pocketbooks. John McCain understands that small business does best when government gets out of its way and he will create an environment in which smaller firms can thrive."
Today in Denver, Colorado John McCain announced his Jobs for America economic plan, kicking off five days of economy focused activity in critical battleground states.
