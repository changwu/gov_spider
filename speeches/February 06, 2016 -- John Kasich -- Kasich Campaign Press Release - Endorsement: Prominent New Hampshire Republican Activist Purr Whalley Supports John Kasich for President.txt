    Yesterday well-known New Hampshire Republican activist Purr Whalley announced that she has joined Governor John Kasich's presidential campaign as a member of the Kasich for America Steering Committee.
Said Whalley, "As the wife of former Deputy Speaker Mike Whalley, I know the experience needed to be a strong and effective leader, and Gov. Kasich has that experience. His record as a budget-balancer in Congress and as twice-elected Governor of Ohio proves he has the ability to get things accomplished and eliminate gridlock. That's what sets him aside from the other candidates in this race. I'm also impressed that he has run a campaign based on his own merits and has not resorted to negative campaigning."
With her endorsement of John Kasich's campaign, Whalley joins the ranks of former U.S. Senators Gordon Humphrey, John E. Sununu, Congressman Chuck Douglas and former Congressman Charlie Bass in supporting his candidacy.
A resident of Alton, Purr Whalley is a former owner of HK Powersports in Laconia. Long active in Republican politics in the Granite State, she previously served on former Governor George Pataki's campaign steering committee.
Said Kasich, "I value Purr Whalley's friendship and I am thrilled to have her insights and energy on my side as a member of the Kasich for America Steering Committee. This is another strong step forward for our campaign here in New Hampshire."
