    The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1590, authorizes the development and enforcement of standards to assure safe and healthful working conditions for employees in the private sector. Section 19 of that Act makes each Federal agency head responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective and comprehensive occupational safety and health program which is consistent with the standards promulgated by the Secretary of Labor for businesses affecting interstate commerce.
Section 7902 of Title 5, United States Code, authorizes the President to establish by Executive Order a safety council composed of representatives of Federal agencies and of labor organizations representing employees to serve as an advisory body to the Secretary of Labor in carrying out a Federal safety program.
As the Nation's largest employer, the Federal Government has a special obligation to set an example for safe and healthful employment. It is appropriate that the Federal Government strengthen its efforts to assure safe and healthful working conditions for its own employees.
Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 7902 of Title 5 of the United States Code, and as President of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:
ESTABLISHMENT OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH PROGRAMS IN FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES
SECTION 1. The head of each Federal department and agency shall establish an occupational safety and health program (hereinafter referred to as a safety program) in compliance with the requirements of section 7902 of Title 5 of the United States Code and section 19(a) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (which Act shall hereinafter be referred to as the Safety Act).
The programs shall be consistent with the standards prescribed by section 6 of the Safety Act. In providing safety programs for Federal employees, the head of each Federal department and agency shall
(1) Designate or appoint a qualified official who shall be responsible for the management of the safety program within his agency.
(2) Establish (A) a safety policy; (B) an organization and a set of procedures, providing for appropriate consultation with employees, that will permit that policy to be implemented effectively; (C) a safety management information system; (D) goals and objectives for reducing and eliminating employee injuries and occupational illnesses; (E) periodic inspections of workplaces to ensure compliance with standards; (F) plans and procedures for evaluating the program's effectiveness; and (G) priorities with respect to the factors which cause occupational injury and illness so that appropriate countermeasures can be developed.
(3) Correct conditions that do not meet safety and health standards.
(4) Submit to the Secretary of Labor by April 1 of each year a report containing (A) the status of his agency's safety program in reducing injuries and occupational illnesses to personnel during the preceding calendar year as related to the goals and objectives established for that year; (B) goals and objectives for the current year;
