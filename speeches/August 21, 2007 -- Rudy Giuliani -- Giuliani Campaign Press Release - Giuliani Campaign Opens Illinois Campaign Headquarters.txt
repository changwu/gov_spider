    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today officially opened its Illinois campaign office. The Illinois headquarters, located in Lisle, will house Rudy's Illinois staff and serve as the base of operations for volunteer activities in the state.
Illinois Campaign Chairman Tom Cross and National Campaign Manager Michael DuHaime attended the opening.
"Rudy Giuliani is the only Republican candidate that can win Illinois in the primary and general elections," DuHaime said. "With today's office opening, recent campaign staff hires and our high level endorsements in Illinois, we are in an excellent position to build support and keep our momentum in the state."
Today's office opening follows the recent endorsements of U.S. Representatives Jerry Weller and Judy Biggert.
