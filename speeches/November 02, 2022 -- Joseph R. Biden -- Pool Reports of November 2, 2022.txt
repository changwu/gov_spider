White House In-Town Pool Report #7 - POTUS remarks conclude
President Biden finished his appearance at 3 p.m.
Some highlights:
President Biden observed a first-year apprentice demonstrate the technique for laying bricks, and expressed interest in how the bricks themselves are cut (answer: either by hammer or trowel).
Biden called union workers the "best-trained" in the world, particularly the apprentice, who he suggested could do some work in Wilmington.
"What are you doing this weekend?"
The president also observed a fourth-year millwright apprentice train with a virtual reality welder.
President Biden said that the apprentice, who is fourth-generation union, was guaranteeing herself "a good job and a middle-class life," and deemed the VR welding tech "pretty cool."
"God love ya-those four generations built this country," Biden said.
Representatives of the IBEW showed off an electric charging station and told President Biden that the price per charge - roughly nine dollars for a standard electric vehicle - is a vast improvement on "five dollars a gallon." President Biden stage-whispered that "I got that down."
Asked from the assembled press about his remarks tonight, President Biden said: "Listen to them man- you'll be impressed.

White House In-Town Pool Report #15 - two-minute warning for POTUS
President Biden's remarks, expected to be roughly twenty minutes long, are set to begin in two minutes.
The Columbus Club - where couples who really love trains can, for a $6,500 rental fee, accommodate 350 guests for a cocktail wedding reception and 200 for a seated dinner - is filled not quite to capacity, with roughly 130 seated guests, not including press and staff. The audience is primarily younger (college students and some union apprentices, per a White House aide)

White House In-Town Pool Report #17 - POTUS finishes speaking
President Biden concluded his remarks, which emphasized the "damaging, corrosive and destructive" nature of election denialism and political violence, at 7.22 p.m.
In his remarks, the president warned that "MAGA Republicans" have contributed to a climate where some Americans have developed an "appetite for autocracy."
"We don't settle our differences with a riot, or a mob, or a bullet, or a hammer," President Biden said, referring to the attack on Paul Pelosi. "We settle them peacably at the ballot box."
President Biden said that those who are willing to use violence to achieve political ends are a "distinct minority" in America, "but they are loud and they are determined."
Candidates who are poised to refuse to accept the results of next week's election, President Biden said, are choosing "a path to chaos in America."
"It's unprecented, it's unlawful, and it's un-American."
Biden closed with his familiar Jon Meacham-crafted line: "The fate if the soul of america lies where it always does - with the people."
(Please forgive tardiness of these reports - the wireless reception in Union Station is trash garbage.)
