    Today, Laura Rosenberger issued the following statement on the anniversary of Ukraine's Independence:
"25 years ago, the citizens of Ukraine boldly declared their independence from the Soviet Union and affirmed their right to self determination. Today, as we observe this Independence Day, Ukrainians honor the legacy of that courageous act, and those who have sacrificed for those ideals and principles in the years since, including on the Maidan.
"Through her multiple visits to Ukraine, Secretary Clinton has seen firsthand the passion with which Ukrainians fight for these ideals in the face of persistent adversity. She remains a staunch ally and advocate as they continue to defend their sovereignty.
"Together, we also acknowledge and celebrate the rich contributions of Ukrainian-Americans to the fabric of American life, and their deep commitment to the ideals of democracy and freedom."
