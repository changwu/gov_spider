    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
REVISION(House)(Rep. Coehlo (D) California and four others)
The Administration strongly opposes enactment of H.J.Res. 192 as reported from Committee. While the Administration is unalterably opposed to genocide and this resolution calls for a day of remembrance for all victims of genocide, it singles out only one event in history for censure and implicit condemnation.
The resolution charges the Turkish nation with the crime of genocide for events that took place between 1915 and 1923 and unfairly places the whole burden of tragedy in human history on one group. As it is written, the resolution cannot heal the wounds of the past, but strongly risks seriously damaging U.S. relations with Turkey, a staunch NATO ally which provides military and other facilities important to the security of the United States. Furthermore, enactment of this resolution risks encouraging further terrorist acts against Turks and others.
The Administration would support the Murtha/Hansen substitute as an appropriate way to address the concerns of Armenian Americans and others. It condemns genocide without singling out a specific event, date, nation, government or people and urges reconciliation rather than promoting division among people. Moreover, it expresses the deep moral conviction to condemn and to strive to end all inhumane acts, wherever and by whomever they are perpetuated. If this substitute fails, we strongly urge defeat of the resolution.
