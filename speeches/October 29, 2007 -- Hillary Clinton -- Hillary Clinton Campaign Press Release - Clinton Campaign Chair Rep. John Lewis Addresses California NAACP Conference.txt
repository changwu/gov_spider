    LOS ANGELES -Civil rights leader and Clinton Campaign Chair Congressman John Lewis addressed the California NAACP conference Saturday, outlining Hillary Clinton's 35-year record fighting for children and families and her commitment to expanding opportunity for all Americans.
During his remarks, Rep. Lewis highlighted Clinton's commitment to protecting civil rights, improving our schools, defending affirmative action and rebuilding the road to the middle class for African Americans.
"As President, Hillary will partner with us to increase opportunities for African Americans - by improving our schools, our health care system, expanding access to capital, putting home ownership back in reach, and cracking down on predatory lenders targeting African American communities," said Rep. Lewis to the hundreds of conference attendees. "Hillary has been a friend to African Americans, and I believe she has the strength and experience to bring positive change to our community."
Rep. Lewis is a civil rights pioneer who has devoted his life to equal rights for all Americans. From his days as a Freedom Rider and the head of the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee, to his leadership of the "Bloody Sunday" march in Selma, Alabama, Rep. Lewis has been one of the most respected figures in the civil rights movement for four decades.
He has represented Georgia's 5th Congressional District for the last 20 years, where he is Senior Chief Deputy Whip for the Democratic Party leadership in the House.
