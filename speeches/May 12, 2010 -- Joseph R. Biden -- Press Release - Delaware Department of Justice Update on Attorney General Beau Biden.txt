    Attorney General Biden continues his favorable progress after sustaining a mild stroke yesterday. He will continue to follow standard protocol and receive medical therapy over the coming days, as is typical for any patient recovering from an event like this.
He looks forward to returning to his duties as Attorney General in the near future.
