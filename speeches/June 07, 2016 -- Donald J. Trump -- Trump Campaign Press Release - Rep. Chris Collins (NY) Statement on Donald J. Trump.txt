    Congressman Chris Collins released the following statement today as the Republican primary season wraps up and Donald Trump looks towards Election Day:
"Donald Trump has energized millions of Americans across this country by ignoring political correctness and directly addressing the issues affecting everyday Americans. This November voters will have a choice between a scandal plagued career politician who will push another four years of Barack Obama's failed policies, and a chief executive who is committed to changing Washington. For the millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet. The choice is clear.
"Donald Trump has the guts and fortitude to tackle the serious challenges facing our country, and like he has done throughout his business career, he will help America win again. He is committed to reducing our deficit, helping our veterans and standing strong in support of our Constitutional rights. When Mr. Trump tells America he will be a president who will create jobs, win negotiations and stand up to our enemies, voters believe him because he has done it his whole career."
