"Americans are worried and the world is watching. It is time for us to rise up and fight. Our ancestors are calling us to join this battle, so I will do it gladly. Join me for love of country. We need a President and a Senate who can bring dignity back to our country and immediately command respect on the world stage. Winning the White House is only half of the battle. In order to change our course we must win the Senate. I'm supporting Joe Biden because he can do both." said DNC Committee Member Bill Shaheen.
"After careful consideration of our many talented candidates, I believe Joe Biden is the best candidate to lead us forward to a moral, compassionate America which restores our faith in the American dream of equal opportunity, access to healthcare, innovation in industry, and international stability," said former NH Senate President Sylvia Larsen.
"After studying this talented field, I'm proud to announce that I'm endorsing Joe Biden for President. When we choose a nominee, we need to pick the person who can unite the Democratic Party, unite the country, defeat Donald Trump, and work to heal our divided nation.

We need him in the White House to bring the American people together, set a more positive course and get things done," said former New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Joe Keefe.
