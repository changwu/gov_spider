    President Trump's failures on COVID-19 and the economy have devastated countless families across North Carolina, and communities like the Lumbee Tribe in Robeson County — which has some of the highest rates of infection and deaths in the state — have borne the consequences of his disastrous leadership.
Yet President Trump has failed to outline any plan to stop this pandemic. With the state's unemployment rate rising to 7.3% in September, more North Carolinians are struggling to pay rent or put food on the table, but President Trump is downplaying the crisis and failing to lead on getting relief to working people.
As President, I will do more than talk — I will do the work. I will bring North Carolinians together to tackle this pandemic. And I will work to make sure the Lumbee Tribe finally receives full federal recognition and ensure communities in every corner of North Carolina have the resources needed to tackle this pandemic and create economic opportunity for everyone.
