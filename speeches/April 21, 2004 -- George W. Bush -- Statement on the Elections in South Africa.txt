    I congratulate President Thabo Mbeki on South Africa's third democratic national election and his party's election victory. The United States also congratulates the people of South Africa as they celebrate on April 27 the 10th anniversary of freedom and democracy replacing apartheid rule. The United States welcomes the peaceful exercise of democracy demonstrated by the Government and people of the Republic of South Africa. All competing parties deserve recognition for playing their role in a multiparty democracy. We commend their acceptance of the outcome and their use of the legal system and the rule of law to resolve disputes.
