    President Bush will host NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson for a meeting and working luncheon on November 12, 2003. This visit will mark Lord Robertson's final visit to the United States as Secretary General.
NATO remains central to America's security, to our ties with Europe, and to our common efforts to support peace and freedom in Europe and beyond. Under Lord Robertson's leadership, NATO has embarked on a major transformation aimed at addressing the security challenges of the 21st century. Today, NATO is leading counterterrorist maritime operations in the Mediterranean; peacekeeping missions in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo; and is supporting the Polish division in Iraq. The President and Lord Robertson will discuss these issues, and planning for the 2004 NATO Summit in Istanbul.
