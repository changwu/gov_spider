    Pembroke, NH â€” Texas Gov. Rick Perry today made the following statement regarding Syria:
"The Obama Administration's call for Syrian President Assad to step down is long overdue. President Assad threatens the safety and security not only of the Syrian people, but the entire Middle East. He also supports terrorist organizations Hezbollah and Hamas. Every diplomatic option should be brought to bear to prevent President Assad from wreaking further violence on his people and the region."
