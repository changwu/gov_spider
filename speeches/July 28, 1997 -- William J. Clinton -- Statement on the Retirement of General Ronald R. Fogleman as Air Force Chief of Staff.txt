    Today General Ronald Fogleman, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, announced that he plans to retire in September, after 34 years of active duty service.
It has been a great privilege for me to work closely with General Fogleman over the last 3 years. I want to take this opportunity to commend this extraordinary officer for his dedicated service to our Nation. For over three decades, in war and peace, General Fogleman has demonstrated his inspirational leadership and dedication to the men and women of the Air Force. As Chief of Staff, his clear vision and tireless championship of air and space power have shaped the U.S. Air Force for the challenges of the 21st century. These are his legacies.
General Fogleman's leadership and wise counsel will truly be missed in the senior decisionmaking ranks of our national security structure. Hillary and I wish him and Miss Jane the very best.
