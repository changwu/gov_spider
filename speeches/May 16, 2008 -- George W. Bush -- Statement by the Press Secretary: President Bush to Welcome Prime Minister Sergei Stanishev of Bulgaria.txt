    Visit of Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev of Bulgaria
President Bush will welcome Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev of Bulgaria to the White House on June 18, 2008. Bulgaria and the United States work closely together as NATO Allies to advance global freedom and security, including through our efforts to secure freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan and in promoting the stability and Euro-Atlantic integration of the countries of the Western Balkans. Under Prime Minister Stanishev's leadership, Bulgaria has advanced key reforms and become one of the two newest members of the European Union in 2007. Our two nations are committed to deepening our economic ties and to strengthening our cooperation on energy security. The President looks forward to discussing these and other issues with Prime Minister Stanishev.
