    I congratulate the people and Government of Kyrgyzstan for yesterday's democratic and peaceful Presidential election. In casting their ballots, the Kyrgyz people have taken an important and courageous step on the path of democracy and demonstrated their commitment to an orderly and open transition of power. I commend President Otunbaeva for her leadership and for her dedication to a vision of peaceful, democratic change. I also congratulate the many Kyrgyz leaders in Government and civil society who worked to realize this moment of promise. The people of Kyrgyzstan will have a partner in the United States as they undertake the hard work of building upon the democratic gains of the past 18 months and realizing a democratic, prosperous, and just future for all Kyrgyz citizens.
