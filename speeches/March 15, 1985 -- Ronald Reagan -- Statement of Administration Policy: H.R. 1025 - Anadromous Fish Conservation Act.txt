    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Breaux (D) Louisiana)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1025 because the 1986 Budget does not propose funding for the fisheries grant program that would be authorized by this bill. As the primary beneficiaries of such a program, the States should assume responsibility for program funding.
