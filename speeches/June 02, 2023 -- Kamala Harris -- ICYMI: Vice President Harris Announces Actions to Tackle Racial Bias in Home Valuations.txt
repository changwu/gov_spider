    Yesterday, Vice President Kamala Harris announced a series of new actions the Biden-Harris Administration is taking to root out racial bias in home valuations—ensuring that all hardworking families can realize the true value of their investment and have a fair shot at the American dream.
The Vice President announced that the Administration issued a proposed rule requiring banks to confirm their appraisal algorithms are not biased; new guidance to make it easier for consumers to appeal what they suspect to be a biased valuation; and the release of the valuation data on 600,000 homes, contributing to the nation's first publicly available home appraisal dataset.
The announcements come on the two year anniversary of President Biden and Vice President Harris creating the Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity Task Force (PAVE), which focuses on identifying and rooting out systemic home appraisal bias. Last year, Vice President Harris announced the PAVE Action Plan, which included the most wide-ranging set of actions ever announced to advance equity and root out racial and ethnic bias in home valuations.
