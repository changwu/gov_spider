    Des Moines, IA -- US Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign today announced that Senator Obama will return to Iowa for a 2-day trip on Sunday and Monday.
On Sunday, Obama will host a town hall in Marion before attending Representative Bruce Braley's fundraiser in Cedar Falls and 'Meet the Candidate' events in Grundy Center and Allison. On Monday, Obama will host a town hall meeting at Iowa Central Community College in Fort Dodge after hosting a 'Meet the Candidate' event in Clarion.
Last weekend, at the Iowa Democratic Party's Jefferson Jackson Dinner, Senator Obama was declared the "oratorical winner" by the Washington Post when he delivered what the Des Moines Register's David Yepsen called a "moving" and "excellent" speech. Obama's speech, which Yepsen wrote could be seen as "turning point" in the campaign, was greeted with rousing applause by the more than 3,000 Iowans who were in attendance on Saturday night in support of Obama.
