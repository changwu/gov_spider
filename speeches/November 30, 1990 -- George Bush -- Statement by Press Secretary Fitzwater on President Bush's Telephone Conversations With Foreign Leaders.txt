    President Bush called a number of foreign leaders this afternoon to discuss his proposal that Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq `Aziz meet with U.S. and other representatives in December, and that Secretary of State Baker travel to Baghdad to meet with [President] Saddam Hussein. All the leaders received President Bush's initiative enthusiastically and reiterated their desires for achieving the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait, the restoration of the legitimate government of Kuwait, and the release of all hostages. President Bush spoke with Presidents Mubarak [of Egypt] and Ozal [of Turkey], King Fahd [of Saudi Arabia], Prime Minister Major [of the United Kingdom], and the Amir of Kuwait.
