    I HAVE just completed talks with officials of several of the steel companies and of the steel workers union.
In view of the mounting impact of the strike on our nation's economy and on the jobs of hundreds of thousands of Americans, I sincerely hope that an agreement can be initiated before my return to Washington next week.
The purpose of the talks today was to help bring about a voluntary settlement of the steel strike which will be fair and just to. all parties involved, including the public. I am persuaded that this is the kind of settlement that the American people want. It is the only kind that would be good for all Americans and for our whole economy.
