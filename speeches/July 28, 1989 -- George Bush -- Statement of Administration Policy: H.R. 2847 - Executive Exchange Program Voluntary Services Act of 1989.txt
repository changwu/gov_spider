    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
NOT SENT, per Murr 8/1/89
(House)(Sikorski (D) MN)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2847. This bill would extend for one year a temporary feature of the Executive Exchange program’ under which the Federal Government may accept the full-time services of ten high-level private sector executives. Under this program, these executives continue to have their salaries paid by their private employers while conducting public business. Continuation of this temporary experimental program would conflict with the principles reflected in the President's proposed ethics legislation now pending before Congress.
The Administration would, however, not object to enactment of a bill to "grandfather" the two individuals — one executive already employed and one selectee — who would be adversely affected by the program's termination on September 30, 1989.
