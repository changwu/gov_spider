    Packed with radical policies and politicians, the first night of the Democrat convention failed to discuss the issues Americans care about.
Last night, Americans who tuned into the Democrat convention heard lots of talk about far-left policies from out-of-touch speakers. If you managed to stay awake, you were treated to:

A speech from a registered Russian lobbyist
A painful, tired joke about Home Alone 2
The governor who's overseen the worst coronavirus response in the country calling the pandemic a "metaphor"

What you didn't hear was anything about the important issues the American people are concerned about. Below is a list of just some of the things Democrats failed to mention on the first night of their convention:

Joe Biden's plan to raise $4 trillion in taxes
Bringing back American jobs
Raising wages
The threat posed by China
School choice
Securing the border
Biden's plan to halt all deportations
Biden's plan to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants
American energy independence
The cost of Biden's radical energy plans
A condemnation of the "Defund The Police" movement
A defense of Second Amendment rights
Giving veterans the care they deserve
Reducing health care costs
Fighting the scourge of opioid addiction
