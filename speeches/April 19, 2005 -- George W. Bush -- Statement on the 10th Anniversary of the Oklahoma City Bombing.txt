    The 10th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing takes us back to the terrible tragedy that touched all Americans and took the lives of so many from Oklahoma City. We remember the malice that led to the death of 168 innocent people in the Murrah Federal Building. For the survivors of this crime and for the families of the dead, the pain goes on. We also remember the many acts of courage and kindness we saw in the midst of that horror. Oklahoma City will always be one of those places in our national memory where the worst and the best both came to pass. We pray for the lives that were lost that day, and we pray for their families. We ask God for strength and peace for those who lost so much.
