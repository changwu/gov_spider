    Clinton to Visit Conway Thursday, Nov. 8
MANCHESTER, NH - Joining the surging support Hillary Clinton has been receiving from communities across the state, State Representative Thomas Buco of Conway today announced that he has endorsed Hillary for President. In 2004, Buco was the first Democrat to be elected in Carroll County in nearly three decades. He is currently serving his second term in the State House and since then four more Democrats have been elected to the State House.
"At a time when our country is facing serious issues both at home and abroad, we need a leader who can rise above negative politics and focus on talking to New Hampshire voters about her detailed, specific plans to confront these challenges head on," said Rep. Buco. "Hillary Clinton is an experienced leader with strong plans to end the war in Iraq, provide universal health care for every American, and help boost the economies of communities like Conway. She is the one candidate with a positive message who can deliver the real change this country so desperately needs."
Last week following the Democratic debate in Philadelphia in yet another sign that negative attack politics are being rejected by New Hampshire voters, State Senator Lou D'Alessandro, citing Hillary's positive focus on the issues that matter, became the eighth State Senator to endorse Hillary for President. Hillary will be returning to the Granite State Wednesday and Thursday and her trip will include a visit to Conway.
"Representative Buco is a strong, bipartisan leader who knows how to get things done for his constituents. I am honored to have his support," said Senator Clinton. "I will look to him to share my detailed plans to bring about the change we all need with his neighbors in communities across Carroll County and the state of New Hampshire."
