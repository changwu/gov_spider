The new Marco Rubio website is being launched today with two goals in mind: 
1. To talk about the big issues facing our nation and the solutions that can rebuild the American Dream.
2. To recruit, organize and activate a team of conservatives with can-do spirit who are willing to do the hard work it will take to turn our nation around.
Don't see an issue that you care deeply about or want to know my opinion on? Don't worry. This website will be updated every single day with new content for us to discuss. We will also be providing new tools for you to spread the word both online and offline.
Please don't forget to also join the conversation on Facebook and Twitter. Also connect directly with our grassroots staff on Twitter.
Will you rise to the challenge and take back our legacy as the only nation on Earth that offers unrestricted opportunity to all?
