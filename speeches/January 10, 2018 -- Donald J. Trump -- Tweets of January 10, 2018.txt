It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts.Retweets: 26665Favorites: 108152

The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way totally without authorization is a disgrace. Must have tough Primary!Retweets: 22740Favorites: 92227

The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues. There was no collusion everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion & yet on and on it goes. Russia & the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. Republicans should finally take control!Retweets: 28805Favorites: 119548
