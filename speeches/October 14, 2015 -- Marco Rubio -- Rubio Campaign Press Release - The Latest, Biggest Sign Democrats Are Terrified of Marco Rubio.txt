Here's what Bill Clinton said about Marco:
"We've got to DESTROY HIM before he gets off the ground."

Why are the Clintons — and Democrats in general — so worried about Marco? The source of this latest report, Ed Klein, explained on Fox this morning:
ED KLEIN: [Bill Clinton] went down the entire list of the Republican candidates, and came to the conclusion that Marco Rubio would present Hillary with the greatest challenge, because of his age, generational change . . . he could be a very formidable challenger.
STEVE DOOCY: So, your source says Bill Clinton feels that Marco Rubio is the one they need to take out?
ED KLEIN: Exactly. Not my opinion — it's Bill Clinton's opinion and I take Bill Clinton's opinion on those kinds of things.
  We've known for months now that Marco is the Clinton campaign's #1 target on the Republican side. But now we know that the fear of facing Marco next November goes straight to the top and they're going to do whatever it takes to "destroy" Marco.

When the Clintons promise to "destroy" someone that means only one thing: the full force of the Left's attack operation will be trained directly on Marco and our campaign.
