    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement in response to the Senate's confirmation of Leslie Southwick to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit:
"I am very disappointed that the Senate voted to confirm Leslie Southwick to the federal bench this morning. His record suggests that he will be responsible for a raft of decisions against the interests of workers, consumers and the civil rights of all Americans. Federal judges should understand and enforce the full range of Americans' constitutional protections, but Judge Southwick fails that standard."
