    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Goodling (R) PA and 18 others)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 5 as a major step towards ensuring high-quality educational opportunity for all students. Reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) reaffirms and strengthens this commitment to children with disabilities and their parents. This legislation is the product of comprehensive bipartisan negotiations involving both chambers of the Congress and the Administration, with broad public input from many individuals and organizations. It places a strong emphasis on teaching and learning, and will do much to help improve educational results for the 5.8 million children with disabilities who are served under the IDEA.
