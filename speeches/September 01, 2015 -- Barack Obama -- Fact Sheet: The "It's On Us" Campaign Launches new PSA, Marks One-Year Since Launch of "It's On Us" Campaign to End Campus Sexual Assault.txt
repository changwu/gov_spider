"The One Thing" marks the third PSA released by "It's On Us" and comes just a few weeks before the one-year anniversary of the launch of "It's On Us," created to increase education and awareness around preventing sexual violence on college and university campuses.
On Wednesday, September 2, Valerie Jarrett, Senior Advisor to the President, will deliver opening remarks at the National Sexual Assault Conference in Los Angeles, where she will highlight the PSA and progress made by the White House to combat sexual assault.
President Obama and Vice President Biden have made it a national priority to root out sexual violence and domestic violence wherever they exist. Soon after taking office, the President created the White House Council on Women and Girls and named the first-ever White House Advisor on Violence Against Women. Over the last six years, the President and Vice President have led the way in tackling the problem everywhere, from college and university campuses to the military to tribal lands and beyond.

• On September 19, 2014, President Obama and Vice President Biden unveiled "It's On Us," in partnership with Generation Progress at the Center for American Progress. "It's On Us" recognizes that the solution to sexual assault begins with all of us. It seeks to reframe the conversation surrounding sexual assault in a way that inspires everyone to see it as his or her responsibility to do something, big or small, to prevent it.

• "It's On Us" now has over 90 partners including media, sports leagues and conferences, sexual assault prevention organizations, non-profit organizations, and corporations. View the full list of partners here: >www.itsonus.org/<#partners 
Key Highlights of the Administration's Record Fighting Sexual Violence

• In 2009, President Obama signed an Executive Order creating the White House Council on Women and Girls. In his remarks at the signing, the President underscored that the purpose of the Council is "to ensure that each of the agencies in which they're charged takes into account the needs of women and girls in the policies they draft, the programs they create, the legislation they support" and that the true purpose of our government is "to ensure that in America, all things are still possible for all people." The Council has developed work streams focused on how women's lives are changing in five critical areas: Families and Income; Education; Employment; Health; and Crime and Violence.
• In 2009, the Vice President appointed the first ever White House Advisor on Violence Against Women to advise the White House on issues of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. The Advisor serves as a liaison to the advocacy community and promotes collaboration across federal agencies. This first-of-its kind inter-agency approach to reducing violence against women has resulted in an unprecedented level of coordination among federal agencies and advancements in efforts to prevent and improve responses to violence against women and girls of all ages. Additionally, the President appointed the United States' first-ever Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues at the beginning of his Administration.
• In March 2010, the President signed the Affordable Care Act, which provides individuals who have experienced domestic, sexual, and dating violence with the economic security of affordable health insurance. Because of the law, most health plans must now cover preventive services, including screening and counseling for domestic or intimate partner violence, at no cost to the consumer. And insurers can no longer deny health coverage or charge a higher premium because a woman is a domestic violence survivor.
• In 2010, the Office of the Vice President and the White House Council on Women and Girls held the first-ever White House roundtable on sexual assault. This gathering of researchers, legal experts, and advocates led to a greater focus on sexual assault within VAWA grant programs.
• In October 2010, President Obama and Vice President Biden announced 15 new action steps across the federal government to reduce domestic violence and sexual assault, covering everything from housing to Head Start to financial literacy, protection orders and rape kit testing. This was the first time any Administration had asked each Cabinet member to do something to end violence against women.
• In 2010, the Office of Victims of Crime (OVC) began a partnership with the FBI Office for Victim Assistance and the Indian Health Service (IHS) to enhance the response to victims of sexual violence in Indian Country. The AI/AN Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner-Sexual Assault Response Team (SANE-SART) Initiative continues to address the acute needs of tribal victims of sexual violence through focused efforts to build the capacity of tribal communities to provide coordinated, community-based, victim-centered responses.

• In September 2011, the Vice President released a video on twitter and YouTube asking students how to make colleges campuses safer. The overwhelming response was "get men involved." As a result, 11 regional forums were held around the country focusing on getting men involved in ending violence against women. The Departments of Education, Health and Human Services and Housing and Urban Development collaborated with local communities to host these events.
• In 2012, the President issued an Executive Order on Preventing and Responding to Violence Against Women and Girls Globally to enhance the Administration's efforts to advance the rights of women and girls and to promote gender equality in U.S. foreign policy.

It enhanced statutory protections for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking and expanded the types of HUD housing programs that offer these protections. VAWA 2013 integrated homicide reduction training into VAWA programs, and included reauthorization of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA). The Administration's 2015 budget invested more than $430 million in VAWA programs, and the Administration's 2016 budget requests an unprecedented $473.5 million for VAWA programs.
• The Administration has also adopted a series of Executive Actions to address sexual assault in the military, including measures to improve command accountability, expand victims' rights within the military justice system, increase training across the ranks, and provide new support for victims.

• In January 2014, the Office of the Vice President and the White House Council on Women and Girls released Rape and Sexual Assault: A Renewed Call to Action, which analyzes data about rape and sexual assault, identifies those most at risk of victimization, examines the cost of the violence, describes the response of the criminal justice system, and identifies areas for further action.
• Additionally, in January 2014, President Obama and Vice President Biden created the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, to be co-chaired by the Vice President's office and the White House Council on Women and Girls. After 27 listening sessions with stakeholders across the country, the Task Force released its first report – Not Alone – with new recommendations for schools to prevent and respond to sexual assault and new steps by federal agencies to improve enforcement of federal laws. The work of the Task Force is ongoing.
• On April 29, 2014, the Administration released a new PSA on sexual assault featuring the President, Vice President, and celebrity actors. The message of the PSA was simple: if she doesn't consent- or if she can't consent- it's a crime. And if you see it happening, help her, don't blame her, speak up. On that same day, the Administration released the first report of the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault. Highlights include urging schools to conduct climate surveys; recommending schools have confidential advocates to support victims and provide information about reporting; providing schools with best practices for preventing sexual assault; and developing training for school officials and campus health centers.

Selected Grant Programs

• Through the Violence Against Women Act, over $400 million of funding is provided each year through more than 20 different national grant programs, which are administered by the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women, to reduce domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. Most of these programs are focused on addressing those four crimes. The following are some of the grant programs that specifically focus on sexual assault:

The grant provides resources for states and territories to help support rape crisis centers, and other nonprofit, and nongovernmental programs that provide services for sexual assault survivors.
o The State and Territorial Sexual Assault Coalitions Program provides grants to the sexual assault coalition in each state and territory. Statewide sexual assault coalitions provide direct support to member rape crisis centers through funding, training and technical assistance, public awareness activities, and public policy advocacy.
