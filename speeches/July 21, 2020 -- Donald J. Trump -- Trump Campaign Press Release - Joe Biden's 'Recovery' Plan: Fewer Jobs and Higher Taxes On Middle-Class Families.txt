    Your wallet won't be safe in Joe Biden's America. 
Joe Biden is wandering out of his basement today with more of the same failed, old, liberal ideas he's been peddling for half a century. Biden is proposing yet another nearly $800 billion in federal spending disguised as an economic plan, on top of the $2 trillion spending he proposed just last week â€“ all while purposefully killing millions of good-paying union jobs and then demanding middle-class Americans foot the bill.
As Biden's unaffordable left-wing agenda gets more expensive by the day, it's obvious why he plans to raise taxes on the middle-class. Multiple studies have all unanimously concluded that Biden's tax plan would raise taxes on Americans at every income level, and Biden himself has pledged to bring back the health care tax that disproportionately hurts lower-income families. In addition to being gut-punched by Biden's tax hikes, Americans will have to grapple with Biden's war on energy, which will cause higher gasoline and electricity prices while decimating millions of energy jobs.
President Trump is already leading the way to rebuild, restore, and renew the U.S. economy. May and June saw back-to-back record-high job growth, rebounding retail and housing sales, and falling unemployment claims. President Trump built a roaring economy once, and he will do it again. 
There's a reason Joe Biden presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression the last time he was in charge: Biden simply has no clue. Just like the rest of the radical Democrats who have co-opted his campaign, the only thing Biden knows how to do is raise taxes, kill jobs, and pass regulations that strangle small businesses.
