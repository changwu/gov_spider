    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an Agreement effected by exchange of notes May 13, 1987, extending for the period of 2 years from July 1, 1987, until July 1, 1989, and amending to conform with current United States law, the Governing International Fishery Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Korea, signed at Washington on July 26, 1982. The exchange of notes together with the present Agreement constitute a Governing International Fishery Agreement within the requirements of section 201(c) of the Act.
Several U.S. fishing industry interests have urged prompt consideration of this Agreement. Because of the importance of our fishing relationship with Korea, I urge that the Congress give favorable consideration to this Agreement at an early date.
Since 60 calendar days of continuous session, as required by the legislation, may not be available before the current Agreement is scheduled to expire, I recommend that the Congress consider passage of a joint resolution to bring into force the Agreement of May 13, 1987.
