    To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith the 1977 Annual Report on the Administration of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act (Public Law 90-602) as prepared by the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.
The report recommends that those sections of subpart 3, Part F of Title HI of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 262 et. seq. (Public Law 602), which require the compilation of this annual report be repealed. This report cost $3,780 to prepare.
All of the information found in this report is available to Congress on a more immediate basis through Congressional committee oversight and budget hearings and the FDA Annual Report. We have concluded that this annual report serves little useful purpose and diverts agency resources from more productive activities.
