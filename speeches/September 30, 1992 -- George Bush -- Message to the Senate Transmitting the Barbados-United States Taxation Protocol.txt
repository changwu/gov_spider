    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the Protocol Amending the Convention Between the United States of America and Barbados for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income signed on December 31, 1984, which protocol was signed at Washington on December 18, 1991. I also transmit for the information of the Senate the Report of the Department of State.
In addition, I transmit herewith, for the information of the Senate, Understandings Regarding the Scope of the Limitation on Benefits Article in the U.S. -- Barbados Protocol. Although not submitted for the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, this document is relevant to the consideration of the protocol by the Senate.
The protocol amends the 1984 income tax convention with Barbados, which has been in force since February 28, 1986, to modify certain provisions of the convention.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.
