    America is thankful for the service and sacrifice of the National Guard and Reserve forces and their families. In keeping with the President's commitment to improve benefits and quality of life for the Nation's citizen-soldiers, President Bush has called on Congress to increase the monthly educational benefit for members of the Guard and Reserve who are mobilized in the war on terror. Congressmen Beauprez and Sweeney have today introduced the President's legislation to accomplish this goal. The President commends them for their leadership in introducing his proposal and urges Congress to act quickly in passing this important measure.
