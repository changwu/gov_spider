Boston, MA - Today, the Michigan Romney for President campaign launched "Mittens From Mitt," a statewide charity project to collect mittens, hats, scarves, gloves, coats, and other warm winter items to give to children in need across Michigan.
Started by the Michigan State University Students for Mitt chapter as a campus-wide effort, the "Mittens From Mitt" project has generated excitement across the state. As a result, the eight other Michigan Students for Mitt chapters have joined the efforts to provide warm winter items to local children in their community.
"Mittens From Mitt" will run statewide through December 21. For more information, or to find a drop-off location, individuals may contact JT Gage at the Michigan Romney for President Headquarters at 248-254-6530 or by email at JGage@MittRomney.com.
"This is a tremendous effort by our Students for Mitt organizations, and I am proud to be a part of this program to give back to the community," said Governor Romney. "Throughout the holiday season, and all year round, we must remember that there are families in need. I am hopeful we will make a positive difference in the live of families across my home state of Michigan."
