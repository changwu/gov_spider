    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. Gray - (D) Pennsylvania)
The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3545 as reported to the House. If it were presented to the President in its current form, the President's senior advisors would recommend veto.
Its only significant source of deficit reductions is increased revenues. Rather than reducing spending, on net the bill would increase it. Moreover, most of the claimed savings would merely shift outlays from FY 1988 to future years.
