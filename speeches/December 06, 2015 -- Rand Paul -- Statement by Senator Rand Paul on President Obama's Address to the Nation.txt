    WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator and Republican Presidential candidate Rand Paul issued the following statement in response to President Obama's address to the nation:
"The President tonight continued his failure of leadership and his outrageous quest to turn a necessary discussion on terrorism and national security into an unnecessary and ineffective gun control debate.
Let me be clear: disarming more law-abiding citizens will not stop mass murderers and terrorists. We should be advocating for more concealed carry ability for law-abiding Americans and an end to unconstitutional gun-free zones.
Second, we must fully examine and reform our border security, including refugee and visa programs. While the President paid lip service to this fight, he plans to keep the failed, current policies in place and allow tens of thousands of refugees to enter our country.
I couldn't disagree more strongly. Immigration, visas, and refugees from countries with active terror networks must be halted while we determine how to better secure our borders and our people.
Finally, we must stop doing the same foolish things overseas that the President advocated for throughout his remarks. We must stop arming and training the allies of ISIS and al Qaeda.
We should not double down on this failed and dangerous policy that the President called for tonight. We must arm our allies, the Kurds, and insist on Arab boots on the ground for our allies in the region.
There are answers here to make our nation safe, but once again the President seems incapable of finding and implementing them. His administration is focused on gun laws that will not stop terrorists, while pushing policies that will let more of them into the country. It is 100 percent wrong and proves the need for new leadership in the White House."
