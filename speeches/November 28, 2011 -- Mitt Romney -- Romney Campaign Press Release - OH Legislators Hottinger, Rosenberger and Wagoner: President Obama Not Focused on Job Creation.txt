    Ohio State Senator Mark Wagoner and State Representatives Jay Hottinger and Cliff Rosenberger made the following statement on the Democratic National Committee's misleading advertisement and press conference call in Ohio:
"President Obama's policies have failed to bring jobs back to Ohio and have devastated the middle class. The last thing that President Obama and his Democratic allies want to do is campaign against Mitt Romney and be responsible for three years of job losses and rising debt. Instead of focusing on revitalizing our economy, President Obama and Democrats only want to focus on tearing down Mitt Romney."
