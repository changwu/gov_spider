Des Moines, Iowa (August 27, 2007): Sen. Joe Biden will hold a press conference TOMORROW in Davenport, Iowa at 2:15pm to respond to President Bush's second in a series of speeches on Iraq. While President Bush is again expected to defend his failed policies in the region ahead of his Administration's report to Congress, Sen. Biden will outline his plan for leaving Iraq without leaving chaos behind. As Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Biden has been a long-time and vocal critic of President Bush's troop surge strategy and has advocated the Biden-Gelb plan to separate the warring factions and give them breathing room and control over the fabric of their daily lives.
