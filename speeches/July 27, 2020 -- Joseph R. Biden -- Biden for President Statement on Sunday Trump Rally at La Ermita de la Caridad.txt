    In response to this past weekend's Trump rally at La Ermita de la Caridad, Biden for President Spokesperson Kevin Munoz released the following statement:
"For far too long, the Trump campaign has pretended to care about Cubans while deporting Cubans, questioning the need for Little Havana, and refusing to ease travel restrictions to the island. This past weekend's grotesque display at a Trump rally at La Ermita de la Caridad shows yet again just how little respect Trump has for the Cuban-American community. La Ermita de la Caridad is a Catholic place of worship and a safe space for Cuban refugees, and for President Trump's campaign to desecrate that space is shameful. This November, we must elect a President who respects and values the Cuban-American community and their contributions to this nation. Our only choice is Joe Biden."
