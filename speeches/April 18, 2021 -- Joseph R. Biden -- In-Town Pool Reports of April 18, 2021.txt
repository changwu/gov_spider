White House In-Town Pool Report #1 — POTUS in Wilmington
Good morning from a quiet White House, where your pooler has been tested and wristband-ed and is currently watching a male Northern Cardinal attempt to woo a skeptical female in front of the sticks. He’s not immediately successful, but clearly determined.
President Biden is in Wilmington this morning, with nothing on his public schedule until his return to the White House this evening.

White House In-Town Pool Report #3 — Notes for 4/19 and gathering for Marine One 
In-town pool gathering for Marine One at 8.45 p.m.
Also, the White House requests that your pooler pass along this note for tomorrow:
Tomorrow, the President will meet with Members of Congress to discuss the historic investments in the American Jobs Plan in the Oval Office. These Members of Congress represent a bipartisan, bicameral group of some of the former governors and mayors now on Capitol Hill. These former state and local elected officials understand firsthand the impact of a federal investment in rebuilding our nation's infrastructure on their communities.

White House In-Town Pool Report #6 — Marine One touchdown
Beneath a waxing crescent moon and a scattering of clouds, Marine One touched down at 9.08 p.m.
President Biden and the First Lady exited Marine One three minutes later. The president did not respond to questions from the pool as he walked to an awaiting SUV.
Correction to previous report: The Ellipse, not the South Lawn. (Your pooler, new to helicopter landings, thought it was all the same big lawn.)
