    The people of our country are saddened by the airline tragedy which took place today near Warsaw, Poland. We are saddened by the awful loss of life, and share the grief of those who knew the victims.
I wish to particularly express the condolences of the American people to the families and friends of those killed in the crash who were members of the United States amateur boxing team and those who accompanied them.
The spirit and determination of these fine American athletes, and those who coached and assisted them, reflected what is best about our country. They represented our Nation well, and will be sorely missed.
