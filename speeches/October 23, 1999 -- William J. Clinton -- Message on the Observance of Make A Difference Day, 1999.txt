    Warm greetings to everyone throughout the nation participating in Make A Difference Day. I am delighted that so many Americans are joining together with their neighbors on this day of helping to create a better world for us all.
It is a very American idea that we meet our challenges not through big government or as isolated individuals, but as members of a true community, with all of us working together. Upholding this fine tradition, citizens young and old are working on this special day to raise awareness of the power of citizen service not only to give hope and help to individuals in need, but also to renew the strength, vitality, and character of communities across our nation.
As you clean up parks and neighborhoods, read stories to young people, collect clothing and other necessities for families recovering from Hurricane Floyd, and participate in numerous other community efforts, I thank each of you for devoting your time, talents, and energy to fulfill America's bright promise for all our people.
Earlier this week, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of AmeriCorps, our national service initiative that engages thousands of citizens in projects that are changing lives and changing America. AmeriCorps members are living up to the highest obligations of American citizenshipâ€” creating opportunities for others, taking responsibility for themselves, and fostering a community of all Americans. I commend everyone participating in Make A Difference Day for adding your own contribution to the tradition of citizen service that has always been a hallmark of our democracy.
Hillary joins me in sending best wishes for a productive and meaningful day.
BILL CLINTON
