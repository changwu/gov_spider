    1. We had a substantial discussion of East-West relations. We stressed that the first need is for solidarity and resolve among us all.
2. At the same time, we are determined to pursue the search for extended political dialogue and long-term co-operation with the Soviet Union and her allies. Contacts exist and are being developed in a number of fields. Each of us will pursue all useful opportunities for dialogue.
3. Our aim is security and the lowest possible level of forces. We wish to see early and positive results in the various arms control negotiations and the speedy resumption of those now suspended. The United States has offered to re-start nuclear arms control talks anywhere, at any time, without preconditions. We hope that the Soviet Union will act in a constructive and positive way. We are convinced that this would be in the common interest of both East and West. We are in favour of agreements which would build confidence and give concrete expression, through precise commitments, to the principle of the non-use of force.
4. We believe that East and West have important common interests: in preserving peace; in enhancing confidence and security; in reducing the risks of surprise attack or war by accident; in improving crisis management techniques; and in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.
