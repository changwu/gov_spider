    The President. I've come to the conclusion that I'm at a terrific place, where people are here bound by a common desire to show compassion to their neighbors in need. I really thank you. It's a compassion commune—[laughter]—where people are united by a singular purpose and setting a great example. Everybody—most people I talk to say, "Well, it makes me feel better." The truth of the matter is, when you volunteer to serve somebody in need, it does make you feel better.
So for all those in our country who are wondering whether or not they can make a difference in somebody's life, the answer is, all you have to do is look at these people here.
Audience member. Volunteer!
The President. All right. Thank you.
