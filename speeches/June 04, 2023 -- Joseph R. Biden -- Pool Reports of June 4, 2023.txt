Hi there -- the pool is gathering shortly. No word on what POTUS is doing today.
From the White House:
Please plan to gather at the Palm Room Doors at 12:00 PM for a South Grounds departure.

In-town pool report #2 — motorcade rolling
The motorcade started rolling from the South Lawn at 12:14 pm. We did not see POTUS

In-town pool report #3 — arrival at JBA/golf
The motorcade arrived at the golf course at Joint Base Andrews at 12:49 pm.
The motorcade came to a stop on a road next to several golf carts, where a group of Secret Service and other people were waiting. The pool spotted aides carrying a couple sets of golf clubs.
We did not see POTUS exit his SUV, and the press then split off from the rest of the motorcade. The pool is now holding in vans down the street, out of sight of POTUS.
No word yet on the president's golf partners.
The motorcade ride was uneventful, though we stopped at a couple red lights instead of speeding through them like we usually do.

In-town pool report #4 — Biden spotting/golf partner
The White House staged the pool near the second hole. At 1:46 pm, the pool spotted POTUS driving a golf cart.
POTUS, in a blue shirt and khakis, hit his ball. It sliced to his right, landing near some trees outside the main fairway. POTUS then got back in the golf cart and began driving to retrieve his ball.
The White House pulled the pool and we returned back to the vans. We were too far away to shout questions.
While we waited for POTUS, Secret Service agents arrived in golf carts. A German Shepard was sitting in the front seat of one of the carts. An agent led the dog around the second hole, in an apparent security sweep.
From the White House: The president is golfing at Joint Base Andrews with his brother:
James "Jimmy" Biden

In-town pool report #5 — motorcade rolling
After holding at a food court, the pool joined the motorcade and we were rolling at 3:39 pm. We did not see POTUS.
The press vans initially joined the waiting motorcade a bit earlier, but we were pulled out of the motorcade line and diverted to a nearby parking lot.
We could not see the motorcade or POTUS from the parking lot. By the time the press vans folded back into the motorcade, POTUS had presumably already gotten into his SUV.

In town pool report #6 — motorcade arrives at WH
After an uneventful ride, the motorcade arrived back at the White House complex at 4:01 pm.
We briefly caught a glimpse of POTUS exiting his SUV and entering the WH, but we were too far away to shout questions.
Your pooler has asked the White House about the loud boom that was reportedly heard throughout the DMV region. We've also asked whether POTUS heard the boom while he was golfing. Nothing yet.

In-town pool report #9 — motorcade rolling/WH on sonic boom
The motorcade was rolling at 6:50 pm
No word on our destination.
In response to pool's questions about the sonic boom, a White House official said: "The President was briefed on the incident. The sound resulting from the authorized DOD aircraft was faint at JBA."
The official referred comment to the Secret Service when asked whether any safety precautions were taken at the White House in response to the incident.

In-town pool report #10 — pool arrival in Georgetown
Pool arrived in Georgetown shortly before 7 pm.
The pool was blocked from getting close to the restaurant that POTUS is apparently going to—even as members of the public walked past us and stood immediately outside the restaurant and snapped photos.
No official word on where POTUS is going.

POTUS exited the restaurant at 8:36 pm. He didn't respond to shouted questions from the pool. We were lined up on a sidewalk about 40-50 feet away.
Motorcade was rolling at 8:38 pm
Before he exited the restaurant, diners applauded and POTUS could be seen mingling and posing for photos. Pool was too far away to hear what he was saying.
