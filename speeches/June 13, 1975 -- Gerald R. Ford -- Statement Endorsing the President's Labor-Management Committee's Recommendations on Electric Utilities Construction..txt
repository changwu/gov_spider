    TODAY, I am releasing the text of the Labor-Management Committee's recommendations for legislative and administrative measures to increase electric utility construction and output.
Having carefully reviewed these recommendations, I accept and endorse them because they can make a significant contribution in reducing the Nation's dependence on oil imports and in conserving scarce natural gas supplies.
Additionally, an expansion in electric utility construction and production will provide solid, long-range employment which will be highly beneficial to the country. An increase in electric utility capacity will also contribute significantly to economic expansion.
I will take steps promptly to create the task force the Committee recommends to tackle the problem of delays in the completion of utility plants. In view of the long lead time on construction, completion of plants now in advanced stages of planning or under construction must have top priority.
I appreciate the constructive contribution of labor and management working together. The time has come for Government to cooperate in the same spirit in addressing and resolving the Nation's problems. I thank the Committee for its continuing work and appreciate its efforts in the national interest.
