    The United States condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks today on Bacha Khan University in Charsadda, Pakistan, and on a bus carrying members of the media in Kabul, Afghanistan. These reprehensible attacks, against students and teachers in Pakistan and members of the media in Afghanistan, underscore the ongoing threat that terrorists pose to the region and to the peaceful and prosperous future we seek to build together. We offer our deepest condolences to the victims of the attacks and to their families, and we stand with the people of the region against all forms of extremism and terrorism.
