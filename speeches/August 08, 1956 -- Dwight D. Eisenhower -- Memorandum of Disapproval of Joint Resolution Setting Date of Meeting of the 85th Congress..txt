    ON RECOMMENDATION of the majority and minority leadership of both the Senate and House of Representatives, I am withholding my approval of S. J. Res. 203, fixing the date of meeting of the Eighty-fifth Congress. January 7, 1957, the date fixed in the resolution, is the date prescribed by law for the counting of the electoral votes for President and Vice President. I am informed that the Congress cannot conveniently count those votes on the same day that it assembles.
