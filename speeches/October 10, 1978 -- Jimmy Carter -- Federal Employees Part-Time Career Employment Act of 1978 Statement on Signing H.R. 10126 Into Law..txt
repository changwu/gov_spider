    I have today signed the Federal Employees Part-Time Career Employment Act of 1978, an important legislative contribution to the broad effort to make the Federal Government more effective and manageable.
This act will facilitate part-time Federal employment. It will help us tap the energies and talents of people who, for various reasons, are unable to work full time—older people, the handicapped, students, women, especially those with family responsibilities, and others.
Along with the recently enacted "flexitime" bill, this legislation will provide more flexible—and more productive-working arrangements for Federal employees.
I congratulate Senators Gaylord Nelson and Thomas Eagleton and Representatives Patricia Schroeder and Yvonne B. Burke for their leadership on this bill. And I thank Chairmen Abraham Ribicoif and Robert Nix for their support.
This legislation puts the congressional stamp of approval on an effort to which my administration has been strongly committed.
Last September, I directed Federal agencies to open up opportunities for men and women seeking part-time employment. This effort, coordinated by the Civil Service Commission, has led to a shift toward part-time jobs. It has also confirmed the experience of private industry that expanded part-time employment can improve productivity and the quality of working life.
These efforts will continue under the Federal Employees Part-Time Career Employment Act of 1978.
