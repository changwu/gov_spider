    Mr. Prime Minister, Mrs. Kaur, Laura and I are honored to welcome you to the White House.
We meet as leaders of two great democracies committed to working together for a better and a safer world. Your visit reflects the growing bonds of cooperation between your nation and mine. Our nations have ties that are strong and warm. These ties are enriched by hundreds of thousands of Americans of Indian origin who contribute so much to America's vitality. Our people share the bonds of friendship and a commitment to prosperity, peace, and regional stability. Our nations believe in freedom, and our nations are confronting global terrorism.
As diplomatic partners, we're meeting this threat in our own nations and abroad. And as economic partners, we're working around the world to displace hatred and violence with prosperity, hope, and optimism. India's embrace of democracy and human rights has ensured that its great diversity will remain a national strength. And since enacting economic reforms in the early nineties, India has become an emerging economic power to the betterment of its people.
The relationship between our two nations has never been stronger, and it will grow even closer in the days and years to come. This transformed relationship was seen vividly in the response to the December 26th tsunami that devastated parts of Asia. Along with Japan and Australia, our two nations launched a coordinated and effective disaster relief mission, providing assistance and relief where it was most needed.
Mr. Prime Minister, the United States and India have built a relationship of great potential as we face this century's challenges. We look forward to building on our strong bilateral relationship to expand our economic ties and to lay the foundation of peace and prosperity for our children and our grandchildren.
Welcome, Mr. Prime Minister, and thank you for coming.
