    First of two Nevada offices to hold public opening
LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential Campaign announced today plans to hold a celebratory grand opening for its Reno, Nevada satellite campaign office.
The event, which regretfully Dr. Paul is not scheduled to attend, is one of two Silver State campaign offices to hold a public opening in the coming week. Details of a Las Vegas area headquarters grand opening that will indeed feature Dr. Paul are forthcoming.
The Reno office event will take place on Friday, October 14th at 7:00 p.m. at the Ron Paul 2012 campaign office, located at 1201 Terminal Way, Suite 224, Reno, NV 89502.
"Ron Paul's poll numbers are rising and with these tailwinds the Nevada team has concluded that he is well positioned to make a tremendous impact here," said the Ron Paul 2012 Presidential Campaign's Nevada Executive Director, Steve Bierfeldt.
"To be truly competitive our organization must reach out to all parts of the state. By establishing a campaign office in Washoe County, we will increase the reach of our message and motivate even more volunteers in the Reno-Sparks area," said Mr. Bierfeldt, who will travel from the campaign's main Nevada office in Las Vegas to preside over the Reno grand opening.
The grand opening event will include a meet and greet with volunteers and campaign staff, who will familiarize volunteers with some aspects of plans to target Northern Nevada. Staff will distribute campaign materials such as yard signs and bumper stickers, and light refreshments including cake and soft drinks will be served amid a family-friendly atmosphere.
