    National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice met today at the White House with Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan of Singapore to discuss the United States and Singapore's close partnership in addressing regional and global challenges, including maritime security in the South China Sea, countering the scourge of terrorism, and promoting prosperity through increased trade. Ambassador Rice affirmed the United States' strong commitment to continuing to play a long-term role in the Asia Pacific by strengthening our ties with key partners like Singapore and with ASEAN through the President's Rebalance strategy. Ambassador Rice and the Foreign Minister discussed the strategic and economic benefits of the Trans Pacific Partnership. Finally, the two highlighted the enduring interests underpinning our 50 years of diplomatic relations, which we will celebrate and build on during Prime Minister Lee's official visit to the White House on August 2.
