Out of Town Pool 5: Church departure 
President Biden left St. Edmond's Catholic Church at 4:58 p.m.
Biden waived at the small crowd gathered across the street, who cheered as he walked down the church steps. When a local resident shouted "we love you, Joe," the president turned around and said "Thank you."
While Biden was in the church, a few people gathered at a distance to observe the scene, including a friendly Jack Russell-pug mix named Jimmy, who greeted some members of the press pool.
The pool is now rolling to a location that has not been announced.
