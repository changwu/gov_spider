    Washington Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers today made the following statement on Obama Deputy Campaign Manager Stephanie Cutter's comments that women aren't concerned about what's happened over the last four years:Â 
"President Obama's campaign is now saying that women aren't 'really concerned about what's happened over the last four years.' I have talked to women around this country, and I can say with authority that women are very concerned about the hundreds of thousands of jobs we've lost, about a poverty rate for women that is the highest it has been in 17 years, and the more than $5 trillion President Obama has added to the national debt, a sum that our children and grandchildren will one day have to pay back. President Obama may wish he could forget his record over the last four years, but women across this country remember it very well and, on Election Day, we will vote accordingly."
