(House)(D'Amato (R) NY and six others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of the Lazio proposed substitute amendment to S. 1494.
The Administration is particularly supportive of provisions in the amendment that would: (1) extend certain housing programs administered by the Departments of Housing and Urban Development and Agriculture; (2) streamline the process for designating housing for the elderly and disabled; (3) strengthen the ability of public housing authorities (PHAs) to limit admission to and occupancy in public and assisted housing by certain persons who use illegal drugs or abuse alcohol; (4) provide authorization of funding for certain designated organizations and programs, including Habitat for Humanity, Cities in Schools, and National Community Development Initiative; and (5) increase the aggregate loan limit for the Section 108 loan guarantee program.
The Administration, however, has certain concerns with S. 1494 and will work with Congress to address these concerns. For example, the Administration recommends that s. 1494 extend a number of additional HUD programs that have expired authorizations. In addition, the provision allowing the renewal of Section 8 moderate rehabilitation contracts should be stricken. These subsidies were never intended to be permanently attached to the housing units. Instead, they should continue to be converted into tenant-based, portable rental housing subsidies.
