    Dear Art:
I have received your letter of July 28, and it is with sincere gratitude for your many years of dedicated public service that I accept your resignation as Administrator of the General Services Administration, effective October 15, 1975, as you requested.
Throughout your six years at G.S.A.--and before that as an exceptionally able assistant to two governors of the State of Pennsylvania--you have fulfilled your challenging leadership responsibilities with skill and distinction. Better than most, you know that your assignments as Administrator have never been anything but demanding and difficult. Yet I have had the utmost confidence in both your ability and your determination to carry on each of your tasks in the best interests of the Nation. You have worked tirelessly to build at G.S.A. an institutional reputation for productivity and effectiveness, and I commend you for the outstanding record of achievement which is the result.
Now as you prepare to return to private life, I hope you will always look back on this time of public service with the fullest measure of satisfaction and pride. You may be sure you take with you my warmest good wishes for every future success and happiness.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
