    I have today signed the instruments of ratification of the Treaties Between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Limitation of Underground Nuclear Weapon Tests and on Underground Nuclear Explosions for Peaceful Purposes, and their respective Protocols. I was gratified that the United States Senate gave its advice and consent to ratification of these Treaties.
During consideration of the Treaties, statements were made by several Senators on the law of treaty interpretation. I believe that the views on this issue contained in President Reagan's message to the Senate of June 10, 1988, reflect the proper roles of the President and the Senate in this area.
In any event, I do not believe that any difference of views on this issue will have any practical effect on the implementation of the Treaties. Any question of interpretation that may arise undoubtedly will be handled in a spirit of mutual accommodation and respect. In this spirit, I look forward to the exchange of instruments of ratification and the entry into force of the Treaties and express my hope that it will lead to even more important advances in arms control and the preservation of world peace and security.
