    LITTLE ROCK, AR -- John Mark Huckabee, the oldest son of Presidential candidate and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, was treated and released from a Des Moines hospital Friday following a traffic accident.
The Governor and former First Lady Janet Huckabee are campaigning in New Hampshire. They spoke with their son by phone while he was in the hospital.
"Janet and I are relieved that John Mark is alright. He will be stiff and sore from the accident, but doctors assured us he sustained no serious injuries," Mike Huckabee said.
John Mark Huckabee, who had been in Iowa to help his father campaign, left Des Moines Friday morning with family friends David and Debbie Haak of Texarkana, Ark. They were traveling home to Arkansas.
As the Haak's vehicle was traveling southbound on Interstate 35, another vehicle on the entrance ramp hit the Haak car on the passenger side.
Witnesses called police and emergency workers. David and Debbie Haak and John Mark Huckabee were taken to a local hospital. All were treated for minor injuries and released. Police issued a citation to the driver of the car that struck the Haak's vehicle.
