Boston, MA – Today, Governor Mitt Romney filed his declaration of candidacy to participate in the West Virginia Presidential Primary on May 13, 2008. West Virginia Romney for President Chairman, State Representative Bob Ashley delivered the paperwork and $2,500 check to the West Virginia Secretary of State Betty Ireland in Charleston.
Upon filing, State Representative Ashley released the following statement:
"Washington is broken and Governor Romney has the experience necessary to fix it. Many West Virginians are looking for a new start and that's not going to happen if we continue to send the same people back to Washington – only to have them sit in different chairs. Governor Romney has turned around businesses, the Olympics, and Massachusetts and now we need him to turn around Washington."
