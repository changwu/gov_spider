VP Supplemental Pool #1
At approximately 1:35p, Vice President Harris made a surprise stop at the Women's March in Los Angeles outside City Hall. After remarks by LA mayor Karen Bass, and with the Second Gentleman listening from just off the riser, Harris spoke for six minutes to the crowd of a couple hundred (your pooler's rough assessment) about "fundamental rights."
Some of her remarks below —there was no livestream, I'm told, so let me know if you want the full audio, happy to send:
"Around our country, supposed so-called extremist leaders, who would dare to silence the voice of the people, a United States Supreme Court, the highest court in our land, that took a constitutional right that had been recognized from the people of America — we have seen attacks on voting rights, attacks on fundamental rights to love and to marry the people that you love, attacks on the ability of people to be themselves and be proud of the people who they are. And so this is a moment that history will show required each of us, based on our collective love of our country to stand up for, and fight for, to protect our ideals. That's what this moment is."
