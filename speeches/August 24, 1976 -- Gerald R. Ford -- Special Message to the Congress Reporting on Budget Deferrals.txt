    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I report revisions to two deferrals previously transmitted.
Both of the revised reports reflect routine increases to the amounts deferred. The Federal Aviation Administration's Facilities and equipment deferral has been increased by $193.8 million, and a deferral for the State and local government fiscal assistance trust fund in the Department of the Treasury has been increased by $1.4 million. The details of each revised deferral are contained in the attached reports.
