"We have heard from many of you who have concerns about the ability of the United Nations to fulfill its mission."
"The United States is a long-standing supporter of the African Union. in 2006 the U>S> was the first non-African country that established a diplomatic mission to the AU Since then we have worked together to support peacebuilding and preventing conflicts. Across the continent we have worked to strengthen the partnership between our lines."
