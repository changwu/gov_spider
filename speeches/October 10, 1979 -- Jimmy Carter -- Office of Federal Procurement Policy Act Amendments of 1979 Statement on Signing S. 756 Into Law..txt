    I have this day signed S. 756, a bill which authorizes appropriations for the Office of Federal Procurement Policy for fiscal years 1980 through 1983.
In addition to its other provisions, the legislation clarifies the authority of the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy to issue policy directives for improving the supply systems and processes of the executive branch. The legislation also calls for the development of a proposal for a Uniform Procurement System to be submitted to the Congress within 1 year. This will serve as successor to the National Supply System project, which I approved August 9, 1979.
