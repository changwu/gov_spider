    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced Mayor Giuliani's campaign county chairs and co-chairs for the Lowcountry region of South Carolina.
"We're delighted to have these fine individuals join Team Rudy and help promote Rudy's message of strong leadership and fiscal conservatism," said South Carolina State Chairman Barry Wynn. "As the campaign progresses, more and more South Carolinians are recognizing that Rudy is the real fiscal conservative candidate."
This announcement is the latest in a series of recent endorsements in South Carolina. Most recently, the Giuliani campaign announced a new executive director, three additional campaign staff members and opened campaign offices in both West Columbia and Charleston.
