    WASHINGTON, D.C.- Sen. Paul continues to gain momentum in the Granite State as he receives 25 new endorsements from First in the Nation primary voters. This totals 275 endorsements for Rand Paul for President by New Hampshire public officials, business leaders, and activists.
"Rand Paul stands as the beacon of liberty that continues to draw primary voters to his campaign from across New Hampshire. These 25 new members join 250 supporters as part of the growing New Hampshire Rand Paul Leadership Team. Our grassroots, volunteer-driven ground game is spreading Rand Paul's message of reining in out of control government spending to balance the budget, protecting the Bill of Rights and overhauling the tax code with a 14.5% flat tax," says Mike Biundo, Rand Paul Campaign Senior Advisor.
