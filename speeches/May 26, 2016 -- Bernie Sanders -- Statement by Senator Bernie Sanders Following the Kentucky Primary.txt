    LOS ANGELES - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement Thursday on the primary election results in Kentucky:
"We accept the results in Kentucky. We are very pleased that we split the delegates in a state with a closed primary in which independents cannot vote and where Secretary Clinton defeated Barack Obama by 35 points in 2008.
"I thank the people of Kentucky very much for their support."
