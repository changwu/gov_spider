    My dear General Dawes:
I regret intensely that you find it necessary to leave the work of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.
There is little need for me to express the gratitude which I know the whole country holds for this great service now added to a life of long devotion to public welfare. I am indeed personally under great obligation to you for your cooperation and great accomplishments in many of our most important governmental problems of the past three years.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
