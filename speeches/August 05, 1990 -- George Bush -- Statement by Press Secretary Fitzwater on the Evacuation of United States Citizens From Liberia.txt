    We have been advised that the initial stages of this morning's Liberia operation have been successfully completed. A total of 59 people were flown to U.S. Navy ships offshore by U.S. Marine Corps helicopters. The U.S. Marine Corps reinforced rifle company is in place providing protection for U.S. citizens. The initial operation went well, and we are unaware of any shots being fired or resistance encountered.
