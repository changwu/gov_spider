    Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, today made the following statement on President Obama's comments about Cuba:
"President Obama stated that Cuba will someday be free, but for three years he has adopted policies that only push that day farther into the future.
Even though the Castro brothers continue to brutalize the Cuban people and have unjustly imprisoned an American aid worker, Alan Gross, President Obama has lifted sanctions on the regime. This only serves to prop up the Castros and extend their rule. We need to replace this president with a strong leader like Mitt Romney who understands the plight of the Cuban people and is unafraid to stand up for their freedom and universal principles of liberty."
