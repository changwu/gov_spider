    Cicilline Will Serve As Rhode Island Campaign Co-Chair
The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Providence Mayor David Cicilline and named him a Co-Chair of Hillary's Rhode Island campaign.
"Hillary Clinton understands the challenges facing our cities, and she has the experience and vision needed to lead this country from her first day in office," Cicilline said.
Cicilline has made a name for himself as reform-minded mayor intent on modernizing city government and improving neighborhood schools. Under his leadership, Providence's crime rate has dropped to its lowest level in 30 years due to an innovative community policing program, and fiscal integrity has been restored as evidenced by straight-A bond ratings.
Prior to his election as Mayor, Cicilline served four terms as a state representative, championing ethics reform and gun safety. His dedication to transparency and accountability in government earned him Common Cause's #1 ranking.
"Mayor Cicilline is an exciting young leader who has turned Providence around and restored faith in city government again," Clinton said. "I'm honored to have his support as we take our message of change across Rhode Island."
