    This bill keeps America flying by helping to make air travel safer, more reliable, and convenient. The President is pleased that Congress has passed the bill, and he looks forward to signing it into law.
The legislation provides a substantial investment in safety research, air traffic control modernization, airport infrastructure improvements and environmental initiatives. It also will help increase capacity and efficiency throughout our aviation system. The President is pleased that the Congress removed the restrictions on FAA's ability to manage its air traffic operations, which had been included in earlier versions.
