"Huckabee praises Iran's release of prisoners while he criticizes Obama" Washington Post
MYRTLE BEACH, S.C.-Speaking to reporters at a tea party convention in here, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee praised Iran's decision to release four Americans held as prisoners, while he criticized the Obama administration's negotiating strategy. "It's great that these prisoners have been released," Huckabee said. "They should have been released before we ever sat down at the negotiating table. They've been there more than a year too long. Actually, they've been there several years too long. I'm grateful that they're released and free, especially Pastor [Saeed] Abedini and the Washington Post reporter, who was clearly railroaded into some false charge. Why it took this long, I have no idea, but today we should rejoice for their families." Two days earlier...Huckabee had told the Washington Post that a tougher president might have already secured the release of the prisoners….Huckabee reiterated that he.. was inclined to immediately end the nuclear agreement and restore the sanctions on Iran. "We should have not only kept them, we should have tightened them," said Huckabee. "This would be like Neville Chamberlain writing a $150 billion check to the Nazis before World War II, and saying, 'Y'all be careful with that money.'"

"President Obama is a complete fool for trusting a country that's been lying, cheating, murdering and sponsoring terrorism around the globe for 37 years. Empowering Iran with sanctions relief is like Neville Chamberlain writing a $150 billion check to Adolf Hitler hoping he'll play nice and behave. This Iran deal is an insane disaster and this White House has lost its mind."
"Huckabee's Advice to Evangelicals: Vote!" Christian Broadcasting Network News
CHARLESTON, S.C. - The evangelical vote is still up for grabs in the current presidential election. No one knows this better than former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee who ran for president in 2008 and lost. He had a pretty good showing back then, surprising everyone when he won the Iowa caucuses.

"One of the important things is that they need to show up and vote. So many of them didn't in the last cycle in 2012 and that's probably one of the factors that cost us the election," Huckabee said. Huckabee said presidential candidates ought to address the "moral issues" of the nation and not just economic ones.
