    DES MOINES, IA â€” Today Swati Dandekar announced her endorsement of U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar for President. Swati, who was the first Indian-born American woman to hold a state legislative position, is a former Iowa State Representative and Iowa State Senator. Swati most recently served as U.S. Executive Director and Ambassador to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), appointed by former President Barack Obama, and prior to that was a member of the Iowa Utilities Board.
This endorsement follows the conclusion of U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar's Heartland Tour where she traveled to 20 counties across Iowa over three days, released her rural and agricultural Plan for the Heartland, and visited the Iowa State Fair.
"I am proud to endorse U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar for President," said former U.S. Ambassador and Iowa legislator Swati Dandekar. "Amy's commitment to improving the lives of everyone in Iowa and in our country -- from making sure our workers are treated fairly to increasing access to education to fighting for women's rights -- is exactly what we need in our Democratic nominee and in the White House. Unlike our current president, Amy respects immigrants and has worked to ensure our country's immigration policies are compassionate. As she likes to say, 'immigrants don't diminish America, they are America.' Amy is a strong woman and she'll be an even stronger president. That's why I am thrilled to do everything I can to get her elected in 2020."
Klobuchar has previously received endorsements from several current and former Iowa legislators and political and community activists, including:
