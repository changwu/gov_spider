    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Waxman (D) CA)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 4754, although it believes that it is unnecessary to require the position of Commissioner of Food and Drugs to be established legislatively as a Presidential appointee subject to Senate confirmation.
