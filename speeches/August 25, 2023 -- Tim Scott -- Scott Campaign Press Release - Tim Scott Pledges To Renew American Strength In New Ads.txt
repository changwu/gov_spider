    "I'll be the President who ends the Biden retreat and leads the charge for American strength." - Tim Scott
CHARLESTON, SC - Tim Scott launched new ads today ahead of his post-debate early state swing to New Hampshire, Iowa, and his home state of South Carolina. The ads highlight the consequences of Biden's policies on everyday Americans as Tim shares his message to renew American strength.
'Tragic' airs in New Hampshire today honing in on the fentanyl crisis that has impacted thousands of Americans.
'Lead the Charge' airs in Iowa. Tim lays out how he'll end the Biden retreat.
 
WATCH: Tragic
TRAGIC TRANSCRIPT:
SCOTT: I'm at our southern border to send a message to the radical Left.
Biden's liberal policies aren't compassionate. They're tragic.
Teenagers overdosing on fentanyl. Young women being sold by human traffickers. Violent crime on the rise.
As Commander in Chief, I will eliminate Biden's 87,000 IRS agents and use that money to finish the wall and double the border patrol.
I'm Tim Scott and I approve this message because we must secure this border now.

WATCH: Lead The Charge
LEAD THE CHARGE TRANSCRIPT:
SCOTT: Joe Biden is out of step and out of ideas.
He has law enforcement retreating from our border and our neighborhood streets.
And America retreating from our deepest held values.
I'll be the President who ends the Biden retreat and leads the charge for American strength.
I'll build the wall, fund our police, and defend our God-given freedoms.
I'm Tim Scott and I approve this message because I have faith in America and our president should too.
