    The United States strongly condemns the outrageous terrorist attack carried out earlier today by al-Shabaab in Mogadishu, Somalia. This despicable and cowardly act took the lives of dozens of innocent civilians, including students taking an exam in hopes of receiving scholarships to study abroad. Those who carried out these attacks have nothing to offer the people of Somalia except murder and destruction, and they must be held accountable. The United States stands with the families and loved ones of those killed and injured, and with the Somali people, who have suffered for far too long. This senseless attack also underscores the continued need for the international community to support the efforts of the African Union Mission in Somalia and the Transitional Federal Government.
Al-Shabaab has shown its utter disregard for human life and human dignity by carrying out terrorist attacks, brutalizing the Somali people, and disrupting and denying humanitarian aid to millions in need even as the United Nations warns that 750,000 Somali men, women and children could lose their lives by the end of the year if humanitarian aid is not received. The United States, United Nations and international community will continue to provide life-saving relief to Somalis in need, while al-Shabaab's continued actions draw strong and broad condemnation from the international community. Together, we must work to save lives while standing against those who deny the basic dignity of the Somali people.
