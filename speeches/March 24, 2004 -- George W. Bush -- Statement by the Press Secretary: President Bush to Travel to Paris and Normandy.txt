    President Bush will travel to Paris on June 5, 2004, to meet with French President Jacques Chirac. He will then travel to Normandy on June 6, 2004, to participate in ceremonies marking the 60th Anniversary of the D-Day invasion.
The Normandy invasion stands as an historic achievement, in which the forces of freedom, at great risk and sacrifice, joined together to turn the tide of war against fascism. Today, our nations stand together still, equally committed to defeat terrorism and advance the cause of freedom.
