    Some twelve years ago, on July 18, 1994, terrorists attacked the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA) building in Buenos Aires, killing 85 innocent civilians and wounding at least 151 others. On November 9, 2006, in an important step toward holding those responsible for this heinous act, an Argentine federal judge ordered international arrest warrants for the former Iranian government officials and a Hizballah operative who conceived, planned, funded, and executed the attack. We applaud Argentina's justice system for its tenacious pursuit of justice against the perpetrators of this terrible attack, and stand ready to support the Argentine prosecution in any way we can.
We offer our prayers and condolences to the families who still suffer the loss of loved ones in that cowardly act. We hope these families can take some comfort in knowing their loved ones will always be remembered and their leaders are moving forward to bring to justice those responsible for this brutal attack.
Hizballah and Iran remain a dangerous, global nexus of terrorism. As the leading state sponsor of terrorism, Iran is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of innocent civilians worldwide. Its financial and military support for Hizballah has allowed that group to perpetrate violence throughout the world.
We call on all governments to support the Argentine Government, to condemn such violent acts, and to work with the community of concerned nations to combat terrorists and all those who fund, support, harbor, and encourage them. These terrorists and their state sponsors must be made to realize they cannot hide from justice. The international community does not tolerate the deliberate targeting of innocent civilians and will hold the perpetrators accountable.
