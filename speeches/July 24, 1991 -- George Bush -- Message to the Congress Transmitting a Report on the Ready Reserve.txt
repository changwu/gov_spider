    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to section 673(d) of title 10, United States Code, I have the honor to transmit the enclosed report relating to units of the Ready Reserve of the Armed Forces that remain on active duty under the provisions of section 673 as of July 1, 1991.
Retention of these units is required by continuing military requirements in response to the ongoing emergency declared in accordance with section 301 of the National Emergencies Act, and Executive Order 12743, January 18, 1991, "Ordering of the Ready Reserve of the Armed Forces to Active Duty."
Ready Reserve units of the Army, Navy, and Air Force are still performing essential missions in the United States, Europe, and Persian Gulf area that support the retrograde of U.S. Armed Forces from the Persian Gulf. Ready Reserve units of the Army are also participating in Operation Provide Comfort by supporting efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to Kurdish refugees in Turkey and northern Iraq. Marine Corps Ready Reserve units remain deployed to the Western Pacific to fulfill the strategic military obligations of the United States in that region. They will remain deployed until such time as the Active component elements deployed to the Gulf can be reconstituted in the Western Pacific, an effort that was also delayed by Operations Provide Comfort and Sea Angel, in which returning U.S. forces provided humanitarian relief to victims of natural disasters in Bangladesh.
All Coast Guard Ready Reserve units have been released from active duty.
