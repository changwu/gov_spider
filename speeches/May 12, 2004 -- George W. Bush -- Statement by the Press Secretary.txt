    The President has received the report and recommendations of the Presidential Emergency Board appointed in the dispute between the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority and certain of its employees represented by the United Transportation Union. The President appreciates the Board's diligent work in this matter.
The President urges the parties to continue to work in good faith to resolve their dispute, taking into account the Emergency Board's recommendations. If the parties fail to reach agreement, the Railway Labor Act provides for the appointment of a second Emergency Board to address the dispute.
The National Mediation Board intends to make the text of the report available at www.nmb.gov.
