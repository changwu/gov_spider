    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Stearns (R) FL and 132 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2498, which is designed to encourage the use of automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) in Federal buildings. In his May 20th radio address, the President announced new measures that will help save the lives of Americans suffering sudden cardiac arrest in Federal buildings and airplanes. It is estimated that more than 20,000 lives could be saved annually by providing greater access to AEDs. In order to increase the likelihood of survival to persons suffering sudden cardiac arrest, the President directed the Department of Health and Human Services and the General Services Administration to develop guidelines to place AEDs in Federal buildings. In addition, the President announced his support for the Cardiac Arrest Survival Act, which would provide Good Samaritan protections for certain persons using an AED in emergency situations or acquiring the device for such purpose, but would maintain existing standards for medical experts and facilities.
The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to enact this important piece of legislation.
