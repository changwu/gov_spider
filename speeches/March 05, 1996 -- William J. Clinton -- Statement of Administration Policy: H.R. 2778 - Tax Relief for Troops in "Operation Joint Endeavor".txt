Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2778 would reduce receipts in FYs 1996 and 1997 and increase receipts in FYs 2001-2003; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring of this, bill'is that the receipts foregone in 1996-1997 would total $82 million and the increased receipts in FYs 2001-2003 would total $93 million.
