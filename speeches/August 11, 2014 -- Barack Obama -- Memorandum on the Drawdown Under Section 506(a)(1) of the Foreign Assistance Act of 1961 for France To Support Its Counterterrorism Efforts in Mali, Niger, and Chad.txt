    Presidential Determination No. 2014-13
Memorandum for the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense
Subject: Drawdown Under Section 506(a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for France to Support its Counterterrorism Efforts in Mali, Niger, and Chad
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 506(a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2318(a)(1) (the "Act"), I hereby determine that an unforeseen emergency exists that requires immediate military assistance to France in its efforts to secure Mali, Niger, and Chad from terrorists and violent extremists. I further determine that these requirements cannot be met under the authority of the Arms Export Control Act or any other provision of law.
I, therefore, direct the drawdown of up to $10 million in defense services of the Department of Defense for these purposes and under the authorities of section 506(a)(1) of the Act.
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to report this determination to the Congress, arrange for its publication in the Federal Register, and coordinate the implementation of this drawdown.
