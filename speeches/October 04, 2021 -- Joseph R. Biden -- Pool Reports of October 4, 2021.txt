From the WH:
The below memo was shared with tomorrow's out-of-town pool ahead of the President's visit to Howell, Michigan tomorrow.
BACKGROUND MEMORANDUM
TO: Out-of-Town Travel PoolFROM: White House Press OfficeDATE: October 4, 2021
RE: Background on IIJA and BBB for the President's Visit to Michigan
Impact of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act on Michigan
The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will make a generational investment in Michigan's infrastructure and resilience.
Roads and Bridges:

In Michigan there are 1,219 bridges and over 7,300 miles of highway in poor condition.
Infrastructure is a key priority for Governor Whitmer. As Governor, she launched the "Rebuilding Michigan Program," a 5-year program to rebuild state highways and bridges. The program is estimated to create 22,000 good-paying union construction jobs this year alone.
Based on formula funding alone, Michigan will receive $7.3 billion for federal-aid highways and $563 million for bridges.

Public Transportation:

Michiganders who take public transportation spend an extra 68% of their time commuting. 17% of transit vehicles in the state are past useful life.
Based on formula funding alone, Michigan will receive $1 billion to improve public transportation options.

Electric Vehicles (EVs):

Governor Whitmer has made it a priority make Michigan a leader in electric vehicles. She recently announced a number of proposals to expand EV charging along key travel routes across the state.
Michigan will expect to receive $110 million over five years to support the expansion of an EV charging network in the state.

High-Speed Internet:

14% of Michigan households do not have an internet subscription.
Michigan will receive a minimum allocation of $100 million to help provide broadband coverage across the state, including providing access to the 398,000 Michiganders who currently lack it.

Water:

Delivering clean water is a key priority for Governor Whitmer. Last year she launched MI Clean Water, a $500 million investment to rebuild water infrastructure to provide clean, affordable water to communities.
Michigan would expect to receive $1.3 billion to improve water infrastructure in the state.

Resilience:

From 2010 to 2020, Michigan experienced 19 extreme weather events.
The bill includes a $50 billion national investment in resilience to strengthen our infrastructure for the impacts of climate change.

Impact of the Build Back Better Agenda on Michigan
The Build Back Better agenda will make life better for millions of working families in Michigan.
Child Care:

The average two-parent household spends $10,400 to care for just one young child every year.
The Build Back Better plan cuts child care costs by more than half for most low- and middle-income Michigan and improves quality of child care.

Universal Pre-K:

Less than a third of 3- and 4-year-olds in Michigan are enrolled in publicly-funded pre-school.
The plan will provide free, high-quality pre-school to all 3- and 4-year-olds in Michigan.

Tax Cut for Families with Children and Childless Workers:

Nearly 230,000 children in Michigan (11% of those under the age of 18) are considered poor.
The plan's Child Tax Credit extension will benefit nearly 2 million children in Michigan, reducing child poverty by 44%.
Before the American Rescue Plan, low-income childless workers were taxed into poverty.
Theplan's expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit for childless workers will benefit more than 570,000 workers in Michigan.

Higher Education:

The average cost of a 2-year degree in Michigan is $4,000 per year.
The plan provides at least two years of free community college to all students and expands the maximum Pell Grant by nearly $1,500, supporting the 174,000 students in Michigan who rely on Pell for their education.

Housing:

514,000 Michiganders spend more than 30% of their income on rent.
The plan will bolster affordable and resilient housing, supporting the construction or rehabilitation of more than two million homes, including 31,000 new or preserved rental homes in Michigan through the Low Income Housing Tax Credit.

Child Nutrition:

16% of children in Michigan live in food insecure households.
The plan will expand access to free school meals to an additional 243,000 students and provide 832,000 students with resources to purchase food over the summer.
