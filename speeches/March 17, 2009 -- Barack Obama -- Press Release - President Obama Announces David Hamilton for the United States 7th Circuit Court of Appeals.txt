    WASHINGTON, DC â€“ Today, President Barack Obama announced his intent to nominate Judge David Hamilton to the United States 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. Hamilton has served for 14 years as a federal district judge in Indiana. He was appointed United States District Judge for the Southern District of Indiana in 1994 and was named Chief Judge in January of 2008.
President Obama said, "Judge Hamilton has a long and impressive record of service and a history of handing down fair and judicious decisions. He will be a thoughtful and distinguished addition to the 7th circuit and I am extremely pleased to put him forward to serve the people of Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin."
Hamilton previously was an associate and then partner at the Indianapolis firm of Barnes & Thornburg and served as Counsel to then-Governor Evan Bayh of Indiana. Hamilton served as a member of the Indiana State Recount Commission and as chairman of the Indiana State Ethics Committee.
"I enthusiastically support the Senate confirmation of David Hamilton for U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Hamilton has served the Southern District of Indiana with distinction as U.S. District Court Judge," U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar said.
"I was proud to work side by side with Senator Lugar to recommend Judge Hamilton for this lifetime appointment," said U.S. Senator Evan Bayh. "President Obama is right that Democrats and Republicans can work together to put highly qualified jurists on the federal bench. Judge Hamilton is an exceptional jurist who has demonstrated the highest ethical standards and a firm commitment to applying our country's laws fairly."
Hamilton is a graduate of Yale Law School and studied at the University of Tuebingen in Germany on a Fulbright scholarship. He is an emeritus member of the board of visitors of the Indiana University School of Law.
