    Las Vegas, NV - Barack Obama made the following statement today on the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 settling their contract with MGM MIRAGE.
"Congratulations are in order for both the Culinary Workers and the leadership at MGM MIRAGE. Every worker in the country deserves to earn a livable wage that allows them to provide for their families, and every worker should be able to achieve the American dream. Fair contracts make that possible, and the contract between the Culinary Workers and MGM MIRAGE is an important sign of the progress that has been made.
The Culinary Workers are a key part of the Nevada community, and there is still more work to be done. I remain committed to standing with them until every worker has a fair contract."
