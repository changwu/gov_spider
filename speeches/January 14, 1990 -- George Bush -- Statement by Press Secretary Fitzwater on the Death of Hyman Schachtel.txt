    The President today called Mrs. Hyman Schachtel, wife of Rabbi Hyman Schachtel of Houston, TX, to express his sadness and condolences over the death of her husband. The President and Hyman Schachtel go back a long, long time. The President termed Rabbi Schachtel one of the great religious and civic leaders that he has known. He told Mrs. Schachtel that her husband had been an inspiration to him and a very good friend. The President and Mrs. Bush will miss him sorely.
