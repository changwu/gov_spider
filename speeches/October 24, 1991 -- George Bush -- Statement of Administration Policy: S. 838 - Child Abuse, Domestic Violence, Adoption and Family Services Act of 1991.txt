    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 10/28/91)(Senate)(Dodd (D) CT and 14 others)
Earlier this year, the Administration transmitted to Congress a three-year reauthorization of programs for child abuse prevention, family violence prevention, adoption opportunities, and temporary child care for children with disabilities. S. 838 also includes a three-year reauthorization for these programs. Therefore, the Administration prefers the reauthorization period in S. 838 to the one-year extension provided by the House-passed companion, H.R. 2720.
The version of S. 838 to be considered on the Senate floor is an improvement over the bill as reported by the Labor and Human Resources Committee. The bill, however, continues to include a number of objectionable provisions. In particular, the bill authorizes excessive appropriations and creates a number of new, narrowly focused grant programs that duplicate current authorities without the promise of being any more effective than current approaches.
Although the Administration does not object to Senate passage of S. 838, it will work with House and Senate conferees to address its concerns.
