    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384, I am submitting the following report on progress made during the past sixty days toward reaching a negotiated settlement in Cyprus.
There was little progress in the intercommunal negotiations between the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots during the period. The talks were delayed due to the presidential elections held by the Government of Cyprus in February. In those elections President Kyprianou was returned to office for a second five-year term.
Following the elections the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General, Ambassador Hugo Gobbi, reconvened the talks on March 8. That meeting was described as cordial by the participants.
Following these discussions there was an additional recess for the meeting of the Nonaligned Movement in New Delhi. The UN General Assembly is likely to take up the Cyprus problem in late April or early May. After that meeting the talks can proceed to address the substantive issues separating the two communities.
President Kyprianou and Turkish leader Denktash remain supportive of the intercommunal talks as the best vehicle for progress toward eventual solution of the Cyprus problem. Ambassador Gobbi is positive about the Secretary General's good offices role in the talks and will attempt to move the discussions forward as soon as possible.
Our Embassy in Nicosia as well as our officers in the State Department remain in close contact with both parties to the intercommunal talks and continue to urge efforts for progress. Visits to the island by our diplomatic officers and by Congressmen emphasize the interest residing both in this Administration and in the Congress in seeing a fair and lasting settlement to the problem.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
