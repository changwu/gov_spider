    National winner to be selected by President Obama for commencement speech
WASHINGTON - The White House and the Department of Education announced today the top three finalists of the first annual Race to the Top High School Commencement Challenge.
The top three finalists, in no particular order are:
• Clark Montessori Jr. & Sr. High School in Cincinnati, OH
• Kalamazoo Central High School in Kalamazoo, MI
• Denver School of Science and Technology in Denver, CO
Between April 26th and April 29th, over 170,000 people weighed in on the six high school finalists.  President Obama will now choose a winner from the top three rated schools and deliver their commencement address later this spring. The final winner will be announced on Tuesday, May 4.
In recognition of the extraordinary achievements and outstanding efforts by each of the original six finalists, the Obama Administration will work to provide a Cabinet secretary or senior administration official to deliver the commencement address at each of the five schools not selected as the national winner.
The Commencement Challenge, launched in late February, invited public high schools around the country a chance to show how they are challenging their students to excel in academics, take personal responsibility for their education, and graduate high school ready for college and career. Over one thousand schools submitted applications.
