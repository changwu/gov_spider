"I am proud and excited to join Governor Kasich's team," said Mayor Swearengin. "He has a proven, pragmatic and responsible record of getting things done for the American people. If we are serious about winning and putting solutions first to grow our economy, I encourage Californians to join me and support Governor Kasich as he makes his way to the convention and to the White House."

Swearengin was elected in 2008 as Fresno's 21st mayor. She is the chair of the California Partnership for the San Joaquin Valley and also serves on the leadership team of the U.S. Conference of Mayors as a member of its Executive Committee. She was recently named one of California's top 10 mayors by Capitol Weekly.
"Without a doubt, Mayor Swearengin is a remarkable leader in Fresno," said Kasich. "She has led the way in revitalizing her community to bring jobs and opportunity to Fresno while also improving the public services her office provides. She is a great example of the potential we can unlock if Washington gets out of the way to empower local leaders to solve problems and make their communities stronger."
