    "What the nation wants is someone who understands the economy, not, if you will, an economic lightweight. I mean, Senator Santorum is a nice guy but he does not understand how the economy works. He has never had a job in the real economy. You have to understand this economy to be able to fix it." — Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "Last night I got more delegates than anybody else. This is a process of becoming the nominee. We're pursuing that in an intelligent way. Conservatives, when you ask in these prior elections, 'Who as conservatives did you vote [for?],' I won the conservative vote. Some who are very conservative may not be yet in my camp but they will be when I become the nominee when I face Barack Obama.  Because again, what the nation wants is someone who understands the economy, not, if you will, an economic lightweight. I mean, Senator Santorum is a nice guy but he does not understand how the economy works. He has never had a job in the real economy. You have to understand this economy to be able to fix it."
