    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Sen. Burns (R) Montana and 19 cosponsors)
The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 877. The bill, with some additional improvements, would be a useful step in helping consumers and businesses to combat unsolicited commercial e-mail, better known as "spam." The Administration applauds the Senate for its efforts to move legislation that helps to address this problem. The Administration believes that problems with spam cannot be solved by Federal legislation alone; the development and adoption of new technologies will also be necessary. The bill would help to address some of the problems associated with the rapid growth and abuse of spam by establishing a framework of administrative, civil, and criminal tools, and by providing consumers with options to reduce the volume of unwanted e-mail. The Administration believes that S. 877 should be strengthened, as outlined in the September 11th letter from the Departments of Commerce and Justice to the Chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, to better serve consumers as well as to avoid creating obstacles to effective law enforcement. The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to improve S. 877 as it moves through the legislative process.
