An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED as has been reported by the media. Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). Makes sense to me!Retweets: 20779Favorites: 96655

If anybody but Donald Trump did what I did in Syria which was an ISIS loaded mess when I became President they would be a national hero. ISIS is mostly gone we're slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families while at the same time fighting ISIS remnants......Retweets: 17379Favorites: 79095

...I campaigned on getting out of Syria and other places. Now when I start getting out the Fake News Media or some failed Generals who were unable to do the job before I arrived like to complain about me & my tactics which are working. Just doing what I said I was going to do!Retweets: 22000Favorites: 100819

I campaigned on Border Security which you cannot have without a strong and powerful Wall. Our Southern Border has long been an 'Open Wound' where drugs criminals (including human traffickers) and illegals would pour into our Country. Dems should get back here an fix now!Retweets: 21960Favorites: 90883

I am the only person in America who could say that 'I'm bringing our great troops back home with victory' and get BAD press. It is Fake News and Pundits who have FAILED for years that are doing the complaining. If I stayed in Endless Wars forever they would still be unhappy!Retweets: 25252Favorites: 111582

I'm in the Oval Office. Democrats come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security including the Wall. You voted yes in 2006 and 3013. One more yes but with me in office I'll get it built and Fast!Retweets: 1123Favorites: 4217

It's incredible how Democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bite and say that a Wall doesn't work. It does and properly built almost 100%! They say it's old technology - but so is the wheel. They now say it is immoral- but it is far more immoral for people to be dying!Retweets: 29355Favorites: 125931

Heads of countries are calling wanting to know why Senator Schumer is not approving their otherwise approved Ambassadors!? Likewise in Government lawyers and others are being delayed at a record pace! 360 great and hardworking people are waiting for approval from....Retweets: 20519Favorites: 74566

....Senator Schumer more than a year longer than any other Administration in history. These are people who have been approved by committees and all others yet Schumer continues to hold them back from serving their Country! Very Unfair!Retweets: 17027Favorites: 63013
