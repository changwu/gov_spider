    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Penny (D) MN and 39 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3390 because it would:

require the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to prepare a pamphlet on its education programs and then distribute it to individuals first applying for such benefits and annually thereafter. VA already publishes sufficient informational materials to inform veterans about available education benefits. For example, VA annually publishes 1.5 million copies of VA Pamphlet 27-82-2, which describes each of the current education benefit programs available, identifies VA sources for obtaining further information, and lists locations for filing applications.  
expand work-study program eligibility to Chapter 35 students (Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance). Work-study benefits should not be provided to nonveterans who can avail themselves of other government-wide educational assistance opportunities.  
limit to 20 hours a week the amount of time individuals could participate in a work-study program. There isâ€™no basis for such a limit. Widely varying class schedules may reasonably allow more hours to be worked during some weeks without adversely affecting individual student progress.  
permit individuals attending school on a half-time basis to be eligible for work-study benefits. The program is tailored to meet the needs of full-time students.
