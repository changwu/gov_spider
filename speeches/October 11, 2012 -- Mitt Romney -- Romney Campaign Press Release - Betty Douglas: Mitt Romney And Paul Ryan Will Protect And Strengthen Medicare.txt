    Betty Douglas, Paul Ryan's mother, made the following statement on tonight's vice-presidential debate:
"Tonight's debate showed seniors across the country that we have a very clear choice between the current administration, which has already cut Medicare by $716 billion to pay for Obamacare, and Mitt Romney and Paul who will protect Medicare for retirees like me and strengthen it for my grandchildren's generation and generations thereafter."
