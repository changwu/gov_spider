    I want to thank the members of the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission for their comprehensive and thorough review of the military compensation and retirement systems and their considered recommendations. In September 2013, I asked the Commission to focus on protecting the long-term viability of the All-Volunteer Force, improving quality of life for servicemembers and their families, and ensuring the fiscal sustainability of the compensation and retirement systems. Our men and women in uniform and their families deserve nothing less.
The Commission's report includes a number of specific proposals that I will review closely over the coming weeks in consultation with our senior civilian and military leadership. I look forward to hearing their views and working with Congress to strengthen and modernize our military compensation and retirement systems.
