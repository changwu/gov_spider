    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with section 106(a) of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority Act of 1995, I am transmitting the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority's operating budget for FY 1996.
The Authority's request for its FY 1996 operating budget is $3.5 million. This budget was developed based on an estimated staffing level of 35 full-time employees. After reviewing the budgets and staffing levels of other control boards, the Authority believes this staffing level is the minimum necessary to carry out its wide range of fiscal, management, and legal responsibilities.
This transmittal does not represent an endorsement of the budget's contents.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
