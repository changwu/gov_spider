    Mitt Romney today announced the support of U.S. Senator Rob Portman.
"It is an honor to have the support of such a committed public servant," said Mitt Romney. "Bringing fiscal sanity to Washington is critical for our country's future economic health and national security. In the United States Senate, Senator Portman has been a leader in the fight for a balanced budget and I look forward to working with him to make the federal government simpler, smaller, and smarter."
"Four years ago, President Obama came to Ohio and promised to change the broken system in Washington and fix our economy - he has failed on both counts," said Senator Rob Portman.  "Mitt Romney has been a lifelong leader who has shown how to bring people together to turn around tough situations.  And right now, that's exactly what our nation needs.  Americans can be proud to stand behind Mitt - he has balanced budgets, cut taxes, and created jobs.  He is the one candidate who will be able to defeat President Obama in November and bring conservative change to Washington while helping America achieve its great potential."
