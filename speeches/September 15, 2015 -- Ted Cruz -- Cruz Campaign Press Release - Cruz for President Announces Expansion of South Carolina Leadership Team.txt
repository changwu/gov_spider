HOUSTON, Texas â€” Today, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, announced an expansion of his South Carolina Leadership Team, including four additional state co-chairs, as well as dozens of county leaders, activists, and a growing pastors coalition.
Sen. Cruz added South Carolina State Representative Wendy Nanney and her husband Register of Deeds Tim Nanney of Greenville, along with business owners and Christian leaders Joe and Gladys Grimaud of Chapin as state co-chairs.
"I am honored to have conservative stalwarts Tim and Wendy Nanney and Joe and Gladys Grimaud join as co-chairs of our South Carolina effort," Sen. Cruz said. "Rep. Nanney has been a consistent conservative and prolific leader on life issues. Tim and Wendy's deep ties to community service and the faith-based community in the Upstate will give our campaign a significant boost throughout the state. The Grimauds are business owners, Christian leaders, and have a strong connection to the veteran community, giving them a unique perspective that will help us get our message out. I can't thank them enough for their service to our country and their support for our campaign."
Rounding out the leadership team, Cruz has added several members from across the state. The group includes small business owners, Republican women and GOP officers, Tea Party leaders, municipal elected officials, pastors, policy experts, faith-based community leaders, and Millennials.
"I appreciate the diversity and breadth of knowledge and experience in this group of leaders," Sen. Cruz added. "Their participation on the State Leadership Team ensures that our message of consistent conservatism and standing up to the Washington Cartel continues to spread. With this team our campaign will be very competitive in the Palmetto State."
