    Today former New Jersey Governor and EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman announced her support for Gov. John Kasich's presidential campaign and joined the Kasich for America leadership team in New Jersey.
"Gov. Kasich is the lone voice of reason and optimism in a very loud room," said Whitman. "His winning combination of tax cuts, balanced budgets and job creation will revive the American economy just like it has done for Ohio. John Kasich is the leader we need to offer greater opportunity to every American, and I'm proud to offer my unqualified support to his campaign."

Whitman served two terms as the 50th Governor of New Jersey from 1994 to 2001 before joining President George W. Bush's administration as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency from 2001 to 2003.
Said Kasich, "I'm humbled and grateful to receive the endorsement of a leader who understands the unique pressures of being an executive. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman shares our vision for lifting Americans through commonsense reforms without leaving anyone behind. It's a true honor to welcome her to our leadership team in the Garden State."
