    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Hughes (D) New Jersey and 6 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 4225 because it fails to strike the appropriate balance between law enforcement concerns and the constitutional right of law-abiding citizens to possess firearms. Specifically, H.R. 4225 is objectionable because it would:

—  restrict domestically manufactured weapons, and other firearms appropriate for self-defense by applying a "sporting purpose" test; and
—  prohibit the manufacture of certain firearms that are useful in military or law enforcement applications. 
The Administration urges that Congress instead pass the President's firearms-related proposals contained in H.R. 2709, the "Comprehensive Violent Crime Control Act of 1989." H.R. 2709 would provide an enhanced mandatory penalty for using a semiautomatic firearm in the course of a violent or serious crime. It would also restrict ammunition feeding devices with a capacity of 15 rounds or more.
