    (SAN FRANCISCO, October 27, 2019)â€” Presidential candidate for the Democratic nomination Tom Steyer released the following statement on the passing of former U.S. Representative John Conyers Jr.
"The passing of Representative John Conyers is a monumental loss for our country. Rep. Conyers was the longest serving African American member of Congress and a champion of civil rights. From founding the Congressional Black Caucus in 1969 to boldly calling attention to the need for reparations, Rep. Conyers worked tirelessly to promote justice for communities of color. He will be missed and his life of service will be remembered."
