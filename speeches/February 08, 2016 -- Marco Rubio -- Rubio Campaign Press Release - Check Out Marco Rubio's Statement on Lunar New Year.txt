I extend warm greetings and well wishes to millions of Americans of Asian descent who are gathering with family and friends to celebrate the Lunar New Year.   This is a season which for many is marked by anticipation and hope for the year ahead.
The holiday is a fitting time to recognize the many contributions this diverse community of Americans of Asian descent have made to America's success. My wife Jeanette joins me in sending our best wishes for peace, health, happiness and prosperity in the New Year.
