    Today, North Carolina's Republican supermajority-controlled legislature passed an extreme abortion ban that would interfere with the doctor-patient relationship and make it even harder for women — especially those in the South — to access care. The details of this ban have been obscured to make it seem less dangerous, but this bill would make it harder for many women to get the care they need. Since the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade, women have been denied medical care they desperately need in order to preserve their health and even save their lives. They've been turned away from emergency rooms, made to travel hundreds of miles for care, and left with complications that threaten their ability to bear children in the future. These impacts are the direct result of extreme state-level abortion bans. President Biden and Vice President Harris will continue to fight to restore the protections of Roe under federal law.
