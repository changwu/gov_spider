The White House Correspondents' Dinner was a failure last year but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it. The filthy 'comedian' totally bombed (couldn't even deliver her lines-much like the Seth Meyers weak performance). Put Dinner to rest or start over!Retweets: 22982Favorites: 107294

Headline: 'Kim Prepared to Cede Nuclear Weapons if U.S. Pledges Not to Invade' - from the Failing New York Times. Also will shut down Nuclear Test Site in May.Retweets: 19825Favorites: 92349

Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING but would Peace House/Freedom House on the Border of North & South Korea be a more Representative Important and Lasting site than a third party country? Just asking!Retweets: 20356Favorites: 93838

I recently had a terrific meeting with a bipartisan group of freshman lawmakers who feel very strongly in favor of Congressional term limits. I gave them my full support and endorsement for their efforts. #DrainTheSwampRetweets: 27369Favorites: 115496

The migrant 'caravan' that is openly defying our border shows how weak & ineffective U.S. immigration laws are. Yet Democrats like Jon Tester continue to support the open borders agenda ' Tester even voted to protect Sanctuary Cities. We need lawmakers who will put America First.Retweets: 24433Favorites: 98179

The Fake News is going crazy making up false stories and using only unnamed sources (who don't exist). They are totally unhinged and the great success of this Administration is making them do and say things that even they can't believe they are saying. Truly bad people!Retweets: 26345Favorites: 110396

The White House is running very smoothly despite phony Witch Hunts etc. There is great Energy and unending Stamina both necessary to get things done. We are accomplishing the unthinkable and setting positive records while doing so! Fake News is going 'bonkers!'Retweets: 21890Favorites: 96062
