    I want to congratulate the House of Representatives for its passage today of H.R. 8494, the proposed Public Disclosure of Lobbying Act of 1978. I am especially grateful to Congressman George Danielson for his leadership in helping to formulate the bill and guide it through the House.
Lobbying is a constitutionally protected activity that plays an important role in the governmental process. It is precisely because of the importance of lobbying in the conduct of the public's business that it should be more open to the public's scrutiny. This bill will enable the American people to understand and see more clearly how the legislative process is being affected by organizations that engage in significant lobbying activities.
I urge the Senate to act quickly on a lobby registration and disclosure bill so that we can have an effective new law by the end of this season.
