Fake News @CNN & MSDNC keep talking about "Lt. Col." Vindman as though I should think only how wonderful he was. Actually, I don't know him, never spoke to him, or met him (I don't believe!) but, he was very insubordinate, reported contents of my "perfect" calls incorrectly, &...Retweets: 27678Favorites: 116513

....was given a horrendous report by his superior, the man he reported to, who publicly stated that Vindman had problems with judgement, adhering to the chain of command and leaking information. In other words, "OUT".Retweets: 20667Favorites: 91435

Thank you Iowa for the RECORD vote we just received in the Primary. The Dems were 25% down (although their votes are all fried!). https://t.co/xQb5ZKWVeTRetweets: 17886Favorites: 74734

Thanks!Retweets: 26157Favorites: 119619

The only way to stop the crazed Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats "is for the Republican Senate to run an offense here". @LeeSmithDC @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews So true, although the Dems Hoaxes & Witch Hunts have driven up Republican Polls, and mine, mightily!Retweets: 16379Favorites: 65417

.@RepDebDingell, who called me, tears flowing, to thank me for rolling out the maximum "Red Carpet" for the funeral of her husband, then voted against me on the partisan Impeachmen Hoax, said "everybody (Dems) wants to get out of town.

...the worst weeks ever." She could have had a much better week if Crazy Nancy, who is the most overrated person in politics (going to lose the House a second time), didn't bring the phony & corrupt Impeachment Hoax. Dems can't do anything right, just look at the Iowa vote count!Retweets: 11718Favorites: 52357

Pete Rose played Major League Baseball for 24 seasons, from 1963-1986, and had more hits, 4,256, than any other player (by a wide margin). He gambled, but only on his own team winning, and paid a decades long price. GET PETE ROSE INTO THE BASEBALL HALL OF FAME. It's Time!Retweets: 48368Favorites: 218528
