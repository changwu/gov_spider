    I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 4996, a bill to restore the Federal trust relationship and Federal services and benefits to the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah.
The bill requires that within 2 years, the Secretary of the Interior develop and submit to the Congress a plan for the enlargement of the tribe's reservation, including the acquisition of not more than 15,000 acres of land. In developing the plan, the Department of the Interior will study closely the needs of the tribe for enlargement of its reservation and make every effort to meet those needs without the expenditure of public funds.
