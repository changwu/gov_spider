    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the enclosed notice, stating that the Libya emergency is to continue in effect beyond January 7, 2001, to the Federal Register for publication.
The crisis between the United States and Libya that led to the declaration on January 7, 1986, of a national emergency has not been resolved.
Despite the United Nations Security Council's suspension of U.N. sanctions against Libya upon the Libyan government's hand over of the Pan Am 103 bombing suspects, there are still concerns about the Libyan government's support for terrorist activities and its noncompliance with United Nations Security Council Resolutions 731 (1992), 748 (1992), and 883 (1993).
For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to maintain in force the actions taken and currently in effect to apply economic pressure on the Government of Libya.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
