    FARMINGTON HILLS, MI -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced Michigan's Grassroots Leadership Team. This team of local Michigan leaders will help organize and manage the campaign's grassroots efforts, including the "Get-Out-The-Vote" turnout operation, in each county and city across the state of Michigan.
Each of Michigan's 83 counties and 15 congressional districts will have a designated chairman at the local level to serve as the point of contact for local volunteers and supporters, and to help communicate John McCain's message of national security, stronger economy and government reform. [All state co-chairs, vice-chairs, state steering committee members, legislative leadership, congressional district and county chairs are listed below.]
"It is an honor to serve as the 11th district co-chair for John McCain's Michigan campaign," said former State Senator Laura Toy of Wayne County. "John McCain is a leader who Michiganders can believe in. He is a leader who has put country first, every time, above self interest. We believe Michiganders have a choice this November between John McCain, who will lead this nation forward with lower taxes and less government, and Barack Obama, who will lead this country backward with more taxes and bigger government. We believe that John McCain has been tested and is the best person to lead our country in these times as we continue to need strong, proven leadership."
State Representative Craig DeRoche of Oakland County, the House Republican Leader, said, "We are organized and enthusiastic about getting John McCain's positive message to Michigan. John McCain will help Michigan bring new jobs to the state while breaking our dependence on foreign oil. John McCain will win in Michigan because he shares our values and priorities."
