    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Schumer (D) New York and 155 others)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 1025.
H.R. 1025 represents a vital first step in reducing the terrible toll of gun-related violence in our Nation. This legislation requiring a waiting period and background check before the purchase of a handgun is simply common sense. It is long past time that the Congress passed it.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 1025 would increase receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill are presented below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates.
