VP Travel Pool Report #4: VPOTUS arrives in Nashville, rolling to RON
AF2 had wheels down at Nashville International Airport at 4:37pm CDT (please note time zone change).
It's a little rainy, windy and about 67 degrees Fahrenheit.
Harris exited AF2 at 4:53pm CDT. She did not stop to speak with press and instead spoke with members of the Tennessee national guard and their family. Your pool found it difficult to hear her over the plane engines. She posed for a picture with these members and their family.
She then entered the motorcade at 4:59, which began rolling at 5:01 en route to RON.

Pool dropped off VP at RON around 5:17 CDT. Pool did not see VPOTUS exit the motorcade. We had an uneventful ride. Per an official, Harris has no more scheduled events. See y'all bright and early tomorrow morning.
Some details from the airportâ€”
Other members of the pool overheard Harris speaking with Tennessee National Guard members and their children about how military service is a sacrifice for families. "I always like to meet future leaders," she said to the kids present, according to other travel pool members.
