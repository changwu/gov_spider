    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Sen. Chafee (R) Rhode Island and 4 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of S. 740, which would increase funding of wetlands acquisition programs, because the bill diverts import duties on ammunition from the general fund to a permanently appropriated fund for wetlands acquisition, which is unnecessary, contrary to sound budgetary practices, and additive to the deficit.
