    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 7/26/93)(House)(Ford (D) MI and Goodling (R) PA)
The Administration supports H.R. 2683, which would provide the necessary legal authority to extend temporarily the current migrant student record transfer system. This would allow time to evaluate issues surrounding continued Federal support for this system as part of the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.
