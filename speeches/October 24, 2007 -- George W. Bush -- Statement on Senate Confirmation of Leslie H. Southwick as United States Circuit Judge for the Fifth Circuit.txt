    The confirmation of Judge Leslie Southwick to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is a victory for America's judicial system and for the citizens of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Today's bipartisan vote resolves a longstanding judicial emergency and will help ensure that the Fifth Circuit can operate more effectively. Judge Southwick is a man of character and intelligence who will apply the law fairly. I appreciate the Senate's approval of his nomination.
While today's vote resolves one judicial emergency, many of America's Federal courts continue to have unnecessary vacancies. I have nominated highly qualified men and women to serve on these courts. Now the Senate must act. In the final 2 years of the past 3 administrations, the Senate has confirmed an average of 17 circuit court judges. But since January of this year, the Senate has confirmed only five circuit court nominees. The Senate has more work to do. I once again call upon the Senate to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities and promptly provide these nominees fair up-or-down votes.
