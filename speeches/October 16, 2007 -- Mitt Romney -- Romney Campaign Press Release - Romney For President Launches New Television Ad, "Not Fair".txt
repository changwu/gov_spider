Boston, MA – Today, Romney for President launched its newest television ad, "Not Fair." The ad highlights Governor Romney's commitment to lower taxes for all Americans. The American people should not have to pay taxes when they earn their money, save their money, and when they die. Governor Romney has proposed a conservative blueprint to lower taxes which includes permanently eliminating the death tax, rolling back tax rates across the board, and making savings tax free for middle class Americans. Change in Washington begins with Republicans advocating lower taxes.
The ad will begin airing as part of the campaign's rotation today in New Hampshire. Script and viewing links are below.

AD FACTS: Script For "Not Fair" (TV:30):
GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: "It's not fair that you have to pay taxes when you earn your money, when you save your money and then when you die."
- Governor Romney: "It seems fundamentally unfair for people to have their income taxed when they earn it, taxed when they save it and taxed when they die." (Chris Dorsey, "Romney Advocates State-Based Health Care Solutions," Iowa Politics, 5/31/07)

GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: "That's why I'll kill the death tax once and for all and roll back tax rates across the board."
- Governor Romney Will Roll Back Tax Rates Across The Board For All Americans. As President, Governor Romney will cut marginal tax rates across the board, allowing all Americans to save more money. This approach is fair, simple and extends the pro-growth benefits of tax rate cuts to all Americans.
- Governor Romney Will Kill The Death Tax. It is unfair to tax the American people three times: once when they earn their money; second when they invest it and receive income from those investments; and third when they die.

GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: "And savings? When I'm President, for middle class Americans, the new tax rate on your interest, dividends, and capital gains will be absolutely zero."
- Governor Romney Will Make Middle Class Savings Tax Free. Governor Romney's plan will allow middle class Americans to save tax free by changing the tax rate on interest, capital gains and dividends to absolutely 0%. By helping more Americans save and invest, we can meet the challenges of an aging population and ensure the financial security of America.
- Governor Romney's Plan Will Allow Over 95% Of American Families To Save And Invest Tax-Free. Any taxpayer with Adjusted Gross Income of under $200,000 would pay a tax rate of absolutely 0% on all of the income they earn from their savings, capital gains and dividends.

GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: "Want tax cuts that will grow our economy? Change begins with us. I'm Mitt Romney and I approved this message."
- Governor Romney: "Republicans for Change believe in strength. We know that the best foe against tyrants and the best ally peace has ever known is a strong America. We will strengthen the military with more troops, better armament, and better care for our veterans. We will also strengthen our economy with lower taxes and energy security. And we will strengthen the American family. There is no work more important to the future of America than the work that goes on within the four walls of the American home. The American family is the foundation upon which this country's greatness has been built, but it is a foundation in need of shoring up." (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At The Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference, Mackinac Island, MI, 9/22/07)
- Governor Romney Was The First 2008 Presidential Candidate To Sign The "Taxpayer Protection Pledge" Promising To Oppose Any Effort To Increase Taxes. "Demonstrating his commitment to oppose any effort to increase taxes on the American people, Governor Romney has signed Americans For Tax Reform's 'Taxpayer Protection Pledge.' As part of his pledge, Governor Romney will 'oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates' and 'oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits.'" (Romney For President Exploratory Committee, "Governor Mitt Romney Signs 'Taxpayer Protection Pledge'," Press Release, 1/4/07)

- Governor Romney Is The Only Major Republican Presidential Candidate To Have Signed The Pledge. GROVER NORQUIST: "Governor Mitt Romney was the first candidate to sign the pledge then all the other candidates, including some of the second-tier candidates, have signed the pledge. The one candidate who's not yet, or two candidates who've not yet signed the pledge, are Rudy Giuliani and Senator McCain. Senator McCain did sign it when he ran in 2000, so it's a little disappointing that he hasn't signed it in 2008. Giuliani's people have said he's likely to sign it, but it hasn't happened yet." CNBC's ERIN BURNETT: "And Fred Thompson hasn't signed it because of course he's not technically running?" NORQUIST: "Correct. He has not – he's not yet announced." (CNBC's "Street Signs," 8/29/07)
