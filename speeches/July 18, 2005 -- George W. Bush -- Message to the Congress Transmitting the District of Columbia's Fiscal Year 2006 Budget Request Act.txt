Pursuant to my constitutional authority and consistent with section 446 of The District of Columbia Self-Governmental Re-organizational Act as amended in 1989, I am transmitting the District of Columbia's Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Request Act.
The proposed FY 2006 Budget Request Act reflects the major programmatic objectives of the Mayor and the Council of the District of Columbia. For FY 2006, the District estimates total revenues and expenditures of $7.35 billion.
