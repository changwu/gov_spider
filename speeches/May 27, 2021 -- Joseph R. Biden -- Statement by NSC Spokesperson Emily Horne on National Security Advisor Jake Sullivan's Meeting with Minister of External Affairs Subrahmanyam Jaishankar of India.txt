They welcomed cooperation in recent weeks that resulted in deliveries of over $500 million in COVID-19 relief supplies from the U.S. federal and state governments, U.S. companies, and from private citizens across America for the people of India. They discussed a range of regional and global issues, and agreed the United States and India should continue working closely together to address common challenges throughout the Indo-Pacific region. They agreed that people-to-people ties and shared values are the foundation of the U.S.-India strategic partnership that is helping to end the pandemic, supporting a free and open Indo-Pacific, and providing global leadership on climate change.
