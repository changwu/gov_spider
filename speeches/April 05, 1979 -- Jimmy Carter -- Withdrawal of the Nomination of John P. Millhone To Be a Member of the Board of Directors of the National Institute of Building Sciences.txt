    The President today announced that he is withdrawing the nomination of John P. Millhone as a member of the Board of Directors of the National Institute of Building Sciences.
Millhone requested that this nomination be withdrawn, because since he was nominated, he has accepted the position of Director of the Office of Buildings and Community Systems of the Conservation and Solar Applications Office at the Department of Energy.
