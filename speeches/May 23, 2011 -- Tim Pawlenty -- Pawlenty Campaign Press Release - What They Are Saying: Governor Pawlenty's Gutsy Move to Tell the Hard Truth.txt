    "It's time for new leadership. It's time for a new approach. And, it's time for America's president - and anyone who wants to be president - to look you in the eye and tell you the truth."
– Governor Pawlenty
"On ethanol, Pawlenty has offered a conservative stance that genuinely involves telling an audience something they don't want to hear, and this stance is a big, flashing anti-pander in a state that's pretty key to his bid. He didn't tuck it into a policy pamphlet or a line in a speech to CPAC; he put it right there in the kickoff speech, in front of an Iowa audience not likely to be receptive. The allegedly milquetoast candidate almost comes across as a little brash."
- Jim Geraghty, National Review
"You? In Iowa? Called for an end to ethanol subsidies? ... That's politically gutsy."
- Rush Limbaugh
"If Pawlenty goes to Iowa to oppose farm subsidies, that's about as honest as a Midwestern politician can get. Will Iowans support that kind of long-overdue honesty, or will they punish Pawlenty for it?
- Ed Morrissey, HotAir
"...If this speech is any indication, Pawlenty looks he's planning to charge sacred cows in rhetoric while campaigning."
- Katrina Trinko, National Review
"Pawlenty's ethanol gambit forces them to rethink that by posing the following question: If he's willing to confront Iowa voters about their little ethanol gravy train in the name of fiscal responsibility — even though his candidacy probably depends on winning the state — then who wouldn't he be willing to confront? He's got guts."

"Telling the truth. In politics. It's an idea so crazy, so out of the box, that it just might work."
- Bryan Preston, Pajamas Media
