    Presidential Determination No. 96-4
Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of Energy
I have considered the proposed Agreement for Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy Between the United States of America and the European Atomic Energy Community, along with the views, recommendations, and statements of the interested agencies.
I have determined that the performance of the Agreement will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security. Pursuant to section 123 b. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2153(b)), I hereby approve the proposed agreement and authorize you to arrange for its execution.
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Washington, November 1, 1995.
