"I want my children and grandchildren – and yours – to live in an America that is safe and prosperous and free. Ten years ago, there wasn't much question about that: We had won the Cold War, our 'new economy' was outpacing our rivals, the dollar was strong and markets were surging.
"A lot has changed since then. But Washington hasn't. Washington is consumed with partisan battles and score settling. Driven by power and politics, Washington has been incapable of solving the challenges of a changing world."
...
"The challenges seem daunting, but Americans always rise to the occasion – we will overcome these as we have many others before. But for our children to inherit from us the great and hopeful America that was bequeathed to us by our parents, we must change Washington."
...
"The right way to overcome our challenges isn't to strengthen government, it is to strengthen the American people.
"To do that, we must first strengthen the American family. I want our children to learn that before they have babies, they should get married: Every child deserves a mother and a father. I want to protect marriage as the union of a man and a woman."
...
"I will work to strengthen our economy to provide good jobs for us and for our children. I will keep taxes down, killing the death tax and letting middle-income families save their money tax free."
...
"We must also strengthen our national security. I will add more troops to our military, with better equipment and armament and with better care for our veterans."
...
"I am optimistic about America's future. I have seen the goodness and resolve of the American people. Challenges make us strong. I will draw on my experience, my values and this vision of American strength to keep America the hope of the world, and the promise of a bright future for our children."
