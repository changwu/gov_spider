In-town pool report #1: no public events on schedule today
Good morning, everyone. Happy Saturday. I am your in-town print pooler today. The president has no public events on his schedule, but there is a coronavirus task force briefing scheduled for 12 pm.
I will provide any updates throughout the day and, as always, let me know if you have any questions.

In-town pool report #2: briefing at 12:45
We were just told overhead that the task force briefing will begin at 12:45.
They have set up video monitors behind the podium. Someone came through before the briefing to take the temperatures of everyone in the room-- the green stickers you may notice on reporters' shirts indicate their temperature was taken.
The briefing will be on camera, but your pooler will send anything notable from offscreen.
