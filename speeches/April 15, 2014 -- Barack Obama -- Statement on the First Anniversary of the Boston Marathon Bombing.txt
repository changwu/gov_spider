    A year ago, tragedy struck at the 117th Boston Marathon. Four innocent people were killed that week, and hundreds more were wounded. Today we remember Krystle Campbell, Lingzi Lu, Martin Richard, and Sean Collier. And we send our thoughts and prayers to those still struggling to recover.
We also know that the most vivid images from that day were not of smoke and chaos, but of compassion, kindness, and strength: a man in a cowboy hat helping a wounded stranger out of harm's way, runners embracing loved ones and each other, an EMT carrying a spectator to safety. Today we recognize the incredible courage and leadership of so many Bostonians in the wake of unspeakable tragedy. And we offer our deepest gratitude to the courageous firefighters, police officers, medical professionals, runners, and spectators who, in an instant, displayed the spirit Boston was built on: perseverance, freedom, and love.
One year later, we also stand in awe of the men and women who continue to inspire us: learning to stand, walk, dance, and run again. With each new step our country is moved by the resilience of a community and a city. And when the sun rises over Boylston Street next Monday, Patriot's Day, hundreds of thousands will come together to show the world the meaning of "Boston Strong," as a city chooses to run again.
