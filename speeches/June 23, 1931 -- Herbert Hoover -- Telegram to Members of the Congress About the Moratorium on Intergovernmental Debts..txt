    YOU NO DOUBT have seen my statement in Sunday's press of the Proposals of the American Government in respect to postponement for one year of all intergovernmental debts.
Inasmuch as the proposal is of course contingent upon action by Congress and as the matter is one of national interest having no partisan character in that light I consulted before action the Senators and Representatives of both parties present in Washington and as many as possible who were accessible in the country.
This list of generous support from members was shown in the public statement referred to above. I regret that difficulties of communication rendered it impossible to contact with all members of the Senate and House.
I do not wish to press any member for reply as to his views if he prefers not to give them at this time yet if you are favorable to the proposal in the first paragraph of the statement above mentioned it would undoubtedly be helpful to the general situation if you could inform me thereof.
