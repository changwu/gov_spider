    For months, President Trump misled the American people about the coronavirus — and Wisconsin families continue to suffer the consequences. His betrayal of the fundamental duties of the office has left Wisconsin small businesses shuttered, parents worrying about their children's safety at school, far too many workers out of a job, and thousands of families mourning the loss of loved ones.
It didn't have to be this bad. Mark my words — if I'm president, I'll always level with the American people, and I'll always tell the truth. I'll implement my plan to beat the virus and provide immediate economic relief to help working families, small businesses, and communities get back on their feet. And we won't just go back to the way things were before the virus — we will build back better by making "Made in America" real, creating good-paying jobs across Wisconsin, and building an economy that works for working people and not just the wealthy and well-connected.
