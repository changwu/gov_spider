    Under authority of the act of Congress approved June 4, 1897 (30 Stat. 11, 36; U.S. Code, title 16, sec. 473), and on the recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture, it is hereby ordered that the following-described lands now a part of the Lewis and Clark National Forest as defined by proclamation of June 19, 1912 (37 Stat. 1753), be, and the same are hereby, transferred to the Helena National Forest:
All lands lying south and east of a line beginning at the northeast corner of sec. 36, township 17 north, range 7 west, Montana meridian; thence in a southwesterly direction along the hydrographic divide between the East Fork of Falls Creek on the west and Bedrock and Green Creeks on the east to an intersection with the Continental Divide; thence following the Continental Divide to its intersection with the east line of sec. 30, township 16 north, range 7 west, Montana meridian.
It is not intended by this order to give any publicly owned lands a nationalforest status which have hitherto not had such status, nor to remove any publicly owned lands from a national-forest status.
