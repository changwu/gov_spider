    American taxpayers have a right to expect that their Federal dollars are being put to the best possible use. The current Federal procurement system is inefficient and wasteful. It adds significant costs without providing extra value. It's time the Federal Government viewed Federal purchasing as a major source of savings by creating a more efficient and responsive Federal procurement system.
If Congress does their part and we do our part in the administration, procurement reforms in the first year alone will save enough money to fund something Americans care deeply about, fighting crime by fighting drugs and putting more police on the streets all across our country.
