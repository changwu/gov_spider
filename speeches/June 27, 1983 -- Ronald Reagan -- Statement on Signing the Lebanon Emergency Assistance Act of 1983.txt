    I am pleased to sign into law S. 639, the Lebanon Emergency Assistance Act of 1983. This act authorizes the appropriation of urgently needed economic and military assistance for Lebanon. The funding authorized by this act will greatly assist in promoting the economic and political stability of that country and support the international effort to strengthen a sovereign and independent Lebanon.
Section 4(a) of the act confirms this administration's announced intention with respect to congressional authorization concerning any future substantial expansion in the number or role of U.S. forces in Lebanon. As indicated in its legislative history, that section does not prevent the initiation of such actions, if circumstances require it, while Congress is considering a request for statutory authorization; nor, of course, is it intended to infringe upon the constitutional authority of the President as Commander in Chief, particularly with respect to contingencies not expected in the context of the multinational effort to strengthen the sovereignty and independence of Lebanon.
