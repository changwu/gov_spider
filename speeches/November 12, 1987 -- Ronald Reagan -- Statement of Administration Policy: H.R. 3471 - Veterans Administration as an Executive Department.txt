    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Brooks (D) Texas)
The administration supports making the Veterans Administration a Cabinet Department as proposed in H.R. 3471, but will work with the Senate to make certain changes in the legislation that would provide the Secretary with more flexibility to determine the organization and structure of the new Department.
