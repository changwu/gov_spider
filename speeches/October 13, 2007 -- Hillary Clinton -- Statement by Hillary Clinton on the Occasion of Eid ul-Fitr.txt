    Hillary Clinton today released the following statement in celebration of Eid-ul-Fitr, which marks the end the month of Ramadan or fasting.
"I am pleased to join Muslim-Americans today in celebration of Eid-ul-Fitr, marking the end of the sacred month of Ramadan. During these times of conflict, it is critical that we recognize the positive role of spiritual renewal, compassion, and charity that the month of Ramadan symbolizes. In the United States, millions of Muslims represent hard-working, law-abiding, and family-oriented Americans of all ethnicities and national origins.
"I am committed to encouraging the principles of diversity and mutual respect that are the bedrock of our nation. We need to help all Americans understand the important contributions that Muslim-Americans make to keep our communities and country strong. I wish Eid Mubarak, or Happy Eid, with prayers for peace and harmony to all."
