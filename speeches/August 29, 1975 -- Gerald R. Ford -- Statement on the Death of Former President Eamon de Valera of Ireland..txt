    IT IS with profound regret that I have learned of the death of Eamon de Valera, the former President of Ireland. I extend my deepest sympathy and that of the American people to his family and to the people and the Government of Ireland. For half a century, Mr. de Valera was a symbol of Ireland's ideals and aspirations. He served the Irish people devotedly and unstintingly, as parliamentarian, Prime Minister, and as President for 14 years. Mr. de Valera also personified the ties of kinship and friendship between Ireland and the United States. Together with the Irish people, we mourn his passing.
