Politico: All U.S. Troops To Withdraw From Afghanistan Under Peace Deal The United States signed a historic peace deal with the Taliban in Doha, Qatar, Saturday that officials hope will mark the beginning of the end of America's longest war. Under the deal, all U.S. troops would withdraw from Afghanistan in 14 months if the Taliban meet their commitments. The signing between Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban officials will set the stage for the final withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan after 19 years of violence that has killed more than 3,500 Americans and coalition troops and tens of thousands of Afghans since the U.S. invasion following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. President Donald Trump said of the peace negotiations at a press conference at the White House on Saturday afternoon that "we think they will be successful in the end," adding, "I'll be meeting personally with Taliban leaders in the not too distant future."
NBC News: Trump Approves Additional Travel Restrictions On Iran, Advisories To Prevent Spread President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence on Saturday announced additional travel restrictions involving Iran and increased warnings about travel to Italy and South Korea to combat the coronavirus after the health officials in Washington state announced the first death in the U.S. from the virus. Pence, who's been placed in charge of the administration's response, said the U.S. would keep out any foreign national who's been in Iran within 14 days. The administration is also urging Americans not to travel to areas of Italy and South Korea that have been struck hard by the virus. Travel from China to the U.S. has already been restricted and Trump said he was also looking at restrictions on entry from America's southern border. Trump said the coronavirus victim who died in Washington was "a wonderful woman" in her fifties who was at "medically high-risk" for the illness. Trump said four other Americans are seriously all, and there are currently 22 confirmed cases.

President Donald Trump appointed Pence on Wednesday to oversee the administration's response to the coronavirus.

Ron DeSantis and his health staff at Palm Beach International Airport before speaking with reporters.

Trump, speaking only moments after the death in Washington state was announced, took a more measured approach a day after he complained that the virus threat was being overblown and that his political enemies were perpetuating a "hoax." "This is very serious stuff," he said, but still insisted the criticism of his administration's handling of the virus outbreak was a hoax. Trump appeared at a hastily called news conference in the White House briefing room with Vice President Mike Pence and top public health officials to announce that the U.S. was banning travel to Iran and urging Americans not to travel to regions of Italy and South Korea where the virus has been prevalent.

Business Insider: 'STOP BUYING MASKS': US Surgeon General And VP Say Masks Won't Help Fight Coronavirus Even As Demand For Emergency Supplies Increases Vice President Mike Pence said at a press conference Saturday that followed the first US coronavirus death that there was no need for people in the US to buy and wear masks to protect themselves from COVID-19. At a press conference Saturday, Trump and Pence, joined by other administration officials, spoke about coronavirus following the death of a person in Washington state. "The president mentioned masks," Pence said. "This morning we talked a great deal about additional medical supplies. Let me be very clear, and I'm sure the physicians who are up here will reflect this as well. The average American does not need to go out and buy a mask." The president at a press conference at the White House on Wednesday put the vice president in charge of the nation's coronavirus strategy as the federal government faced criticism over its response to the virus as it continues to spread beyond China's borders around the globe. The US has access to 43 million medical masks, President Trump said, just one of the resources that he credited with ensuring the country is "prepared for whatever circumstance."

Pence said [relevant remarks begin around 8:15], "The risk of the spread of the coronavirus in the United States of America remains low. That's according to all of our experts. And it's a direct result of the unprecedented action that President Trump took last month, when he closed our border to Chinese individuals coming into the country and also established a quarantining effort. Our White House Coronavirus Task Force has literally been meeting every day for the last six weeks. And the American people can be confident that we're going to bring, at the president's direction, the full resources of the federal government to bear to protect the people of this country."
