    Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and Republican candidate for President, today announced that Alabama State Senator, Tripp Pittman, has endorsed him in his campaign for the presidency. As a small business owner and entrepreneur, Senator Pittman understands just how important sound economic policies are to creating jobs and growing the economy. As a civic leader and statesman, he knows exactly what kind of leadership it takes to rebuild and strengthen the communities and cities that make up the foundation of American society.
"Dr. Carson's life exemplifies the American Dream," said Senator Pittman. "As a husband, father and renowned neurosurgeon, he leads by example. Combined with his intellect and the virtues of hard work, integrity and a strong moral foundation, Dr. Carson will lead America forward, deal with our many challenges and help us achieve a more secure and prosperous future."
Dr. Carson said he is honored and humbled to have the support of Senator Pittman. "He has been a dedicated servant to the people of Alabama, fighting for pro-growth economic policies and a limited, accountable government," he said. "Leaders like Tripp exemplify my call to return faith, integrity and common sense to all levels of government, and I appreciate his support in this critical election."
