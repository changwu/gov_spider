    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Murphy (D) PA and 40 others)
The Administration supports a responsible increase in the Federal minimum wage, but opposes H.R. 2710. This bill would increase the Federal hourly minimum wage to $4.25 over a two-year period. This accelerated phase-in would exacerbate inflation and result in economic harm. H.R. 2710 also fails to provide a meaningful training wage, and would establish an objectionable minimum wage review board, which would result in "back-door" indexing of the minimum wage.
The President's senior advisers would recommend veto of H.R. 2710 if it were presented to him in its current form.
