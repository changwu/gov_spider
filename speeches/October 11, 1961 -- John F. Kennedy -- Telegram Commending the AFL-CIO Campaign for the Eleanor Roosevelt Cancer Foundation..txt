    Mr. George Meany, President American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations Hotel Commodore New York, New York
I was delighted to learn today that the AFL-CIO and its member unions have pledged to raise $1 million for the Eleanor Roosevelt Cancer Foundation. Your decisions to undertake this special effort on behalf of the general welfare, at a time when you are also confronted with many problems of direct and immediate concern to your members, exemplifies again the spirit of public service that is traditional in the American labor movement. I wish your campaign every success.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
