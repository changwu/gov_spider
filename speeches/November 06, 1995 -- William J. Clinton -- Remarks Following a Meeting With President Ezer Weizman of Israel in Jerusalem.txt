    First, let me just say how pleased I am to have had the opportunity to come here for a second time to visit with President Weizman on this very, very sad day for Israel and for the United States. I want to emphasize today the support of the American people for the people of Israel. It is evidenced by our delegation here. We have three American Presidents, three American Secretaries of State, almost 40 Members of our Congress, including the leadership of both parties in both Houses of our Congress, and a very distinguished group of American religious and business leaders, all coming here to express our support and our solidarity, our grief over the death of Prime Minister Rabin and our support for the process of peace.
But for me, this is not a day to discuss the future or policies beyond what I have already said. I think you can see, by the kind of delegation that came from the United States, how strongly we feel about our support for Israel and how strongly we feel about our support for peace.
Thank you.
