    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with section 360D of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 2631), I am submitting the report of the Department of Health and Human Services regarding the administration of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act during calendar year 1989.
The report recommends that section 360D of the Public Health Service Act that requires the completion of this annual report be repealed. All the information found in this report is available to the Congress on a more immediate basis through the Center for Devices and Radiological Health Center technical reports, the Radiological Health Bulletin, and other publicly available sources. This annual report serves little useful purpose and diverts agency resources from more productive activities.
