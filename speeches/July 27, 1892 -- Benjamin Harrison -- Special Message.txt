    To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith, with its accompaniments, a report from the Secretary of the Navy of the results of the survey made pursuant to the act of March 2, 1891, "to enable the President to cause careful soundings to be made between San Francisco, Col., and Honolulu, in the Kingdom of the Hawaiian Islands, for the purpose of determining the practicability of the laying of a telegraphic cable between those points."
