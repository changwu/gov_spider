    To the Congress of the United States:
The promotion of desirable community development and flexibility in urban transportation policies are principal goals of this Administration.
It is clear that in order to promote the orderly development of urban areas according to local priorities, our efforts should be focused on measures which better integrate and coordinate all modes of transportation in urban areas with other physical and social programs. Moreover, State and local governments should be given greater participation in major decisions in the use of Federal programs affecting community development.
I am pleased to submit to the Congress this report which summarizes the many ways in which the executive branch of the Federal Government is working to effect significant improvements toward that end.
The report was prepared jointly by the Departments of Transportation and of Housing and Urban Development as required by section 4(g) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966. In particular, it documents the cooperative efforts on legislative proposals, policies and activities that are being taken by this Administration to assure that urban transportation systems most effectively serve both national transportation needs and the development policies of individual urban areas.
I commend this report to the attention of the Congress.
