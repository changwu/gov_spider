    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement about George Tenet's new book, which describes how the Bush Administration twisted intelligence in its rush to war in Iraq.
"The very least we can do from George Tenet's new book, is to learn some lessons. Tenet has made it clear how much the Administration compromised the truth in the march to war. We don't need any compromises to end it. When the president vetoes Congress' bill to end the war, Congress should send the same bill right back to him."
