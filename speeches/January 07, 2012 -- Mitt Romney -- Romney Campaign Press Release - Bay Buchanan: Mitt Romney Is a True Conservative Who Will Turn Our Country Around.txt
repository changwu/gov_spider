    Conservative leader Bay Buchanan made the following statement following tonight's debate:
"Mitt Romney was the clear winner of tonight's debate because, once again, he proved that he is a true conservative who will turn this country around. Conservatives need a candidate who not only shares our views, but is committed to putting them into action. Mitt Romney is the strong leader we need to reverse Obamacare, create jobs, and secure our borders. Americans cannot afford four more years of President Obama and his failed policies."
