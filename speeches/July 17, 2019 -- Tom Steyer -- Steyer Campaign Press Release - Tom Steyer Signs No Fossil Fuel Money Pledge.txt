    Steyer's signature comes after a decade of taking on Big Oil, fighting for renewable energy, and combating the effects of the climate crisis
(San Francisco, July 17, 2019) â€” Presidential candidate Tom Steyer vowed to not accept campaign contributions from the fossil fuel industry by signing the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge. In a video posted today, Steyer is shown signing the Pledge and voicing his unwavering commitment to continue his fight against dirty fossil fuel money corrupting our political system. Steyer becomes the twenty-first Democratic presidential candidate to sign on to the Pledge.
"For too long, big oil, gas, and coal companies have used their money to influence politicians and kill real action on climate change," stated Steyer. "We must protect and prioritize the needs of the American people, both today and tomorrow. That's why I've spent the last decade taking on the oil lobby to win clean air laws, leading grassroots campaigns that defeated powerful special interests, and working to address climate change. That's why signing the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge is a no-brainer for me. Climate change is a crisis and we need to respond with immediate action. Getting dirty money out of politics is the first step."
Taking the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge means that Steyer and his campaign will not accept any contributions over $200 from PACs, lobbyists, or executives of fossil fuel companies. The Pledge aims to combat the influence of companies whose primary business is the extraction, processing, distribution, or sale of oil, gas, or coal. Fossil fuel companies spent more than $260 million in campaign contributions and lobbying Congress in the 2016 cycle in exchange for subsidies and friendly laws that put polluters before the people. Signing the Pledge is rejecting the fossil fuel industry and its money, and instead prioritizing our climate, our health, and our democracy.
