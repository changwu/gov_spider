    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, the Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer ("Montreal Protocol"), adopted at Copenhagen on November 23-25, 1992, by the Fourth Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. I am also enclosing, for the information of the Senate: the adjustments, also adopted November 23-25, 1992, that accelerate the respective phaseout schedules for substances already controlled under the Protocol (chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, other fully halogenated CFCs, methyl chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride); and the report of the Department of State.
The principal feature of the Amendment that was negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), is the addition of new controlled substances, namely hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrobromofluorocarbons (HBFCs), and methyl bromide. The Amendment, coupled with the adjustments, will constitute a major step forward in protecting public health and the environment from potential adverse effects of stratospheric ozone depletion.
The Amendment will enter into force on January 1, 1994, provided that 20 Parties to the Montreal Protocol have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, or approval. Early ratification by the United States is important to demonstrate to the rest of the world our commitment to protection and preservation of the stratospheric ozone layer and will encourage the wide participation necessary for full realization of the Amendment's goals.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Amendment and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
