    Our economy is sliding into recession and the strain on working families – from stagnant wages, rising energy costs, looming foreclosures, and skyrocketing tuition – is growing. Yet, the Bush Administration has acted once again to tilt the balance of power towards corporations instead of hardworking Americans. I believe we should expand the FMLA so that all workers have the time they need to care for themselves, their children, or sick family members, and be responsible employees.
I have proposed a bold agenda to address the work-family squeeze that so many parents feel. Forty percent of workers are currently ineligible for FMLA benefits because they work part-time, work for small businesses, or are new to their jobs. My plan will expand the FMLA to cover 13 million additional workers, provide 7 sick days, move us towards paid family leave for new parents and caregivers, and provide greater access to quality child care for working families. I was also proud to work with my colleague Senator Dodd to enact legislation that provides extended access to leave for the relatives of wounded military members.
The Bush Administration is seeking to make it more difficult for employees to claim paid leave when it is available to them by requiring the employers leave policies to take precedent over the FMLA; requiring employees with chronic health conditions to obtain an annual certification that they are able to do their job or risk being transferred to a different job; allowing employers to communicate directly with medical providers, which raises privacy concerns; and much more. The proposed regulation is 500 pages long.
The Family and Medical Leave Act makes it possible for people to meet their responsibilities at work and at home. I have advanced a positive agenda to move our nation towards this goal. The President's proposed regulations, unfortunately, are a harmful step back.
