    To Lee Kling
I have your letter advising me of your need to devote more time to your interests in the private sector.
I want to take this opportunity to personally express my gratitude and appreciation for the contributions you have made to my Administration, especially your tireless dedication to our fight against inflation. I know I can count on your continued support in this effort, as well as your willingness to serve on the Board of Directors of AMTRAK.
I trust that in the days and months ahead I may continue to seek your advice and counsel. You have my warmest wishes for continued success.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER

Dear Mr. President:
My experience over the last eight months as your Assistant Special Counselor on Inflation and Deputy to Ambassador Strauss has been extremely rewarding and enjoyable. I want you to know how much I appreciate your making this opportunity possible.
As you have pointed out, inflation is our nation's most crucial economic concern. During the past several months, the groundwork has been laid for a comprehensive and sustained attack on this critical problem. With the guidance of Bob Strauss and your other economic policy advisers, and now with the addition of Alfred Kahn, I know that your program is developing the broad support necessary to insure success.
With this in mind, I am anxious to return now to my work in the private sector. You may rest assured, however, that I will continue to support vigorously and speak on behalf of the anti-inflation program, as well as your other programs which I endorse so enthusiastically.
The experience of working with you and your fine staff has been a privilege I will remember and treasure. Needless to say, I will always be available to assist you in any way possible.
With my deepest devotion and respect,
Sincerely,
S. LEE KLING
[The President, The White House, Washington, D.C. 20500]
