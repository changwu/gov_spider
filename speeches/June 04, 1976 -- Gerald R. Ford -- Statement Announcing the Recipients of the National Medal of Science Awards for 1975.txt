    The National Medal of Science is the Nation's highest award for outstanding achievement in science and engineering. I am most pleased to announce the selection of 15 outstanding Americans who are designated as the 1975 recipients of this award.
The records of discovery, contribution, and service to the Nation of these medalists demonstrate the diversity and strength of our Nation's scientific and engineering endeavors. The winners have contributed to the fundamental understanding of our natural environment in both the world and universe in which we live. Their accomplishments include dramatic contributions to increased productivity in agriculture and improvement of human health. Their research in mathematics and its applications have revolutionized our methods of conducting research and our utilization of computer technology in operations and systems research. New sources of energy have been derived from the fundamental research undertaken by other recipients.
In short, the contributions of these 15 distinguished people are a useful reminder to all of us how valuable it is to maintain a strong national effort in research and development. I am committed to the belief that a vigorous effort to discover and apply new knowledge will keep our Nation strong.
