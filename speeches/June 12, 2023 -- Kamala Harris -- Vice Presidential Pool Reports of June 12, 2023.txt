VPOTUS In-town pool report #2: additional info from College Athlete Day
Correction: Flagging that DeUndre Eberhart was not in attendance, per the Vice President's office.Eberhart is also not the mayor of Atlanta, as stated in the information provided by VPOTUS's office in the last report. (Thank you to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution for catching.)
VPOTUS walked out on stage at 11:42 a.m. EST.She handed the mic over at 11:48, as it started sprinkling outside.She stood beside the second gentleman under umbrellas as the program continued. Clear ponchos were handed out to people in the crowd.Event was over fewer than 20 minutes later.
