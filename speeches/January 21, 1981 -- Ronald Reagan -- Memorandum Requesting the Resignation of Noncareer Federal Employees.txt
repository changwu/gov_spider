    Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
As President, I take office with the commitment to the American people to begin anew and undertake basic changes in government. Accordingly, it is important that non-career appointees occupying policy-making and confidential positions be committed to achieving these goals.
Therefore, I request that all Department and Agency heads and other proper personnel, where appropriate and in coordination with the Office of Presidential Personnel, obtain the resignation of PAS's and PA's (Presidential appointment with Senate confirmation and Presidential appointments).
In addition, I ask all Department and Agency heads to obtain the offer of resignation from non-career SES's (Senior Executive Service), NEA's (Non-career Executive Assignment) for appropriate determination as to removal or retention. (This request is not made to heads of independent regulatory agencies.) It is our intention to accept most such offers of resignation.
Sensitivity to providing for ongoing Government functions and complying with appropriate laws and regulations is required in the acceptance of resignations of persons holding the positions specified in the above two paragraphs.
I wish to thank all those who will be leaving government for their services to our country and know that they will understand that this step in no way reflects upon them personally. The new Administration wishes them well.
RONALD REAGAN
