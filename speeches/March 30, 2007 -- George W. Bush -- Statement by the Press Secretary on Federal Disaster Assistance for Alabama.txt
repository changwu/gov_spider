    The President today made additional disaster assistance available to the State of Alabama impacted by severe storms and tornadoes on March 1, 2007, by authorizing an increase in the level of Federal funding for debris removal and emergency protective measures under the Public Assistance program, including direct Federal assistance, for a period of up to 48 hours.
The President's major disaster declaration issued for the State on March 3, 2007, initially authorized Individual Assistance, and any other forms of assistance under the Stafford Act subject to the completion of Preliminary Damage Assessments. Subsequent to the declaration, Public Assistance and Hazard Mitigation were authorized at 75 percent Federal funding of total eligible costs.
Under the President's order today, the Federal share for debris removal and emergency protective measures (Categories A and B), including direct Federal assistance, under the Public Assistance program has been increased to 100 percent of the eligible costs for a period of up to 48 hours.
The cost-share adjustment is retroactive to the date of the President's major disaster declaration for the State of Alabama.
