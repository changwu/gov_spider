    On Saturday, April 29th at 11:00 AM ET, in honor of Month of the Military Child, the First Lady will host the first-ever Joining Forces Military Kids Workout on the South Lawn of the White House to highlight the importance of building connections between military and civilian communities, and demonstrate the many ways to celebrate military-connected children. Joining Forces is the First Lady's initiative to support military families, which includes families of service members and veterans, caregivers and survivors.
The workout will be led by Team Red, White and Blue (Team RWB), an organization dedicated to supporting the mental and physical wellbeing of veterans and service members while building connection with communities, and Will B. Reynolds III, U.S. Army veteran and founding board member of Team RWB. This workout will include veterans, service members, their families and children, caregivers, and survivors, as well as members of community-based workout groups, and Biden-Harris Administration officials and staff. The workout will be accessible and adaptable for children and individuals of all ages and skill levels.
Dr. Biden will deliver brief remarks to kick off the workout. This event will be open press. For interested media, RSVP HERE by Friday, April 28th at 5:00 PM.
