    To the Congress of the United States:
I hereby report to the Congress on the developments since September 26, 1993, concerning the national emergency with respect to Angola that was declared in Executive Order No. 12865 of that date. This report is submitted pursuant to section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).
On September 26, 1993, I declared a national emergency with respect to Angola, invoking the authority, inter alia, of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 (22 U.S.C. 287c). Consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolution No. 864, dated September 15, 1993, the order prohibits the sale or supply by United States persons or from the United States, or using U.S.registered vessels or aircraft, of arms and related materiel of all types, including weapons and ammunition, military vehicles, equipment and spare parts, and petroleum and petroleum products to the territory of Angola other than through designated points of entry. The order also prohibits such sale or supply to the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ("UNITA"). United States persons are prohibited from activities that promote or are calculated to promote such sales or supplies, or from attempted violations, or from evasion or avoidance or transactions that have the purpose of evasion or avoidance, of the stated prohibitions. The order authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions including the promulgation of rules and regulations, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the order.
1. On December 10, 1993, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("FAC") issued the UNITA (Angola) Sanctions Regulations (the "Regulations") (58 Fed. Reg. 64904) to implement the President's declaration of a national emergency and imposition of sanctions against UNITA. A copy of the Regulations is attached for reference.
The Regulations prohibit the sale or supply by United States persons or from the United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft, of arms and related materiel of all types, including weapons and ammunition, military vehicles, equipment and spare parts, and petroleum and petroleum products to UNITA or to the territory of Angola other than through designated points. United States persons are also prohibited from activities that promote or are calculated to promote such sales or supplies to UNITA or Angola, or from any transaction by any United States persons that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in the Executive order. Also prohibited are transactions by United States persons, or involving the use of U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft relating to transportation to Angola or to UNITA of goods the exportation of which is prohibited.
The Government of Angola has initially designated the following points of entry as points in Angola to which the articles otherwise prohibited by the Regulations may be shipped: Airports: Luanda, and Katumbela, Benguela Province; Ports: Luanda, Lobito, Benguela Province, and Namibe, Namibe Province; and Entry Points: Malongo, Cabinda Province. Although no specific license is required by the Department of the Treasury for shipments to these designated points of entry (unless the item is destined for UNITA), any such exports remain subject to the licensing requirements of the Departments of State and/or Commerce.
2. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month period from September 26, 1993, through March 25, 1994, that are directly attributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the declaration of a national emergency with respect to UNITA are reported at about $85,000, most of which represents wage and salary costs for Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in the Department of the Treasury (particularly in the FAC, the U.S. Customs Service, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Enforcement, and the Office of the General Counsel) and the Department of State (particularly the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs and the Office of the Legal Adviser).
I shall continue to report periodically to the Congress on significant developments, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).
