    Two years ago, the United States gave official notice that we would leave the International Labor Organization unless corrective measures were taken to restore that organization's commitment to its original purposes. Because such measures have not been taken, I direct that United States membership in ILO be terminated. The United States remains ready to return whenever the ILO is again true to its proper principles and procedures.
