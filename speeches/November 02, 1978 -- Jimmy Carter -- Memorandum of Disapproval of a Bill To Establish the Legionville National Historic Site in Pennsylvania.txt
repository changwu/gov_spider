    MEMORANDUM OF DISAPPROVAL
I am withholding my approval from S. 1104, a bill that would authorize the establishment of the Legionville National Historic Site in the State of Pennsylvania. I am withholding my signature because I do not believe the Legionville site is of sufficient national significance to merit the cost of establishing and maintaining it as a national historic site.
The site does not meet the national significance criteria for historical areas established by the Department of the Interior. The Pennsylvania State Historic Preservation Office judged the site of only local significance. A National Park Service report made in June 1977 agreed. Further, the site has been altered by such modern intrusions as a railroad and an interstate highway.
The career of General "Mad" Anthony Wayne has been amply commemorated at other designated sites and I do not believe the added expense of acquiring and developing this site is a worthwhile expenditure of Federal funds.
