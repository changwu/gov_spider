    AUSTIN — Today Governor Rick Perry released the following statement after reports emerged that the Federal Bureau of Investigations took possession of thumb drives and servers containing Secretary Clinton's emails during her tenure as Secretary of State:
"It's no surprise that after her disastrous tenure at the State Department, Secretary Clinton continues to try to hide the evidence of her failed leadership from the American people. Leadership is not about convenience — it's about judgement and character. Secretary Clinton continues to prove she has neither."
