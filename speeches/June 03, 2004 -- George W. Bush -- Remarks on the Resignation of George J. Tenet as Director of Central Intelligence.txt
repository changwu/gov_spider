    Today George Tenet, the Director of the CIA, submitted a letter of resignation. I met with George last night in the White House. I had a good visit with him. He told me he was resigning for personal reasons. I told him I'm sorry he's leaving. He's done a superb job on behalf of the American people. I accepted his letter. He will serve at the CIA as the Director until mid-July, at which time the Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, John McLaughlin, will serve as the Acting Director.
George Tenet is the kind of public service you likeâ€”servant you like to work with. He's strong. He's resolute. He served his Nation as the Director for 7 years. He has been a strong and able leader at the Agency. He's been a strong leader in the war on terror, and I will miss him. I send my blessings to George and his family. I look forward to working with him until the time he leaves the Agency. And I wish him all the very best.
Thank you.
