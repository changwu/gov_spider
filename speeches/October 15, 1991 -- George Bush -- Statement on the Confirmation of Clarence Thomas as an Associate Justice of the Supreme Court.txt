    I am pleased that the Senate voted to confirm Judge Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court. Judge Thomas has demonstrated to the Congress and to the Nation that he is a man of honesty, dedication, and commitment to the Constitution and the rule of law. The Nation and the Court benefit from having a man of principle who is sensitive to the problems and opportunities facing all Americans.
I thank Senator Jack Danforth and other Members of the Senate who helped guide this nomination through to confirmation.
