    The President today nominated John A. Rollwagen, the head of the world's largest manufacturer of supercomputers, to be the Deputy Secretary of Commerce. Rollwagen is the chairman and CEO of Cray Research, Inc.
"The Department of Commerce will play a leading role in the development of a high skill, high wage economy," President Clinton said. "Having presided over a high skill, high wage corporation for 15 years, John Rollwagen can help us bring this about. As a proven CEO of a high technology company, Rollwagen is an innovative thinker and highly respected manager. He combines business savvy, international experience, and high technology knowledge. I'm convinced that he is the best choice to work together with Secretary Ron Brown to make the Commerce Department a powerful part of our administration's work of restoring the competitiveness of American business," said the President.
