VPOTUS Pool 7 - Walsh sworn in
Pool was escorted into the VP's ceremonial office at 5:08 pm. The event started a touch later than expected.
Harris, wearing a monochrome maroon (though some may say brown) suit, entered her ceremonial office at 5:47 pm. Walsh subsequently gave his oath, and was officially sworn in a minute later. Harris did not answer a shouted question on the chances of gun control passing in the Senate.
