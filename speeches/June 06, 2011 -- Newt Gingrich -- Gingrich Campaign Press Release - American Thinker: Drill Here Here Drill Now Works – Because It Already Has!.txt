    From the American Thinker:
...Drill here drill now works! American ingenuity in energy technology has fostered a boom in natural gas prospecting. Hundreds of small to medium size American energy companies are creating tens of thousands of good paying jobs developing Americas vast natural gas deposits, leading the way for this energy of the future.
The same will hold true for gasoline. America produces about 6 million of the 20 million barrels a day of the national consumption. Current worldwide proven reserves equal 1 trillion barrels of oil with another 1.7 trillion in current and undiscovered reserve growth. Developing America's oil reserves by following the Natural gas trend will bring gas to about $1.90 a gallon at the pump. Allowing development of America's reserves alone would alleviate or dependence on foreign oil. Factoring in the estimated 2 trillion barrels of oil shale deposits America has over 250 years of oil reserves. The evidence is irrefutable we can do the same for Oil as is being done for Natural Gas. It's time to stop the government moratorium on domestic energy development and fuel the engine of American economic prosperity.
