    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Ohio Senate Minority Whip Ray Miller.
During his 16-year tenure in the Ohio House of Representatives, Miller helped pass landmark legislation, including the creation of the Ohio Department of Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services and Ohio Commission on Minority Health, the Community Mental Health Act of 1988, and the nation's first state-level funding for the Head Start Program.
Before serving in the Ohio legislature, Miller worked on the White House staff as Deputy Special Assistant to President Jimmy Carter. Prior to that, he served as the Assistant Director of Legislation for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and Vice-President of Minority Affairs for Columbus State Community College.
Miller is president of Professional Employment Services of America.
"I'm honored to have Ray's support," Clinton said. "With his help, our message of change will resonate across Ohio."
