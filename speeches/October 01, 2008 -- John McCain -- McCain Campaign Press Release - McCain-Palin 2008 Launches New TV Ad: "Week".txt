Script For "Week" (TV :30) 
JOHN MCCAIN: What a week.
Democrats blamed Republicans,
Republicans blamed Democrats.
We're the United States of America.
It shouldn't take a crisis to pull us together.
We need a President who can avert crisis.
Put people back to work.
Grow our economy.
And move people from surviving to thriving.
We need leadership without painful new taxes.
That will make our country strong again.
I'm John McCain and I approve this message.
