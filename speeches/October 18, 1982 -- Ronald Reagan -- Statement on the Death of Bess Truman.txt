    Bess Truman lived a long, full life, serving her husband, her family, and her country with dignity. She was a devoted wife, a loving mother, and a gracious, unassuming First Lady. Bess Truman embodied the basic decency of America. Nancy and I convey our deepest sympathy to her family and to all who will miss this fine lady's goodness.
