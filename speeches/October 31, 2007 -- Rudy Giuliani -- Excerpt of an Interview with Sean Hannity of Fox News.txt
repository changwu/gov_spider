    SEAN HANNITY: "Let me start with the Democrats blasting you. You were a big name last night in the debate even though you weren't there. I'm sure you're aware of it by now."
MAYOR GIULIANI: "Sean, we claimed victory in last night's debate. I think I was the clear winner since I got mentioned more than the Democrats got mentioned and I didn't make a mistake. I didn't say that I saw an unidentified flying object. I didn't give two internally contradictory answers to one question. Never seen that before. I've seen Hillary, you know do a southern accent in the South and talk like a New Yorker in New York and take two different positions on Iran and six different positions on Iraq, but I never saw her take two different positions in one minute in front of the same audience."
HANNITY: "It's priceless isn't it?"
MAYOR GIULIANI: "No, I think that we should just keep that tape. It says everything that Obama and Edwards were trying to say about her not being able to take and stick with a position. It is—I've never seen that in a presidential debate. I've seen a lot of things go wrong, but I've never seen anybody say two totally contradictory things about a simple subject – either for or against driver's licenses for illegals. This is not like a really complex question."
HANNITY: "Well, she equivocated on a number of issues here including the answer on Social Security. A blue ribbon commission?"
MAYOR GIULIANI: "She usually gets out of it by saying, 'I don't answer hypothetical questions. These are complex matters of war and peace, life and death.' Give me a break. A driver's license is not. You either are for it or against it. Obama was able to get the answer out. He said he's for it. I'm against it. Ok. We can debate that. I can respect the disagreement. But that kind of game they play. I mean this is the worst of the Clinton years coming back, I think, to kind of stare her in the face."
