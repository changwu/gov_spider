    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. DeLay (R) TX and 12 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 4504, the Orderly and Timely Interstate Placement of Foster Children Act of 2004. This bill would help speed up the interstate adoption process so that children could be placed in permanent, loving homes more quickly by authorizing the Department of Health and Human Services to make incentive grants to States that complete timely interstate home studies. The Administration is particularly pleased that the House bill includes a provision that eliminates the ability of States to opt out of requirements to conduct criminal background checks on foster and adoptive parents.
