    On Wednesday, March 29th, at 12:45 PM, as part of the First Lady's Joining Forces initiative and ahead of Month of the Military Child, Dr. Biden will visit Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Greene County, Ohio, to meet with military families. During the visit, Dr. Biden will tour a local Purple Star elementary school supporting military-connected children and host a listening session with military parents. The First Lady will highlight President Biden's investments for military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors in his FY 2024 budget proposal to Congress.
The mission of Joining Forces is to support those who also serve: military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors. The First Lady's work and priorities of Joining Forces are guided by the life experiences and the perspectives shared during listening sessions with military-connected families.
Portions of this visit will be open press. For interested media, RSVP HERE by Tuesday, March 28th at 12:00 PM.
**All times are local.**
