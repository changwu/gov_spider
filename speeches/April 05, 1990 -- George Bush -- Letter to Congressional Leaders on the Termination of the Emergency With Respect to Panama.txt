    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Today I have issued an Executive order, a copy of which is attached, stating that the restoration of a democratically elected government in Panama has ended the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States previously posed by the policies and actions of the Noriega regime. The order therefore terminates the Panamanian emergency declared on April 8, 1988, while preserving enforcement and blocking authorities as authorized by law.
Sincerely,
George Bush
