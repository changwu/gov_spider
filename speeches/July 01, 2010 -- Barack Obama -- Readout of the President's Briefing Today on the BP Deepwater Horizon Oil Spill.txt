    President Obama and Vice-President Biden received a briefing today from Secretary Napolitano, Secretary Chu, Secretary Salazar, Administrator Jackson, Administrator Lubchenco, Carol Browner and other senior administration officials on the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Secretary Napolitano and National Incident Commander Allen provided a situational update and an overview of available resources responding to the crises including: more than 42,000 personnel protecting the shoreline and cleaning up vital coastlines; over 6,800 vessels responding on site; and approximately 2.7 million feet of containment boom and 5 million feet of sorbent boom deployed.
The administrationâ€™s science team provided an update on oil containment efforts and plans to increase the capacity to capture more oil and eventually kill the well. The briefing also covered hurricane projections and their potential impacts on the response, the ongoing efforts to ensure seafood safety and the use of dispersants. The briefing concluded with discussion of additional environmental impacts on wildlife, National Parks and other sensitive coastal shorelines and habitat.
