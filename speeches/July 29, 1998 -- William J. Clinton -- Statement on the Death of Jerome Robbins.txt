    Hillary and I are deeply saddened to learn of the death of Jerome Robbins. Like so many Americans, our lives were enriched immeasurably by his artistic genius. Through his brilliant choreography, he brought the joy and passion of the human experience to millions, lifting American theater and dance to new heights. And in the treasury of timeless masterpieces he leaves behind—from "Fancy Free" and "On the Town" to "West Side Story" and "Fiddler on the Roof "—his creative spirit will live forever.
