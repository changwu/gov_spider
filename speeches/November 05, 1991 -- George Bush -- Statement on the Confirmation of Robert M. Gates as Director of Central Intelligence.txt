    Today's vote is a confirmation that Bob Gates has the professional expertise and experience to lead our intelligence community during these changing times. I look forward to Bob undertaking his duties quickly as Director of Central Intelligence and guiding our intelligence community during this historic era. He is a true professional of great integrity who will bring a wealth of experience and dedication to a most challenging task.
