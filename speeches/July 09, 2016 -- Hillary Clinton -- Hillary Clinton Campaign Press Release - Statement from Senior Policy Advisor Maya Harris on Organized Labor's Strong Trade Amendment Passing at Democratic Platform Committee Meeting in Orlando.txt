    "Hillary Clinton's position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership is well-established and well-known: she opposes TPP, before or after the election. Â Hillary Clinton has made clear that she is not interested in tinkering around the margins with TPP and believes we need a new approach to trade that protects American jobs, raises incomes for American workers, and strengthens our national security.
"We are proud to stand with our friends in organized labor in passing a strong amendment to the Democratic Platform on all trade deals, including the TPP, introduced by AFSCME's Lee Saunders, which was backed full-throatedly by unions and other delegates in the room. With the amendment, the platform lays out a clear, high test for judging trade agreements, including whether they raise wages, create good-paying jobs, and enhance our national security. She believes that the TPP fails the test that is now laid out in the platform as a result of this amendment."
