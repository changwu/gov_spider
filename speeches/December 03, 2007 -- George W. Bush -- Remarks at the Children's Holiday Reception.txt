    Thank you all for coming. Welcome to the White House. I've got two jobs. One is to introduce you to my wife Laura, and two is to tell you how much we admire your moms and dads, how much we appreciate their service to our country.
I know it's hard when you have a loved one, somebody you love a lot, not going to be around for the Christmas season. And one way we hope to help you through the moment is to invite you here to the White House for what's going to be a pretty special moment.
So I want to say thank you. When you talk to your mom or dad or e-mail your mom or dad, you make sure you tell them that President and Mrs. Bush are sure proud of their contributions to our country.
And so with that, I'm going to do my second job, which is to bring to the podium here my wife, First Lady Laura Bush.
