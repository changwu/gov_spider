President Obama's May 18 speech was definitive proof that the time has come to end the destructive and dishonest "peace process" until Hamas is decisively defeated and the Palestinian Authority is thoroughly reformed with all terrorist factions and activities purged.
George Orwell in "Politics and the English Language" warned that bad thinking leads to bad language.
President Obama's speech is a model of bad proposals based on false analysis driven by factual and moral confusion.
There is no moral equivalency between Israel and terrorist organizations Hamas and Fatah.
Israel is a democracy with the rule of law.
Hamas is an evil organization publicly dedicated to destroying Israel and preparing for terror against civilians (including a 3 month old baby deliberately slaughtered).
There can be no peace until Hamas is defeated.
The "peace process" must be replaced with a "victory process".
President Ronald Reagan warned against moral equivalency in his 1983 "Evil Empire" speech. He said, "beware the temptation of pride -- the temptation of blithely declaring yourselves above it all and label both sides equally at fault; to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire, to simply call the arms race a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong and good and evil."
Eight years later the Soviet Union disappeared.
If we develop similar clarity about democracy and terrorism, decency and evil, we can defeat Hamas in an even shorter time.
Then there can be a genuine peace process.
