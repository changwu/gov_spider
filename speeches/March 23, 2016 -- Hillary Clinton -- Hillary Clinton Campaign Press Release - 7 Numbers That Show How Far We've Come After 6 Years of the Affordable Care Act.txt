Today marks six years since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, and one thing is clear: It's working.
Here are seven numbers that show how far we've come toward putting quality, affordable health care within reach for every American.
20 million Americans newly insured under the Affordable Care Act
9.1
The percentage of Americans who are uninsured—the lowest rate in 50 years
140 million
Americans who are now guaranteed preventive care, like cancer screenings and vaccines, without paying out of pocket

87,000
Deaths prevented due to improvements in hospital quality
26
Age up to which young people can now stay covered on their parents' insurance plans
129 million
Americans who are no longer denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition
0
Number of women who are charged more for health insurance because of their gender
12.7 million
Americans insured through the Affordable Care Act exchanges
$0
Annual out-of-pocket cost of birth control with health insurance

These are more than just numbers.?
Because of the Affordable Care Act, Americans like Aqualyn can no longer be denied coverage because they've had a stroke or any other so-called pre-existing condition. People like Elena can get the prescriptions they desperately need without going bankrupt. And countless lives have been saved.

Hillary has spent her career fighting to make quality, affordable health care available for every American—and after 6 years of the Affordable Care Act, we're closer than ever to making that a reality. As president, she'll build on the successes of the law—and she'll keep fighting to bring costs down and put health care within reach for everyone.
