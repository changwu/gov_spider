    The United States condemns in the strongest terms the horrific attack today in Kabul, Afghanistan, which has left more than 80 dead and hundreds wounded. We offer our condolences to the families and loved ones of those killed, and a swift recovery to the wounded. This heinous attack was made all the more despicable by the fact that it targeted a peaceful demonstration. As we reaffirmed at the NATO Warsaw Summit earlier this month, the United States and the international community stand firm in our ongoing support for the people and Government of Afghanistan, and together with the Afghan people and government, we remain committed to work jointly with the Afghan security forces and countries in the region to confront the forces that threaten Afghanistan's security, stability, and prosperity.
