    I commend the Senate for confirming Deborah Cook to be a Judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. She has served with distinction as an Ohio Supreme Court justice and is known for her integrity and outstanding legal ability. She has led a distinguished legal career, and she will make a superb appellate court judge.
Justice Cook was first nominated on May 9, 2001, and has waited nearly 2 years for a vote. Some in the Senate continue to engage in obstructionist tactics and are preventing votes on two very qualified nominees who were also nominated on May 9, 2001, Miguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen.
Our justice system relies upon an independent court system, and when there are vacancies, the American people suffer. I again call on the Senate to put an end to the delays and to hold an up-or-down vote on all judicial nominees within a reasonable amount of time, regardless of who is President or which party controls the Senate.
