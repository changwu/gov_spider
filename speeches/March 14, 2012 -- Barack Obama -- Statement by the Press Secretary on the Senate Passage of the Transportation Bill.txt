    Maintaining a world class infrastructure system is critical to creating an economy built to last. Our country needs and deserves a commitment to surface transportation that will create jobs by rebuilding and modernizing our roads and bridges and allows us to compete and grow in the global economy.
We are pleased that Senators have continued the tradition of working across the aisle to pass a bill that keeps Americans at work maintaining our nation's vital infrastructure and provides states and localities the certainty they need to plan ahead. We are hopeful that the House will move swiftly and in similarly bipartisan fashion to do the same.
The Obama Administration will also continue to work with Congress to make additional investments to create jobs right now and to provide longer-term funding to support economic growth and competitiveness for generations to come.
