    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Bass (R) NH and 23 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 5254, the Refinery Permit Process Schedule Act. As part of his four-part plan to confront high gasoline prices, the President has called on Congress to simplify and speed up the permitting process for refinery construction and expansion. H.R. 5254 includes measures to simplify and expedite the refinery permitting process while maintaining strong environmental standards, although the Administration notes that the bill does not include codification of New Source Review rules that would enable accelerated investments in efficiency at refineries. The bill would also encourage refinery siting on former military sites. The Administration commends the House for proposing these steps to address the Nation's critical need for additional refining capacity to address the Nation's energy needs and looks forward to working with Congress as H.R. 5254 moves forward in the legislative process.
