    We are committed to working to enhance the long-term economic and environmental health of the region. That commitment means a responsible forest management plan and a responsible but determined effort to get timber moving back into the mills. We have offered an innovative, comprehensive, and balanced plan to solve a difficult set of problems. Now we are taking steps to implement that plan and get timber to the mills.
