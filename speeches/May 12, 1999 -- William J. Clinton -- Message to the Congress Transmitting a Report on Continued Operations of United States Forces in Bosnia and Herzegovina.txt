    To the Congress of the United States:
Section 1203 of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 1999, Public Law 105-261 (the Act), requires submission of a report to the Congress whenever the President submits a request for funds for continued operations of U.S. forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In connection with my Administration's request for funds for FY 2000, the attached report fulfills the requirements of section 1203 of the Act.
I want to emphasize again my continued commitment to close consultation with the Congress on political and military matters concerning Bosnia and Herzegovina. I look forward to continuing to work with the Congress in the months ahead as we work to establish a lasting peace in the Balkans.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, May 12, 1999.
