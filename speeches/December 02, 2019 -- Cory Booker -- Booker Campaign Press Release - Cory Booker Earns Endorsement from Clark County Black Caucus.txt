    Las Vegas, NV -- Today, the Clark County Black Caucus (CCBC) announced their endorsement of Cory Booker for president. In their announcement CCBC cited Cory's understanding of the struggles families face each day and highlighted that he's consistently been a voice for Black Americans on the debate stage, in his policy platform, and in the media. CCBC also noted that Cory has expressed a thorough knowledge of root causes and well-thought out plans to address the inequities in society.
"CCBC is proud to stand up for Senator Cory Booker in Nevada's upcoming Caucus, a public servant that has time and again stood up for us," said Yvette Williams, Caucus Chair.
"We are proud to receive the support of such a prominent advocacy organization in Nevada that has worked to advance issues that matter to Cory and our campaign," said Cory 2020 Nevada State Director Phil Kim. "From civil rights to economic justice, CCBC has been at the forefront of addressing issues that impact the state's African-American community. We look forward to working together and are honored to have them on our team."
The Clark County Black Caucus was formed during the historic election of the first African American president -- Barack Obama. The CCBC has worked over the last decade to advance issues that impact the African American Community to engage their members in the political process and work together to be a voice for change.
Cory met with members of the Clark County Black Caucus during his third visit to the state and participated in an event hosted by the CCBC and BSU students at Cheyenne High School.
