    Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell today made the following statement on the July employment report:
"As one economist recently noted, there hasn't been a single day in the Obama presidency when more Americans had a job than the day he took office. The recovery has yet to materialize for the 23 million Americans who are still struggling for work. The last three and a half years have been a string of broken promises and disappointing economic news thanks to President Obama's failed policies. Mitt Romney has a plan to help struggling middle-class families. I've studied his plan, and it is a package of measures that will end the current malaise and put the country on course to achieve strong economic growth and job creation."
