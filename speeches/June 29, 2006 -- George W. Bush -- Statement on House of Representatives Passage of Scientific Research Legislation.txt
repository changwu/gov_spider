    I commend the House for approving full funding of the basic research component of the American Competitiveness Initiative through the Science, State, Justice and Commerce appropriations bill. With this funding, the House has shown that it iscommitted to supporting the work of our Nation's most brilliant scientists as they study promising areas such as new energy technologies, supercomputing, and nanotechnology.
I appreciate the support of Chairman Lewis and the tireless and effective efforts of Chairman Wolf, and I commend the House leadership's work to move quickly on the centerpiece of our innovation agenda. I urge the Senate to join the House in passing this important legislation.
