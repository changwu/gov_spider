    As Hillary Clinton launches her "Big Challenges, Real Solutions Tour" across Iowa today, the Clinton Campaign announced a new television ad set to air in Iowa and New Hampshire that makes clear what's at stake in this election.
As Iowans prepare to caucus on January 3rd, America faces a war abroad and a troubled economy at home -- critical moments that demand a President who is tested and ready to lead on Day 1 and offers real solutions to the big challenges we face.
The 30-second spot is entitled "Stakes."
