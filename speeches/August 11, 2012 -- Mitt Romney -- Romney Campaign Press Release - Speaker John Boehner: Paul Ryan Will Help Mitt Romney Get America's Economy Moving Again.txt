    Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) today made the following statement on the selection of Congressman Paul Ryan as Mitt Romney's Vice Presidential running mate:
"Paul Ryan is a reformer and a proven leader who will be a great partner to Governor Romney in his efforts to get our country, and our economy, back on track.  At a time when millions of Americans are still looking at President Obama's policies and asking 'where are the jobs?' Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney will focus on common sense solutions to stop Washington from spending money it doesn't have and get the federal government out of the way of small business job creators. 
"I'm proud to call Paul Ryan a friend, and I will do everything in my power to make sure that he and Mitt Romney - along with our entire Republican ticket - are well positioned to win in November."
