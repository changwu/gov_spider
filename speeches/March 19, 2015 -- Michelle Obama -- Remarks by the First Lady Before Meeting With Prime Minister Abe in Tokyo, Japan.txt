    MRS. OBAMA: Prime Minister, first of all, your wife is an amazing woman. And the restaurant is good, so you have to try it. (Laughter.) Maybe the next time I come to visit, you can join us. (Laughter.)
But we had a very productive meeting today. And we are just so grateful for your support and investment in girls' education. We couldn't do this without the strong support that you've provided. And I'm very excited about the work that our countries will do together to spread the word.
