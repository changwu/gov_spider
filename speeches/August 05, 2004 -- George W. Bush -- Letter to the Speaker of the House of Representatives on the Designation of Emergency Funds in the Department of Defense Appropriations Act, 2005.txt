    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I hereby concur with the Congress in the designation of $25.856 billion provided as part of the Department of Defense Appropriations, FY 2005 (H.R. 4613), as an emergency requirement.
These funds are necessary to support Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, the Department of State's Mission in Iraq, State and local law enforcement assistance for security and related costs associated with the 2004 Presidential Candidate Nominating Conventions, the Judiciary, and to respond to the humanitarian crisis in the Darfur region of Sudan.
Additional information on this action is set forth in the attached letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
