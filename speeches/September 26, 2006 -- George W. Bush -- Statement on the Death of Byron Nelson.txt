    I was saddened to learn today of the passing of Byron Nelson. Byron Nelson was a legend in the game of golf, setting extraordinary standards for excellence on the course. More importantly, he was a true gentleman and role model for generations of golfers. Laura and I join fellow Texans and the sports world in extending our sympathies to his wife, Peggy, and his family and friends.
