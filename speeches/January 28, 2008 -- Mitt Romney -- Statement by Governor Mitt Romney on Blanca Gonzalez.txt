Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement on Blanca Gonzalez, the mother of a Cuban political prisoner, sitting in the First Lady's Box at tonight's State of the Union address:
"The President's invitation of Blanca Gonzalez to tonight's State of the Union Address is a great reminder to the world of the courage of Cuba's growing democratic movement as well as the unfinished business to which they and we are committed. Blanca Gonzalez, the mother of Cuban political prisoner Normando Hernandez Gonzalez, puts a human face on the continuing tragedy. We must keep the faith with these remarkable Cuban patriots by maintaining the pressure on the Castro brothers until the vestiges of their regime are wiped off that beautiful island and by helping the Cuban people reclaim their country and rebuild their future."
