    John Breaux is a distinguished public servant. His tenure in the Senate has been marked by bipartisan statesmanship, results for the people of Louisiana, and dedicated service for America.
During more than 30 years in the Congress, John Breaux has put party politics aside to get things done for the American people. His leadership in getting the 2001 tax cut passed helped spur economic growth and job creation, and his vision and tenacity on Medicare reform have now helped provide senior citizens with long-awaited prescription drug benefits and more choices in health care. He also has been a leader in the effort to pass comprehensive energy legislation, among many other legislative achievements.
It is with deep respect that Laura and I extend our gratitude and best wishes to John, his wife, Lois, and their children.
