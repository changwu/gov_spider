He spoke outside afterward to some of the 2,000 more who couldn't get inside the Cox Business Center hall.
In the unexpectedly tight contest, a recent Public Policy Polling survey had Hillary Clinton up by only 2 percentage points over Sanders. Both campaigns are on the television airwaves with ads and have sent experienced campaign staff to the state.
"You are going to have the opportunity to make history and to help lead this country in a political revolution. We can win here in Oklahoma and a victory here is the path to victory nationally," Sanders said at the high-decibel conclusion of a long speech on how to change the country's rigged economy propped up by a corrupt campaign finance system. 
Before the rally, Sanders made an impromptu stop at The Woody Guthrie Center, a museum dedicated to the life and legacy of the American folk musician and singer-songwriter.
"Woody Guthrie is one of the greatest musicians and songwriters in American history," Sanders said after touring the museum and archives. "His songs spoke to the reality of working-class people and it is incredible how much his music lives on in this country and throughout the world. In fact, on a number of occasions we have used his iconic song – This Land is Your Land – as part of our campaign. I was excited to visit this beautiful museum dedicated to a man who was raised in Oklahoma."
