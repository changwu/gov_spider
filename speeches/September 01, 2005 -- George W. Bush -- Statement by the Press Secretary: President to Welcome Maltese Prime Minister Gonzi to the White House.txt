    President Bush will welcome Maltese Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi for a meeting at the White House on October 3, 2005. Malta has been a valued partner in the fight against terror, helping to safeguard shipping in the Mediterranean Sea and promoting U.S.-EU political and economic cooperation. The President and Prime Minister Gonzi look forward to discussing how our nations can strengthen our bilateral counterterrorism cooperation, as well as how the United States and the European Union can work together to advance freedom and prosperity in the Broader Middle East and North Africa.
