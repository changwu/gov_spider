    To the Congress of the United States:
I am submitting an updated report to the Congress concerning the emigration laws and policies of Albania. The report indicates continued Albanian compliance with U.S. and international standards in the area of emigration. In fact, Albania has imposed no emigration restrictions, including exit visa requirements, on its population since 1991.
On December 5, 1997, I determined and reported to the Congress that Albania is not in violation of the freedom-of-emigration criteria in sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974. That action allowed for the continuation of normal trade relations status for Albania and certain other activities without the requirement of an annual waiver. This semiannual report is submitted as required by law pursuant to the determination of December 5, 1997.
