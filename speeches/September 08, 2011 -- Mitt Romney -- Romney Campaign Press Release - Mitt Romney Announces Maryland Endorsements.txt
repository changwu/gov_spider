    Mitt Romney today won the support from leaders in Maryland.
"It is an honor to have the support of so many in Maryland," said Mitt Romney. "They share my goals in this campaign to reverse President Obama's failed policies and get our economy moving again. I look forward to working with them as I bring this message to Maryland and the American people."
Announcing his support, State Senator Richard Colburn said, "Mitt Romney has a proven record of creating jobs and cutting spending. President Obama has failed on these points and it has hurt the American economy. Mitt Romney has the much-needed experience to lead our country toward an economic recovery."
