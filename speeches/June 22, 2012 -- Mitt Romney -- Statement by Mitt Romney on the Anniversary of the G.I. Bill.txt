    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the anniversary of the G.I. Bill:
"Sixty-eight years ago today, the G.I. Bill became law. It was an exemplary act that gave unparalleled opportunities to America's Greatest Generation, the millions of veterans who answered our country's call in the supreme emergency of World War II. Today, we have a new Greatest Generation that has answered our country's call in the aftermath of 9/11. They have stood for us through many hard trials, and we must stand by them. That obligation begins with restoring our economy to health. Those returning from the front lines should not be coming home to unemployment lines. As president, I will work from day one to turn around America's economy and create good jobs for veterans and for all Americans."
