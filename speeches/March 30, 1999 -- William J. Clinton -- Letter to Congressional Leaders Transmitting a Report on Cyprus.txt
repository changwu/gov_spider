    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question covering the period December 1, 1998, to January 31, 1999.
In an important step toward easing tensions on Cyprus, the Government of Cyprus announced on December 29 that the S-300 antiaircraft missiles that it had ordered from Russia would not be delivered to the island. This positive and welcome decision gave important new impetus to efforts to reduce tensions and promote a just and lasting settlement of the Cyprus dispute.
The United Nations remained active during the reporting period in the effort to resolve the Cyprus dispute. In addition to renewing the mandate for the U.N. Forces in Cyprus (UNFICYP), the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1218 that endorsed the Secretary General's September 30 initiative to reduce tensions and promote a just and lasting peace on Cyprus. In a December 23 statement, I wholeheartedly endorsed Resolution 1218 and directed that the United States take all necessary steps to support a sustained effort to implement it. As I said then and wish to emphasize now, the United States remains deeply committed to finding a viable solution to the Cyprus problem.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
