    LADSON, SOUTH CAROLINA â€” South Carolina Rep. Marvin Pendarvis announced his endorsement of Beto O'Rourke for President of the United States this morning at an event outside of Charleston -- one of the first major endorsements from the state in the Democratic primary race.
"I've watched Beto O'Rourke speak to Americans about our shared ambitions and the solutions to the greatest challenges of our lifetime, and witnessed the passion he ignites in voters in communities of all shapes and sizes across the country. I've gotten the opportunity to speak with him about his values and where he comes from. Beto's vision, his energy, and his connection with the American people are driving not only a campaign but a movement -- a movement that is people-powered, that includes all Americans and takes no one for granted, and that seeks to bring us together instead of driving us apart. I couldn't miss the opportunity to be a part of what promises to be a game-changing campaign for South Carolina and our nation, and I couldn't be more excited to endorse Beto O'Rourke for President of the United States."
An accomplished public servant, social justice advocate and civil rights attorney, Rep. Pendarvis is one of South Carolina's most exciting leaders, and also a bold and powerful voice for progress in the Palmetto State and across America.
