    Former Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's remarks to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce:Â 
"Our immigration system is broken, and for years, typical Washington politicians in both parties have played politics with this issue, instead of putting forth serious policies. There's no better example of Washington's leadership failures on this issue than President Obama himself. For three years, he has done nothing to confront this issue. Even with his own party in control of both chambers of Congress, he didn't even bother to bring a bill forward. Mitt Romney is someone who has a track record of getting things done. He's put forth a serious plan to strengthen our legal immigration system, bring immediate families together kept apart by government red tape, and reward those who serve our country honorably with legal residency."
