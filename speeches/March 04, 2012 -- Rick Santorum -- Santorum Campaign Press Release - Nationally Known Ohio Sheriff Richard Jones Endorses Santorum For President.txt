    Verona, PA - The Rick Santorum for President Campaign is proud to announce it has received the endorsement of Butler County, Ohio Sheriff Richard Jones.
Sheriff Jones said: "Our nation needs great leaders - and Rick Santorum is such a leader. Four years ago I swam against the current and campaigned against John McCain because of his liberal views on immigration, and this year I again refuse to campaign for a moderate. Rick Santorum is tough on immigration, has been a leader on securing the border, and fighting for traditional American values. I am proud to endorse Rick Santorum for President to return our nation to those values."
Sheriff Jones has earned a national reputation for being one of our nation's strongest law enforcement officers against illegal immigration. During Richard's tenure as Butler County Sheriff's Chief Deputy, he orchestrated putting more deputies on the streets to help the Sheriff's Office respond to calls for service faster. He's worked hard to help make more jail cells available to lock up more criminals and increase the productivity and efficiency of the office through computer automation.
