    On this important occasion of Labor Day, we take time out of our active schedules to honor the working men and women of America whose diligence and energy have made this country great.
These are the men and women whose sweat and toil built this nation from the ground up. They laid the railways, highways, and runways that brought this far-flung land together. They created an industrial machine that became and still remains the envy of the world. They answered the call in every time of need and forged the military might of a superpower. And, more recently, they have led the world into a new age of communications and services. Their labors have fed, clothed, and housed this nation in good times and in bad.
Despite labor's tremendous contribution to the growth and success of our country, those who worked hard and played by the rules were once frequently unrecognized and exploited. Yet the cause of labor has advanced greatly in this century because of the determined efforts of brave labor leaders who risked their own security to bring about fair working conditions and a decent standard of living for the rank and file men and women of this country. Labor Day gives us all an opportunity to recognize the pivotal role that working men and women have played in our history.
We are now at the dawn of a new era of prosperity. On this Labor Day, let us dedicate ourselves to the idea that hard work should be justly rewarded. We still have much to do. The challenges of remaining competitive in a global economy make it all the more imperative that we continue to embrace the ideas of innovation and industry. All of us have our own contribution to make to the success of America. We don't have a single person to waste. Recognizing this, we can celebrate this day by reflecting upon the dignity of labor and the pride felt in a job well done.
Best wishes for a wonderful holiday.
BILL CLINTON
