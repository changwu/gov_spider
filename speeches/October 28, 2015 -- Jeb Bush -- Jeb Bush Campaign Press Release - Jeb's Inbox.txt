    From the moment Jeb was sworn in as governor, he was determined to change the culture in Tallahassee. He knew that the best ideas didn't come from the state capital — they came from Floridians themselves. That's why he gave out his email address and spent 30 hours per week answering emails from constituents.
Through his email exchanges, Jeb demonstrated what hands-on, committed leadership can achieve. He never settled for a broken bureaucracy — he made government work for the people.
As Jeb says in the video, "People are just getting hammered by a heartless, cold government and bureaucrats that don't care about taking care of people. We changed the culture because I led from the top. If you've got a problem, I'm going to be on your side."
