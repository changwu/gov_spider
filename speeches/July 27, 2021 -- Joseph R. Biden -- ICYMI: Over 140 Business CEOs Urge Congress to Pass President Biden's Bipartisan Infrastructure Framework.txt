    Yesterday, over 140 CEOs representing businesses across the nation sent a letter urging members of Congress to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework. Signees include Microsoft Corp. President Brad Smith, Ford Motor Company CEO James D Farley Jr., and Lyft CEO John Zimmer.
The business leaders write: "We urge you to finalize and adopt this program to modernize and expand physical and digital assets that are a necessary foundation for our nation's sustainable growth."
They continue: "The framework that Congress and the Biden administration have worked diligently to craft reflects priorities shared by labor, business and state and local governments, as well as the American people. It will leverage significant private investment and generate a strong return for the federal government."
The letter follows endorsements from the nation's governors and mayors, leading business and labor organizations like the Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable, International Brothers of Electrical Works (IBEW) and the AFL-CIO, as well as large majorities of Republicans and Democratic voters.
