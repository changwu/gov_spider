MRS. OBAMA: Hi, Anthony! It's First Lady Michelle Obama. I'm here at NORAD, I'm helping them track Santa this evening. Are you staying up late trying to figure out where Santa is?
ANTHONY: No!
MRS. OBAMA: What are you doing?
ANTHONY: Just watching TV!
MRS. OBAMA: You're just watching TV? But it's Christmas Eve! Aren't you excited that Santa is going to be coming in the morning?
ANTHONY: Yeah, but I just -- I get to watch TV.
MRS. OBAMA: You get to watch TV? That's really cool. Do you get to watch TV a lot, or is this just special because it's Christmas Eve?
ANTHONY: A lot.
MRS. OBAMA: Yeah? Well, you know what I have? I have a special satellite system that can track where Santa is anywhere in the world. You want to know where Santa's reindeer are right now?
ANTHONY: Yeah.
MRS. OBAMA: They're flying over a country called Libya right now. Do you know where Libya is?
ANTHONY: No.
MRS. OBAMA: Libya is all the way on the other side of the world in a continent called Africa. So he's flying in Africa right now, and he's already delivered over 3 billion gifts. Can you imagine that?
ANTHONY: A lot.
MRS. OBAMA: Yeah, he's working really hard. And he's going to be headed to your house soon, Anthony. He's coming to your house. But you know what? You have to be in bed before Santa comes to deliver your gifts, okay?
ANTHONY: Okay.
MRS. OBAMA: All right. So you've got to go to bed and sleep tight so when you wake up in the morning Santa will have come and delivered your gifts, okay?
ANTHONY: Okay.
MRS. OBAMA: Well, Anthony, it's been -- hello?
ANTHONY: What time is it -- be in bed?
MRS. OBAMA: Well, you should go to bed as soon as your mom and dad tell you to go to bed. That's the perfect time. Okay? All right. Well you have a Merry Christmas, okay, Anthony?

MRS. OBAMA: Hi, Hunter. Hello, is Hunter there?
HUNTER'S DAD: Yeah, he's kind of being shy.
MRS. OBAMA: Okay. Well, Hunter, this is First Lady Michelle Obama. I'm helping NORAD track Santa. And I'm going to tell you where Santa is because I'm looking on the radar screen and I see Santa -- I see a little sleigh and eight tiny reindeer, and he is flying right now -- he's going faster than the speed of light. He's flying over a country called Libya, and he's delivered over 3 billion toys already. And it looks like he's headed towards your house soon. But, Hunter, you've got to be in bed before Santa will come and deliver the toys. So you've got to listen to your dad when he says go to bed so that Santa can get there in time and drop your toys off, okay?
HUNTER'S DAD: He said okay real quietly.

PEYTON: Wow!

It's a pretty cool system. So are you going to stay up late tonight, or are you going to get a good night's sleep so that you're fresh for Christmas?
PEYTON: I'm probably going to ask my mom if I can take a pill that will help me sleep, because otherwise I'm going to stay up all night.

NICK: I know.
