    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Tauzin (R) LA and 15 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2122, Project BioShield Act of 2003. This bill would implement a Presidential initiative to help spur the development and availability of next generation countermeasures against biological, chemical, nuclear, and radiological weapons. Specifically, H.R. 2122 would: (1) speed the Government's ability to turn promising scientific discoveries into necessary countermeasures by one-third or more; (2) authorize funding to purchase critical new countermeasures targeted against the most worrisome threats; and (3) allow the Food and Drug Administration to make promising treatments quickly available to Americans in emergency situations. Project BioShield is critical for strengthening our ability to protect Americans against biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear terrorist threats.
The Administration notes that provisions on submission of legislative proposals, and of reports on options considered and rejected, should reflect Constitutional principles regarding Executive-originated legislative proposals and protecting Executive deliberations.
