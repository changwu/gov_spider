    "Joe Biden's trip to Georgia next week proves that Democrats are taking the Senate runoff elections seriously and so should Republicans. Control of the U.S. Senate is at stake and it is imperative that Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler are returned to Washington to hold the line against radical, leftist attempts to raise taxes, impose the job-crushing Green New Deal, gut law enforcement, and grant amnesty to 11 million illegal aliens. Perdue and Loeffler have been strong allies for President Trump while their opponents represent everything liberal activists have been screaming about for four years. Jon Ossoff is a cookie-cutter leftist opportunist who spends his entire life shopping for political offices. Raphael Warnock is an unrepentant Marxist who is the most radical candidate for statewide office in Georgia history. While President Trump continues his legal battle challenging the election, it is still of the utmost importance for Republicans to retain control of the Senate. Every Georgian should either vote early for Perdue and Loeffler or turn out on January 5th."
