    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Stump (R) AZ and 29 cosponsors)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 1092, which contains miscellaneous provisions related to the Department of Veterans Affairs, but will work in the Senate to modify the bill's provisions relating to enhanced-use leases.
Scoring for Purposes of Pay-As-You-Go
H.R. 1092 would affect direct spending and receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is zero.
