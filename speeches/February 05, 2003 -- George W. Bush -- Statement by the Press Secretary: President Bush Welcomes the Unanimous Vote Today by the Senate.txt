    President Bush welcomes the unanimous vote today by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in favor of a resolution giving the Senate's advice and consent to the Moscow Treaty on Strategic Offensive Reductions. He commends Senators Lugar and Biden for their leadership in making action on the Moscow Treaty a top priority, and hopes the full Senate moves forward on the resolution at its earliest opportunity.
