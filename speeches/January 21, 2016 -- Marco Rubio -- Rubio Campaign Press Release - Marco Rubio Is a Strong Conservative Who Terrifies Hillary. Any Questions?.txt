He's a strong conservative and everyone knows he'll beat Hillary Clinton.

Here's what he had to say:
I am . . . the strongest conservative that gives us a chance to defeat Hillary Clinton, the best chance. This is what this has to be about. At the end of the day, we have our differences in the Republican Party. We have been talking about those in this primary cycle. But eventually we will all be together on the same team.
We cannot allow Hillary Clinton, or God forbid for that matter, Bernie Sanders to be President of the United States. The damage that Barack Obama has done to America is so extensive. If we get this election wrong, Sean, we may not be able to turn this thing around. It may be damaged, it may be permanent, and we cannot lose this election. I will beat Hillary Clinton. She does not want to run against me. You can see that in their press releases and in the way they act towards me. But I can't wait to run against her.
Of course, I want the voters to give me that chance, because we will beat Hillary Clinton and then we will reverse the damage that Barack Obama has done to this great country.
