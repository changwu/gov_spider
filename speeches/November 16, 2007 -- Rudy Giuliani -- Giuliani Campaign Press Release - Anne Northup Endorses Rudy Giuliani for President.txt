    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that former Kentucky Congresswoman Anne Northup has endorsed Mayor Giuliani for President. Northup will serve as Rudy's Kentucky State Chair.
"Rudy's experience as a leader proves that he is the only candidate truly committed to fiscally conservative principles," said Northup, who represented Kentucky's 3rd Congressional District from 1997 until 2007. "As President, he will also keep America on the offense in the Terrorists' War on Us, one of the greatest challenges we face. I am proud to support Rudy for President."
"Anne is a welcome addition to our team," said Michael DuHaime, Giuliani's National Campaign Manager. "We look forward to working with her to grow Rudy's support in the state and continue spreading the word about his commitment to lowering taxes, slashing wasteful Washington spending and keeping American families safe."
