    I AM pleased to be signing today H.J. Res. 92, a measure which emphasizes the need for a sound program of Federal statistics regarding the millions of Americans of Spanish origin or descent.
As stated in the preamble to this Joint Resolution, Spanish-origin Americans have made significant contributions to enrich American society and have served our Nation well in time of war and peace. To encourage and assist their full participation in all aspects of American life, it is important that we have adequate and accurate information about their economic and social conditions.
Such information, gathered through the major statistical programs of the Federal Government, can help provide the basis for action on the part of governments at all levels--Federal, State, and local. In addition, action by private organizations can better assist Americans of Spanish origin and descent in achieving a better life.
The major Federal statistical agencies already gather and publish much of the data required for determining the conditions and needs of this often disadvantaged group. And these agencies have made significant improvements in their efforts to help assure that such needed information is available.
I applaud these efforts and the increased impetus they will receive as a result of the enactment of H.J. Res. 92.
