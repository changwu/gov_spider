    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-384, I am submitting the following report on progress made during the past 60 days toward reaching a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus problem.
Following a summer recess, the intercommunal negotiations resumed discussion and analysis of the United Nations "evaluation" of the talks. In recent sessions, the negotiators completed initial discussion of those sections of the "evaluation" dealing with aspects of the possible executive, legislative, and judicial structure of a federal government. The negotiators have maintained a serious and positive attitude.
We commend the continued earnest efforts of the Secretary General and his Special Representative on Cyprus, Ambassador Hugo Gobbi, to narrow the differences between positions and to promote negotiating progress. We fully support the United Nations effort to reach a mutually acceptable agreement for the Cyprus problem and firmly believe that the intercommunal negotiations provide the most useful path towards that goal. On September 17 the negotiators announced a recess; negotiations are scheduled to resume on November 2.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
