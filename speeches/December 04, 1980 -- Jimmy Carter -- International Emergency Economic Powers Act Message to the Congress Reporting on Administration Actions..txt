    To the Congress of the United States:
On November 14, 1979, in Executive Order No. 12170 I declared a national emergency to deal with the threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States constituted by the situation in Iran. That declaration was made pursuant to the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and statutes of the United States, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.). I reported that declaration to the Congress on November 14, 1979, pursuant to Section 204(b) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (the Act).
On April 7, 1980, I issued Executive Order No. 12205, pursuant to the November 14, 1979, declaration of national emergency, which provided for certain trade, financial and other measures against Iran and its nationals. I reported that action to the Congress on April 7, 1980, pursuant to Section 204(b) of the Act.
On April 17, 1980, in Executive Order No. 12211 I declared a national emergency to deal with the threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States that was referred to in Executive Order No. 12170 and Executive Order No. 12205 and to deal with the added unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States created by subsequent events in Iran and neighboring countries, including the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. That declaration was made pursuant to the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and statutes of the United States, including the Act, and the National Emergencies Act. I reported that declaration to the Congress on April 17, 1980, pursuant to Section 204(b) of the Act.
Pursuant to Section 204(c) of the Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(c) ), I hereby report to the Congress with respect to action that I have taken since April 17, 1980, pursuant to Executive Orders Nos. 12170, 12205 and 12211 and with respect to such changes as have occurred concerning the information previously reported to the Congress.
1. Pursuant to the three Executive Orders, the Department of the Treasury, acting under my delegation of authority to the Secretary of the Treasury, has issued a series of regulations that prohibit imports of goods and services from Iran or of Iranian origin (other than for news dissemination), payments or transfers of funds or other property to any person in Iran (except for news-gathering activities and family remittances) and payments and transactions in support of travel to or travel and maintenance within Iran of U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent resident aliens.
2. As I directed in Executive Order No. 12211, prior licenses for transactions by persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States with Iran Air, the National Iranian Oil Company and the National Iranian Gas Company have been revoked with the effect that their offices in the United States have been closed down.
3. Pursuant to Executive Orders Nos. 12170 and 12211, the Department of the Treasury, acting under my delegation of authority to the Secretary of the Treasury, issued on July 2, 1980, a proposed rule which would require that certain types of blocked Iranian property be held in interest-bearing status. Comments have been received on the proposed rule, but a final rule has not yet been issued.
4. The Justice Department has filed Suggestions of Interest with all courts considering litigation involving the Government of Iran, its agencies and instrumentalities asking those courts to stay proceedings for ninety days in cases pending before them in light of the serious foreign policy consequences of further proceedings at this time. A number of courts have granted this request, including the only two Courts of Appeals to rule on the requested stay. Other courts have denied the request and are proceeding to consider the merits of the cases pending before them.
5. A census of blocked Iranian assets and claims against Iran and Iranian entities, which was provided for in regulations issued by the Department of the Treasury on April 9, 1980, has been undertaken.
6. On November 2, 1980, the Iranian Parliament adopted a resolution establishing its terms for the release of the hostages. Since that time various messages have been transmitted between the Government of Iran and the Government of the United States using the Government of Algeria as an intermediary.
7. On November 12, 1980, I transmitted to the Congress a Notice of the continuance after November 14, 1980, of the national emergency which I declared in Executive Order No. 12170.
8. The national emergencies which I declared in connection with the threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States arising from events in Iran during November 1979, and subsequent events in Iran and neighboring countries, including the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, continue to exist. Those threats and the rationale for taking steps under the Act continue to the present time. I shall continue to exercise the powers at my disposal to deal with those threats.
9. I am transmitting herewith regulations issued since April 17, 1980, pursuant to the three Executive Orders referred to above, together with the proposed rule requiring that certain types of blocked Iranian property be held in interest-bearing status.
