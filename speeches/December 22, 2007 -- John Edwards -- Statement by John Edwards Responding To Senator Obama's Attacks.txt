    Des Moines, Iowa – Today, Senator John Edwards released the following statement in response to attacks from Senator Obama:
"Senator Obama's attacks seem to increase as momentum for our campaign grows. The truth is I am the only candidate in this race who has never taken a dime of PAC or Washington lobbyist money – ever. And, it's why I support public financing of federal elections.
"As for outside groups, unfortunately, you can't control them, but let me make it clear – I think money has corrupted our politics and these groups should not be a part of the political process.
"Of course, if Senator Obama is serious about real change, I hope he and Senator Clinton will finally end their silence and join with me in calling on the Democratic Party to end the influence of Washington lobbyists by once and for all rejecting their money."
