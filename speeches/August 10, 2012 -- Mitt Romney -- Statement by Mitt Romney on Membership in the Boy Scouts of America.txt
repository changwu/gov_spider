    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on his views on membership in the Boy Scouts of America:
"The Boy Scouts of America is one of our country's greatest organizations, helping build strength of character in millions of young Americans. I believe in protecting the fundamental right of freedom of association, and that private organizations like the Scouts should remain free to organize themselves and set membership rules and requirements as they themselves think are in the best interest of their organization."
