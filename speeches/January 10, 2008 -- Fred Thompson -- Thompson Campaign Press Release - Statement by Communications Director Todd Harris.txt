    McLean, VA -Thompson for President Communications Director Todd Harris released the following statement on tonight's debate:
"There were two tiers of candidates in tonight's debate: Fred Thompson, and then everyone else. Fred came to win tonight and that is exactly what happened. No other candidate on that stage showed the same commitment to conservative values, grasp of foreign policy and national security, and the ability to talk straight and direct with the American people.
"Our campaign is 'all in' in the Palmetto State. Tonight's performance will go a long way to demonstrate that Fred Thompson is the only candidate the voters can trust to be a strong consistent conservative with the experience and judgment to lower taxes, keep the country safe, fight illegal immigration and secure our borders."
