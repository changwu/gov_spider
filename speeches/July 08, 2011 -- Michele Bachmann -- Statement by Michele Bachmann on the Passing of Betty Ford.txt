    Des Moines, Iowa â€” Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann issued the following statement in response to the passing of Betty Ford:
"Throughout her long career, Betty Ford charmed Americans with her wit and candor. On the public stage, at a challenging time in our history, she was not afraid to speak her mind, and her example inspired many women to follow a career in public service.
"Her openness about her breast cancer revolutionized our attitude to that cruel disease, and her example saved the lives of countless women. Her strong devotion to care for the sick and promote genuine recovery from addiction is a model of the best in America. On behalf of my entire family, I would like to extend my sincere condolences to the Ford family on this sad occasion. May God give them comfort at this time as we all remember the many accomplishments of Betty Ford."
