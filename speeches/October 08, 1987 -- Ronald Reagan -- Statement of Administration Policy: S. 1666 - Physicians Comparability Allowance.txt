    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Dole (R) Kansas)
The administration supports enactment of S. 1666, which includes provisions recommended by the administration that would extend and improve the Federal government's civilian physicians pay comparability allowance. The administration will, however, seek early repeal of an objectionable and unnecessary requirement in the bill to pay annual bonuses to non-physician psychologists in the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps even though there are no recruitment or retention problems regarding such individuals.
