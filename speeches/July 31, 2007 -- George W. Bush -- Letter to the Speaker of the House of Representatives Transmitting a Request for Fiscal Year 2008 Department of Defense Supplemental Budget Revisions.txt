    Dear Madam Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed revisions to the FY 2008 Budget request for Department of Defense operations in the Global War on Terror. This request would provide the additional resources necessary to maximize the production of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles and rapidly field this capability to our servicemembers in Iraq and Afghanistan. Overall, the discretionary budget authority in my FY 2008 request for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom would be increased by $5.3 billion, for a Department of Defense total of $147.0 billion for these operations.
I hereby designate the specific proposals in the amounts requested herein as emergency requirements. This request represents urgent and essential requirements and I encourage you to take up the FY 2008 war funding, including this critical force protection funding, as soon as possible. The details of the request are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
