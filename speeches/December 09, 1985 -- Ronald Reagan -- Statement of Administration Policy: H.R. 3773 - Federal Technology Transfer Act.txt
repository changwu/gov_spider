    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revision)(House)(Fuqua (D) Florida and 13 others)
The Administration supports the concept underlying the Federal Technology Transfer Act. However, the Administration strongly believes that H.R. 3773 should be removed from the suspension calendar to permit amendments that would:
(1) delete section 3 establishing a Federal Laboratory Consortium to facilitate the transfer of Federal technology to the private sector, to be funded by a 0.005% "set-aside" from government laboratory research and development funds; and
(2) revise section 6 to require that the royalty income—to be utilized by agencies' government-operated laboratories—be subject to such amounts and to such extent as provided in appropriations acts. (Section 6 provides that a percentage of royalties received from licensing of inventions be retained by an agency and transferred to the agency's government-operated laboratories.)
