    Today, during the National Air Traffic Controllers Association's convention in San Diego, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement:
"I would like to congratulate Paul Rinaldi and everyone with the National Air Traffic Controllers Association for a successful convention in San Diego. I am honored to have earned the endorsement of this proud organization's 19,000 members.
"Every day, hard-working and highly-skilled air traffic controllers keep our country moving, growing, and thriving. Almost 900 million passengers travel by air in the United States each year, and NATCA's members ensure we get to our destination safely—helping us take business trips, meet our families, and explore the country and the world. And through it all, this organization has fought for good benefits and wages for all workers and helped build our country's middle-class.
"As President, I will stand with NATCA and organized labor like I have my entire career. My top priority will be building an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. We will make the biggest investment in American infrastructure since the end of World War II—including in the National Airspace System. We will defend the right to organize and bargain collectively and fight against right-to-work legislation that is wrong for workers and wrong for America. And we will help workers retire with the dignity and security they have earned.
"If I am elected, American workers will always have a seat at the table and a champion in the White House—because when unions are strong, families are strong, and America is strong."
