    I am today announcing a program which will improve our efforts to reduce workrelated injuries and illnesses in the Federal workforce. In this Administration, great strides have been made by the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration in attempting to provide a safer and healthier workplace in the private sector. We must make equal improvements in our programs for the Federal worker.
In keeping with my dedication to improve the efficiency of government, I am committed to both a reduction in injuries and illnesses and a reduction in accompanying costs. Today, I am making it the responsibility of all Federal managers, supervisors and employees to take an active part in this program to improve the record of the Federal government in the area of occupational safety and health.
In so doing, I have directed the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Federal Advisory Council on Occupational Safety and Health, to develop additional strategies to stimulate joint problem-solving activities throughout the government. I am also authorizing a system of Presidential awards to be presented annually to those agencies showing the greatest commitment and results in improving the safety and health conditions for their workers.
The Federal government's most valuable resource is its dedicated and highly skilled workforce. Today, we embark on a program for Federal employees that will bring down injury and illness rates and thereby reduce human suffering.
