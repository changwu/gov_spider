    Secretary Stahr, General Trapnell, General Conway, General Decker:
I want to express my appreciation to the officers and men of the 82d Airborne for this opportunity to see a group of Americans who do in peacetime what other men do in war, and that is, live hazardously in defense of their country.
I saw this Division first in July of 1945, secondly when it marched up Fifth Avenue later that year for the Victory Parade. And now I come here on this occasion, when this Division with its long and illustrious history of combat leadership in World War I and World War II is performing a most vital function.
The United States of America has obligations and alliances which stretch around the world. Millions of people look to us. In many of those countries there are few Americans and no American soldiers, but out beyond the sight of land there are the ships of the United States Navy.
Here at Fort Bragg there is this Division and our other STRAC Divisions, and in Omaha, Nebraska, and other cities there are the wings of our Air strength.
It is all of this that makes it possible for freedom to maintain its position. So I hope that those of you who serve here, during these days of a cold peace, will recognize that every day that you are on duty and in a position of preparedness, you are maintaining freedom all around the globe.
So on behalf of my fellow citizens of this country we express our pride in you, and our appreciation to you. This is a Division which is "All-American"--and as an American I am proud of it.
