    On this Labor Day, I proudly join my fellow citizens in saluting our Nation's working men and women.
As we celebrate the historic role of our nation's free labor movement, we are reminded that workers have contributed as much to America's social greatness as they have to our economic strength. Their dedication to humanitarian goals, conscientious craftsmanship and technical excellence have improved virtually every aspect of our livesâ€”from jobs and working conditions to education, national defense, housing, medical care and transportation. Because of the quality of the goods and services they produce, we enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the world.
Labor Day, 1985, finds the American wage earner better off than in many years, with inflation down, a vibrant economy creating many opportunities, and employment running at record levels. But we must not slacken in our efforts to resolve the continuing problems facing those whose skills have become obsolete and young people seeking entry level jobs. Labor and management must also work hand in hand to improve the position of American products in foreign markets. Increased exports means more jobs for American workers, more growth, more opportunity. Doing its part, this Administration is committed to keeping open foreign markets and removing obstacles to free trade.
These challenges require the best efforts of all of us because we all have a stake in the success of these efforts. By shaping a better future for our workers, we can and will assure continued progress and even greater opportunity for all Americans.
