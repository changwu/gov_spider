    HOUSTON, Texas — Presidential candidate Ted Cruz released the following statement in observance of New Year's Eve:
"On the eve of the new year, I want to thank millions of Americans for what we have together achieved in 2015. In less than a year's time, conservatives across this country have come together from all walks of life – tea party conservatives, libertarians, women and men concerned for our safety, young people, small business owners – and they have changed the course of the 2016 election.
"The Washington Cartel said we didn't have a prayer. Well, actually, that's where for many of us this began. We believe that 2016 isn't simply another election year. It's a chance to change the course of this nation: To once again have the courage to stand up to our enemies, to call them by their name, and to defeat ISIS. To restore every citizens' God-given liberties, especially their right to live in accordance with their faith. And to ignite jobs and growth so that families can once again have confidence that our children will have greater opportunities than we had.
"That's why hundreds of thousands of supporters and volunteers have risen up across this country. And I believe, that's why there is incredible optimism for 2016. It's the last year of the Obama Administration. And it's the year that I believe the people can and will take back our country and once again reignite the promise that has made this country the greatest nation in the history of the world.
"2016 will be our time!"
