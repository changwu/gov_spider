    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed requests for FY 2003 budget amendments for the Securities and Exchange Commission and for the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Housing and Urban Development. The discretionary budgetary resources proposed in my FY 2003 budget would not be increased by these requests.
This transmittal also contains FY 2003 budget amendments for the legislative branch. As a matter of comity, appropriations requests of the legislative branch are transmitted without change. These additional amendments would increase discretionary resources for the legislative branch by $17.7 million.
The details of these requests are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and observations.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
