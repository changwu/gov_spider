    Former Florida House Majority Leader Adam Hasner today made the following statement on the Obama administration's refusal to say whether Jerusalem is the capital of Israel:
"Israel is at greater risk today than at any time since the October War of 1973. It is disconcerting that at a moment like this, the White House is unwilling to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital city. This is not a moment for distancing ourselves from Israel. If that is President Obama's intention, he should make it plain to the American people and the world. We deserve to know what our policy is toward Israel and whether the United States recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's capital."
