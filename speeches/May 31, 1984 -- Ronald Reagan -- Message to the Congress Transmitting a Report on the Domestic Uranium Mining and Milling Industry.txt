    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in Section 23(a) of P.L. 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Authorization Act of 1983, the "Comprehensive Review on the Status of the Domestic Uranium Mining and Milling Industry" is provided to the Congress.
The report presents information on the current and projected status of the domestic uranium mining and milling industry including uranium requirements and inventories, domestic production, import penetration, domestic and foreign ore reserves, exploration expenditures, employment, and capital investment. In addition to presenting projections of industry behavior under current policy, the report provides projections under alternative policy scenarios in the event that foreign import restrictions were enacted by Congress. The anticipated effect of spent nuclear fuel reprocessing on the demand for uranium is also addressed.
