    "We pause today to honor all of the brave men and women who have honored us by wearing our nation's uniform. Through their service and sacrifice, our veterans defended our country, our freedom, and our values. We could never adequately repay the debt that is owed. But what we can do and must do is ensure that veterans receive the benefits they have earned through their service and continue strengthening the country they fought for and love."
