    Support Highlights Organizing Power of Women Behind Harris in Iowa
On the heels of the launch of "Iowa Women for Kamala" and ahead of the third Democratic debate, 100 "Blue Wave Women" from across Iowa announced their endorsement of Senator Kamala Harris. These "Blue Wave Women" are made up of women who became engaged in progressive politics in the wake of the 2016 election, helped power a record number of female lawmakers into office in Iowa in 2018, and have continued to use their activism to fight for a better future for them and their families. These women are now committed to electing Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States by collecting commit to caucus cards from their own networks, attending women-to-women phone banks, and talking to their family and friends about how Kamala Harris will defeat Donald Trump and unify Americans around solutions to our common challenges. Many of these women will serve as Women for Kamala Captains and precinct leaders for the Harris campaign on Caucus night.
These women represent a diverse array of backgrounds, but are united in their enthusiastic support of Harris. Many of them are inspired by her fierce questioning of Trump's nominees like Brett Kavanaugh and William Barr, recognizing she has what it takes to take on Donald Trump and inspire the coalition necessary to win in 2020.
"Kamala's vision for our country and proven ability to accomplish real change motivated me to switch from being a registered Independent for 21 years to committing to caucus for Kamala," said Jennifer Jean of Pleasant Hill. "Her intelligence, strength, compassion, and ability to speak truth and ask tough questions of the powerful make her the perfect role model for my teenagers. Her joy and galvanizing optimism is what motivates me to volunteer, knock on doors, and make phone calls to make sure we put this woman in the White House."
"Senator Harris' slogan says it all â€“ she is truly for the people," said Elizabeth Kutter of Cedar Rapids. "But just as important, I wake up confident that she'll win in 2020. I dream about Senator Harris taking down Donald Trump. But first things first, I'm spending my energy to help put her over the top at the Iowa caucuses in February."
"After 2016, I started hearing about Kamala Harris and the amazing job she does as California's Senator. I realized this is who I needed to be involved and motivated," said Sabrina Davis from Des Moines. "When Kamala started running I knew I had to support her so young girls who dream of becoming president can look to the White House and see that yes, it can be done and that yes, it's possible to be a powerful woman in charge."
Harris' campaign in Iowa continues to engage grassroots supporters in unique and innovative ways in every county and precinct across the state. By giving women the tools to organize their own communities, the Harris campaign is able to organize even further in the state. Last week, Kamala Captains hosted nearly 25 events across the state utilizing their own networks and engaging hundreds of new and existing supporters.
