    President Bush will welcome President Thabo Mbeki of the Republic of South Africa to the White House on December 8, 2006. The President and President Mbeki will discuss African regional issues, especially Darfur, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Zimbabwe. The two leaders will also review joint efforts to combat HIV/AIDS in South Africa, where U.S. Government-supported programs reach over 200,000 with anti-retroviral treatment and many more with HIV prevention and care. They will exchange views on United Nations issues in light of South Africa's recent election to a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for 2007-2008. President Bush looks forward to the opportunity to recognize South Africa's contributions to peace and stability on the African continent.
