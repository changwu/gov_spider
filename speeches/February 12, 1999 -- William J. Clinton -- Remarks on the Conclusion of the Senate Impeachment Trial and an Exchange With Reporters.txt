    The President. Now that the Senate has fulfilled its constitutional responsibility, bringing this process to a conclusion, I want to say again to the American people how profoundly sorry I am for what I said and did to trigger these events and the great burden they have imposed on the Congress and on the American people.
I also am humbled and very grateful for the support and the prayers I have received from millions of Americans over this past year.
Now I ask all Americans, and I hope all Americans—here in Washington and throughout our land—will rededicate ourselves to the work of serving our Nation and building our future together. This can be and this must be a time of reconciliation and renewal for America.
Thank you very much.
Q. In your heart, sir, can you forgive and forget?
The President. I believe any person who asks for forgiveness has to be prepared to give it.
