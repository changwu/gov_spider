    Thanks to the Republican voters of Georgia, we are another step closer to our goal of winning every primary and caucus. After the votes are counted in Maryland and Colorado, I'm confident our campaign will be seven-for-seven in this election season. We are well on our way to the nomination and look forward to taking the battle to the Democrats. Barbara and I deeply appreciate the support we received today for our message of jobs, family, and peace.
To those who have been with me in the past but did not vote for me today, I hear your concerns and understand your frustration with Washington. I am committed to regaining your support. To get the economy moving, I will continue pushing the Democratic majority in Congress to enact my growth initiatives by the March 20th deadline.
