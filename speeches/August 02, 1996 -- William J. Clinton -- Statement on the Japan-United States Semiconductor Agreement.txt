    I want to congratulate Ambassador Barshefsky and her entire negotiating team on the agreement reached today on semiconductors. Their tireless efforts to advance our Nation's economic interests around the world have reaped enormous benefits for America's businesses and workers.
This agreement achieves our goals of transparency and monitoring of the semiconductor market to assure market access for our companies. The semiconductor industry serves as an engine for growth and jobs and has regained its position as world leader in semiconductor production.
