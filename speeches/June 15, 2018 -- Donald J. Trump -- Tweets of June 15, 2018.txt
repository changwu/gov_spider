FBI Agent Peter Strzok who headed the Clinton & Russia investigations texted to his lover Lisa Page in the IG Report that 'we'll stop' candidate Trump from becoming President. Doesn't get any lower than that!Retweets: 23712Favorites: 91847

The IG Report is a total disaster for Comey his minions and sadly the FBI. Comey will now officially go down as the worst leader by far in the history of the FBI. I did a great service to the people in firing him. Good Instincts. Christopher Wray will bring it proudly back!Retweets: 19628Favorites: 85926

Thank you for all of the compliments on getting the World Cup to come to the U.S.A. Mexico and Canada. I worked hard on this along with a Great Team of talented people. We never fail and it will be a great World Cup! A special thanks to Bob Kraft for excellent advice.Retweets: 13446Favorites: 71995

U.S.A. Jobs numbers are the BEST in 44 years. If my opponent (the Democrats) had won the election they would have raised taxes substantially and increased regulations - the economy and jobs would have been a disaster!Retweets: 21635Favorites: 98957

Wow the highest rated (by far) morning show @foxandfriends is on the Front Lawn of the White House. Maybe I'll have to take an unannounced trip down to see them?Retweets: 14861Favorites: 88138

The Democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the Border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda. Any Immigration Bill MUST HAVE full funding for the Wall end Catch & Release Visa Lottery and Chain and go to Merit Based Immigration. Go for it! WIN!Retweets: 28609Favorites: 110650

Wow what a tough sentence for Paul Manafort who has represented Ronald Reagan Bob Dole and many other top political people and campaigns. Didn't know Manafort was the head of the Mob. What about Comey and Crooked Hillary and all of the others? Very unfair!Retweets: 25324Favorites: 97786

I've had to beat 17 very talented people including the Bush Dynasty then I had to beat the Clinton Dynasty and now I have to beat a phony Witch Hunt and all of the dishonest people covered in the IG Report...and never forget the Fake News Media. It never ends!Retweets: 37551Favorites: 154084

I have a great relationship with Angela Merkel of Germany but the Fake News Media only shows the bad photos (implying anger) of negotiating an agreement - where I am asking for things that no other American President would ask for! https://t.co/Ib97nN5HZtRetweets: 21846Favorites: 81808
