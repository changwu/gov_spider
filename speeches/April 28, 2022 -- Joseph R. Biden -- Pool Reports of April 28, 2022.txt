4/28 Pool Report #4
The signal in the Roosevelt Room was poor. Please excuse the delayed pool report.
The president finished speaking at about 11:33 p.m.
He took at least six questions from reporters on a range of topics, including the economy, Title 42, Ukrainian refugees, the war in Europe, and student debt. Several of his responses to the questions made news. I will transcribe if I see the Q&A session wasn't available online.
