The two leaders discussed the necessary elements of a truly sustainable peace, including meaningful justice for victims of the conflict, demobilization and reintegration of armed combatants, the extension of the rule of law and government services, and the education, jobs, and economic opportunities that will allow Colombia to realize its full potential as a prosperous and secure country. The Vice President and President Santos agreed that it will be important to work with the United States Congress to ensure continued bipartisan support for Colombia following the signing of the peace accords.
