LAKE JACKSON, Texas - 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul is in a statistical dead heat with President Obama, poised to unseat him in a hypothetical head-to-head contest, according to a new poll.
Paul in the poll garners 45 percent of the vote to Obama's 46 percent, within the +/- 3 percent margin of error. Paul's main competitor nationally, Mitt Romney, fares quite similarly against Obama earning 47 to 45 percent respectively, also within the margin of error. Paul's fellow GOP aspirants Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry, and Jon Huntsman all suffer defeats by margins beyond or well beyond the poll's error margin.
Poll highlights include Paul handily besting Obama among independents by 47 to 40 percent, faring better among this key voter segment than presumed frontrunner Mitt Romney. In the case of all other GOP competitors, Obama wins the independent vote by percentage points at, within, or beyond the poll's margin of error.
"We've called this contest a two-man race between Ron Paul and Mitt Romney, and this poll is further proof of that. It also demonstrates Ron Paul's support among independents, an important voting segment within which our candidate is strong," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
The survey of 1,413 adults nationwide including 1,247 registered voters was conducted via telephone from January 4th to 8th.
