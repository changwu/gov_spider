    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Symms (R) Idaho)
The Administration supports enactment of the Interstate Cost Estimate and Interstate Substitution Cost Estimate to authorize the apportionment of interstate funds remaining for 1984 and all of 1985, 1986 and 1987. However, the Administration opposes enactment of interstate highway funding legislation that adds to the cost of the Interstate system, revises existing programs, creates new spending authorizations or earmarks funds. The Administration, therefore, strongly urges passage of S.J. Res. 44 or S. 279 in lieu of S. 391.
While the Administration strongly supports the committee's deficit reduction efforts — including the $500 million reduction in the 1986 obligation limitation (compared with 1985) and deletion of "demonstration" projects — we must take note that this reduction is more than offset in the 1986-1990 timeframe by spending provisions in S. 391 not subject to the obligation limitation.
