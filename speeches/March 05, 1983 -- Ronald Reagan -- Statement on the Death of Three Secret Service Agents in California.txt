    It was with profound sadness and sorrow that I learned of the tragic deaths of three special agents of the United States Secret Service who gave their lives today in the service of their country. Pat LaBarge, Don Bejcek, and Don Robinson were professionals in every sense of the wordâ€”men whose duty required the utmost in courage and dedication. Nancy and I extend our deepest sympathy to their wives, children, and families.
