    To the Congress of the United States:
I am today transmitting for your consideration the budget of the District of Columbia for fiscal year 1974, together with a supplementary budget request covering necessary additional expenses for fiscal year 1973.
These budget proposals reflect views expressed by citizens of the District of Columbia at City Council budget hearings and have been examined by the Mayor and the City Council in accordance with their responsibilities under Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967. The Office of Management and Budget has also reviewed these proposals as specified in the District of Columbia Revenue Act of 1970.
As a result of prudent and effective fiscal management on the part of the municipal government, this 1974 budget will provide adequately for District needs during the coming year without requiring either additional Federal funds or increased city revenue. The fiscal year 1974 proposals call for the expenditure of $841.2 million in operating funds and $150 million in capital funds.
Timely Congressional action last year on the District's 1973 budget was of great assistance to city officials in planning and executing sound programs to serve the people of Washington. I urge the Congress again to act expeditiously on the District budget for 1974.
RICHARD NIXONThe White House,April 2, 1973.
