    National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met yesterday with democratic opposition leader Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya of Belarus. Mr. Sullivan underscored the steadfast support of the United States for the Belarusian people's pursuit of a sovereign and democratic future, including free and fair elections as well as human rights protections. He affirmed that the United States, together with its allies and partners, will continue to hold the Lukashenka regime accountable for its actions. They discussed the recent measures taken by the United States in response to the regime's ongoing crackdown against the pro-democracy movement, flagrant human rights abuses, including the continued imprisonment of more than 1,400 political prisoners, and facilitation of Russia's war against Ukraine.
