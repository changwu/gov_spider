    I know that all Americans share my concern for the displaced families and residents of Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, and Illinois. Yesterday the Mississippi River engulfed homes and businesses. Even more flooding is predicted in the upcoming days.
Those who live and work along the upper Mississippi are not strangers to the threat of spring floods. Since the 1993 floods, many communities and residents have taken measures to protect themselves and their property. They are to be commended for this preventative work.
At my direction, FEMA Director Joe Allbaugh and his staff are working closely with State and local officials throughout the impacted and threatened areas to closely track the flooding and any further damage. As I travel to Canada for the Summit of the Americas, I will continue to monitor the situation.
