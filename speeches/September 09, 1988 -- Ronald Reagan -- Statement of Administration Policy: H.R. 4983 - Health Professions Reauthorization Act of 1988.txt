    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Waxman (D) CA and 2 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 4983 because it would continue the existing categorical approach for supporting health professions training contained in title VII of the Public Health Service Act at a time when a more flexible approach is needed, and because it would intrude on the ability of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to manage the affected programs.
The Administration believes the best method for accomplishing national objectives for health professions training is through a consolidated authority which would adapt to changing national requirements. The Administration urges the House to reconsider the Administration's legislative proposal for a flexible health professions authority.
In addition, the bill's prohibition against normal apportionment of the Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) Program credit authority, and its failure to include the Administration's proposals to keep HEAL self-sustaining, will lead shortly to the insolvency of the HEAL insurance fund.
Finally, the three-year authorization levels contained in H.R. 4983 are over $400 million in excess of the amounts contained in the President's FY 1989 Budget.
