    Memorandum for the Heads of Executives Departments and Agencies
Subject: Advisory Committee Review
Your recommendations for the continuation or termination of advisory committees, in response to my directive of February 25, 1977, have been received and are being reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.
I believe more can be done, and I have asked OMB staff to carefully review your recommendations. When that review is complete later in May, senior OMB staff will meet with your Departments and agencies for a critical zero-based analysis of committees you wish to continue. However, I urge you not to wait for those sessions to rethink the need for your committees. OMB would be happy to receive further recommendations for committee terminations during their review.

I am pleased that you have recommended the termination of all committees advising your Departments and agencies. You have made an important contribution to our effort to improve the organization and effectiveness of government. Efforts such as yours, and our continued attention to the establishment and continuation of committees, will make it a success.
