    It is a great pleasure to sign into law H.R. 2282, the Veterans' Disability Compensation and Survivors' Benefits Amendments of 1979. This bill increases by 9.9 percent the rates of compensation for service-disabled veterans and their survivors.
Benefits to disabled veterans and their survivors are a reflection of our deep gratitude to those men and women injured or killed in the service of their country. My administration has consistently supported periodic increases in benefits for them as the cost of living rises. In keeping with that policy I have recommended and the Congress has enacted increased compensation each year since I took office.
My budget last January proposed an increase in compensation benefits, effective this fiscal year. I am pleased that H.R. 2282 accomplishes this by substantially increasing benefits for about 2Â½ million service-disabled veterans and their survivors, retroactive to October 1, 1979.
