    Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's plan for education reform:
"Mitt Romney's education reform proposals will bring a much-needed overhaul to our country's schools and give every child a chance to succeed. He will fix our broken system by tying federal funds to success, expanding parental choice, and rewarding talented teachers. His record of achievement in Massachusetts stands as a testament to his ability to deliver. America's education system needs an overhaul and Mitt Romney has the plan to do just that.
