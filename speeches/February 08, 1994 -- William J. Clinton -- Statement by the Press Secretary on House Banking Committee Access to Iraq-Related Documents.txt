    President Clinton on February 4 restored the access of the House Banking Committee to classified material and ordered relevant Federal agencies to declassify certain Iraq-related documents requested by the committee.
In a letter to Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez, the President said, "I am very pleased to tell you that in view of your October 28 letter and your pledge to protect the confidentiality of classified information provided by the administration, we have decided, effective immediately, to restore fully your committee's access to classified information. This action will resolve an unfortunate and long-standing difficulty that has severely interfered in the committee's relations with the executive branch."
Accordingly, the President has directed relevant agencies of the Federal Government to provide the committee access to the classified information it has requested in connection with its investigation of BNL and pre-war policy toward Iraq. Consistent with past practice and policy, access will be subject to arrangements to protect intelligence sources and methods as well as ongoing law enforcement investigations.
The President also ordered relevant Federal agencies to declassify and disclose to the public Iraq-related documents requested by the committee concerning the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), Cardoen, Matrix-Churchill, Gerald Bull, and U.S. policy toward Iraq immediately preceding the Persian Gulf war. The President also indicated that agencies will review for declassification other specific documents identified by the committee as necessary to carry out the purposes of its investigation. The administration will declassify these documents to the maximum extent possible, excluding from public release only: (1) material that must remain classified; (2) material whose disclosure would compromise privacy rights; and (3) material that reveals executive branch deliberations.
