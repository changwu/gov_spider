    Tomorrow, Sunday, March 24, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand will deliver a campaign kick-off speech outside the Trump International Hotel. The speech puts an exclamation point on the end of a whirlwind week, in which Gillibrand officially launched her campaign with the video, "Brave Wins," participated in a MSNBC town hall in Michigan, returned to Iowa for the third time, and made her first visit to Nevada.
Senator Gillibrand's speech will touch on key moments in her life and career, and lay out her vision for an America where everyone has health care, work is rewarded with policies like paid family leave, our economy is booming with green jobs, families are safe from gun violence, the corrupting influence of money has been expunged from our politics, and more.
The event will also include a brief speaking program, featuring speakers and activists who display the fierce bravery that has inspired Senator Gillibrand's candidacy. Speakers will include a mother who founded an organization to combat gun violence, DREAMers fighting for immigration reform, young women standing up for women's rights and against sexual assault, champions for LGBTQ rights, and more.
When: Sunday, March 24th. Doors open for press at 10:30AM EST. Speaking program begins at 12:30PM EST and should conclude by 1:30PM EST.
Where: The intersection of 61st St. and Central Park West, just north of Columbus Circleâ€”directly across from Trump International Hotel. Press entrance will be from 61st St.
