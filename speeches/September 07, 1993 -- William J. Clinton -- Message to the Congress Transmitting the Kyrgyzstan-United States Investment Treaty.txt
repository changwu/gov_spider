    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view of receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Kyrgyz Republic Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, signed at Washington on January 19, 1993. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to this Treaty.
The Treaty will establish an agreed-upon legal basis for the protection and encouragement of investment. This Treaty thus forms an integral part of the framework for expanding trade and investment relations between the United States and the countries of the former Soviet Union. It is designed to encourage economic opportunity—for investment, trade, and growth—in both countries. It will assist Kyrgyzstan in its transition to a market economy by strengthening the role of the private sector and by encouraging appropriate macroeconomic and structural policies.
The Treaty is fully consistent with U.S. policy toward international and domestic investment. A specific tenet, reflected in this Treaty, is that U.S. investment abroad and foreign investment in the United States should receive fair, equitable, and nondiscriminatory treatment. Under this Treaty, the Parties also agree to international law standards for expropriation and compensation for expropriation, free transfers of funds associated with investments, freedom of investments from performance requirements, and the investor's freedom to choose to resolve disputes with the host government through international arbitration.
I recommend that the Senate consider this Treaty as soon as possible, and give its advice and consent to ratification of the Treaty at an early date.
