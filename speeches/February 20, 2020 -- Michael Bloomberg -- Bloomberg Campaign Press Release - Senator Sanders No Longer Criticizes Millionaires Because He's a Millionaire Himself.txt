    NEW YORK — Senator Bernie Sanders used to criticize the "millionaires and billionaires" — but now it's just billionaires because he is a millionaire himself. He profited off of his books and chose not to donate those profits to charity.
Sen. Sanders has three homes, including a four-bedroom, three-bath lakefront summer home. According to Forbes Magazine, he purchased the home in cash "less than two months after ending the 2016 campaign built on lambasting the rich."
Sen. Sanders' household wealth puts him in the top 5% of all Americans.
