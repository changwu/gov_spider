    Our administration is doing everything we can to respond to the continuing needs of individuals, families, businesses, and communities arising from the January earthquake. California's economic future depends in part on a strong recovery from the earthquake, and the loans and other assistance included in this package will help considerably. Our departments and agencies will continue to monitor events in California and take whatever actions are needed to meet Federal responsibilities there.
