    On behalf of the people of the United States, I congratulate the Government and people of Kuwait on the 50th anniversary of their independence on February 26. Kuwait is a longstanding friend and partner of the United States, and we thank His Highness the Amir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir al-Sabah for his steadfast partnership and friendship.
February 26 is also the 20th anniversary of Kuwait's liberation by U.S.-led coalition forces. On that day, the international community, having rejected outright aggression and acted to reverse it, stood shoulder to shoulder with Kuwait in securing its freedom and sovereignty. I take this opportunity to honor all those who made the ultimate sacrifice for the cause of freedom in that undertaking: Kuwaitis, Americans, and other coalition partners alike. I also wish to reinforce our enduring commitment to the peace and prosperity of the region.
