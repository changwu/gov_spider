    SANTA FE, NM-- The Richardson for President campaign today announced that Tom Reynolds, currently the campaign's Iowa communications director, will become national press secretary, serving as a lead spokesman and day-to-day contact for all national media.
"As Governor Richardson's poll numbers and the campaign's momentum continue to increase, the attention from the media in Washington, DC and across the nation has grown exponentially," communications director Pahl Shipley said. "Tom has done an exceptional job in raising Governor Richardson's profile in Iowa and we know he can continue to do the same at the national level."
Prior to joining the campaign in April, Reynolds most recently served as the press secretary for Sen. Tom Harkin (D-IA), Chairman of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee. Before that, Reynolds worked as the communications director for Rep. Jane Harman (D-CA), then-Ranking Member on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
"Tom is an experienced professional who will be a great addition to our national communications team," Governor Richardson said. "I am confident, with his campaign experience and his work on Capitol Hill, that Tom will continue to contribute as we move forward."
Shipley said the campaign is looking for a replacement for Reynolds in Iowa and the state will remain a focus of the campaign.
"Iowa is critically important to Governor Richardson," Shipley said. "Our numbers are on the rise, our support is strong and growing, and we plan to keep the momentum going."
