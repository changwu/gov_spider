Boston, MA- Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement on the release of a new tape from Osama bin Laden:
"Al Qaeda is on the run in Iraq. This latest tape from Osama bin Laden is further evidence that the surge is working. We need to maintain our resolve in wiping al Qaeda off the map wherever we may find their depraved fighters. America remains committed to the people of Iraq and to helping forces of moderation across the Islamic world combat violent, extreme jihadists. This week has been a stark reminder of the threats faced by the civilized world. But ultimately, America will prevail in this defining struggle of our generation."
