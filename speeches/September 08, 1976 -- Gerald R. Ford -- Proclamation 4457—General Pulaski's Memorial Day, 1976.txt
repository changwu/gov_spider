  A Proclamation

The success of the struggle for American independence was insured in large measure by the courage, selflessness and sacrifice of patriots dedicated to the principles of freedom and equality. Casimir Pulaski was such a patriot and, one hundred and ninety-seven years ago this October, his devotion to these principles and their realization cost him his life.
General Pulaski, in exile from his native land, came to America in 1777 to join the Revolutionary Army. He fought courageously at Brandywine and in other battles, and he commanded Pulaski's Legion which fought so valiantly and contributed greatly to the achievement of our independence.
In October, 1779, General Pulaski died of wounds received in the Battle of Savannah. In commemoration of his heroic sacrifice in the cause of American Independence, it is appropriate to pay grateful tribute to him and to the millions of Americans of Polish descent who have played such an important part in founding our country, fostering its growth, and preserving and perpetuating its ideals.
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Monday, October 11, 1976, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day.
I also invite the people of the United States to honor the memory of General Pulaski on that day with appropriate exercises and ceremonies in suitable places throughout our land.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and first.

GERALD R. FORD
