    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Fascell (D) Florida and 12 others)
The Administration opposes House passage of Title II of H.R. 1495, and urges that the bill not be considered under suspension of the rules. If H.R. 1495 were presented to the President in its current form, his senior advisers would recommend that the bill be vetoed.
The Administration recommends that HÂ»j|i 1495 be amended to delete Title II, which would change statutorl||r the existing structure and policy-making mechanisms for the jMpNBite Inspection Agency (OSIA). Title II would establish a ctfpfusing and inefficient chain of command for OSIA, create serious management problems, and diminish OSIA's effectiveness in carrying out its arms control inspection mission. The title is, moreover, unnecessary because existing arrangements are working well. H.R. 1495 would infringe on the President's authority to organize the Executive branch.
