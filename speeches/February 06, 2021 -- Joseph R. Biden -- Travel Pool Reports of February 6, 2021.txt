Travel pool report #4 — POTUS foot check-up 
New Castle, Del.
At 3:13 p.m., the motorcade arrived at Delaware Orthopaedic Specialists in Wilmington. POTUS stepped outside, wearing a greenish-brown sports coat, and entered through the clinic's front doors.
The White House sends along this statement —
Statement from Dr. Kevin O'Connor, Physician to the President:
The President will receive a regularly scheduled 10 week post-injury weight-bearing X-ray at the Delaware Orthopaedic Specialists, where he was evaluated initially. The President's symptoms have improved as expected, and he is adhering to a strict physical therapy regimen. As we explained initially, sprains of the foot can sometimes be a more significant injury than the bony fractures which accompany them. This x-ray is to check to assure that he has achieved good ligamentous stability.

Statement from Dr. Kevin O'Connor, Physician to the President:
The President received routine follow up x-rays today. Both small fractures of his foot are completely healed.

This injury has healed as expected, and he will return to his usual exercise regimen.
