    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Pursuant to subsection 402(c)(2)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the "Act") (19 U.S.C. 2432(c)(2)(A)), I have determined that a waiver of the application of subsections (a) and (b) of section 402 of the Act with respect to Romania will substantially promote the objectives of section 402. A copy of that determination is enclosed. I have also received assurances with respect to the emigration practices of Romania required by subsection 402(c)(2)(B) of the Act. This letter constitutes the report to the Congress required by subsection 402(c)(2).
Pursuant to subsection 402(c)(2), I shall issue an Executive order waiving the application of subsections (a) and (b) of section 402 of the Act with respect to Romania.
Sincerely,
George Bush
