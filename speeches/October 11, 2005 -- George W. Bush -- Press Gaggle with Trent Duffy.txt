MR. DUFFY: The President just finished meeting with the Jefferson Parish officials, which was very similar to the meeting he had yesterday with the Plaquemines Parish officials. There were about seven council members, Parish President Aaron Broussard, and as I said, Congressman Bill Jefferson, Congressman Bobby Jindal and Congressman Charlie Melancon.
As I said, this was largely based on yesterday's -- pardon me, let me back up -- very similar to yesterday's event. It was an open exchange with the Jefferson Parish officials about their vision for rebuilding Jefferson Parish. The President was very happy to listen to their ideas. They talked generally about how Jefferson Parish is going to be leading in the recovery effort, since it wasn't as damaged as some of the other parts of New Orleans. And the officials, I think, were excited about moving forward.
I think you heard from the President directly -- the quote about, out of this rubble hopefully something -- some good will come of this. He told that to the parish members, as well. I don't really have anything more. He doesn't have anything else on the rest of his schedule.
Q: Are there plans to come back down here anytime soon?
MR. DUFFY: We don't have anything to announce, but the President has said he is going to be a full partner, and that the work is just beginning. And nothing to announce at this point, but I think it's safe to say that the President will be making some more trips down here.
Anything else? It's a pretty light day. Thank you, enjoy your lunch.
