    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Reps. Bennett (D) Florida and 18 others)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1983 because:

— the natural and historical resources addressed by the bill have not been found to be nationally significant;
— non-Federal organizations are already providing adequate protection for several of these resources; and
— any additional conservation and protection of the resources addressed by the bill should be a matter of State or local action.
