Marco made a campaign stop in Minneapolis on Tuesday, and the crowd of more than 1,600, coming from all over, packed the venue from wall to wall.

And it wasn't just a big crowd — it was a pretty raucous one, too.

Here's Marco's whole speech:

It was punctuated with cheers, chants, and even some funny back and forth when he declared that if Democrats like Bernie Sanders want a socialist country, there are plenty of them they could move to — that America's supposed to be different.
Marco joked that, given the number of Minnesotans of Scandinavian descent, didn't want to wish Bernie Sanders upon Sweden or Norway . . . so maybe he could go after Luxembourg?
Alas:
Rubio riffing on what socialist state Sanders should be prez & asks if any1's from Luxembourg—and there appears to be someone here!

Here was the rousing end to Marco's speech:

Local conservative blogger John Hinderaker was on hand, and here's what he had to say:
The crowd at the rally skewed young and was diverse by Minnesota standards. Rubio was very sharp. He was relaxed and bantered easily with the crowd, which sometimes was borderline rowdy. . . I don't think there were many undecided voters at today's event, but any who were there had to be impressed.
Marco was off to Michigan fairly soon, but he stuck around for a bit to meet voters — anything for a Dolphins fan!

Thanks for signing our son Nathanael's Dolphins jersey today in Minneapolis, @marcorubio! @jenniska pic.twitter.com/P5n2g6FwzA

Another reason we know Minnesota is Marco Rubio country: He has the backing of some of the most important conservative leaders in the state, including Congressman John Kline, former governor Tim Pawlenty, and former senator Norm Coleman.
