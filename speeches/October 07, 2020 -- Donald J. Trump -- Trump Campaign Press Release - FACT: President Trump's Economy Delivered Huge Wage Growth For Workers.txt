    The Trump economy was delivering huge wage gains for workers before the Chinese coronavirus reached our shores.
President Trump built the greatest economy in history once and he's doing it again. The only thing that could stop the Great American Comeback is Joe Biden's disastrous economic agenda.
Before the artificial interruption to our economy, wages for typical workers were rising at their fastest rate in a decade:


According to the Wall Street Journal, wages for "rank-and-file" workers were growing at the fastest rate in a decade, outpacing those of their bosses.

Wages for the bottom quarter of workers were outpacing gains for high income workers. 

Wages for Black Americans were growing even faster. After years of stagnation, President Trump's economy finally accelerated wage growth for Black workers. 

In stark contrast to the President's economic success, Joe Biden completely botched the economy and led us to the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression with near stagnant wage growth.
