In town print pool report 2 - arrived at... 
?The motorcade has arrived at Trump National Golf Club, in Sterling, Virginia, around 10:11 am ET. As we drove up, your pooler saw a handful of protesters holding signs including one calling President Trump a “HUGE FAILURE” and another calling on him to “RESIGN.” Nearby, a woman walking her dog gave a prolonged thumbs-up to the motorcade.
?Your pooler has not seen the president yet this morning. We are holding at a nearby restaurant.
?Will update with further pertinent details as they come, and as per usual, try to figure out who POTUS is with here.?

In town print pool report 3 - headed back... 
At around 3:03 pm ET on Sunday, the motorcade departed the Trump golf club in Sterling, VA, en route back to the White House. Will update when arrived back there in DC.
As our vans waited for the president to head back to Washington, your pooler again saw a small group of sign-holding, anti-Trump protesters, joined by some pro-Trump supporters as well, still hanging out near the entrance to the golf club, some sitting and resting in the shade as they waited for the president to leave the neighborhood. Meanwhile, between around 1:30 pm ET til the motorcade left, a man sporting an American flag T-shirt driving a Jeep Wrangler, with both an American flag and a Trump banner fixed to the vehicle, was seen driving around in the area bordering the club, passing our vans well over 20 times by our tally.
We spotted an NRA bumper sticker and noticed the driver was riding around with a little, patriotic teddy bear in the back of the Jeep.
Alas, your pooler has not spotted President Donald Trump himself this afternoon so far, and no confirmation or sighting on this pooler‘s end as of yet on who was with POTUS.
