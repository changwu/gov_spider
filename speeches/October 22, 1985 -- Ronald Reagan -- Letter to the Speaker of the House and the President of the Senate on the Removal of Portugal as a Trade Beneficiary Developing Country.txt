    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am writing to inform you of my intent to remove Portugal from the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) Program, effective January 1, 1986.
This action is required by section 502(b) of Title V of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the Act), which states that no member state of the European Communities may be designated as eligible for GSP benefits. Portugal will become a member state of the European Communities on January 1, 1986.
This notice is being provided pursuant to section 502(a)(2) of the Act.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
