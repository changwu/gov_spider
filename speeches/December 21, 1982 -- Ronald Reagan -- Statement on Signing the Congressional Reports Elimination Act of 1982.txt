    I have today signed into law H.R. 6005, the "Congressional Reports Elimination Act of 1982." This act repeals or modifies requirements for the submission of 67 reports to the Congress that are no longer useful, duplicate other requirements for providing information, or involve costs and time to executive agencies that outweigh any benefits or utility to Congress. This is a useful and constructive step in reducing unnecessary paperwork and in improving executive branch operations.
