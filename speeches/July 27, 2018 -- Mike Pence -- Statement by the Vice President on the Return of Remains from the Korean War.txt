    Thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump, North Korea committed to return the remains of our American service members who fell in the Korean War. This agreement was deeply meaningful to so many families across America and demonstrated once again the President's unwavering commitment to the courageous men and women who have worn the uniform of the United States. President Trump asked that I travel to Hawaii on August 1 to participate in the Honorable Carry Ceremony and receive the remains as they return to American soil. As the son of a Korean War combat veteran, it is deeply humbling to be part of this historic moment. We will never forget the sacrifices these brave service members and their families made for our nation and our freedoms.
