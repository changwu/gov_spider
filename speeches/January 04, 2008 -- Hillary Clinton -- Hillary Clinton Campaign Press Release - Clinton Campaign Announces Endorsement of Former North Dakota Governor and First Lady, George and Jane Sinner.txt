    The Clinton campaign announced Friday that former North Dakota Governor George Sinner and his wife Jane have endorsed Hillary Clinton's Campaign for President.
"Hillary is the only candidate in this race who can walk into the White House on day one and begin making the critical changes we need to move this country forward," said Governor Sinner. "She is committed to building a strong organization in North Dakota to be successful in the February 5 caucus. Her message of experience and change, plus her commitment to issues that matter to North Dakotans, makes her uniquely qualified to tackle the challenges we face at home and abroad."
"Hillary's compassion and perspective on the issues that matter to our children and families is unprecedented," said former First Lady Jane Sinner. "I witnessed up-close her work with the Children's Defense Fund and how effective she was - first by recognizing a need and then having the leadership to make it happen. Hillary brings the change Washington needs and this country demands."
Sinner is the last Democratic Governor to serve North Dakota. He served with distinction for two terms, from 1985-1992.
The campaign is building a solid grassroots organization in North Dakota, and is continuing to build a strong volunteer base throughout the state. In the weeks ahead, the Clinton campaign will ramp up its presence in North Dakota and will campaign aggressively in this February 5 caucus state.
