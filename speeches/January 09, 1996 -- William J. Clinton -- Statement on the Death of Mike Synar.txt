    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn this morning of the death of former Oklahoma Congressman Mike Synar. Mike Synar was a brave and unflinching public servant who in tough political times remained true to his principles. He did not always do what was popular, but he always did what he thought was rightâ€” for Oklahoma and for America. Throughout his life, and especially during the past 6 months, Mike Synar was a true profile in courage.
Hillary and I will miss him. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends at this difficult time.
