Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to the families of the victims, and we honor the brave firefighters who are risking their lives to contain the fires."
"We must employ all federal resources to fight these fires, care for the displaced, and help communities rebuild from the ashes."
"In times like these, Americans stand firm, and we stand together. There have been incredible acts of bravery and generosity over the past four days, as Californians have pitched in to help their neighbors. I have asked my supporters in California to take time out from campaigning this weekend to assist the relief efforts, and I'm encouraging all Americans to take action to help those in need."
