    Newt recently participated in the Thanksgiving Family Forum in Des Moines, Iowa hosted by The Family Leader. He answered questions concerning loss of values, Faith vs. secularism, and his world view in terms of freedom, responsibility, and morality.
Other questions and answers include the role of the federal government as it pertains to achieving a common good, is there any moral justification for war, DOMA, abortion, adoption, and the judicial system. Newt also expresses his deeply held convictions regarding America, and how his experiences have helped shape the love he has for country.
Newt's thoughtful answers on these issues drew consistent applause and rave reviews from the crowd, just as they did in the previous three presidential forums in Iowa. To watch those forums, click on the links below:
