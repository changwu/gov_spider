    More than 200,000 New Donors Fuel National Super Tuesday Strategy
MANCHESTER, N.H. â€“ Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign on Thursday announced that it will ramp up staffing in Super Tuesday states and make an aggressive $5.5 million television and digital ad buy in 10 states, including an expansion of prior investments in Texas and California, following a $25 million January fundraising haul.
"Bernie's multiracial, multigenerational, people-driven movement for change is fueling 2020's most aggressive campaign for president," Sanders' campaign manager Faiz Shakir said. "Working class Americans giving $18 at a time are putting our campaign in a strong position to compete in states all over the map."
The Sanders campaign will immediately increase staffing in Super Tuesday states and invest more than $5.5 million in television and digital ads in eight new states, including Arkansas, Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah, and expand buys previously made in California and Texas.
The investment follows a January that was the campaign's single best fundraising month to date with over 1.3 million donations from more than 648,000 people. Over 219,000 new donors gave in January.
"Teacher" was the most common occupation of Sanders' January donors, the five most common employers were Amazon, Starbucks, Walmart, the United States Postal Service and Target, and the average donation was $18.72.
Since the campaign's February launch, Sanders has raised more than $121 million from over 6.4 million individual donations with an average contribution of $18. More than 99.9 percent of donors have not maxed out and can give again. To date, over 1.5 million people have donated to the campaign. The total does not include an additional $12.7 million in transfers all made in 2019 from Sanders' other federal accounts.
