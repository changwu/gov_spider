    Dear Mr. President: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
Enclosed are classified and unclassified copies of the report on Soviet Treaty Compliance required under condition 7 of the Resolution of Ratification for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START).
The judgments included in this report are drawn from reports prepared by the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and submitted to Congress under the provisions of PL 99-145, as amended, and Section 52 of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act.
Under the terms set forth in the Resolution of Ratification, this report addresses actions of the former Soviet Union which were violations or probable violations of the obligations of the SALT I Interim Agreement, SALT II, ABM, INF and START Treaties and the ultimate resolution of these issues. This report does not address the actions of the newly independent states which have succeeded the Soviet Union. In contrast to the Soviet Union, the newly independent states have demonstrated a substantially improved willingness to adhere to arms control obligations and to work with us to resolve problems.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
