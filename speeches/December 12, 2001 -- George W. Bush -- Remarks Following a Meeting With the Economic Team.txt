    Economic Stimulus Package
Thank you all for coming. I've just met with my top economic team to discuss the importance of an economic stimulus package to ourâ€”to the future of our economy. We strongly agree that we need an economic stimulus package, and I'm hopeful we'll be able to achieve one.
Last night I met with people from the United States Senate, Senators Breaux and Nelson and Miller, along with centrist Republicans. And we agree that there is enough votes to get a good package out of the Senate, a package that I think will help our economy, a package that these Democrats and Republicans think will help workers and the economy. And I am hopeful that with good work with the people around this table and with the leadership out of the Senate and the House, that we'll get a good package.
It's important to take care of those workers that have been affected by the attacks of September the 11th, and it's also important to focus on ways to grow our economy. And so this administration is committed to helping the Congress do its job, and that is to respond to the economic times we find ourselves in.
I want to thank you for coming. Happy holidays. Looking forward to seeing you at the event, the Christmas event at the White House. Oh, and see you at the next event. [Laughter]
