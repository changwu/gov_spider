    Earlier this week on MSNBC, California Congressman Raul Ruiz announced his endorsement of Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"It's very important that we look out for each other. Our constituents, the residents who live here are very anxious. They're anxious because there is no leadership from the White House with consistent messaging. They are contradicting the scientists and that needs to end," said Congressman Ruiz. "Look at the difference between President Trump's press conference and Vice President Biden's press conference and their plans and their demeanor and straightforwardness with the American people. That's why in fact I've decided to endorse Vice President Joe Biden for the Presidency."
Ruiz has served in Congress since 2013 and represents California's 36th Congressional District. He serves on the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Prior to his election, Ruiz was an emergency room physician.
Ruiz's endorsement builds on the wide support for Joe Biden in California, which includes prominent leaders like Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia, Los Angeles County Supervisor and former Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, Congressman Tony CÃ¡rdenas, Congressman Ami Bera, Congressman John Garamendi, Congressman Lou Correa, Congressman Jerry McNerney, Congressman Harley Rouda, Congresswoman Jackie Speier, Congressman Brad Sherman and numerous others.
Biden for President has previously announced more than 2,100 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
