    The President announced his intention today to nominate Dr. Mary Lowe Good, the senior vice president of Allied-Signal, Inc., to be Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology Administration.
"One of the central challenges that we face in the 1990's is making sure that our Nation's technological capacities are developed as fully as possible," said the President. "With a distinguished record of commercial research and of involvement with national technology policy, Dr. Good has what it takes to help ensure that Government does its part to make that happen."
