    A new poll by Public Policy Polling shows Newt in a statistical tie for third place amongst GOP voters, with 10% support.
"This poll is further evidence of the momentum we have been seeing since Newt's commanding performance at the GOP debate in Ames and subsequent debates," said Michael Krull, Campaign Director for Newt 2012.
"Newt Gingrich is the only candidate with a proven record of implementing national policies that have reformed government, balanced the budget and led to the creation of millions of new jobs. He has the knowledge, experience and firm understanding of conservative principles to get the job done."
"Voters are beginning to realize that fixing the jobs crisis caused by President Obama's policies of class warfare and bureaucratic socialism requires a veteran, not rookie," added Krull.
This is the second poll released this week which shows Newt Gingrich ahead of Congresswoman Bachmann.
