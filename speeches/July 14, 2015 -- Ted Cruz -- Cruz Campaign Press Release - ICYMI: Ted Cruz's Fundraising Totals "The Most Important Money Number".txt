HOUSTON, Texas — The Washington Post's Chris Cilliza writes that Ted Cruz's eye-popping fundraising haul from the second quarter is the most important money number in the Republican primary for president and it "should scare the hell out of any of the establishment candidates with designs on the party nomination."
Excerpts appear below:
"[I]t's Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's fundraising totals that stood out to me as the most important money number from the June reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.
"Cruz raised $14 million through his campaign committee and another $37 million through a constellation of super PACs set up to aid his campaign. That total of $51 million raised put him second behind Bush in total fundraising over the first six months of the year — ahead of the likes of Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Scott Walker.
"Cruz's ability to raise large amounts of money — through both a campaign account and super PACS — not only differentiates him from other ideological warrior candidates of the past but also gives him a real chance at breaking into the top tier of candidates as the race continues.
...
"Take Cruz's demonstrated fundraising ability over the first half of 2015 and couple it with his status as the most conservative candidate in the race and you have a potent mix that should scare the hell out of any of the establishment candidates with designs on the party nomination."
