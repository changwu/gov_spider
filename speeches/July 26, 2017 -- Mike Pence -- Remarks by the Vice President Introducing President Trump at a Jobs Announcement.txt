    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Governor Walker, Speaker Ryan, Senator Johnson, Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary Ross, Chairman Gou, members of Congress who join us today of the House and Senate, distinguished members of the state legislature in Wisconsin: On behalf of the First Family, welcome to the White House. (Applause.)
And thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump, welcome to a historic day for American jobs in the American heartland. (Applause.)
Since the very first day of this administration, President Trump has been busy rolling back federal red tape, unleashing American energy, working to lower taxes, rebuild our infrastructure, and give the American people the world-class healthcare they deserve. And job creators have responded to the President's agenda with optimism and action.
Businesses large and small have created more than 800,000 new jobs since President Trump took office. (Applause.) Company after company are announcing record investments -- billions of dollars and thousands of jobs.
And today's announcement here at the White House is just the latest vote of confidence in our President and his agenda, and our partners at the state level. And companies across this country and across the wider world are going to continue to invest in American jobs and American workers and America's future -- because under President Donald Trump, America is back. (Applause.)
So, ladies and gentlemen, with gratitude for his leadership and his determination to make America prosperous again, it is now my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce to you the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)
