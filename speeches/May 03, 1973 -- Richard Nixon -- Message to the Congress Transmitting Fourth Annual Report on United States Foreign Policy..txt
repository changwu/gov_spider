    To the Congress of the United States:
This Administration attaches fundamental importance to the articulation as well as the execution of foreign policy.
Public understanding is, of course, essential in a democracy. It is all the more urgent in a fast changing world, which requires continuing, though redefined, American leadership. One of my basic goals is to build a new consensus of support in the Congress and among the American people for a responsible foreign policy for the 1970's.
These were the reasons that I began the practice of annual Presidential Reports to the Congress. This fourth Review, like the previous ones, sets forth the philosophical framework of our policy and discusses major trends and events in this context. Two other important documents complement this one with the more detailed record of current questions and policies. The Secretary of State's third annual report of April 19, 1973, covers our specific country, regional, and functional policies and provides basic documentation. The Secretary of Defense's yearly report of April 3, 1973, presents a thorough accounting of our policies and programs for national defense.
It is my hope that this Report will inform and lift the national dialogue on our purposes and our place in the world.
