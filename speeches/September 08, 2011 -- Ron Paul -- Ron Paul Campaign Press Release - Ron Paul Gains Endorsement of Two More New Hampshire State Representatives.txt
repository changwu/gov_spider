    MANCHESTER, N.H. — New Hampshire State Representatives Mark Warden (Hillsborough, District 7) and Tammy Simmons (Hillsborough, District 17) today announced their endorsement of Congressman Ron Paul for the 2012 GOP nomination for president.
"Ron Paul speaks directly and clearly to the people about the issues, and never treats voters like they somehow can't understand the challenges facing this country," said Mark Warden. "Americans get it — we're experiencing it. And we need a president with decades of consistency on sound money, limited government, free markets, and a strong national defense."
"Our debt and deficits are out of control. Prices continue to rise and the dollar continues to collapse," added Tammy Simmons. "We can make hard decisions or we can let things spiral further out of control. I ran for office to reduce the size and scope of government, cut spending, and restore liberties. I meant what I said, and I will no longer vote for people who say one thing and do another.
"Ron Paul is the only candidate who consistently does what he says and will continue to do so when elected."
Simmons and Warden join ten other state representative endorsing Ron Paul, including Jenn Coffey, Tim Comerford, Cameron DeJong, Laura Jones, Kyle Jones, George Lambert, Donna Mauro, Paul Mirski, Carol Vita, and Lucien Vita.
