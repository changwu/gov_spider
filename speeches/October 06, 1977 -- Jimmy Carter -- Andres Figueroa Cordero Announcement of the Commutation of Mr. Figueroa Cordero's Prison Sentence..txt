    The President today granted clemency to Andres Figueroa Cordero, convicted in 1954 along with three other Puerto Ricans in connection with the shooting and wounding of several Congressmen.
The President commuted his sentence to the time served.
Mr. Cordero has terminal cancer. The President commuted Mr. Cordero's sentence on humanitarian grounds because of his physical condition.
Mr. Cordero was convicted of assault and conspiracy to overthrow the Government and was serving a 25- to 75-year sentence. He would not have been eligible for parole until 1981.
The commutation order, which is not a pardon, was an act of clemency on the part of the President.
Mr. Cordero was expected to be released from the Federal Medical Center for Prisoners at Springfield, Mo., within 24 hours.
