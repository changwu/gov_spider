Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
In 1975, Federal Executive Boards again proved their ability to strengthen communication and facilitate coordination within the Federal community and with citizens in the 25 major metropolitan areas they serve. The attached Annual Report provides a sampling of some of the many activities undertaken by Federal Executive Boards. Primary areas of emphasis in 1975 were minority business enterprises, energy conservation, assistance for the elderly, productivity improvement, and personnel management.
During the Bicentennial Year of 1976, I am confident that Federal Executive Boards will play a major part in helping restore public confidence in the institution of government. The American people are demanding and properly deserve greater efficiency, responsiveness, and economy in government operations. Federal Executive Boards can assist in reducing the rigidity and complexity of government by promoting cooperation, sharing ideas, and pooling experience and resources.
Please reinforce among your senior officials in the field the need for their rededication of commitment to and support of Federal Executive Board activities. Top level involvement is important if Federal Executive Boards are to continue their role in fostering better communication and coordination. Moreover, active participation at all levels is essential if Federal Executive Boards are to assist in improving the effectiveness of the Federal Government in the field.
