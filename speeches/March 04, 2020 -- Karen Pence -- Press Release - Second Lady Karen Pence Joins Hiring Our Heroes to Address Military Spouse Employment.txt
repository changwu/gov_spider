    Today, Second Lady Karen Pence delivered remarks to military spouses and business and community leaders at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Hiring our Heroes event in Tampa, Florida. The event featured their release of "A Collective Effort: Workforce Development Solutions for the 21st Century Military Spouse" report, which includes one year's worth of extensive research on the ways to identify best practices, challenges, and solutions in workforce development for military spouses.
Currently, military spouses face a 24% unemployment rate and on average move every 2 to 3 years. Mrs. Pence recognizes these unique challenges and has worked with Hiring Our Heroes on finding new ways that states, businesses, and the federal government can work together to employ and retain military spouses.
"Employers who hire military spouses benefit from their tremendous talent and breadth of experience," said Second Lady Karen Pence. "I applaud the important work to identify employment solutions and the continued efforts to encourage military spouses to find work in their chosen field."
About Hiring Our HeroesThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation's initiative launched in March 2011 as a nationwide effort to connect veterans, service members, and military spouses with meaningful employment opportunities. Working with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's vast network of state and local chambers and strategic partners from the public, private, and non-profit sectors, our goal is to create a movement across America in hundreds of communities where veterans and military families return every day.
