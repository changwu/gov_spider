    Utah Congressman Jason Chaffetz today made the following statement on Newt Gingrich's comments about Mitt Romney's character:
"Newt Gingrich is so desperate to prop up his sinking campaign that his message has devolved into a character assassination of Mitt Romney. I know Mitt, and I have seen him as a husband of 42 years, father of 5, and grandfather to 16. As governor of Massachusetts and president of Salt Lake City Olympic games, he led successful turnarounds of both of those enterprises. Mitt Romney embodies the definition of public servant. He didn't take a dime in salary as governor â€” and donated his salary from the Olympics to charity. Newt's new attack on Mitt's character is a desperate attempt to save his campaign, and it's not going to work."
