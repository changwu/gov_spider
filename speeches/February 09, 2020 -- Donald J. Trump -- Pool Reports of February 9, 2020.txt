In-town pool report #4 - corrected quote and fuller quotes
Correcting this quote.
Trump did not say: "We argue a little bit, but we agree 90 percent of the time." He said this: "We argue a little bit but 90 percent of the time we get along."
Fuller quotes here:
"We argue a little bit but 90 percent of the time we get along. And I just say call the White House, call me anytime you have difficulty. Because we are all in this together. Our states are doing fantastically well. We have a tremendous sampling of our governors, great turnout tonight which we appreciate. Anything I can do to help you are going to let me know, you are going to call."
"Rather than sitting and making small talk all night, I thought I'd have the press leave. When they depart we'll start asking questions, making statements. If you have any suggestions, we'd love to hear them. If you have any questions, I'd love to answer them."
"That fact is you've all - I know you very well - It's not easy being governor," he said. "You just look at the way our country's doing. We've never done as well as we are doing right now."
