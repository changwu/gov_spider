    Congresswoman Julia Brownley from California is endorsing Senator Kamala Harris's presidential campaign. Brownley has represented California's 26th congressional district since 2013 and was recently named to the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. Before being elected to Congress, Brownley served in the State Assembly from 2006-2012 and was a member of the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District Board of Education for 12 years, including three terms as its president.
"I am proud to endorse Kamala Harris for President because she has the vision we need for America's future â€” bringing people together, lifting up diverse voices, and fighting for our shared values," said Congresswoman Brownley. "I worked with Kamala when I was in the California legislature and I know she has the tenacity, fearlessness, and experience to lead this country into a better future for all Americans. Her passion and track record as a champion for justice and an advocate for women and families is unparalleled. She's exactly the kind of effective and compassionate leader our country needs."
Brownley is fifth member of the California congressional delegation to endorse Harris's campaign joining Reps. Barbara Lee, Katie Hill, Nanette Barragan, and Ted Lieu. Her endorsement follows Governor Newsom, five statewide officials (Kounalakis, Padilla, Ma, Thurmond, Lara), labor and civil rights leader Dolores Huerta as well as 21 members of the California State Senate Democratic Caucus including Senate Pro Tem Toni Atkins.
