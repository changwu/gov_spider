TRANSCRIPT:
Narrator: Senator Tim Scott is a Christian conservative who believes that life is a gift from God. Scott has a 100% pro-life voting record, and he fought to put three new conservative justices on the Supreme Court sending Roe v. Wade to the ash heap of history.
As president Tim Scott will protect our most fundamental right, the right to life itself. Here's Tim Scott:
Tim Scott: As president, I will sign the most pro-life legislation that reaches my desk. Our immediate priority should be passing a national 15 week limit on abortion while we support Republican led states that do even more to protect life. 
The Biden liberals support abortion up until the moment of birth. I'm running for president to stop their radical agenda and create a culture of life in America.
I'm Tim Scott, candidate for president, and I approve this message because I will always fight for our pro-life values. 
Narrator: Paid for by Tim Scott for America.
