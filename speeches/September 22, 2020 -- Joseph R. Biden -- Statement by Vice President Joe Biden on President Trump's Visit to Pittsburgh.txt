    Four years ago, candidate Donald Trump promised the hardworking people of Pittsburgh he would bring jobs back to the region. But since then, President Trump has only brought Pittsburgh economic turmoil under his watch.
President Trump's failed leadership didn't bring jobs back. Instead, his tax breaks for the super wealthy, his reckless trade wars, and his refusal to act to stop COVID-19 from spreading — even when he knew how dangerous the virus was — has led to the worst jobs crisis in close to a century and 200,000 deaths. Pittsburgh now faces an unemployment rate of nearly 15% and has lost 3,000 manufacturing jobs since Trump took office. Yet President Trump still has no plan to get us out of this crisis.
The stakes of this election could not be higher. To pull ourselves out of President Trump's economic mess, we need a government with a plan to help communities like Pittsburgh who built this country recover and rebuild stronger. We need a leader in the White House who understands the dignity of work and will create good-paying jobs with health care and the option to join a union, so families aren't an accident or illness away from bankruptcy. As President, I will fight for working families, enact middle-class tax cuts so Pittsburgh families finally get a fair shot, and create the jobs Trump promised four years ago but decimated with his failed leadership.
