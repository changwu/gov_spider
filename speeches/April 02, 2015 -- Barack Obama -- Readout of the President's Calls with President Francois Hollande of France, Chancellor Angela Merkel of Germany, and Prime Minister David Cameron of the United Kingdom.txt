    The President spoke separately today with President Hollande of France, Chancellor Merkel of Germany, and Prime Minister Cameron of the United Kingdom to discuss the political framework reached between the P5+1, the EU, and Iran on a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) regarding Iran's nuclear program. The President thanked the leaders for each country's important role in negotiating this historic step. The leaders affirmed that while nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, the framework represents significant progress towards a lasting, comprehensive solution that cuts off all of Iran's pathways to a bomb and verifiably ensures the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program going forward.
