    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 8/4/92) and SENT to House 8/6/92(House Rules)(Oberstar (D) Minnesota and 12 others)
The Administration strongly opposes enactment of H.R. 5466 because it would:
— Mandate such diverse and detailed matters as computer reservations systems (CRS) contract expiration dates, liquidated damages clauses, and the conditions for upgrading computer hardware or software. Freezing such details in statute will create problems as circumstances change and different solutions become available.
— Establish an inflexible timetable for the resolution of all CRS complaints regardless of their complexity. This would limit the amount of time that can be devoted to particularly complicated cases. Meeting this timetable would also divert resources from other aviation enforcement proceedings, including consumer protection cases.
— Extend "on time" reporting requirements to the commuter airline industry, without benefit of meaningful hearings or justification. Most commuter airlines do not possess the sophisticated computer systems required to compile and report "on time" statistics.
— Unnecessarily interfere with the Department of Transportation's exercise of its rulemaking authority and the orderly development of regulations through notice and public comment.
