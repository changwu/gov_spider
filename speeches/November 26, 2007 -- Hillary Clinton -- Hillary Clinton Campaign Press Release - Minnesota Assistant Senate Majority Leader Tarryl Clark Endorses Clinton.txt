    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Minnesota Senate Assistant Majority Leader Tarryl Clark.
"America needs change, and Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to deliver it," Clark said. "She is ready to begin tackling our challenges at home and abroad on her first day in the White House."
Elected to the Minnesota Senate in 2005 and reelected in 2006, Clark quickly rose to the second-highest leadership position in the caucus. A bipartisan problem solver, Clark has worked across the aisle to pass legislation to help seniors stay in their homes, to help reintegrate our returning veterans, and to make sure our youngest children are ready for kindergarten.
Clark is a longtime community activist and former executive director of the Minnesota Community Action Partnership and former Associate Chair of the Democratic Farmer-Labor Party. She has also been active in the Children's Defense Fund-MN and the Legal Services Advocacy Project. As a Commissioner of the St. Cloud Housing and Redevelopment Authority, Clark pushed to expand affordable housing and the creation of good paying jobs.
"I'm honored to have Tarryl's support and delighted that she'll help lead our efforts in Minnesota," Clinton said.
