    Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.
I would like to say to the American people that no nation in the history of humankind has been more deeply blessed than have we. We've got a lot to be thankful for. The original settlers of this country, more than 300 years ago, began to express our thanks to God every year for the blessing that came on them. This year, we have just before Thanksgiving a good omen in the Middle East which might bring to humankind one of the greatest blessings of all, and that's peace. And all of us want to remember in our prayers the hopes that we harbor for a peaceful settlement of those differences there and those around the world.
Thanksgiving is historically a family affair. I've just returned from Stevens School and had Thanksgiving dinner prepared by my daughter and the fifth and sixth graders of the public school. It was a very good affair. But I think it's time now for us to look outward as a nation, recognizing that we are leaders, that we have extraordinary good fortune in the material things of life, and remember others, both our neighbors here at home and around the world who are not so fortunate as we.
As President, though, I would like to wish the American people a happy Thanksgiving and urge them to remember those who haven't been blessed so fortunately as we have in our own lives. Also, to the press, I want to say that I'm thankful that I don't have to answer questions now on matters of great moment, except that Thanksgiving is a matter of great moment.
Thank you very much.
