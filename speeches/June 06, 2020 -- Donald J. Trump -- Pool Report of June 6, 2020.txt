Pool report #1: travel/photo lid 
A travel/photo lid was declared at 11:05 am on this hot muggy Saturday morning.
Apologies for the delay. Your pooler was in transit ahead of a noon call time for the pool, and obeying restrictions on using a cell phone while driving for a change, just to see if he likes it.
Have a safe weekend.
