    I reluctantly am signing H.R. 6663, a bill delaying the effective date of amendments to rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
I sign this bill with reluctance because the United States Marshals Service needs prompt relief from the burden of serving process for private parties in civil actions, relief these amendments would provide. I understand, however, that time demands affecting Congress this year simply have not allowed it to complete timely review of these amendments. I am confident that Congress will promptly review these rule 4 amendments, as well as amendments to 28 U.S.C. ยง 569(b) and 1921 proposed by this administration, thereby providing a comprehensive solution to the problems associated with service of private process by the U.S. Marshals Service.
