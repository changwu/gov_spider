So now the Democrats are working to gain control of the U.S. Senate through their actions on John James, David Perdue, and more. Would End the Filibuster, Life, 2A, and would Pack and Rotate the Court. Presidency becomes even more important. We will win!Retweets: 67855Favorites: 341299

I easily WIN the Presidency of the United States with LEGAL VOTES CAST. The OBSERVERS were not allowed, in any way, shape, or form, to do their job and therefore, votes accepted during this period must be determined to be ILLEGAL VOTES. U.S. Supreme Court should decide!Retweets: 0Favorites: 0

This is what we know. We have to go back to the state level and how this morass came to be in the first instance. The Governor, Wolf, and the State Supreme Court, flagrantly violated the Constitution of the U.S. The power to set these rules and regulations is vested in theRetweets: 59998Favorites: 266157

....Legislature. They just ignored that, ignored the Constitution. Now we bring it down to the counting houses, and outrageously, observers, who are the sentinels of integrity & transparency, were excluded. Pennsylvania has conducted itself in a horrible lawless way, and....Retweets: 18399Favorites: 73340

....hopefully this will be corrected at the Supreme Court of the United States. Also, these late ballots past Election Day are illegal, exactly what the President has been saying. The Supreme Court, in extraordinary circumstances,...Retweets: 32919Favorites: 176771

Joe Biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the President. I could make that claim also. Legal proceedings are just now beginning!Retweets: 116319Favorites: 677422
