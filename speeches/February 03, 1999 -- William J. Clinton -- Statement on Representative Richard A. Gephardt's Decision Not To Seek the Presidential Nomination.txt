    Democratic Leader Gephardt and I had a good meeting this morning. He and I discussed his decision, and I feel he made the choice for the right reasons. I am pleased he will continue to focus on an agenda that will strengthen our Nation for the 21st century: saving Social Security and Medicare, strengthening public education, maintaining a strong economy, passing a Patients' Bill of Rights.
Dick has been a key ally for the past 6 years, and I know he will continue to be for the next 2. His leadership has been central to so many of the successes the Nation has enjoyed these past 6 years: from the 1993 economic plan to family and medical leave to expanding health care coverage and raising the minimum wage.
Finally, on a personal level, Hillary and I value Dick and Jane's friendship and look forward to Dick's continued leadership.
