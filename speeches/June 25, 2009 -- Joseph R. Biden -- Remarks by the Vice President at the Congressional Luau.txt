    THE VICE PRESIDENT: Welcome to the White House. It's my great honor to introduce the folks behind me here. But I just was telling the President on the way over, I like the state he represented -- but I love the state he's from. (Laughter.) Mr. President, I'm glad you brought Hawaii to the White House.
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama. (Applause.)
