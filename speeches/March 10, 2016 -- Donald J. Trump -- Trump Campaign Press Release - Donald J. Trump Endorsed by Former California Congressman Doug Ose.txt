Our country is declining. If something doesn't change, then my children and future generations of Americans will inherit a mere shadow of what the United States once was. Donald Trump offers the only vision of how to change the path we are on. He has shown a remarkable ability to get things done in the face of seemingly impossible obstructions. No one else in this race has negotiated more successfully than he has in advancing towards a stated goal. He has the wherewithal to go the distance while ignoring the legions of bandit lobbyists in Washington DC and their robber baron bosses from Wall Street. He is unbowed by political correctness and unafraid of the Clinton Machine. He understands the geopolitical peril we face and will rebuild America's reputation and military. He knows the deep debt we owe our veterans. He understands the enormous responsibility of leading America. He understands that he is the President of the whole country. He understands that the decisions he makes will directly affect every American for generations to come. He has learned how to make crucial decisions in a career spanning decades, decisions where if you're wrong then you're out of business, compared to giving eloquent speeches from the safety of the Senate floor. I am proud to endorse his candidacy and to be a volunteer in his campaign, and I look forward to his election as the next President of the United States.
