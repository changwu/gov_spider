This morning, the Marco Rubio for President campaign announced the county leaders in Northeast Iowa helping Marco share his optimistic message with caucus-goers.
As Marco is competing in all of Iowa's 99 counties, today's announcement continues to build on months of momentum. Leaders in the Northeast part of the state are going to play an important role in Marco's success on caucus night.
"Marco Rubio grew up from humble means to achieve the American dream and his plan for the economy would allow more Iowans than ever before to do the same," said Kathleen Bean of Linn County. "His inspirational message is rallying Northeast Iowa to his candidacy, and I am excited to be part of this campaign to begin a new American Century."
"I'm proud to endorse Marco Rubio for president because we need a leader in the White House who understands the threats America faces around the globe," said Lowell Engle of Allamakee County. "Marco Rubio will not close Guantanamo; he will send terrorists on a one-way trip there. Marco will also tear up President Obama's disastrous Iran deal and ensure there are consequences for threatening the security of the United States."
"It is critical for Northeast Iowa Republicans to support a consistent advocate of agriculture like Marco Rubio," said Zach Boss of Buchanan County. "He knows Washington is broken and the old way of doing things does not work anymore. Marco will help Iowa thrive in the 21st century economy by stopping the EPA's overregulation of our farms and returning power to our citizens."
