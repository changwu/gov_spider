    Dear Mike:
Thank you for your letter of February 3, 1982. I accept your resignation as Administrator of the Small Business Administration with sincere regret, effective today.
Your service to the Nation in this capacity, especially your support of the Administration's economic program, has been greatly appreciated. I know that in the years ahead you will be able to look back with pride on your many accomplishments as an advocate of small business.
I wish you all future success and happiness, and I look forward to your continued participation in the Administration.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
[The Honorable Michael Cardenas, Administrator, U.S. Small Business Administration, Washington, D.C. 20416]
Dear Mr. President:
I regretfully submit my resignation as Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration.
Mr. President, I leave this position with the full realization that we have accomplished many of the objectives that we initially set out to achieve for the benefit of the small business community. Unfortunately, too little of our success in this regard reached public attention.
The Small Business Administration, under my leadership has been a strong advocate of your economic recovery program. I want to assure you of my continued support of these programs and your administration.
I remain, as always, a strong small business advocate.
Respectfully,
MICHAEL CARDENAS
[The President, The White House, Washington, D.C. 20500]
