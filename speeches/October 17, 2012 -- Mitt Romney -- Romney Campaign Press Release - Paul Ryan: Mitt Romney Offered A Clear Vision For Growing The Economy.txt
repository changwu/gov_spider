PAUL RYAN: "Well, he clearly changed his tactic. They said that he would change his tactic but his answers didn't change. He didn't offer any new idea about how the next four years would be any different than the last four years. The reason why I think Mitt Romney won this debate is because he gave the country a very clear choice and a very clear vision for about how we have a leader that will create jobs, grow the economy and get people back to work. Look, it's not going well right now for our economy. It's not going well right now for the middle class. Mitt Romney offered people a very concrete vision about how he's got the experience, the knowledge to get people back to work to grow the economy. That's why I think he won this debate."
