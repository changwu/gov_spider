    Urbandale, IA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following statement in reaction to the House of Representatives failure to pass a Balanced Budget Amendment to the U.S. Constitution:
"Today's vote in the House showed who is serious and who is not serious about getting our nation's fiscal house in order. Both parties can talk all they want about fiscal responsibility but passing a Balanced Budget Amendment that requires a supermajority for any tax increase and puts a cap on federal spending at 18% of GDP is the only way to permanently ensure that our government cannot grow beyond its means. A strong Balanced Budget Amendment is the true path to economic prosperity and without it, we simply can't trust the government to actively try and balance the federal budget.
Currently, government spending has exploded to nearly 25% of GDP and is well on its way to 40%. This is unacceptable and must be stopped.
A strong Balanced Budget Amendment focused on capping spending will empower the American family and build economic freedom - and I commit to using the bully pulpit of the Presidency to get bipartisan support for this commonsense measure - but this time, finish the job."
