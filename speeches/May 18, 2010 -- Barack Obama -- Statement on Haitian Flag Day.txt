    On behalf of the American people, I send my congratulations to all those who celebrate Haitian Flag Day here in America, in Haiti, and around the world. Over 200 years ago, freedmen from what is now the Republic of Haiti came to the aid of American patriots fighting for freedom at the Siege of Savannah. Then, in 1803, Haiti declared their independence, and this day celebrates the flying of that first Haitian flag. The bonds between our nations have been strong and vibrant since that day.
But as we observe this day of celebration, let us also remember the ongoing efforts in Haiti to rebuild and recover from that tragic earthquake. We stand with the international community in our support for the Government of Haiti and the Haitian people as they continue to create a foundation for a brighter future. On this Haitian Flag Day, the people of Haiti should remember that they have a friend and partner in America.
