    America is safer when our partners have access to the American-built systems they need to defend themselves and our shared interests, and when American industry competes on a level playing field. Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a National Security Presidential Memorandum approving a new Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) policy. He has also established a new Administration policy on the export of American-manufactured unmanned aerial systems (UAS).
The new CAT policy reflects the priorities set out in the President's National Security Strategy, and provides a framework under which all United States Government agencies will review and evaluate proposed arms transfers and approve commercial defense sales by American companies. The Trump Administration's new UAS export policy replaces an overly restrictive policy established in 2015 that hindered American companies from delivering a crucial military capability to our allies and partners. These updated policies reflect the President's commitment to peace through strength by building up our allies and partners, expanding opportunities for American industry, creating American jobs, and advancing the national security interests of the United States.
American industry produces the most sophisticated and effective defense systems in the world. Today's announcements are key first steps in a series of Government-wide initiatives to strengthen our allies, support the manufacturing and defense industrial base, and drive American job creation and innovation.
