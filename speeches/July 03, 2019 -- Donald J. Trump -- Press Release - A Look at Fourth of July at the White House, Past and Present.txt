As we commemorate the Declaration of Independence this Fourth of July, we remember all those who have upheld freedom over tyranny for our country.
On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence. President Thomas Jefferson held the first Fourth of July event at the White House in 1801, and modern Presidents have continued the tradition.
This year's festivities will honor America's armed forces with a first-of-its-kind celebration on the National Mall. The 2019 "Salute to America" will feature remarks from President Trump on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, a flight demonstrations by the Blue Angels, live music from our military bands, and the largest fireworks display ever seen in our Nation's capital.
