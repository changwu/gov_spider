    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Miller (D) California and 10 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2144. The bill would establish an Advisory Council on California Indian Policy to review the policies and programs affecting California Indians. This federally funded Council is unnecessary, unwarranted, and could create a precedent for similar councils in other States. In addition, the bill would restore Federal recognition to the United Auburn Indian Community of the Auburn Rancheria of California without ensuring that the tribe meets the appropriate criteria.
