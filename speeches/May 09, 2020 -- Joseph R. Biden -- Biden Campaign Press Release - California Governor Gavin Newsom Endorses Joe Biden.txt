    Yesterday, during a virtual event with Biden for President, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced his endorsement of Joe Biden for President of the United States.
"I'm so honored to be here with you and supporting your presidency. You get it, and you've gotten it done over the course of decades. You've been on the frontlines of fighting against poverty, ignorance, and disease. You have a deep compassion and empathy, you see the world from other people's eyes. You're willing to reach out to people â€” never talk down to people, regardless of their political stripes regardless, their lot in life," said Governor Gavin Newsom at an event with Vice President Biden. "That's about character. It's about decency. It's about honor. And you're ultimately about bringing people together and uniting this nation. We are desperate, in this moment in time, for that healing - for that leadership, that stewardship, that sense of hopefulness. I'm enlivened by your candidacy. I'm proud of your service as we all are. This is a unique moment in time and unique moment in our history, and we're uniquely grateful to you. I just couldn't be more proud of you, and the prospect of your presidency."
Governor Newsom's endorsement builds on the wide support for Joe Biden in California. Biden for President has previously announced more than 2,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
