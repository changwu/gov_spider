    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the Convention Between the United States of America and the Republic of South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital Gains, signed at Cape Town February 17, 1997. Also transmitted is the report of the Department of State concerning the Convention.
This Convention, which generally follows the U.S. model tax treaty, provides maximum rates of tax to be applied to various types of income and protection from double taxation of income. The Convention also provides for the exchange of information to prevent fiscal evasion and sets forth standard rules to limit the benefits of the Convention so that they are available only to residents that are not engaged in treaty shopping.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this Convention and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, June 26, 1997.
