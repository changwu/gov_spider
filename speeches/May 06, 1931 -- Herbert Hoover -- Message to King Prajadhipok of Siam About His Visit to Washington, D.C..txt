I HAVE received Your Majesty's message and am most gratified that you found your visit to Washington a pleasant one. It was a privilege and a pleasure to welcome Your Majesty and Her Majesty The Queen to Washington as our guests. In my own name, and on behalf of my fellow officials, I extend to Your Majesties our sincere best wishes and the assurance that your visit has forged more strongly the bonds of traditional friendship uniting Siam and the United States.
