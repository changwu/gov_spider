    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. de la Garza (D) Texas and 16 others)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2399. The bill is unnecessary and would complicate the conduct of the ongoing National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program by requiring a series of reports and the establishment of an interjurisdictional advisory committee.
