Today, the White House is announcing the finalization of the Implementation Plan associated with the National Strategy to Secure 5G. This Implementation Plan, approved by President Donald J. Trump, is the culmination of a robust interagency development process and serves as the framework for how the United States, in partnership with industry and our likeminded international partners, will lead the way in the development, deployment, and management of secure and reliable 5G telecommunications infrastructure.
5G wireless technology will be transformational with the potential to touch nearly every aspect of our lives and spur incredible economic growth. With this potential, the stakes for securing this new technology could not be higher. The National Strategy to Secure 5G Implementation Plan will help to provide the American people with secure, reliable, and trustworthy 5G infrastructure.
The work to enhance the security of 5G and beyond networks will require a range of efforts from across the United States Government, working in close collaboration with our international and industry partners. The United States Government is committed to fostering innovation and realizing the technological promise of 5G, while continuing to safeguard our economy and national security.
This Implementation Plan, driven by the National Strategy to Secure 5G, achieves this purpose through four lines of effort:

Facilitating domestic 5G rollout
Assessing the risks to and identifying core security principles of 5G infrastructure
Addressing risks to United States economic and national security during development and deployment of 5G infrastructure worldwide
Promoting responsible global development and deployment of 5G technology

This Strategy and Implementation Plan keep the Administration's promise to protect the national security, economy, and critical infrastructure of our Nation by ensuring we are well-postured to secure this critical technology.
