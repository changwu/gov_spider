"Under Newt's leadership with the Contract With America, he led a team that balanced the budget, paid off the national debt, and reformed our welfare system," said former Delaware House Speaker Terry Spence. "We desperately need Newt's knowledge, experience, and bold leadership skills to get America back on the right track. While other candidates have ignored Delaware, Newt has been campaigning here aggressively and I encourage my fellow Delawareans to vote for Newt Gingrich next Tuesday."
"Terry has had a long and distinguished career serving the people of Delaware and I'm honored to have his endorsement," said Newt Gingrich. "Terry understands that Republicans need to put forth a positive agenda in order to defeat President Obama and I look forward to working with him to rebuild the America we love."
Gingrich is campaigning in Delaware this week in advance of the state's April 24th primary.
