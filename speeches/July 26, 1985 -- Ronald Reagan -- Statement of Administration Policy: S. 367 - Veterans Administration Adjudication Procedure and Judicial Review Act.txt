    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Hart (D) Colorado and 25 others)
The Administration opposes Senate passage of S. 367 since it is neither necessary nor advisable. The present system of informal adjudication of claims for veteran benefits is working efficiently and fairly, and no widespread injustice has resulted from this system. In view of this record, the potential costs and burdens associated with judicial involvement in the day-to-day process of claim adjudication, as required by S. 367, are unjustified.
