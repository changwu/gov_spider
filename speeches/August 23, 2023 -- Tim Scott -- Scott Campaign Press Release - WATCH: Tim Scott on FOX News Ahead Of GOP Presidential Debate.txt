Tim ScottThe Story with Martha MacCallumAugust 22, 2023
Martha MacCallum: So what's your debate prep like? How, how have you been getting ready for tomorrow night?
Tim Scott: Mostly spending time studying, of course, but also in prayer, hanging out with family and just really enjoying how blessed it is to be an American. I'm so proud to be an American. I think back to the kid who's growing up in poverty and a single parent household, and now I'm running for President of the United States. Only possible in America. Yeah, absolutely. It's a great story.
Martha MacCallum: Well, when we look at the polling, I think we have the Iowa poll that we can pull up here. You are kind of the in third right now in this Des Moines Register poll. They've got you at nine, in third place at 9%. So you're kind of getting up into DeSantis territory there. Are you going to be sort of seeking to land some punches on him Tomorrow night?
Tim Scott: I'm gonna tell my story about why I believe that America can do for anyone what she's done for me. We're gonna focus on restoring hope, creating opportunities, and protecting the America that we all love.
