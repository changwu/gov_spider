    AUSTIN - The Perry campaign today released a 30-second television advertisement, "Lazy," which is airing over national cable and Iowa broadcast and cable.

"As President Obama continues to make excuses for our nation's economic struggles, apologizing for America and disparaging Americans by calling us lazy, soft and un-ambitious, Gov. Perry is offering solutions to reverse the damage inflicted by this out-of-touch administration," said Perry campaign communications director Ray Sullivan. "This ad underscores Gov. Perry's priority to overhaul Washington through common-sense measures including a balanced budget amendment and reducing Congressional salaries."
"Lazy" Script
Video of President Obama: "We've been a little bit lazy I think over the last couple of decades."
Rick Perry: "Can you believe that? That's what our President thinks is wrong with America? That Americans are lazy?"
"That's pathetic. It's time to clean house in Washington."
"It's time for a Balanced Budget Amendment that forces Washington to stop overspending."
"If Congress balks, cut their pay and send them home."
"Obama's socialist policies are bankrupting America. We must stop him now."
"I'm Rick Perry. I approve this message."
