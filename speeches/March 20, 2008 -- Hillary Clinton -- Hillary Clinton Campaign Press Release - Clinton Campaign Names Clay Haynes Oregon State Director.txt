    The Clinton Campaign today announced that Clay Haynes will serve as State Director, leading Hillary's efforts in Oregon.
Haynes has served as deputy national field director, overseeing the campaign's voter outreach strategies in critical battleground states across the country.
"We are going to run a grassroots campaign that reaches out to every corner of Oregon," Haynes said. "We're going to work hard for every vote."
Governor Ted Kulongoski welcomed the campaign to Oregon.
"Hillary Clinton is ready to lead this nation from her first day in office," said Governor Kulongoski. "I look forward to traveling with her across the state to speak directly to Oregonians about her plans to jumpstart our economy and rebuild the middle class."
Congresswoman Darlene Hooley called Hillary the best choice for Oregon.
"Hillary Clinton will be a powerful voice for all Oregonians in the White House," said Congresswoman Darlene Hooley. "She would move our nation toward a clean energy future that protects our environment and creates millions of new jobs in the process."
