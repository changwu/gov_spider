    FIFTY YEARS ago today, the International Joint Commission, a body provided for by the International Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909, held its first semiannual meeting. This institution, which was created with the objective of resolving amicably disputes and problems confronting the two nations with regard to the lakes and rivers common to both of them, has had a distinguished record. It has set a standard for later organizations created by Canada and the United States for the resolution of problems and for the development of common policies. The International Joint Commission worked on a very large number of problems and projects dealing with water resources. The Commission's studies and recommendations have served as a basis for important agreements which have brought great profit to both the United States and Canada.
These quiet but important efforts deserve recognition, as do the present Chairman of the United States Section of the International Joint Commission, the Honorable Teno Roncalio, and his Commissioners, and the distinguished Chairman of the Canadian Section, General Andrew G. L. McNaughton, and his colleagues. It is certainly the hope of everyone that the International Joint Commission will, in the next half century, continue its record of outstanding achievement.
