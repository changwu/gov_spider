    Helena, MT -- This week, Montana Governor Steve Bullock added his fifth qualifying poll for the DNC's second Democratic debate in Detroit. Today, his campaign also announced that in half a fundraising quarter, and without any transfers from other funds, he raised over $2 million.
"This week, Governor Steve Bullock added his fifth qualifying poll for the DNC's second Democratic debate. As the only candidate who has won and governed a Trump state, we could not be more excited that Governor Bullock's important voice will be on stage," said Bullock for President campaign manager Jenn Ridder. "Since announcing his campaign in mid-May, Governor Bullock received grassroots support from all 50 states and raised over $2 million, without the transfer of other funds. It's clear Governor Bullock's message of winning back places Democrats lost in 2016 and ending dark money's corrupting influence will resonate in early states like Iowa and New Hampshire, and he will continue working to earn every vote."
