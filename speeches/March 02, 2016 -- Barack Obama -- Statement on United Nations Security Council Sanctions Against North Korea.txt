    Today the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted UNSCR 2270, which imposes significant costs on the D.P.R.K. in response to its January 6 nuclear test and February 7 missile launch. This resolution levies strong new sanctions aimed at halting Pyongyang's efforts to advance its weapons of mass destruction programs. I have consistently said that the D.P.R.K. would face consequences for its actions, and I welcome this resolution as a firm, united, and appropriate response by the international community to the D.P.R.K.'s recent provocations that flagrantly violated multiple Security Council resolutions. Today the international community, speaking with one voice, has sent Pyongyang a simple message: North Korea must abandon these dangerous programs and choose a better path for its people.
