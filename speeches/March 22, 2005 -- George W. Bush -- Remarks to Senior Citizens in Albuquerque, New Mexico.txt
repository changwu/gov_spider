    The President. Listen, thank you all for letting the Senator and I come by. We're thrilled to be—I'm thrilled to be back in New Mexico. You know, it's right across the border from right where I was raised. But I'm here today to talk about Social Security. I know it's of concern to you; it's of concern to me as well.
My message to people that are getting their Social Security check is pretty simple, and it's this: The Government is going to keep its promise. You just don't have to worry about it. I know there are some conflicting messages out there, but it's just not the truth. The truth is you're going to get your checks. The question is whether or not your grandchildren are going to get their checks. [Laughter] And that's what the Senator and I are here to talk about today, because we want to make sure that not only is the safety net solid for you but that there's is a safety net for your children.
People oftentimes ask me, did Franklin Roosevelt do the right thing with Social Security? And my answer is, absolutely. My predecessor, Franklin Roosevelt, did the right thing in setting up the Social Security system. And now we've got to make sure the Social Security system works for generations. And that's why we're in town— that's why I'm in town; Pete is in town because he lives here. [Laughter]
But thanks for letting us come by. It's great to see you.
Audience member. It's great to see you.

The President. Good.
Senator Pete V. Domenici. We don't get to eat, Mr. President.
The President. No, that's right; we've got to go work. [Laughter]
Audience member. Can I shake your hand?
The President. Yes sir, you can. Thanks for letting us come by.
