    Dear Dennis:
It is with great regret that I accept your resignation as Associate Administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, effective October 28, 1983. During the many years we have known you, Nancy and I have come to regard you as almost a member of the family. We have relied on your expertise and your foresight to handle so many of the daily problems in communications and other areas that it is going to be very hard to imagine things flowing smoothly in your absence.
We want you to know, however, that we are delighted at the opportunity that has opened up for you in the private sector. You can be sure that Nancy and I send you our very best wishes for every future success and happiness, even as we remember with great pleasure the many years you have been with us.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
November 3, 1983
Mr. President:
This is to inform you that I have submitted my resignation to Secretary Baldrige. As you know, I resigned to accept a position with The Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve in your administration, and I will always treasure the memories of that service.
DENNIS LEBLANC
