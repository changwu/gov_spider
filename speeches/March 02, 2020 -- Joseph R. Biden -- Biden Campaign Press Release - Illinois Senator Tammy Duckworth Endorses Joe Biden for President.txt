    Duckworth Becomes 7th U.S. Senator to Support Biden
Today, Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth, a combat Veteran and former Assistant Veterans Administration Secretary, released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"Those of us who've served this nation in uniform understand just how important it is for the Commander in Chief to have not only the depth of experience needed to protect our country, but also the humility to recognize the magnitude of the sacrifices our troops make on their orders. As a combat Veteran and former Assistant VA Secretary, I know that Joe Biden won't just pay lip service to those sacrifices, he'll make sure our troops and Veterans receive the support, care and respect they've earned. Joe also has a proven record of not just promising to help the little guy and communities of color like Donald Trump, but Joe actually delivers for them — he's earned our trust. I'm supporting Joe Biden because he will unite our party and country, restore dignity to the White House and rebuild trust in our government with decency, optimism and experience."
Duckworth becomes the seventh U.S. Senator to endorse Biden — the most of any candidate in the race. She joins Senators Chris Coons and Thomas Carper of Delaware, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Doug Jones of Alabama, Dianne Feinstein of California and Tim Kaine of Virginia. She also joins federal leaders from Illinois supporting Biden, including Congressman Brad Schneider (IL-10), Congressman Danny Davis (IL-7), and former Senator and Ambassador Carol Moseley Braun.
Last week, Biden for President announced the support of 82 Illinois leaders from all 18 congressional districts. Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,400 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
