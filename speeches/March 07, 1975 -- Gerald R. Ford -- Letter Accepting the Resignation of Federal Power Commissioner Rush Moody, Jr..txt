    Dear Rush:
I have your letter of February 28, and it is with a special sense of regret that I accept your resignation as a Commissioner of the Federal Power Commission, effective March 15, 1975, as you requested.
You can be sure I understand the reasons which led to your decision and that I share your strong conviction in the urgent need to review and change our present natural gas policies. I will continue to support, in the strongest terms possible, Congressional action deregulating new natural gas. I recognize, as you do, that affirmative legislation on this matter is critical to our goal of energy independence.
While we will be sorry to lose your valued counsel, nevertheless, I welcome this opportunity to express my personal appreciation for the outstanding manner in which you have fulfilled your responsibilities on the Commission. Your service has been distinguished not only by your exceptional ability, but also by your genuine concern for our national well-being. Over the past three years, your efforts to assure a better, more secure life for all Americans have earned their gratitude and my own admiration.
Now, as you prepare to leave government, I want to thank you for your willingness to serve this Administration and our Nation. I am grateful for your cooperation and support and extend to you and to your family my warmest good wishes for every success and happiness in the future.
Sincerely,
JERRY FORD
[The Honorable Rush Moody, Jr., Commissioner, Federal Power Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426]
