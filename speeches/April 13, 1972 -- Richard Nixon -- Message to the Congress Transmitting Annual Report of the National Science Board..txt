    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to submit to the Congress this Fourth Annual Report of the National Science Board, "The Role of Engineers and Scientists in a National Policy for Technology." This Report has been prepared in accordance with Section 4 (g) of the National Science Foundation Act, as amended by Public Law 90-407.
Many of the key recommendations in this Report are in close accord with the initiatives I have set forth this year in my address on the State of the Union, my Budget Message, and my recent message to the Congress on science and technology.
The Report stresses that in the field of research and development, a vigorous partnership between private industry, the universities, and the Government can be an important asset for strengthening our economy and spurring new technological solutions to problems of the modern world. The Report also points out that intensive research is needed to refine our understanding of the complexities of contemporary life and to develop better ways of bringing our talents to bear on domestic concerns.
As I have indicated on several occasions, I have great hope that we can realize the full potential of American technology for serving our national purposes. The commitment of this Administration to continued progress toward that goal is clearly reflected in the array of programs which I have detailed in my latest Budget Message.
I am confident that the Congress will find this Report useful.
