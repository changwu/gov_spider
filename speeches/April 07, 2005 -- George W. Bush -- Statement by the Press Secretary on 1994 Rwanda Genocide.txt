    On this day eleven years ago the world witnessed the beginning of one of the most horrific episodes of the twentieth century, the 1994 Rwanda Genocide. A 100-day campaign waged by Hutu extremists tore Rwanda apart and resulted in the murder of at least 800,000 Tutsi men, women, and children, as well as many moderate Hutus.
We urge the international community to continue to work with Rwanda and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to bring to justice those responsible for the genocide. We also urge the international community to continue to assist the survivors of the genocide.
The United States joins Rwanda and the international community in this day of reflection.
