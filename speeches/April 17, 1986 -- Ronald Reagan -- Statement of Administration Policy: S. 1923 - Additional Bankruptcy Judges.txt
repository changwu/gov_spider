    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Thurmond (R) South Carolina and 7 others)
The Administration has no objection to the creation of additional United States bankruptcy judgeships but recommends that S. 1923 be amended to delete section 2, which would unnecessarily interfere with the managerial discretion and flexibility of the Department of Agriculture and the Small Business Administration. Beyond that, however, the Administration believes that S. 1923 should not be further amended. Any additional bankruptcy amendments should be considered separately and on their own individual merits.
