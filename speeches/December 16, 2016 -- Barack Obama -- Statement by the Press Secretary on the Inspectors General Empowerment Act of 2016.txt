    Inspectors General work on behalf of the American people to ensure that our government is open and accountable – and the President is grateful for their service. That's why he's pleased to sign the Inspectors General Empowerment Act of 2016, which will safeguard access to the information Inspectors General need to do their jobs. Because of changes made to address issues identified by the Administration and Members of Congress, H.R. 6450 now strikes an appropriate balance between affording Inspectors General the access they need and protecting Americans' privacy and civil liberties. Most importantly, this legislation continues – even after President Obama leaves office – the commitment to transparency in government that has been a hallmark of this Administration from day one.
