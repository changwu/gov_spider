LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul again drew thousands of supporters to a campaign rally, this time in Kansas City, Missouri.
The high turnout was notable because of the short notice given as Dr. Paul concluded his Pacific Northwest visit to Washington and Idaho, and made his way to Missouri's largest city. The 12-term Congressman from Texas' rally took place tonight at 7:30 p.m. CST in Union Station's Sprint Festival Plaza, located at 30 West Pershing Road, Kansas City, MO 64108.
