    Juntos Con Romney Steering Committee Co-Chair and Former Administrator of the Small Business Administration Hector Barreto and Florida State Senator Anitere Flores made the following statements on Vice President Biden's remarks at the National Council of La Raza Conference:
"Vice President Biden's address at NCLR comes on the heels of yet another disappointing jobs report which showed that the second quarter of this year was the worst quarter of job creation in two years," said Juntos Con Romney Steering Committee Co-Chair Hector Barreto.Â "We have now had 41 straight months of unemployment above 8%. For our Hispanic community, the situation is even more precarious, with the unemployment rate stuck at 11% and for our youth between the ages of 16 and 19 at a staggering 31%. Regrettably, President Obama's answer to our economic troubles is to set up the U.S. economy for one of the biggest tax increases in history in 2013. Increasing taxes on any American at this time is the wrong policy at the wrong time. Either the President does not recognize that or chooses to ignore it for political purposes."
Florida State Senator Anitere Flores said, "As a candidate for president, Barack Obama promised to present a plan to reform immigration in his first year in office, but once again President Obama has failed to live up to his campaign promises. Unfortunately, for the American people, we are still waiting for that plan. The fact remains that President Obama has failed to provide any leadership in pursuit of a long-term immigration solution, which represents yet another broken promise to the Latino voters who helped elect him. As president, Governor Romney will work with Republicans and Democrats to find a long-term solution. He will strengthen legal immigration and tackle the challenge of our broken immigration system in a civil and resolute manner."
