    Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:
A report made to me on the 5th of this month by the Secretary of War contains various matters in which the honor and safety of the nation are deeply interested. I transmit it, therefore, to Congress and recommend it to their serious consideration.
JOHN ADAMS.
