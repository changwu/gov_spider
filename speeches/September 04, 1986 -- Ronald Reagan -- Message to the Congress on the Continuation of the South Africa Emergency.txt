    To the Congress of the United States:
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the enclosed notice, stating that the South African emergency is to continue in effect beyond September 9, 1986, to the Federal Register for publication.
The failure of the South African Government to take adequate steps to eliminate apartheid, that Government's security practices, including the recent imposition of another state of emergency, and the persistence of widespread violence continue to endanger prospects for peaceful change in South Africa and threaten stability in the region as a whole. Under these circumstances, I have determined that it is necessary to continue in effect the national emergency with respect to South Africa after September 9, 1986, in order to deal with this unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy and economy of the United States. Additional measures to deal with this threat will be considered upon the completion of consultations with key Allies on joint, effective measures to eliminate apartheid and encourage negotiations for peaceful change in South Africa.
