    Today the President designated three foreign individuals and two foreign entities in the seventh annual set of determinations of drug traffickers who will be subject to the sanctions provided in the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act ("Kingpin Act"). This action brings the total number of individuals and entities designated under the Kingpin Act to 62 since the first designations were made in 2000.
This action underscores the President's determination to do everything possible to pursue drug traffickers, undermine their operations, and end the suffering that trade in illicit drugs inflicts on Americans and other people around the world, as well as preventing drug traffickers from supporting terrorists.
The Kingpin Act, which became law in December 1999, targets significant foreign narcotics traffickers, their organizations and operatives worldwide, denying them access to the U.S. financial system and all trade and transactions involving U.S. companies and individuals. The Kingpin Act does not target the countries in which these foreign individuals and entities are operating or the governments of such countries.
The additional foreign individuals and entities the President has designated this year as appropriate for sanctions under the Kingpin Act are:
Dawood Ibrahim (India)
Fahd Jamil Georges (Brazil)
Ali Naway (Iran)
Dawood Ibrahim Organization (India/Pakistan/UAE)
Amezcua Contreras Organization (Mexico)
The initial list of drug kingpins was released in June 2000; the above names will be added to that list.
