    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Rep. Vucanovich (R) Nevada)
Tne Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3212, a bill to convey free some 1,900 acres of Federal land in Washoe County, Nevada, to the Reno Sparks Indian Colony. The Administration generally opposes the transfer of public lands to any entity without the payment to the United States of fair market value. This bill is especially objectionable, however, because the primary beneficiary of this proposed transfer is not the Indian Colony, but rather Washoe County.
The public land conveyed to the Reno Sparks Colony by H.R. 3212 is purportedly required for housing and community development to accommodate the Colony's expanding population. However, it has . come to the Administration's attention that the Colony already owns a vacant 160-acre parcel that could be used for this purpose. The parcel was purchased with tribal funds in 1980 and has an estimated fair market value of $225,000. The Colony has been discouraged from developing this land by Washoe County, because it lies under the National Air Race Course and such development could interfere with air races.
Enactment of H.R. 3212 would trigger a contractual agreement between the Colony and Washoe County whereby the Colony's 160-acre parcel would be transferred free to the County. Thus the effect of H.R. 3212 is to permit a conveyance of Indian land to Washoe County, which it could otherwise purchase with its own resources.
