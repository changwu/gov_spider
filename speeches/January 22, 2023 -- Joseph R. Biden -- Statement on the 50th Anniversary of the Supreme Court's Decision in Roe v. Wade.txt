    Today, instead of commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, we are acknowledging that last year, the Supreme Court took away a constitutional right from the American people.
Since the Supreme Court's decision, Americans, time and time again, have made their voices heard: Women should be able to make these deeply personal decisions free from political interference. Yet Republicans in Congress and across the country continue to push for a national abortion ban, to criminalize doctors and nurses, and to make contraception harder to access. It's dangerous, extreme, and out of touch.
I'll continue to fight to protect a woman's right to choose. Congress must restore the protections of Roe v. Wade in Federal law; it's the only way we can fully secure a woman's right to choose in every State.
