    Vice President Kamala Harris spoke separately today with Prime Minister Kiril Petkov of Bulgaria and Prime Minister Petr Fiala of the Czech Republic. Following her recent trip to Poland and Romania, these calls were opportunities for the Vice President to further hear perspectives from leaders in Central and Eastern Europe and to discuss next steps in our collective response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In both phone calls, the Vice President underscored the U.S. commitment to the security of our NATO Allies and expressed support for collective efforts underway to reinforce NATO's defense and deterrence. They also discussed efforts by the United States and Europe to surge assistance to Ukraine and the region, including humanitarian relief to those fleeing violence. The leaders agreed to continue to stay closely coordinated and to stand resolutely with the people of Ukraine.
