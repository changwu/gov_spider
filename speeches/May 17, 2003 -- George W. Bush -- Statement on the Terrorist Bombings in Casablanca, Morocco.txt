    I strongly condemn the terrorist bombings in Casablanca, Morocco, that have taken many innocent lives. On behalf of the American people, I extend condolences to the families of the victims and our hopes for a quick recovery to those injured.
These acts of murder show, once again, that terrorism respects no boundaries nor borders. Casablanca is a city well-known for its tolerance and its diverse range of religious and ethnic communities.
These acts demonstrate that the war against terror goes on. Morocco is a close friend of the United States, and we offer assistance to the Government of Morocco to help track down and bring to justice those responsible.
