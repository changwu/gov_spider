    I have today approved H.J. Res. 456. This resolution provides funding for economic and democratic development assistance to the republics of the former Soviet Union, funding for the remainder of fiscal year 1992 for certain international agencies, and emergency funding for loans to U.S. small businesses that have been adversely affected by natural disasters.
