    President Biden spoke with Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada today to offer additional support to respond to the devasting and historic wildfires burning in Canada. The President has directed his team to deploy all available Federal firefighting assets that can rapidly assist in suppressing fires impacting Canadian and American communities. To date, the United States has deployed more than 600 U.S. firefighters and support personnel, and other firefighting assets to respond to the fires. The two leaders also discussed continued cooperation to prevent wildfires and address the health impacts that such fires have on our communities. They agreed to stay in close touch on emerging needs.
