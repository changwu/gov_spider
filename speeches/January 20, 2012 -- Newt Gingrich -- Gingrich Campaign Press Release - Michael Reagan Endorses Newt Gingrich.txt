    Atlanta, GA - Newt 2012 today released the following statement announcing that Michael Reagan has endorsed Newt Gingrich for president.
"I am endorsing Newt Gingrich for President and here's why:
 
Newt understands that we must reject and fundamentally change the course that Barack Obama has set for America.
 
Newt is our only chance in 2012 to contrast a Reagan conservative with  Obama's European' styled socialism.
 
Newt exemplifies the conservative principles my father championed.
 
Strong national defense, lower taxes and smaller government.
 
In the 90's Newt's leadership brought us the Contract with America which changed Washington.
 
I'm confident Newt can do it again.
 
We cannot afford a candidate backed by the same Washington insiders who repeatedly tried to undermine my father and the Reagan revolution.
 
It's time to choose.
 
Do we go forward with bold ideas or continue with failed policies?
 
So I ask my fellow Republicans and conservatives to join me in supporting Newt Gingrich for president."
