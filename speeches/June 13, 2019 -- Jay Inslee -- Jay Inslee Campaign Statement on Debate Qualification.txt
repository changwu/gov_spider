    Seattle â€“ Today, Inslee for America Campaign Manager Aisling Kerins released the following statement on Gov. Jay Inslee officially qualifying for the June and July debates.
"This is a huge victory for our upstart campaign," Kerins said. "Jay Inslee's appearance on the debate stage will come thanks to the grassroots energy for defeating climate change. Governor Inslee is the only governor in this race to meet both the grassroots donation and polling criteria, and he reached 65,000 donors faster than many better-known senators. This is a sign of the momentum building around the need to make climate change the number one priority of the next president."
