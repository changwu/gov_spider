And Glenn Beck, who's campaigned for Cruz, was blown away by what Marco did to Trump:
Rubio is killing it.#gopdebate

The insurance exchange between Trump and Rubio is exactly what needed to be done to trump on every issue. #nodepth #GOPDebate

Cruz supporter and conservative writer Ben Shapiro said Marco's performance may have Cruz fans reconsidering their choice:

Reporters noticed that Cruz's biggest supporters were impressed with what they saw from Marco:
Telling: Every Cruz surrogate, including Cruz, admitted Rubio had a good night vs. Trump
