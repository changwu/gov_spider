    At the invitation of Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Bush will travel to northeastern Germany in advance of his participation in the G-8 Summit in St. Petersburg, Russia. Chancellor Merkel will host President Bush on July 13, 2006 in the towns of Stralsund and Trinwillershagen, which are in the Chancellor's electoral constituency. The visit, which will take place in what had been communist East Germany, will underscore our two nations' commitment to advancing freedom and prosperity, and to strengthening the transatlantic partnership. The two leaders look forward to discussing a wide range of global challenges, in particular continuing their consultations on Iran and preparing for the G-8 Summit.
