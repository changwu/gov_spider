    Hillary for America's National Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Outreach Director Jason Tengco released the following statement on Donald Trump's comments on his call for a ban on Muslims and restricting immigration from countries like the Philippines, which is a treaty ally:
"Donald Trump's latest proposal to renew his call to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., as well as ban immigration from countries like the Philippines, shows once again that he is temperamentally unfit and unqualified to be president. As a proud Filipino American, I am deeply concerned that families like mine who immigrated from the Philippines would have been the target of Trump's reckless and baseless policy proposals. They, and many other immigrants, have made valuable contributions to society, and make our nation stronger.
"Hillary Clinton has a plan to fight for comprehensive immigration reform and to reunite families, knowing that Filipinos have some of the longest visa wait times: up to 23 years in many cases. Hillary knows that America is a country of immigrants, and understands that we are a stronger country when we come together."
