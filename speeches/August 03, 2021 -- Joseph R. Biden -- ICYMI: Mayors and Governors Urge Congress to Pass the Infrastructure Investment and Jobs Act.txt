    This week, governors and mayors across the country have expressed their ardent support for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the largest long-term investment in our infrastructure and competitiveness in nearly a century.
The deluge of tweets from state and local leaders supporting the bill amplified the importance of the bill's passage by Congress to improve the safety and efficiency of roads, bridges, and transit nationwide, extend access and affordability of broadband, ensure clean water, make our infrastructure and economy more resilient, and tackle the climate crisis.
Several of the tweets also commended the bipartisan efforts of the bill's negotiations, urging Congress to move the plan forward.
While all called for swift passage of the bill, some went a step further, advocating for President Biden's larger plan ??" the Build Back Better Agenda, which will make historic investments in universal pre-k, community college, and child care, among others.
