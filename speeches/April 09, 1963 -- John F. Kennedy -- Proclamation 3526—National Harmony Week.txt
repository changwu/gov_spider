  A Proclamation

Whereas barbershop quartet singing is a uniquely American form of music which provides pleasure for millions of people everywhere; and
Whereas the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America, Incorporated, has made an important contribution to our culture not only by its efforts to preserve such singing, but by its dedication to good fellowship and harmony among peoples of all walks of life; and
Whereas April 11, 1963, will mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of this Society; and
Whereas, in recognition and appreciation of the Society's efforts to maintain barbershop quartet singing as a traditional form of native American music and, through their stimulus to good music and vocal harmony, to keep America singing, the Congress by a joint resolution approved April 9, 1963, has designated the six-day period beginning April 15, 1963, and ending April 20, 1963, as National Harmony Week, and has requested the President to issue a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to join in the observance of that week:
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy, President of the United States of America, do hereby invite the people of the United States to observe the period of April 15, 1963, through April 20, 1963, as National Harmony Week, with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this ninth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh.
