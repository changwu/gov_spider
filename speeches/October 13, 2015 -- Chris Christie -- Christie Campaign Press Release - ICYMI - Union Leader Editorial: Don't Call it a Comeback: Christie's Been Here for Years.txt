    Don't call it a comeback: Christie's been here for years
Editorial
New Hampshire Union leader
Christie looks to join Bill Clinton and John McCain in the club of presidential candidates who won the nomination after the Washington press corps declared their candidacies over.
Christie is a conservative, pro-life governor elected twice in a liberal state. He's mastered the town meeting format like no one since McCain, and his outspoken style and eagerness to engage with his critics play well with flinty Granite State voters.
Christie also has solid campaign fundamentals in place, including decent fundraising and one of the larger ground games in New Hampshire. He's a credible contender in a crowded GOP field, and that hasn't changed.
