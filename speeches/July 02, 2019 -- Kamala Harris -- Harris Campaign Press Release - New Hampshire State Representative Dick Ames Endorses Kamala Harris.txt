    Ames Is Harris's Second Major New Hampshire Endorsement Following the First Democratic Debate
On the heels of her commanding debate performance on Thursday, State Representative Dick Ames is endorsing Kamala Harris for President. Ames is a four term State Representative, first elected to the legislature in 2012. He currently serves as the Vice Chair of the House Committee on Ways and Means and is an influential figure in Cheshire County politics.
"Kamala is the best possible candidate to go up against Donald Trump in a general election. She is focusing her campaign on the issues that keep Americans up at night, and has announced thoughtful proposals to increase teacher pay, give the middle class an income boost, and promote tax fairness. Kamala also understands the existential threat of climate change, and will treat the crisis with the urgency it deserves," said State Representative Dick Ames. "Kamala proved during the first debate that she is the candidate we need in this moment, and I'm proud to announce my endorsement."
Ames joins former New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Joe Keefe in throwing his support behind Harris after the first Democratic debate. In his endorsement last week, Keefe highlighted Harris's "concrete, practical solutions on issues" and noted that Harris is "the best candidate to take on Trump in 2020."
Harris will return to New Hampshire on July 14.
