    This week, U.S. House of Representatives Majority Leader and Maryland Congressman Steny Hoyer announced his endorsement of Joe Biden:
"This election is the most important of my lifetime, and I strongly believe that Joe Biden is the person this country needs to bring us together to confront the extraordinary challenges we face. Joe Biden is a man of integrity, a man of empathy, a man of common sense. That's why the people of Delaware elected him over and over again, and that's why Barack Obama chose him to be the Vice President of the United States and why he served so ably and so well and so loyally in that capacity. He's made a difference throughout his life, and he'll make a difference for America."
Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 3,000 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
