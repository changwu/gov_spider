    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today unveiled some of the leaders of the New York "All-American" Leadership Team. The campaign's "All-Americans" are young professionals, under the age of 45, who are helping build coalitions and fundraising in the New York region.
The New York team is led by Co-Chairs Donald Trump, Jr. and Harry Wilson.
"My fellow All-American fundraisers are very important to making sure the campaign has the resources necessary to communicate Mayor Giuliani's ideas to the American people," said Wilson. "The All-Americans are yet another illustration of the broad support for Mayor Giuliani."
