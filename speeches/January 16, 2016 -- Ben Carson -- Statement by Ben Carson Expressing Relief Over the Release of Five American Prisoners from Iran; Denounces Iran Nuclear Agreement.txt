    I am very pleased that five American citizens, who were illegally imprisoned by Iran in flagrant violation of longstanding international human rights norms, have finally been released. I am overjoyed for the families and friends of Jason Rezaian, Amir Hekmat, Saeed Abedni and two additional, unidentified Americans.
However, the fact remains that President Obama's nuclear agreement with Iran is fatally flawed and gravely jeopardizes the national security interests of the American people, our ally Israel and other peaceful nations in the Middle East and around the world. Furthermore, the disastrous agreement will release more than $100 billion to Iran and allow it to continue exporting terrorism around the world and threaten the United States and its allies. If I am elected President, I will withdraw from this dangerous agreement on Day One.
