    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-265; 16 USC 1801), I transmit herewith a governing international fishery agreement between the United States and the Republic of Korea, signed at Washington on July 26, 1982.
This agreement is one of a series to be renegotiated in accordance with that legislation to replace existing bilateral fishery agreements which are due to expire this year. I urge that the Congress give favorable consideration to this agreement at an early date.
