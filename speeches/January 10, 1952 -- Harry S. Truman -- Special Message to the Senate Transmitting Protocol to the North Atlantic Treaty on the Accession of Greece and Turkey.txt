    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith a certified copy of a Protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty on the Accession of Greece and Turkey which was opened for signature at London on October 17, 1951 and has been signed on behalf of the United States of America and the other Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty. I transmit also for the information of the Senate the report made to me by the Secretary of State regarding this matter.
It is my firm belief that the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty at this time to include Greece and Turkey--two countries which have been collaborating so effectively with the other members of the free world in building the structure of peace--is a requisite step in the furtherance of the Treaty's objectives. I hope, therefore, that the Senate will find it possible to give early and favorable consideration to this Protocol.
