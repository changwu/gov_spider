    Youngest Des Moines School Board Member Ever Elected Says Sanders "The Only Candidate Who Will Be Able to Defeat" Trump.
DES MOINES â€“ Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign at Monday's rally in Des Moines announced Dionna Langford as an Iowa campaign co-chair. Langford, the youngest Des Moines School Board member in history, is featured in a new video launching today.
"When I first ran, I think my bank account may have been in the negative. I had no political experience. There's a way that we say that you're supposed to do politics: You sit down with these people, you have these conversations," Langford says in the video. "One of the many things that has attracted me to Sen. Sanders campaign is our political system shouldn't operate that way. It shouldn't be for those who just have affluence, it shouldn't be for those who are just well-connected."
Langford became the youngest school board member in Des Moines history when she ran and won in 2014. Langford joins Linn County Supervisor Stacey Walker, LULAC Iowa State Director Nick Salazar, State Rep. Jeff Kurtz, Former CCI President Barb Kalbach and Black Hawk County Supervisor Chris Schwartz as an Iowa campaign co-chair.
"We are thrilled to have Dionna's voice out on the trail over the home stretch toward caucus night," Bernie 2020 Iowa State Director Misty Rebik said. "Her leadership, her energy, and her direct experience of how establishment politics shuts out working-class people give her the kind of moral authority that is inspiring everyday Iowans to join our growing movement."
The video was created entirely in-house by Sanders' campaign and can be seen here.
