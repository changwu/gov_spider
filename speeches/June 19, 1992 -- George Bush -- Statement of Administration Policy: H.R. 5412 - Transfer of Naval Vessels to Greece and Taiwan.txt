    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Fascell (D) FL and Broomfield (R) MI)
The Administration Supports enactment of H.R. 5412, as reported by the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
Scoring for the Purpose of PAYGO and Discretionary Caps
H.R. 5412 would increase offsetting receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). If H.R. 5412 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within 5 days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to Congress.
