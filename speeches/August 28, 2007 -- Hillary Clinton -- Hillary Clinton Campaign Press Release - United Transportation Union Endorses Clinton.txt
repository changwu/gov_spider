    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of the United Transportation Union. UTU represents 125,000 active and retired members in the railroad, bus and public transit sectors across America.
"The UTU has a long history of picking winners early. Hillary will be a president that America's working families can count on. Time and again, as a United States senator, she has stood with us," said UTU President Paul Thompson.
Incoming UTU President Mike Futhey Jr. said Clinton's detailed plan to rebuild the nation's infrastructure and her strong performance at the AFL-CIO Presidential forum in Chicago were deciding factors in the union's endorsement.
"Hillary Clinton's record has been friendly to working men and women of this country. She consistently has endorsed the necessity of a strong middle class," Futhey said. "The UTU will encourage its 125,000 active and retired members to support Hillary and other labor friendly candidates in 2008."
"I am honored to receive the support of the United Transportation Union," Clinton said. "America's workers have been invisible to this administration, and it's time they had an advocate in the White House."
