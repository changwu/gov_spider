Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you soRetweets: 3948Favorites: 8377

Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believableRetweets: 2693Favorites: 6381

Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!Retweets: 2176Favorites: 5295

The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!Retweets: 2348Favorites: 5856

Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.Retweets: 2883Favorites: 6853

Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian," did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?Retweets: 2196Favorites: 5580

Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!Retweets: 2299Favorites: 5677

If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?Retweets: 2405Favorites: 5834
