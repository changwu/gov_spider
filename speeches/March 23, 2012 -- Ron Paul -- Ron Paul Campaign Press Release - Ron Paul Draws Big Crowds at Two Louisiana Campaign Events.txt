BATON ROUGE, Louisiana — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul attracted big crowds today at two college-campus town hall meetings in Louisiana. More than 800 people greeted Dr. Paul in Pineville, and over 1,100 welcomed him in Hammond.
As a comparison, Ron Paul's rival Rick Santorum attracted 400 people to his Pineville rally, according to information provided to 'Youth for Ron Paul,' an initiative of the Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign that helped organized Dr. Paul's Louisiana events. Dr. Paul, then, held an event in Pineville with double Santorum's crowd size and hours later the 12-term Congressman from Texas held an even larger event.
Dr. Paul's first campus town hall meeting was held at 1:00 p.m. CST in the Guinn Auditorium of Louisiana College, located at 1140 College Drive, Pineville, LA 71360. His second occurred this evening at 7:00 p.m. CST in the University Center of Southeastern Louisiana University, located at 800 West University Avenue, Hammond, LA 70402.
Both events were open to the university communities and general public, and were comprised of Ron Paul supporters and undecided voters. Dr. Paul spoke about his platform of constitutionally-limited government, the bond between personal and economic liberties, and his path-breaking 'Plan to Restore America,' an economic blueprint that earns high praise for its seriousness in tackling the nation's fiscal and economic challenges.
