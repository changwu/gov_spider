Commentators
David Rothkopf, The Daily Beast: Whatever critics on the left or right might assert, with a ceasefire being implemented, it's fair to say Biden has navigated US involvement in the current round of Israel-Palestine fighting deftly-avoiding many of the errors of his predecessors. My latest. [Tweet, 2/20/21]
Palmer Report: He won't get credit for it, but President Biden has managed to thread a seemingly impossible needle in bringing about a ceasefire in the Middle East. It's a reminder that diplomacy doesn't consist of foot stomping or mean tweets, but using the leverage you have behind the scenes. [Tweet, 5/20/21]
Yaakov Katz, Jerusalem Post: By agreeing to ceasefire, @netanyahu made a strategic decision to honor & show respect to @POTUS who asked for a truce.
