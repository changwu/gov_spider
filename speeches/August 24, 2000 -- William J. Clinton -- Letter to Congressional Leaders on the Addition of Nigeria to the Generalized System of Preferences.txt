    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Nigeria to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP program, which offers duty-free access to the U.S. market, was originally authorized by the Trade Act of 1974.
I have carefully considered the criteria identified in sections 501 and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974. In light of these criteria, I have determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits to Nigeria.
This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(f)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
