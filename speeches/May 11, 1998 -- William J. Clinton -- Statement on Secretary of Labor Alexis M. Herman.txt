    Secretary Herman has served me and this administration with distinction. She is a person of integrity, a dedicated public servant, and an asset to working families all over America. I know her well, and I am confident she will not be distracted from the important work she is doing. It is unfortunate that, despite no findings of wrongdoing by the Secretary, the Independent Counsel Act compels the Attorney General to recommend the appointment of an independent counsel in these circumstances. I look forward to the speedy resolution of this investigation. I am confident that in the end, investigators will also conclude that Ms. Herman did nothing wrong.
