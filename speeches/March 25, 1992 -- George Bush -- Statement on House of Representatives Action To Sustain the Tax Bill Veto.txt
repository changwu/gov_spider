    I am pleased that the House of Representatives has voted to sustain my veto of the Democratic tax increase. This 215 - 211 vote indicates broad support for my position in both parties. We don't need a tax increase. We do need an economic growth package that will spur savings and investments in this country and create new jobs. I am hopeful that the many Democrats who gave us majority strength on the veto vote might join us on proposals to speed the economic recovery.
