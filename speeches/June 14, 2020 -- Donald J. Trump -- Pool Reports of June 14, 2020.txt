The pool is assembled on the tarmac waiting for President Trump, who was scheduled to leave Bedminster at 5 PM. We are awaiting word that he has left. On his arrival, he will be flying back to Washington DC.
The White House has not provided any information on how the president has spent his birthday. Pool traveled separately to the airport and has not yet seen Trump today.
