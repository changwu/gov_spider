    Largest-yet coalition rollout representing 13 counties follows recent veterans-themed rally
ANKENY, Iowa â€” The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign announced today the names of 25 Iowans joining the active "Veterans for Ron Paul" nationwide coalition.
The announcement occurs on the heels of a similar recent 20-veteran announcement, a 'Salute to Veterans' rally in Des Moines, and a Des Moines Register op-ed by Ron Paul addressing veterans issues, all in the last week.
Surpassing the recent record-setting rollout for this coalition, the additional members reside in Butler, Cass, Cedar, Cerro Gordo, Jackson, Jasper, Linn, Pocahontas, Polk, Scott, Warren, Washington, and Woodbury counties, all Iowa.
Support for the Ron Paul 2012 campaign in the Hawkeye state continues to benefit from the backing of veterans such as the ones speaking out today. Reasons for Dr. Paul's substantial support from voters who are veterans include his dedication to veterans while in Congress, highlighted in an ad here, and the fact that he is himself a former Air Force flight surgeon.
