    On International Women's Day, we celebrate the many milestones on the road to gender equality and recommit ourselves to fight for the rights and opportunities of women and girls around the world.
Empowering women isn't just the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do. When women succeed, nations are more safe, more secure, and more prosperous. Over the last year, we've seen women and girls inspiring communities and entire countries to stand up for freedom and justice, and I'm proud of my administration's efforts to promote gender equality worldwide.
As a nation, we've launched new efforts to promote women's economic empowerment and political participation, to prevent and respond to gender-based violence, and to strengthen our commitment to helping more women participate in peace-building and conflict resolution. We are promoting food security initiatives that recognize the rights and needs of women farmers and ensuring that women and girls are at the center of global health programs. And we will continue to focus on empowering women and girls at home and abroad.
We've also worked with a wide range of partners, from the United Nations and civil society groups to the private sector, to advance this important agenda. Because when it comes to creating a world in which our sons and daughters can reach their potential, we each have a role to play. And we can make even more progress together.
