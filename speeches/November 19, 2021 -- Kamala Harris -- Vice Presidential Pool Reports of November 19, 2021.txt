VP Travel Pool Report #1: Andrews 
Greetings from your pooler, who is now in the terminal at Joint Base Andrews, preparing to depart with VP Harris for Columbus, Ohio.
Per a staffer in the VP's office, traveling with the VP will be labor secretary Marty Walsh and Rep. Joyce Beatty, whose district we will be visiting.
As you know, VP was briefly POTUS this morning, while President Biden was undergoing a medical procedure. She is now VP again.

VP Travel Pool #6: Tour @ Union Hall 
The Vice President is now, at 2:42 pm, beginning her tour of a room full of training equipment for HVAC systems.
She is accompanied by Sec. Walsh.
The training room has wood paneling and linoleum flooring and is full of equipment one would seemingly need a high degree of expertise to operate without damaging.
A sticker on one of the cabinets says, "Right to work is a lie!"

Then, a few moments later: "We plan on getting a lot of folks through this program."
A shouted question from a fellow pooler regarding the Rittenhouse verdict went unanswered.
We are now waiting for the VP to make a speech in the union's auditorium.

VP Travel Pool Report #9: Background 
A summary of the day's activities, on background from the White House:
Today Vice President Kamala Harris is traveling to Columbus, Ohio to discuss how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will upgrade our nation's infrastructure and create good-paying union jobs in Ohio and across the country. And, on the heels of the U.S. House of Representatives passing the Build Back Better Act, the Vice President will make the case for the Senate to do the same so we can lower costs for working families and strengthen our economy.
The Vice President will be joined by Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh, will also deliver remarks.
The Vice President, Secretary Walsh, and Chairwoman Beatty will tour the Plumbers & Pipefitters Local Union #189, meet with workers, and deliver remarks. Pipefitters will benefit nationally from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including through a $55B investment to expand access to clean drinking water for households and business all across the country.

VP Travel Pool #11: Excerpts (1/2) 
From the VP's remarks. More to come
"it is great to be back in Ohio. And it is great to be here to celebrate the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure investment and jobs act."
Notably, she thanked Sen. Rob Portman, R-Oh., "who was the lead Republican negotiator, and I appreciate the work you did to make clear that certain things shouldn't be partisan, particularly when we're talking about supporting working men and women of America."
"Infrastructure gives people what they need to get to where they need to go."
"Here in Ohio, there are nearly 5,000 miles of highway that need to be repaired, highways like Interstate 70, and 71." ("I know what I'm talking about," the VP joked, to laughter.)
"You know how expensive it is to replace a flat tire? Insurance don't cover that."
"This is just some basic stuff."
"Always look to unions, to the working men and women of America to see the potential of our nation." And, later, in the same theme: "And we also know when workers are heard, when unions are strong, our economy is strong, and America is strong."
The infrastructure law "will put millions more Americans to work in good union jobs."
Infrastructure is "part one of two," a reference to Build Back Better.
"We are determined to lower the cost of living for working people in America."
On House passage of BBB earlier this morning: "We are confident that the Senate will do the same."

VP Travel Pool Report #12: Excerpts (2/2) 
On the House passage of BBB: "They had a long night."
"And the President and I, I'll tell you, we are confident." Said she spoke to him before coming to Ohio (presumably after his procedure).
"In the middle of the Civil War, we started construction on the transcontinental railroad. In the middle of the Great Depression, we finished construction on the Hoover Dam. We created the interstate highway system in the middle of the Cold War."
"In America, we have the courage to see beyond the crisis."
