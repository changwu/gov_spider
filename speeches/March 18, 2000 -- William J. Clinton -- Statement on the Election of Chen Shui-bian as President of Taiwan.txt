    I congratulate Mr. Chen Shui-bian on his victory in today's elections in Taiwan. This election clearly demonstrates the strength and vitality of Taiwan's democracy.
During the election, all the candidates made clear their hope for restoration of constructive dialog with the People's Republic of China. I believe the election provides a fresh opportunity for both sides to reach out and resolve their differences peacefully through dialog. The United States strongly supports such dialog and is committed to promoting peace, stability, and prosperity in the region.
We will continue to conduct close unofficial ties with the people on Taiwan through the American Institute in Taiwan in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act and our "one China" policy as embodied in our three communiques with the People's Republic of China.
