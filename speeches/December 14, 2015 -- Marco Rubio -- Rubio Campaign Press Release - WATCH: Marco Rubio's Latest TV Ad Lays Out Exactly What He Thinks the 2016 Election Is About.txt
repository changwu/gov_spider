In it, Marco lays out the stakes of this campaign:
This election is about the essence of America. About all of us who feel out of place in our own country.

A generation drowning in debt, and a president humiliated by Putin, Iran, and Islamic jihadists.
I'm Marco Rubio. I approve this message because this is about the greatest country in the world and acting like it.
