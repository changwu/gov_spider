    The President. Ladies and gentlemen of the press, a slight change in our plans, I am happy to say. It's been our pleasure to have had the' opportunity to welcome Prime Minister Nakasone to the White House, to personally meet him, and to discuss a wide range of global and bilateral issues facing ore' two countries. These were very fruitful discussions of difficult problems of trade and defense, and we began the discussions on international issues.
But our ties and our common responsibilities are of such importance that I've invited the Prime Minister to join me tomorrow for breakfast, so that we can discuss in more detail the efforts that both of us are making to secure a more peaceful world.
So, our statements as a result of all of our discussions will be made tomorrow morning following that breakfast and before the Prime Minister's departure.
The Prime Minister. I would like to say a few words as a greeting.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the United States' President, Mr. Reagan. We are very happy to be invited here in the White House, and have made very enjoyable and very fruitful talks this morning.
And it is a great honor for me and for my family to be invited by the President's family in this White House breakfast meeting. And I would next like to make our formal statement next morning.
Thank you very much.
