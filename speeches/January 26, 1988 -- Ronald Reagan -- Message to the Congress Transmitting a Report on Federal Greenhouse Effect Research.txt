    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with Section 9 of Public Law 99-383 (100 Stat. 816), I transmit herewith a report on current government activities in the area of research on the so-called "Greenhouse Effect."
While you will note that extensive investigations of the phenomenon are in progress, we do not plan to establish an International Year of the Greenhouse Effect as suggested in the language of Public Law 99-383.
