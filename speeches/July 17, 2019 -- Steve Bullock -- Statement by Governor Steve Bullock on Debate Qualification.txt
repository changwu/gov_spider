    Helena, MT – After officially qualifying for the second DNC debate, Montana Governor Steve Bullock released the following statement:
"I'm excited to add my voice to the next DNC debate in Detroit. We need to have a conversation that isn't detached from the realities people face in their everyday lives — the need for affordable healthcare, quality public schools, and an economy that ensures everyone has a fair shot at success," said Montana Governor Steve Bullock. "As the only candidate who has won and governed a Trump state, I'm focused on realistic solutions to the problems we're facing — the first of which is ensuring we are competitive everywhere so we can beat Donald Trump."
