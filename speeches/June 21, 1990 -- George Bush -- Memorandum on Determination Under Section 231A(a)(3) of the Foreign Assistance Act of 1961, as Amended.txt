    Presidential Determination No. 90-24
Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Pursuant to section 231A(a)(3) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2191a(a)(3), I hereby determine that the waiver of section 231A(a)(1) with respect to Nicaragua, permitting the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to insure, reinsure, guaranty, and finance projects in Nicaragua, is in the national economic interests of the United States. I therefore direct that the provisions of section 231A(a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2191a(a)(1)), henceforth be waived with respect to Nicaragua.
You are authorized and directed to report this determination, along with the attached reasons, to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and to publish it in the Federal Register.
GEORGE BUSH
