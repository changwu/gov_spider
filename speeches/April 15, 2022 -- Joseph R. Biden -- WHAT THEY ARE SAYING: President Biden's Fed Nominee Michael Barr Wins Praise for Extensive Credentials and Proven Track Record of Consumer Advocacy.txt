His contributions include pivotal roles in the design and passage of the Treasury Department's Community Development Financial Institution Fund and New Markets Tax Credit Program, efforts which have driven transformational capital into opportunity-starved communities. Following the Great Recession, he served as a lead architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, working to protect our most vulnerable citizens from abusive financial practices. His support for a more equitable financial marketplace, combined with his extensive knowledge of the financial system make him unequivocally qualified to help ensure that America's financial system works in the best interest of all – not just a privileged few."
