    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Everett (R) AL and 15 cosponsors)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 1703, which is consistent with ongoing efforts within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to revise its system of processing and adjudicating employment discrimination claims. The Administration, however, believes that the bill's requirement for a six-member panel to review VA's procedures for handling equal employment opportunity and harassment issues will be costly and duplicative of activities that VA already has underway. The Administration will work in the Senate to modify H.R. 1703 to address this concern.
