    The President. Good morning. Let me say again how very sad Hillary and I are about the terrible accident that has taken the life of Princess Diana and the others who were with her. We liked her very much. We admired her work for children, for people with AIDS, for the cause of ending the scourge of landmines in the world, and for her love for her children, William and Harry.
I know that this is a very difficult time for millions of people in the United Kingdom who are deeply shocked and grieving, and the American people send their condolences to all of them. We value their friendship, and we understand this great and painful experience.
For myself, I will always be glad that I knew the Princess and always think of her in very strong and positive terms, as will Hillary, and we can only hope that her work will go forward and that everyone who can, will support her two fine sons and help them to have the life and the future that she would want.
Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, you yourself on this vacation have been subject to intrusive photographers. Is there a lesson in this tragedy for the press? Should we back off?
The President. I think it is better right now if we let a little time pass and let this event and the people involved be honored and grieved, and then we'll have time to think about that and maybe make a better judgment. I think it's better for me not to say anything until this moment has received its due respect.
Thank you.
