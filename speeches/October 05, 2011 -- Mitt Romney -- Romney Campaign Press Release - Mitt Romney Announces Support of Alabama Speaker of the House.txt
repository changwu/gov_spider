    Mitt Romney today announced Alabama Speaker of the House Mike Hubbard as Co-Chairman of the Alabama Leadership Team and Chairman of the Alabama Legislative Steering Committee.
"It's an honor to have the Speaker's support. In 2010, his leadership as Chairman of the Alabama Republican Party resulted in Republicans winning every statewide race, reclaiming a congressional seat and, most impressively, putting both houses of the Alabama Legislature in a Republican majority for the first time in 136 years," said Romney. "I'm looking forward to working with Speaker Hubbard and my entire Alabama team to bring my plan for economic recovery and job creation to Alabama and the country."
Announcing his support, Speaker Hubbard said, "Governor Romney is the leader we need to guide our country through an economic recovery. His private sector experience uniquely qualifies him to understand how to create jobs and grow business. I'm excited to be a member of his team and look forward to helping spread his conservative message across Alabama."
