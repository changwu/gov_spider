In Town Pool Report #2 - Coons and Carper 
Senators Chris Coons and Tom Carper of Delaware just spoke to reporters outside at the White House. They said they had just finished an hour long meeting with President Biden.
Some quotes below and I've attached a recording:
Carper said they spoke about the importance of getting the president's nominees confirmed, as well as Covid response and how to revive the economy. He said "the main thing is getting people vaccinated. The main thing is to put the coronavirus in our rearview mirror." He also said "to the extent we can work with our Republican colleagues, let's do that."
Coons said they spoke about the president's conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin and challenges in the US-Russia relationship, as well as the US-China relationship. On Covid, he described Biden as "relentlessly focused on delivering the relief that Americans need" and said it would come in "weeks not months."
On prospect for compromise, Coons said "we did have a conversation about the direct payments and how those might be modified in a way to ensure they're targeted." But he said Biden is "not going to forget the middle class."

Sen. Chuck Schumer came outside at about 1 PM with some of the Democratic senators and spoke briefly to reporters. He said it was an hour and a half long meeting with the president.
"We had a long, serious, substantive meeting where we discussed many of the details of the bill that we have to put together over the next few weeks.""There's agreement, universal agreement we must go big and bold.""We hope our Republican colleagues will join us in that, in that big bold program that America needs.""We want to do it bipartisan, but we must be strong. We cannot dawdle, we cannot delay, we cannot dilute, because the troubles that this nation has and the opportunities that we can bring them are so large.""So we're gonna all work together with this president, we are united as one big whole package, working with our Republican friends, when we can."
