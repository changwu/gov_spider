    This year's recipients of the 1999 National Medal of the Arts and National Humanities Medal stand at the pinnacle of American artistic and academic achievement. Through their ideas, their scholarship, and their works of art, they have opened all our eyes to the richness and the miracle of the human experience. All Americans owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude.
