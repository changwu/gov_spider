    DETROIT, MI â€“ Tonight, John Delaney delivered his opening statement at the Second Democratic Debate, highlighting the contrast between his commonsense solutions and the extreme proposals of candidates like Senators Sanders and Warren. Delaney's statement is transcribed below and can be viewed here.
"Folks, we have a choice. We can go down the road that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren want to take us, which is with bad policies like Medicare-for-all, free everything, and impossible promises, that will turn off independent voters and get Trump re-elected. That's what happened with McGovern, that's what happened with Mondale, that's what happened with Dukakis. Or we can nominate someone with new ideas to create universal healthcare for every American, with choice, someone who wants to unify our country and grow the economy and create jobs everywhere. Then we win the White House. I'm the product of the American dream. I believe in it. I'm the grandson of immigrants and the son of a construction worker. My wife April and I have four amazing daughters. I was the youngest CEO in the history of the New York Stock Exchange, created thousands of jobs, and then served in Congress. That's the type of background - and my platform is about real solutions and not impossible promises that can beat Trump and govern. Thank you."
