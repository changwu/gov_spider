    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Sponsors: Natcher (D), Kentucky; Hefner (D), North Carolina)
This Statement of Administration Policy expresses the Administration's views on H.R. 2446, the Military Construction Appropriations Bill, FY 1994, as reported by the House Appropriations Committee. The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2446 and will work with Congress to address the concerns described below.
The Administration appreciates the Committee's support of the requests for the base closure and realignment program and the overseas construction program of the Department of Defense. However, the Administration objects to the Committee's adjustments that would:

provide $100 million less than the $240 million requested for the NATO Infrastructure program; and
provide an unrequested $197 million for National Guard and Reserve construction projects.

The Administration urges the House to restore requested funding for the NATO Infrastructure program. The Committee's reduction would undermine U.S. efforts to increase the burdensharing contributions of our NATO allies by calling into question the U.S. commitment to programs requiring common funding. Large reductions in the NATO Infrastructure program could reduce the alliance's ability to meet basic mission requirements.
The Administration requests that the House delete unrequested funding for low-priority Guard and Reserve projects and redirect this funding to high-priority programs, including NATO Infrastructure.
The attached tables provide OMB's preliminary scoring of the bill.
