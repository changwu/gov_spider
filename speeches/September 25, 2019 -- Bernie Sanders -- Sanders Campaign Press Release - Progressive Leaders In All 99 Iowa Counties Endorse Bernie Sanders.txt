    DES MOINES -- Following the conclusion of the Iowa "Bernie Beats Trump" tour, Bernie 2020 today announced endorsements from community leaders and activists in all 99 Iowa counties. The group represents community leaders and activists fighting for Medicare for All, tuition-free college, a Green New Deal and repealing right to work in Iowa by strengthening unions.This weekend, the Bernie 2020 Iowa field staff and volunteers hosted over 165 "Plan to Win" parties statewide where community leaders and party activists were trained on how to organize their communities and expand voter outreach.
"In 2016, the political revolution was sparked here in Iowa when thousands of working people came together in a show of grassroots strength to say that we should create a government and an economy that works for all of us and we're happy to say that in 2019, our grassroots movement is stronger than ever," said Iowa Bernie 2020 State Director Misty Rebik. "Taking on the corporations and special interests that have a stranglehold on our economy is tough work but I'm confident that the power of this statewide network of grassroots organizers can defeat them and deliver us a victory on caucus night."
