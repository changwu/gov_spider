    The people of southern California are responding courageously to the challenge of restoring their lives and their communities in the wake of the earthquake. From the first day, our administration has been working extremely hard to fulfill the Federal Government's obligation to help make that possible.
This new assistance reflects new costs that have come to our attention in recent weeks.
My administration is continuing to monitor the situation, and we will continue to provide the necessary assistance as additional needs become evident.
