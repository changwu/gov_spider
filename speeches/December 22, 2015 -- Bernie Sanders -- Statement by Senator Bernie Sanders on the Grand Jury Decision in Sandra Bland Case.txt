    SIOUX CITY, Iowa â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement Monday after a grand jury in Texas decided no felony was committed by the sheriff's office or jailers in the death of Sandra Bland:
"Sandra Bland should not have died while in police custody. There's no doubt in my mind that she, like too many African-Americans who die in police custody, would be alive today if she were a white woman. My thoughts are with her family and her loved ones tonight. We need to reform a very broken criminal justice system."
