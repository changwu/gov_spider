    Boston, MA â€” Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam made the following statement on Mitt Romney's plan for real change:
"Mitt Romney's plan for real change will begin on day one through energy independence, trade that works for America, better training to create a highly skilled work force, a plan to cut the debt, and helping small businesses grow and prosper. This is the change that Florida voters are hungry for and that will lead Mitt Romney to a Florida victory on Election Day. We won't settle for a small agenda that brings us more of the same, and when we come together in Florida and nationwide on November 6th, we'll get to work rebuilding our country and making America the land of opportunity once more."
