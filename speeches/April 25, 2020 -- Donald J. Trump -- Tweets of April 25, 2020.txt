Thank you to the people of Colorado for the warm and gracious notes and letters sent to me for all of the Ventilators we got for you. It was my great honor! @SenCoryGardnerRetweets: 17940Favorites: 112372

Many testing sites are, and have been, open & available. Just passed 5 Million Tests, far more than any other country in the world. In fact, more than all other major countries combined! Don't believe the Fake News! https://t.co/uTSMAvj7R3Retweets: 11318Favorites: 42173

Just spoke to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali of Ethiopia. His Country needs Ventilators, and the U.S. is in good position to help him. We will!Retweets: 27410Favorites: 183487

It is a wonderful feeling to know that our States are loaded up with Ventilators, many brand new and high quality just off of our production lines, and that we are now in a position to help other countries that so desperately need them. Every person needing a Ventilator got one!Retweets: 23364Favorites: 125952

The Do Nothing Democrats are spending much of their money on Fake Ads. I never said that the CoronaVirus is a "Hoax", I said that the Democrats, and the way they lied about it, are a Hoax. Also, it did start with "one person from China", and then grew, & will be a "Miracle" end!Retweets: 34055Favorites: 143479

If the Wall Street Journal "Editorial" writers had called, as they should have, they would have easily found that I was "NOT happy with the Georgia Governor on Tuesday night." You said the opposite, and got it wrong as you often do!Retweets: 23289Favorites: 112043

Was just informed that the Fake News from the Thursday White House Press Conference had me speaking & asking questions of Dr. Deborah Birx. Wrong, I was speaking to our Laboratory expert, not Deborah, about sunlight etc. & the CoronaVirus. The Lamestream Media is corrupt & sick!Retweets: 42115Favorites: 193361

What is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, & then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately. They get record ratings, & the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time & effort!Retweets: 53472Favorites: 244307

I never said the pandemic was a Hoax! Who would say such a thing? I said that the Do Nothing Democrats, together with their Mainstream Media partners, are the Hoax. They have been called out & embarrassed on this, even admitting they were wrong, but continue to spread the lie!Retweets: 58207Favorites: 281426
