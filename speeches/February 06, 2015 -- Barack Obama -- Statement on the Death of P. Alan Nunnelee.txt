    Michelle and I were saddened to learn of the passing of Representative Alan Nunnelee. Alan represented the people of his beloved Mississippi for two decades, first as a State senator and then in Congress. A proud son of Tupelo, Alan never wavered in his determination to serve the men and women who placed their trust in him, even as he bravely battled the illness that ultimately took his life. As a Sunday school teacher and a deacon at his church, Alan believed deeply in the power of faith and the strength of American families. Today our thoughts and prayers are with Alan's family: his wife Tori, their children and grandchildren, and all those who loved him.
