Dear Jack:
As you know, the South Pacific Commission will hold its fifth Session of the South Pacific Conference, representing peoples from all of the islands in the Pacific area, at Pago Pago, American Samoa, starting July 18th.
I am delighted that it will be possible for you to serve as a Senior Advisor to the U.S. Commissioners. I would ask you to take a special look on my behalf at the ways in which our Administration can speed the economic, educational and social development of the area which we consider to be in the long run interest of the United States.
I hope that when you get back you will find an early opportunity to come to Washington to report to me personally on developments and prospects in the Pacific area as they reveal themselves at the South Pacific Conference.
Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[The Honorable John A. Burns, Honolulu, Hawaii]
