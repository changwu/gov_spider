HOUSTON, Texas – Today, Ted Cruz continued to build on the campaign's strong Oklahoma leadership team with endorsements from major Oklahoma legislative leaders.
"I am thrilled to announce such outstanding conservative legislators to our Oklahoma leadership team leading up to Super Tuesday," said Cruz. "These courageous conservatives know that Oklahomans are tired of career politicians in Washington and want someone who has a record of fighting against the Washington Cartel.
"This impressive list of conservative leaders supporting Ted Cruz's campaign shows his strong support across our state," said Cruz for President Oklahoma Chairman Congressman Jim Bridenstine. "Oklahomans are tired of leaders of both parties in Washington making deals at the expense of the American people. Ted Cruz is the leader we can trust to do what he says he'll do and stand up for us against the Washington Cartel."
