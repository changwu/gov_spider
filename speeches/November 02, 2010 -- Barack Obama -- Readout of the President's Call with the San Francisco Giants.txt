    Earlier today, President Obama called members of the San Francisco Giants organization. He congratulated the management, owners and the team on winning the World Series and noted that he remembered the excitement he felt when the White Sox broke their World Series dry spell. The President said he enjoyed watching the game and congratulated the whole organization, including the pitching staff and young stars Madison Bumgarner and Buster Posey for their composure under pressure. The President also mentioned that he wanted to find out if there really was magic in closer Brian Wilsonâ€™s beard. The Giants invited the President to a home game and the President said he looked forward to congratulating the team in person at the White House.
