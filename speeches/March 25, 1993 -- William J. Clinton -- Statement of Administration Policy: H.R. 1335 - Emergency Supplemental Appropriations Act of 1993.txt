    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate Floor)(Natcher D-Kentucky and Byrd D-West Virginia)
The Administration supports passage of H.R. 1335, reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee and commends the committee for its prompt consideration of the President's economic stimulus program.
President Clinton, in a March 23, 1993 letter to Chairman Byrd, stated, "this stimulus package is an essential bridge from today's weak recovery ta the development of a Stronger base for long-term growth." The economic stimulus bill is an integral, part of the President's economic plan of short-term stimulus, long-term investment and deficit reduction.
The Administration opposes any efforts to delay passage of this critical legislation and opposes amendments which would delay the availability of specific funding in the Committee-reported bill, such delays could jeopardize the effort to spur economic growth during the coming months end put the spending and stimulus at risk.
In addition, the Administration opposes amendments which would drop the emergency designation for a significant portion of the funding contained in the bill, thus requiring unspecified offsets for a significant portion of the stimulus bill. To do so would cancel the intended benefits of the measure and threaten the education, infrastructure, health and other investment initiatives in the President's five year economic program.
