    Today, I have signed into law S. 512, the "Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act" (the "Act"). Several provisions of the Act, including sections 102(a)(1) and (3), 103(b)(3), (c)(3), (d)(3), (e)(3), purport to require the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to submit budget requests to the Congress to implement certain programs or to limit the amount it may request for those programs. Other provisions of the Act, sections 103(e)(4)(B) and (D), purport to require the Commission to evaluate whether additional legislative authority or appropriations are needed to implement a certain program envisioned by the Congress. My Administration will treat these provisions in a manner consistent with Article II, section 3 of the Constitution, which provides the President with the discretion to recommend to the Congress only "such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient."
