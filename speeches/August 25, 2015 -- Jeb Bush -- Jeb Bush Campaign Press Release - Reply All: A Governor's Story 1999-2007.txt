    Governor Jeb Bush has written a memoir of his governorship through the email exchanges he had with his staff, members of the media and most importantly the Floridians he represented during his two-terms as the leader of America's fourth largest state. The book, titled Reply All, is available for pre-order on Amazon today. It will be published on October 30.
Governor Bush spent 30 hours a week doing email because it kept him committed to his mission of being the best leader possible for Floridians. His new book chronicles how he took on the teachers union to make Florida a pioneer in school choice and helped drive a nearly 50 percent increase in high school graduation rates; how he vetoed more than 2,500 earmarks, saving taxpayers more than $2 billion and earning the nickname Veto Corleone; and how he made Florida's economy the envy of the nation by cutting taxes by $19 billion, streamlining regulations and taking on the trial lawyers to restrict frivolous lawsuits.
You will also see his commitment to helping those Floridians facing challenges as evidenced by his commitment to reduce domestic violence and improve services to Floridians with developmental disabilities. You will also see how Governor Bush's strong leadership brought his state together in the face of an unprecedented eight hurricanes during 2004-2005 hurricane seasons.
