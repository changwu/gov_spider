(House Rules)
(Rep. Kline, R-MN, and 37 cosponsors)
The Administration opposes H.R. 3094 because it would undermine and delay workers' ability to exercise their right to choose whether or not to be represented by a union. H.R. 3094 also attacks the freedom of individuals to choose the co-workers with whom they wish to seek representation.
