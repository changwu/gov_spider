Over the weekend, that special guest announced himself: It's South Carolina Representative Trey Gowdy.

Rep. Gowdy has been an outspoken champion of conservative causes in the House, especially getting a reputation for being one of the Obama Administration's worst enemies in Congressional oversight.
His decision to back Marco didn't go unnoticed.

Rep. Gowdy's pick is already making waves with some voters.
@DailyCaller That makes me want to look much more closely at Rubio. GREAT respect for Gowdy!
