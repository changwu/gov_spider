    On Thursday, April 3, 2014, the President signed into law:
H.R. 2019, the "Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act," which terminates the entitlement of national committees of eligible political parties to payments from the "Presidential Election Campaign Fund" for presidential nominating conventions; transfers amounts maintained in the Campaign Fund for these national committees to a new "10-Year Pediatric Research Initiative Fund;" and authorizes appropriations out of the Initiative Fund for grants to be made by the National Institutes of Health for pediatric research.
