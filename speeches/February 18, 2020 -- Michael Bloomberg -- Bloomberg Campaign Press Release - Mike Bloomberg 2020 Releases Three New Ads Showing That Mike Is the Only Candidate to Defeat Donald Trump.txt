    The new TV spots, entitled 'It Won't Work', 'Only Democrat', and 'Scary Truth,' emphasize Mike's ability to take on Trump — and win
NEW YORK — The Mike Bloomberg 2020 campaign today released three new powerful TV ads, highlighting Mike's electability and his ability to defeat Donald Trump in November. The ads emphasize Mike's record of winning tough battles, and his unmatched experience as a leader, including as a three-term mayor of the City of New York.
The TV ads 'It Won't Work,' 'Only Democrat' and 'Scary Truth' are running nationwide on network, cable and local markets in 28 states, including in every Super Tuesday state.
"Now we know the Trump strategy — try to win by attacking, distorting, dividing. Mr. President, it won't work," Mike Bloomberg says in one of the new ads. "I led a complex, diverse city through 9/11, and I have common sense plans to move America away from chaos to progress."
One of the top concerns of Democrats is defeating Donald Trump in November — Democratic voters across the spectrum want bold, achievable actions to address the biggest challenges we face, from gun control to climate change and more. Mike is the candidate with a record of delivering results and winning broad support.
"Here's the scary truth: it's easy to say "beat Trump," but it's going to be harder to do," one of the ads begins. "We need someone who has the clout, toughness, and record of getting things done: Mike Bloomberg."
Mike is everything that Trump is not: a successful, honest, capable, and practical leader who built his own business from scratch, was a phenomenally successful mayor of one of the largest cities in the country, and has led the national fight against climate change and the NRA. Mike's leadership ability is unmatched by other candidates in the race, making him the best choice to take on Donald Trump and rebuild America.
