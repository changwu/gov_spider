    Today, the President met for over an hour with twelve leaders from some of the nation's largest labor organizations to discuss ways to work together to strengthen the economy. The group talked about creating good jobs for the American people and how the partnership with labor is essential to growing our economy and continuing our recovery. The President discussed how the steps we have taken have prevented a second Great Depression, and reinforced the essential role the union movement plays in growing the economy, creating good jobs on Main Street, and keeping America competitive. The President reiterated his commitment to working in partnership with the labor community as we tackle these challenges, along with his support for policies that protect working Americans and support the rights of workers to organize and collectively bargain. The President and the labor leaders pledged to continue to work closely together in the coming months on these important economic issues.
