    I didn't have any information about reported frauds and irregularities in the recent Porto Rican elections. I don't think that either of the Porto Ricans who were in here this morning mentioned it. They were talking more about the economic conditions. I was more interested to see what we could do to improve them. Many of the people of Porto Rico are laborers, a low class of labor, and compensation is small, and if anything could be done to improve the economic condition of the Island is something to interest me more than past frauds in elections. So the matter of elections was not mentioned. I don't think I had heard anything about it.
