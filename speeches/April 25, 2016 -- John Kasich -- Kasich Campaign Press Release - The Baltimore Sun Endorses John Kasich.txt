[C]ompared to Mr. Trump and Senator Cruz, neither of whom has come close to demonstrating the skills or the temperament to serve as leader of the free world, Mr. Kasich has offered genuine statesmanship — if only by refusing to wallow in the trough of name-calling and extremism that has so captured his opponents. It should come as no surprise that polls have consistently shown that Mr. Kasich has a better chance of winning in November than the vulgarian New York developer with a frighteningly poor grasp of foreign policy or the Princeton debater and preposterous Ronald Reagan poseur with a demonstrated inability to work with others, Democratic or Republican, and who promises more of the same if elected.

Maryland GOP voters who believe supporting Mr. Trump is a clear and loud refutation of the Republican establishment ought to think again. Suffering such a potential embarrassment of a national candidate at the top of the ticket could not only doom the party's Senate majority, it might even tip the balance in the House, not to mention hand the White House to Hillary Clinton, who has all but wrapped up the Democratic nomination. If conservatives think Congressional Republicans failed to block President Barack Obama, imagine what happens after the party so foolishly sacrifices most of its potential influence.
That Governor Hogan has stayed out of the presidential race since the departure of his friend and mentor, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, speaks volumes. He knows what it takes to cross party lines and that the top two vote-getters are fundamentally ill-equipped to get the job done. Mr. Kasich comes closest, and he gets our endorsement.
