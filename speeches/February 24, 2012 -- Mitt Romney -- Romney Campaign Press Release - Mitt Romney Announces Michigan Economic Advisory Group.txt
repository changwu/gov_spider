    Mitt Romney today announced his Michigan Economic Advisory Group. The team will be led by Hillsdale College Economics Professor Gary Wolfram.
"Michigan has been hard hit the last couple of years," said Mitt Romney. "Bringing jobs back to Michigan and creating certainty for future Michiganders is important not only to the state but to the rest of the country. For too many years, Michigan has faced economic struggles — it is time for the state to help lead our country's economic recovery. In my efforts to bring pro-growth policies to Washington and Michigan, my Michigan economic team will be integral in this endeavor."
Announcing the Michigan Economic Advisory Group, Professor Gary Wolfram said, "Mitt Romney laid out a bold pro-growth economic plan that will enable small businesses in Michigan to grow and hire. Not only does this plan create a fairer tax environment for Michiganders and our businesses that compete globally, it also addresses spending and entitlement reform. Mitt Romney worked in the private sector and knows that government has to get out of the way of the American entrepreneurial spirit — his economic plan will give innovators and hardworking Americans the ability to pursue their dreams."
"Mitt Romney's knowledge of the auto industry and experience in starting and running businesses would be a much-needed improvement in Washington, DC," said Patrick L. Anderson.
