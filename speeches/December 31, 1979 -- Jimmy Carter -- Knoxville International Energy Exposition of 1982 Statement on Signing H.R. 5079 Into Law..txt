    I take great pleasure in signing H.R. 5079, which authorizes United States participation in Energy-Expo '82 the International Energy Exposition to be held in Knoxville, Tennessee, in 1982.
Energy-Expo '82 has the prospect of being critically important to the future of every nation and perhaps of every individual on Earth. With "Energy Turns the World" as its theme, the exposition will focus attention on one of the world's most pressing problems, and give participating nations an opportunity to demonstrate working prototypes of their newest energyrelated inventions and developments as well as to discuss their energy policies in a variety of conferences.
The planning of this internationally significant event has been going on for several years. In April 1977, I granted it Federal recognition as being in the national interest; in December 1978, I invited all the nations with which the United States has diplomatic relations to take part; and in August of this year I transmitted to Congress the proposal for United States participation which I now have the satisfaction of signing into law.
Knoxville, known as the Energy Capital of the World, is an appropriate site for Energy-Expo '82. It is surrounded by energy production—the Appalachian coalfields, Oak Ridge, the Tennessee Valley Authority—and it is the home of the University of Tennessee, with its diverse energy research facilities.
I look forward expectantly to Energy-Expo '82 and to the benefits it can bring to the people of this Nation and the world.
