Romney Campaign: President Obama's Policies Are Crushing The Middle Class
ED GILLESPIE: "It was a very fact-based critique of the failure of the President's policies and how they're crushing us...the middle class in this country. Falling wages; hard to find work; rising gas prices; rising food prices and middle-class families caught in that crunch as a result of the President's policies. But more important, I think, Sean, Governor Romney laid out his plan for changing that and a positive vision for moving this country forward for 12 million new jobs to get to us a balanced budget to unleash energy in this country, to expand trade."
