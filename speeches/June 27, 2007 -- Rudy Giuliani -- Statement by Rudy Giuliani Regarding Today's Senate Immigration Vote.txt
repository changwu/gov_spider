    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee released the following statement today regarding the U.S. Senate's vote on immigration legislation:
"Today a majority in the Senate made clear this bill shortchanged the American people by failing to end illegal immigration and failing to secure our borders. The bill did not deserve to move forward.
"As I have said before, this bill — which I believed was based more on compromise than on principle — failed to do several basic things, including: securing our borders, creating a uniform tamper-proof ID card for all foreign workers and students, establishing a single nationwide database of foreigners, and mandating the full implementation of a biometric ‘check in-check out' system.
"The legislation was a hodgepodge at best, and I believe it would have ultimately made our country less secure.
"I urge the President to use the authority and funds at his disposal to do everything possible to end illegal immigration and secure our borders."
