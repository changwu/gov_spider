    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate Floor)(Sponsors: Byrd (D), Mississippi, Johnston (D) Louisiana
The Administration supports the FY 1990 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
The Administration is pleased that the Senate bill provides funding for the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC). The SSC is a critical part of this Administration's initiatives to strengthen the position of the Nation as a world leader in science and technology. However, the Administration is concerned about the provision requiring a 10 percent set-aside for special groups. While the Administration supports the intent of this provision, the specific requirement could adversely affect the management of the project.
The Administration is also pleased that the bill deletes most of the objectionable funding and language provisions included in the House-passed bill for the Army Corps of Engineers. The Senate bill eliminates the cost-sharing exemptions and authorizing language, refrains from using excessive "savings and slippages" to finance the Corps planning and construction programs, and provides authority for new Corps of Engineers recreation user fees. The bill also scales back the number of new construction starts and other unbudgeted items for the Army Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation.
In total, the bill is far more fiscally responsible than the House-passed bill. In addition, it reaffirms the important water resources policy reforms of the Water Resources Development Acts of 1986 and 1988.
We strongly encourage the Senate to preserve a strong, fiscally responsible bill that provides for investment in important projects for America's future.
