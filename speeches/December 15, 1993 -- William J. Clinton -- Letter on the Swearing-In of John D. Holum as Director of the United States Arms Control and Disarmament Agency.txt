    Dear John:
I am delighted to extend my congratulations as you are sworn in as the Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
There are few challenges more pressing today than arms control and nonproliferation. Already we have taken several steps to address these challenges. In the past year, we have submitted the Chemical Weapons Treaty to the Senate. We have ratified the Open Skies Treaty. We have advanced new proposals on a comprehensive test ban and the ABM Treaty, and have made substantial progress in the denuclearization of the States of the Former Soviet Union. We have elevated nonproliferation on the national agenda and with your leadership will be pursuing a range of measures such as focused regional strategies and comprehensive approaches to the dangers posed by fissile materials. These steps and others we will take together can make our people safer and our nation more secure.
Much remains to be done to meet these challenges. Under your guidance, ACDA will play a crucial role in advancing the full range of our arms control and nonproliferation agenda. I look forward to having the benefit of your counsel, your expertise and your leadership skills as we work together to ensure a safer world for generations to come.
Sincerely,
BILL CLINTON
