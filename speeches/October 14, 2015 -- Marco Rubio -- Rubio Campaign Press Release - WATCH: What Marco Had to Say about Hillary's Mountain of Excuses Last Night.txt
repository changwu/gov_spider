Asked about Bernie Sanders's and Hillary Clinton's dismissal of investigations into her use of private email while in government:

Well, they may not care about it, but the people in this country do, because it goes right to the issue of credibility. First of all, it's pretty clear that what she told us and what happened are two very different things. Second, it goes to the issue of competency: These emails, by the secretary of state, were the prime targets of foreign intelligence agencies. As soon as the news came out that she was using a private server, one of the first things I said was, those emails were vulnerable to the Chinese, to the North Koreans, Iran, you name it . . . And of course now we're seeing reports that that was the case.
It shows that she was both incompetent but quite frankly was not being [honest] with the American peopleÂ andplaying games with words.
It goes to the issue of whether you can trust someone or not, the credibility issue.
