?The president arrived by motorcade at Joint Base Andrews at 4:33 pm ahead of his flight to Sanford, Florida, for his first rally since contracting coronavirus. He did not talk to press but gave a thumbs up through the window and a wave as he walked toward the steps to board AF1.

 Out of Town Pool Report #3: arrival 
Air Force One touched down at the Orlando Sanford International Airport at 6:39 pm.
The channel was set to Fox News during the mostly uneventful flight.
Early on, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows came to the press cabin door to thank members of the press pool for traveling today. He wore a mask and did not stay to chat.
No other visitors came by the press cabin and Meadows is the only senior staffer pool has seen on today's trip.

 Out of Town Travel Pool #4: rally 
?The president emerged from Air Force One at 6:54 pm ET. He is on stage now, having taken the stage to God Bless the USA.
The traveling press corps deplaned Air Force One and rushed on foot to the nearby, outdoor rally set up at the airport immediately after arrival. Traveling press is seated in a separate section from the rest of the press corp in a fenced off area with a buffer between our filing tables and the president's supporters. The sun is setting in Sanford, but it is still 84 degrees outside.
Many of the president's supporters -- -of which there are many stuffed into the rally site but pool has not received an official crowd count -- are not wearing masks, although some are.
Immediately prior to the president taking the stage "Memory" from the musical Cats was playing. Since the president began talking, members of the audience have shouted Trump's name and four more years.
Pooler will send additional color but for full quotes please consult a television.
