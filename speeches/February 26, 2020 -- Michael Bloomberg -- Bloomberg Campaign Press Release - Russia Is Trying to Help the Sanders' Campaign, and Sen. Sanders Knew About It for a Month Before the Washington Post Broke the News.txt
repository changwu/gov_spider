    NEW YORK — The Washington Post reported that Senator Sanders was briefed by U.S. intelligence over a month ago that Russia is interfering in our elections again – this time to help his campaign. Sen. Sanders' response? He attacked the Washington Post for reporting on it.
Not surprising given his support for Russia – including making it his honeymoon destination. Foreign Policy for America criticized Sanders' vote against sanctioning Russia "during a time when policymakers feared that President Donald Trump 'might arbitrarily lift the sanctions on Russia."
We already have a Russian puppet in the Oval Office. It's clear why Russia is doing this. They know Senator Sanders can't beat Trump and they want to keep Trump in the White House.
This is confirmed by recent polling. Vox reported on new data showing that Sanders' appeal "appears almost entirely limited to left-leaning young people, who are usually a small share of the overall electorate." And that "whites without a college degree — a demographic some speculate Sanders could win over — are actually more likely to say they will vote for Trump against Sanders than against the other Democrats. The same is true of the rest of the electorate, except left-leaning young people." Further, new polling from the Bloomberg campaign shows that a Sanders nomination would devastate down ballot races, possibly leading to the loss of the House of Representatives.
We cannot have a repeat of 2016, and we call on the senator to condemn the interference and not attack our press for reporting on it.
