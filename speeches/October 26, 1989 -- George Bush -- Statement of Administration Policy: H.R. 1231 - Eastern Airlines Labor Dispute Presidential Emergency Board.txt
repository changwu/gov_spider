    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Anderson (D) CA and Oberstar (D) MN)
The Administration opposes H.R. 1231 and, if it is presented to the President, his senior advisers would recommend that it be vetoed.
It is inappropriate, in light of the history of the present dispute and the Eastern Airlines bankruptcy court proceeding, to require the President to establish a Presidential Emergency Board, as would be mandated by H.R. 1231.
The President's senior advisers would likewise recommend the veto of a substitute for H.R. 1231 providing for establishment of a congressional advisory commission. The proposed commission would investigate and make recommendations on the three pending labor disputes at Eastern Airlines, and additional important aviation industry policy matters. It is premature and infeasible to attempt to resolve these fundamental matters in 45 days, as would be required by the bill.
