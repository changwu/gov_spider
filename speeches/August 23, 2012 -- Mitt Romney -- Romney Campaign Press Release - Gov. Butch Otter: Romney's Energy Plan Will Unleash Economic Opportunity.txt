    Idaho Governor Butch Otter made the following statement on Mitt Romney's vision for America as an energy superpower:
"One of my great frustrations as a member of Congress and now as Governor is the federal government's refusal to enable states and the private sector to make the best, most responsible use of our vast energy resources right here at home. That kind of obstructionism has just gotten worse under the current administration. Governor Romney has outlined a reasonable, achievable and refreshing plan for energy independence and for unleashing our incredible potential for creating the career and economic opportunities America needs. I look forward to helping President Romney bring it to fruition."
