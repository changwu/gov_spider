    Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, consistent with the requirements of section 3134 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 110-181), the enclosed report entitled, "The Global Nuclear Security Report 2008."
This report, compiled by the Departments of State, Defense, and Energy, provides a list of all known sites worldwide containing nuclear weapons, formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material, and related equipment. It also details the United States comprehensive nuclear nonproliferation effort designed to help secure nuclear material, equipment, and expertise worldwide, and cooperation with international partners on this crucial global imperative. The report includes information on program plans and priorities, interagency cooperation, programmatic and budgetary requirements, and international engagement related to this vital national security priority. We have expanded and accelerated our nuclear security and nonproliferation efforts internationally to now include partnerships with over 100 countries worldwide.
I am proud of the significant accomplishments the United States has achieved to help address the risk of nuclear proliferation and secure nuclear materials globally, as outlined in this report.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
