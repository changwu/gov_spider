Boston, MA â€“ Today, Michigan State Representative Dave Robertson announced his endorsement of Governor Mitt Romney. Representative Robertson has been involved in politics since 1991, and represents Michigan's 51st House District.
"In Michigan, Representative Robertson has fought for our common conservative principles such as keeping taxes low and cutting government spending. It is these principles that will strengthen Michigan's economy and allow families to keep more of their hard-earned money. I look forward to working with him to continue fighting for fiscal responsibility, government restraint and pro-growth economic policies," said Governor Romney.
Representative Robertson said, "Governor Romney demonstrates true leadership and the ability to solve seemingly impossible problems. From turning around the 2002 Winter Olympics, to closing a nearly three billion dollar deficit as governor, Mitt Romney has the experience and vision we need here in Michigan and in Washington."
