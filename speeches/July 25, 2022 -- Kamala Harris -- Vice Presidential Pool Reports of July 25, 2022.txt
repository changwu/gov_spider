VP travel pool report #4--VP Harris remarks at roundtable
At the top of the open press portion of VP's roundtable, which lasted approximately 5 minutes, VP made the following remarks:
On the Dobbs ruling's impact: 
"This has created a healthcare crisis, and as has been said, Indiana has already been on the forefront of this very issue," Harris said, nodding to the case of the 10-year-old Ohio rape victim who crossed state lines to receive an abortion from Dr. Caitlin Bernard in Indianapolis.
Harris talked about her experience as a former prosecutor tasked with prosecuting crimes against women and children, including sex crimes.
"The idea that in some states, after a child or a woman or a man, but in particular in this case of an abortion, a woman or a child would have endured such an act of violence and then to suggest that she would not have the autonomy and authority to make a decision about what happens to her is outrageous."
In her opening remarks, Harris also said: "I would also say that on this issue, one does not have to abandon your faith or your belief to agree that the government should not be making this decision for her. And individuals should be able to choose based on their personal beliefs and the dictates of their faith. But the government should not be telling an individual what to do especially as it relates to one of the most intimate and personal decisions a woman could make."
On Indiana's special session: 
"On this day, where Indiana is the first state since the Dobbs decision to convene a special session to propose a law that includes, based on what has been proposed, what will essentially be a ban on abortion for women, because to be clear—it may be some people need to actually learn how a woman's body works—when you know how a woman's body works, you will understand that the parameters that are being imposed mean that for the vast majority of women by the time she realizes she is pregnant, she will effectively be prohibited from having access to reproductive health care that would allow them to choose what happens to her."
On the Biden administration's actions: 
"The President has signed an executive order to protect women's access to abortion medication and has taken action to protect the constitutional right to interstate travel."
