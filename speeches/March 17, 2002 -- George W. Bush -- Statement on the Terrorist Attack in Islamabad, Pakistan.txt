    I am outraged by the terrorist attack that took place today in Islamabad, Pakistan, against innocent civilians. I strongly condemn them as acts of murder that cannot be tolerated by any person of conscience nor justified by any cause. On behalf of the American people, I extend my deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims of this terrible tragedy, and I wish a full and fast recovery to those injured. We will work closely with the Government of Pakistan to ensure those responsible for this terrorist attack face justice.
