    President Clinton and President Kuchma underscored the important role that cooperation in civil and commercial aerospace activities can play in furthering scientific, technical and economic ties between the United States and Ukraine. As a first significant step in this cooperation, the two Presidents signed an agreement on cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes that will expand joint efforts in space communications, space technology, life and microgravity sciences applications, remote sensing and earth sciences, space sciences and telecommunications.
The two Presidents agreed that future joint activities should be explored. Both Presidents recognized that the Ukrainian aerospace industry can make a valuable contribution to Ukraine's economic reform and development as it undertakes the transition to a market economy. They resolved to work together to open prospects for Ukrainian access to international aerospace markets. Noting that a preliminary dialogue addressing the potential for commercial space opportunities between the United States and Ukraine had already begun, they agreed to hold further talks on commercial launches and the scope of these activities, in accordance with market principles, with the principles contained in international arrangements for integrating economies in transition into the international space launch market, and consistent with current obligations of the two countries.
President Clinton and President Kuchma also directed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Ukrainian National Space Agency to identify potential experiments and payloads which could qualify for flight on the Space Shuttle and also to create an opportunity for a Ukrainian Payload Specialist to fly on the Space Shuttle. Both agencies will jointly report their recommendations for such a mission by March 31, 1995.
