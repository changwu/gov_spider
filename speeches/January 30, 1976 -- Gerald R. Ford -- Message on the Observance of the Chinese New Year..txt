    MRS. FORD and I send our warmest New Year greetings to our fellow citizens of Chinese ancestry. We hope that the good fortune symbolized by the Year of the Dragon will be with you and your families and that it will also abound in our national life as we celebrate the Bicentennial of our Independence.
We hope that your celebrations of this festive event will be happy and memorable for each of you.
GERALD R. FORD
