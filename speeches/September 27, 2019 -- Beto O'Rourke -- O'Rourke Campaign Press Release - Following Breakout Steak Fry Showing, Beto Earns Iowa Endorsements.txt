    Activists, Former USDA Official, Students Praise Beto's Leadership, Unique Style of Campaigning
DES MOINES, IOWA — Beto for Iowa announced the endorsements of nine Iowa activists, leaders, and students today. These endorsers come after Beto's standout performance at the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry, where he received a standing ovation from more than 12,000 Iowans, and his wide-ranging discussion in Waterloo on gun violence prevention, the intersection of poverty and race, and transformational justice. Beto's campaigned in Iowa's largest cities and smallest towns, writing no one off and taking no one for granted. Today's endorsements bring Beto's total Iowa endorsements to 37.
"Beto's approach is paying off across Iowa — from having no fear in combatting our gun violence epidemic, to fighting for our farmers, teachers and students — and these endorsements show that we're picking up momentum as we enter the fourth quarter of 2019," said Norm Sterzenbach, Iowa State Director.
The full list of endorsements includes:

Frank Rottinghaus, Floyd County Treasurer
Peggy Sherrets, Mayor of Oelwein
Mark Rocha, Board Member, Asian and Latino Coalition & Political Director CWA 7102
Doug Thompson, former USDA official and Hancock County Farmer
Don Dew, President of Sioux City Pride and Co-Founder of Siouxland Pride Alliance
Jose Maldonado, Founder, Lambda Softball Association of Eastern Iowa
Tommy Hexter, Founder, Grinnell College Farm House
Bobbie Fox, Sierra Club member and Environmental Activist, Cedar Falls
