    Before signing, I would like to read a statement that has been prepared:
Mrs. Ford and I are signing today the first consumer pledge prepared for Americans by the nonpartisan Citizens' ]Action] Committee to Fight Inflation.
The WIN committee is asking mayors and principal county officials across this country to set up local action committees for distribution in the near future of similar pledges for citizens to sign in a concerted mass effort to stop inflation. The committee has also prepared a businessman and businesswoman's pledge and a worker's pledge for local distribution. Each Governor is being asked to establish one statewide committee to determine ways and means to slow inflation and to save energy in each State.
If all Americans will pull together to hold down prices, to buy wisely, to increase productivity, and to save energy, this citizens' mobilization to slow inflation can and will work. Inflation is sapping the economic strength of this country, and it must be brought under control.
So, at this point Betty will sign the first pledge, and I will join her.
REPORTER. Mr. President, what are you going to do to carry out this plan?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, the things that I buy, I will be very careful in purchasing. I think we have got to increase our productivity--that includes me. We have to be Yankee traders when we buy, and we have to cooperate individually and collectively. And Mrs. Ford has pledged to me, as well as here, she will do the same.
