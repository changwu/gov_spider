    On December 7 and 8, leaders of Muslim nations belonging to the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) met in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The OIC Summit Declaration issued at the conclusion of this Summit covers a great deal of ground. There is much in the Declaration with which we agree, though there are also portions which do not comport with U.S. policy.
The United States welcomes valuable statements from the OIC regarding the common fight against terrorism and extremism. The Declaration condemns terrorism; stresses the need to criminalize all aspects of terrorism, including its financing; and rejects any justification for the deliberate killing of innocent civilians. In addition, the OIC Declaration condemns extremism and calls for developing school curricula that "strengthen the values of understanding, tolerance, dialogue and pluralism."
The United States also praises the OIC for the support it extends to Iraq as it completes its transitional political process and elects a full term government under its new democratic constitution. We appreciate the endorsement of OIC members of the Arab League initiative to promote national dialogue in Iraq and welcome the OIC's unreserved condemnation of terrorist violence directed against the Iraqi people.
The United States welcomes the OIC decision to confront the scourges of terrorism and extremism and support Iraq. We look forward to strengthening our cooperation with members of the OIC committed to making progress in the global fight against terrorists and their supporters.
