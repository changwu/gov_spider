    Chicago, IL -- U.S. Senator Barack Obama released the following statement today in response to the speech delivered by President Bush at the Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention.
"The disastrous consequences described by President Bush are already in motion and are a direct result of a war that should never have been authorized. There is no military solution to Iraq's problems. The only way to reverse these consequences is to change course through a surge in our diplomatic and humanitarian efforts in Iraq and the region, and a phased withdrawal of our forces that puts real pressure on the Iraqi government to act."
