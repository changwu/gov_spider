03/01/1879


Veto of "An act to restrict the immigration of Chinese to the United States," which included terms to modify in part the 1869 Burlingame Treaty.  Hayes argues that modifying an existing treaty "is not competent for Congress."  He also warns that the restrictions in the legislation would put at risk "our citizens in China.




04/26/1979


Proclamation Warning Against Unauthorized Settlement in the Indian Territory.




04/29/1879


Vetoes Army Appropriations Bill. Hayes objected to language prohibiting use of troops at election sites "to keep peace at the polls."  He argued that no soldier had ever interfered with any election and that laws were already in place to prevent that.  Moreover he argued that the legislation would "deprive the civil authorities. . . of all power to keep the peace at the Congressional elections."  He stated that "national legislation to provide safeguards for free and honest elections is necessary. . . to secure the right to vote to the envranchised race at the South, but also to prevent fraudulent voting in the large cities of the North."  Veto sustained.




05/12/1879


Vetoes "Act to Prohibit Military Interference at Elections."  Hayes references his prior veto of 04/29/1879 and offers a detailed accounting of prior law relating to the use of the military by the National Government. He notes that under the legislation it would be unlawful to use the Army or Navy "to uphold the authority of the Government of the United States."  Veto sustained. 




05/29/1879


Vetoes general Appropriations Bill. The Bill raises the same kinds of concerns raised in the message of 04/29/1879.  "The supervision of the elections will be reduced to a mere inspection, without authority. . .to make the election a fair one."  And, "on the day of an election, peace and good order are more necessary than on any other day of the year." The veto was sustained.




06/23/1879


Veto of "An act making appropriations for certain judicial expenditures."  Again citing his veto of 04/29/1879, Hayes writes "It is not sought by the bill before me to repeal the election laws.  Its object is to defeat their enforcement." The veto was sustained.




06/30/1879


Veto of "An act making appropriations to pay fees of the United States marshals and their general deputies."  He notes that the bill has sections that are "identical in tenor and effect" to the bill he vetoed on 06/23/1879.  Hayes points out that his is coupled with appropriations in a way to force him to choose either to continue essential functions or to approve legislation to which he has objected.  This legislatuion has been described by the House historian as an important early example of the use of appropriations "riders."  This strategy was developed by Southern Democrats who were seeking an end to reconstruction. As a consequence of Hayes's insistence, some of the government was not funded until the middle of 1880.  This veto was sustained.

Veto of "An act making appropriations to supply certain deficiencies in the appropriations for the service of the Govwernment for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880. Hayes observes, " Under these circumstances, to attempt in an appropriation bill the modification or repeal of these laws is to annex a condition to the passage of needed and proper appropriations, which tends to deprive the Executive of that equal and independent exercise of discretion and judgment which the Constitution contemplates."  This veto was unchallenged.
