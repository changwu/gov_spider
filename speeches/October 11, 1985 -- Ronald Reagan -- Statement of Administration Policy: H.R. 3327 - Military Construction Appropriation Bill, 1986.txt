    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Sponsor: Whitten (D), Mississippi)
The Administration is concerned about the level of funding recommended, which is $1,949 million below the requested level of $10,340 million and $109 million below the Congressional Budget Resolution level of $8,499 million. The Committee provides $8,391 million in Military Construction and Family Housing for the Department of Defense. The Administration is particularly concerned about the reduction relating to the elimination of certain overseas projects and urges the restoration of funds for these projects, including the funds for the Ground Launch Cruise Missiles (GLCM) facilities in the Netherlands.
