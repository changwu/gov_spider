"Our growing grassroots support helps us build a robust campaign to compete in early states like Iowa and beyond," said Bullock for President Campaign Manager Jenn Ridder. "With a doubling of our individual contributions — and an average online contribution of just $24 — it's clear that Governor Bullock's message of progressive reform is resonating with grassroots supporters across the country.
