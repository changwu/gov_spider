    Well, thank you, everybody. We're going to be making formal remarks over there, but we just wanted to say that we've had an extraordinarily productive day. And what is represented around the table is not just three Presidents but rather it's ministers, agency heads at every level, and that reflects the kind of concrete cooperation and detail that is going to, ultimately, make a difference in improving opportunity and democracy and stability in Pakistan and in Afghanistan. So we'll see you guys over there.
Thank you.
