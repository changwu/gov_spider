    Newt spoke to an enthusiastic crowd this morning at Price Hill Chili in Cincinnati, Ohio. He talked about his plan to create jobs, how to replace the welfare system with an opportunity society, why we need a bold Reagan conservative to defeat President Obama, and more.
Republican presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich today brought his talk of family, jobs and God straight to where he hoped it would resonate - Cincinnati's West Side.
And it did. The popular Price Hill Chili was packed with 200 people who cheered and clapped as Gingrich promised he'd put people on unemployment into job training and cut corporate taxes. "Large-scale" change is needed, he said, and he's the man to bring it.
"It is fundamentally wrong to give people 99 weeks of money for doing nothing," he said, prompting the crowd to yell, "Newt! Newt!"
Gingrich spoke for 30 minutes. He stood on a platform at one end of the restaurant's enclosed patio room in front of blue bunting and five flags. The soundtrack before and after was full of country songs about America, with the exception of U2's "Beautiful Day."
He drew his biggest cheers when he talked about oil and said, "No American president will ever again bow to a Saudi king."
He said he doesn't want to run just a Republican campaign, but one that unleashes "the American people so they can go out and rebuild the America we love." A woman shouted, "Yes! Yes!"

  Jim Ferneding of Montgomery wanted the chance to shake Gingrich's hand, and he got it. He told him: "You're the one with the strength. Just concentrate on condemning Obama and you will win."
Nick Boschert stood in the back holding a sign that said: "I Stand With Newt + The Catholic Church." His kids go to St. Xavier High School and St. Ignatius Elementary School and he's president of the St. I's men's society.
"I think (Newt's) the one who can get things done," he said.
