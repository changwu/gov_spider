    The issue of migration of Mexican nationals to the United States is a priority on our bilateral agenda. We, the Presidents of the United States and Mexico hereby politically commit our respective governments to strive to ensure a proper and respectful management of this complex phenomenon taking into consideration its diverse causes and economic and social consequences in both countries.
During the last two years, our governments have engaged in consultations and exchange of information through many mechanisms and have produced significant progress in the bilateral treatment of issues such as human rights and consular protection of migrants and efforts to combat migrant trafficking. This constructive dialogue should serve as a first step leading to specific proposals to manage migration between our nations in a mutually beneficial manner.
In pursuing these proposals, our governments reaffirm a commitment to enhanced bilateral cooperation in the management of migration. We will be guided by the following principles:

The sovereign right of every State to formulate and enforce its immigration laws in a manner that addresses its national interests, always in accordance with the rules of international law and in pursuit of a spirit of bilateral cooperation;
Full compliance with the objectives of the memorandum of Understanding on Consular Protection of United States and Mexican Nationals, signed on May 7, 1996, especially the respect for human rights of all migrants; and,
Dedication to a comprehensive vision of managing migration and our shared border that turns differences between our nations into sources of strength, and that leads to mutually beneficial economic and social development that preserves family reunification and protects human dignity.

On the basis of these principles, we, the Presidents of the United States and Mexico commit our governments to intensify dialogue and to accelerate efforts to achieve the following goals:

Explore ways to strengthen mechanisms and fora for consultation and cooperation on migration and consular protection that the two governments have established at the national and local level;
Protect the rights of migrants, pursue vigorously the administration of justice in situations in which migrants and border communities register complaints concerning unlawful actions, and respect due process and constitutional guarantees in the implementation of immigration laws;
Ensure the implementation of safe and orderly procedures for the repatriation of migrants;
Design and implement new ways to reduce violence along the border and to protect innocent victims of traffickers from the dangers of crossing in mountainous and desert terrain, including a vigorous educational and public information campaign to advise families on both sides of the border of the hazards of crossing in those areas;
Combat trafficking in migrants and forging of documents and, to that end, develop effective mechanisms of exchange of information and cooperation, with full respect for the sovereignty of each country;
Achieve a comprehensive approach on the migration phenomenon between the two countries through scientific and cooperative studies that contribute to a bilateral understanding of this issue.

We, the Presidents of the United States and Mexico, affirm our governments' political will to strive to fulfill a vision of our shared border in the twenty-first century as a place that supports and depends on building communities of cooperation rather than of conflict. In pursuance of this vision, our governments will work together to expand upon the foundation of progress made through joint planning and cooperation during the last two years in certain border areas. Both administrations will intensify efforts to achieve the following goals:

Encourage binational strategic planning activities that seek to design new integrated approaches to mutually beneficial economic, social, environmental, and cultural development in border communities;
Support and expand public and private partnerships in developing cross border interests and activities, and in pursuing shared interests on either side of the border;
Intensify the dialogue on financing mechanisms that promote and implement cross border development projects;
Test new ways to design infrastructure and community development projects that provide a dignified approach to public safety in border communities;
Explore new approaches to managing temporary travel between border communities, consistent with the laws of each nation, recognizing the economic, social and family benefits of vigorous cross border exchange; and,
Promote effective management of ports of entry to foster orderly movement of traffic of goods and people, and to reduce the waiting times for daily commuters and other commercial vehicles.

We, the Presidents of the United States and Mexico, call on the relevant agencies of both administrations to report to us in one year, through the Binational Commission, on the progress made towards the better management of the migration phenomenon and the trans formation of our border into a model area of bilateral cooperation.
