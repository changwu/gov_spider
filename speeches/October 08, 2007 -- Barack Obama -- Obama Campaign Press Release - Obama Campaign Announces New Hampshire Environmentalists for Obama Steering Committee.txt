    Environmental and energy policymakers, experts and activists join campaign to lead grassroots organizing efforts
Manchester, NH -- As Senator Barack Obama headed to Portsmouth today to unveil his plan for a Clean Energy Future, Obama for America announced the membership of the New Hampshire Environmentalists for Obama Steering Committee. The Steering Committee, consisting of State representatives, policy experts, activists, innovators, and business leaders, will coordinate outreach and advise the campaign on environmental and energy issues.
"Barack Obama has shown his commitment to our environment throughout his career in public service-passing laws to promote biofuels and invest in fuel-efficient vehicles and proposing a national low carbon fuel standard as part of his campaign platform," State Representative David Borden said. "But even more important, Obama understands that if we're going to tackle the urgent crisis of climate change, we're going to have to bring all sides together. He's the only candidate in this race who has the ability to unite people for real change in our energy policy."
In his speech today at the Portsmouth Public Library, Senator Obama will lay out a set of proposals that will allow America to lead the world in combating global climate change.
