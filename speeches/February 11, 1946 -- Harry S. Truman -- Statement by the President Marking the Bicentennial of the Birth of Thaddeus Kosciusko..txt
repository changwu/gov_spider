    FEBRUARY 12 of this year will mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of a great Polish patriot who is revered by all Americans-General Thaddeus Kosciusko.
The American nation will never forget the prominent role he played in the early history of this country. They will never forget the great service which he so generously rendered to the cause of American independence and which contributed in such great measure to the ultimate success of that cause. But even more important than this, Kosciusko will be remembered by the people of America, as well as by the people of Poland and many other lands, for his unflagging devotion to the ideals of liberty, freedom and justice to all mankind. To the attainment of these ideals Kosciusko, throughout his life-time, devoted all his energies and talents. His heroic efforts in the cause of liberty have served as an inspiration to all peoples.
It is most fitting that on February 12 the people of the United States join with the people of Poland--bound together as they are by historical ties--in honoring the memory of one of Poland's brave and gallant sons and one of America's great heroes.
