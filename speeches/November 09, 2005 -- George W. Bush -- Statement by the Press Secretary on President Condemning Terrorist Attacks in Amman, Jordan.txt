    The President condemns in the strongest possible terms the vicious terrorist attacks against innocent civilians in Amman, Jordan. Those targeted included citizens of many nationalities. On behalf of the American people, the President expresses his condolences to King Abdullah and the people of Jordan. We hope for the recovery of those wounded in these attacks, and offer our prayers for the victims and their families.
Jordan is a close friend of the United States, and we will offer every possible form of cooperation in investigating these attacks and assisting in efforts to bring these terrorists to justice.
