    HOUSTON, Texas – Former Congressman, three time Olympian, and five time World Record holder Jim Ryun announced today he is endorsing Ted Cruz for President. Ryun is the last American to hold the world record in the mile run. As a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1996–2007, Ryun represented Kansas's second congressional district. He spent his time in Congress advocating for limited government, restoring the rule of law and respecting our Constitutional liberties. Congressman Ryun will join Congressman Jim Bridenstine, Congressman Tim Huelskamp, and Rafael Cruz for a rally in Wichita, Kansas tomorrow night at 6 p.m.
"I have known Ted for years," said Ryun. "He is a consistent conservative who has time and time again proven he stands on principle. I am excited to stand with him. Our nation is at a tipping point and we have very clear choices in this Republican Primary. Ted is now positioned as the only candidate who can defeat Donald Trump and I am calling on all my fellow Kansans to stand with me and vote for Ted on Saturday."
"Jim is a man of great courage and principle," said Cruz. "He served the people of Kansas and all Americans well during his time in Congress. His support for conservative principles has been unwavering. I am glad to call Jim a friend and honored to have his support in this race."
