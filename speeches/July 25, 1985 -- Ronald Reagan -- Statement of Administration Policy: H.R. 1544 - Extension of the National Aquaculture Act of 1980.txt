    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Reps. Breaux (D) Louisiana and Young (R) Alaska)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1544. The primary purposes of the National Aquaculture Act can be accomplished by the private sector, which is now in a position to develop new aquaculture opportunities and commercial applications, without further Federal involvement.
