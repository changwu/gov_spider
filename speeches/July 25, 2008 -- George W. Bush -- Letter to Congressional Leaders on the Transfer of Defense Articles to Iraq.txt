    Dear Mr. Chairman:
Pursuant to section 1228(f)(2) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Public Law 110-181 (NDAA), I hereby provide notice that the effective date of section 1228 of the NDAA is delayed for a period of 90 days.
I certify that it is in the vital interest of the United States to continue to provide defense articles to the Government of Iraq for this additional period of 90 days in order to develop and sustain the military and security forces of Iraq. Additional time is needed to review the export and transfer program for Iraq and to implement necessary measures to ensure compliance with the registration, monitoring, and record-keeping requirements of section 1228. Halting the provision of defense articles to Iraq during this period of review and implementation would be contrary to the national security of the United States.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
