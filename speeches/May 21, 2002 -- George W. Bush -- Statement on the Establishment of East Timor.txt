    The United States salutes the establishment of East Timor, the first new nation of the millennium. With those in Dili, we celebrate the successful conclusion of the long struggle of the people of East Timor for an independent nation. We are heartened that the people of East Timor have embraced the path of democracy that will lead their nation to peace and prosperity. On behalf of the American people, I congratulate Xanana Gusmao, who was sworn in as East Timor's first President.
The United Nations has played a pivotal role in bringing East Timor into the family of nations. We praise the contributions and efforts of the international community which helped make the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor a success.
