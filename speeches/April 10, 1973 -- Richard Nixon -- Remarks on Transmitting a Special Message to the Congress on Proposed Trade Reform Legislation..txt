    THE TRADE BILL I am sending to the Congress today can mean more jobs and better jobs for American workmen.
It can help American consumers get more for their money.
It can help us expand our trade, and thus expand prosperity in America.
And most importantly, these proposals can help us reduce international tensions and strengthen the structure of peace in the world.
