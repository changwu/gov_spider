    Chechnya
Q. Mr. President, did you and the Prime Minister discuss Chechnya and the ongoing crisis with President Yeltsin?
The President. No, we just got here. We're just starting a discussion.
Q. [Inaudible]â€”together, was Chechnya brought up?
The President. Chechnya was not brought up. We discussed the Middle East and we discussed Bosnia, because we have common efforts there. But the rest of our time was devoted to the nuclear summit.
And I'm looking forward, I might say, to this meeting because of all the good work the Prime Minister has done for peace in Northern Ireland with the Irish Prime Minister. And I think that the proposal for all-party talks and the elections as a way to get into it is a very good thing. And I think the cease-fire should be reestablished by the IRA immediately.
Middle East Peace Process
Q. What about the Middle East, sir? Have you heard anything from Secretary Christopher or other people involved, any updates?
The President. I'm in regular contact with him, but I have nothing to add right now. We're working at it hard and we may have something to say in the next few hours, but I just don't know.
