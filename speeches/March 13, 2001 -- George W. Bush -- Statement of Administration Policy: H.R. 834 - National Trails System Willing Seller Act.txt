    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. McInnis (R) Colorado and 20 others)
The Administration supports H.R. 834, which would allow the use of federal funds to acquire land for nine National Trails System (NTS) components from willing sellers.
Passage of H.R. 834 will provide more uniform resource protections for all NTS components, as well as enable federal trail administrators and managers to protect the resources of these nine NTS components by: (1) allowing for the protection of cultural, historical, and natural resources that are on non-federal lands; (2) permitting the relocation of on-road sections of the NTS to safer, more appropriate off-road sites; and (3) making the market value of land available to willing sellers.
