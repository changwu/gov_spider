    The President today issued an emergency declaration for areas struck by record and near-record snowfall in the State of New York.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to New York State and affected local governments in Erie County and Niagara County, to help clear emergency routes in order to protect public health and safety, and to prevent damage to public and private property.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency said that damage surveys are continuing in other areas, and additional assistance and counties may be added after the assessments are completed.
