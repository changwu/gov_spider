    Salazar Named Co-Chair as Sanders Unveils Immigration Plan
DES MOINES -- Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign on Thursday named League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) Iowa State Director Nick Salazar as a state campaign co-chair. The announcement follows the release of Sanders' immigration plan, A Welcoming and Safe America for All. Salazar will make his first appearance as a campaign co-chair at Saturday's Coralville rally to introduce Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
"I personally endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders because he represents the best opportunity for America to truly transform itself into the nation that it can and should be," said Salazar. "To win Iowa and build a movement we are bringing together a diverse group of leaders, along with millions of people, who are prepared to fight for justice and I am ready to be a part of that fight as campaign co-chair here in Iowa."
Salazar has a long history of activism in his eastern Iowa community of Muscatine and serves as the Iowa Democratic Party 2nd Congressional District Affirmative Action Chair. In May, Salazar was unanimously elected as LULAC Iowa's State Director and became the youngest person to serve in the role in the 62-year history of the organization in Iowa. Salazar has played an important leadership role in LULAC's recent successful efforts to strike down parts of Iowa's voter ID laws and the awarding of 62 scholarships to Quad City area students totaling over $54,000 in an effort to help ease the burden of college tuition. In October, Sen. Sanders participated in the LULAC presidential forum in Des Moines, receiving an enthusiastic reception from the crowd.
Salazar joins Linn County Supervisor Stacey Walker as a Bernie 2020 Iowa campaign co-chair.
