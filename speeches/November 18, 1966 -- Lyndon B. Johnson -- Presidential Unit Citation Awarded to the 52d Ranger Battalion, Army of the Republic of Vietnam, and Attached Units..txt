FOR
EXTRAORDINARY HEROISM
The 52d Ranger Battalion and the above attached units, Army of the Republic of Vietnam, distinguished themselves by extraordinary heroism in action against hostile forces in the vicinity of Phu Hai, Phuoc Tuy Province, Republic of Vietnam on 11 November 1965.
After providing relief for an outpost that had been under attack, the Rangers were returning to their home station and engaged in a road clearing operation when information was received that a large force of Vietcong planned an ambush along the return route. Without hesitation, the Rangers deployed to advantageous positions and used sound counter-ambush techniques. When contact was made with the numerically superior force, the friendly troops launched an assault on the Vietcong which drove them toward the northeast. Having regrouped, the Rangers again assaulted the Vietcong positions just as hostile reinforcements began moving toward them from the north.
In close, fierce fighting, the Rangers forced the insurgents from their positions in the northeast into the path of their reinforcements approaching from the north, causing both the advancing and retreating hostile elements to be caught in the open and become the target of accurate air strikes. Then as an insurgent unit, moving to the west, attacked a small force of Rangers left to guard vehicles near Kim Hai, a Ranger Company quickly moved back to the ambush site, drove off the Vietcong, and retrieved all but three of their vehicles.
The determination, devotion to duty, indomitable courage, and extraordinary heroism demonstrated by the members of the 52d Ranger Battalion and its attached units in defending their homeland are in the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon themselves and the Republic of Vietnam.
