    THE PEOPLE of the United States join me in sending Your Excellency and the people of China their sincerest felicitations on the forty-seventh anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China.
We gladly recall on this occasion the Treaty of Mutual Defense between the Republic of China and the United States. We pay tribute to the indomitable spirit of free China which, tested so often in recent years by invasion and war, has once again been demonstrated in the face of Communist attack. We recognize that the sacrifices of free China contribute to the survival of freedom everywhere. We extend our sympathy and friendship to all the Chinese people, being deeply conscious of the hardships and denials of freedom that so many of them are enduring.
