Boston, MA â€“ Today, 35 years after the Roe v. Wade decision, Governor Mitt Romney released the following statement commemorating the annual March For Life:
"Today, as Americans from across this country participate in the annual March for Life, my thoughts are with all those whose dedication and compassionate concern have done so much to educate and assist others in creating a genuine culture of life.
"After 35 years of Roe v. Wade, we are again reminded why this decision should be overturned. "We recognize the worth and dignity of every person, a fact that is ingrained in our hearts and etched in our national purpose. Unelected judges should not be the final arbiters on these important decisions which define who we are as a people.
"Respect for human life is, at once, both the foundation and the way forward to the future of a just and noble society, one in which every human individual is welcomed in life and protected in law."
