    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Bliley (R) Virginia and 2 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 2969, subject to the understanding that the District of Columbia will continue making payments on its borrowings from the Federal Government at the time of receipt of the annual Federal payment. This position is based on an expectation that the District will be able to implement real and effective reforms to address its current fiscal problems.
