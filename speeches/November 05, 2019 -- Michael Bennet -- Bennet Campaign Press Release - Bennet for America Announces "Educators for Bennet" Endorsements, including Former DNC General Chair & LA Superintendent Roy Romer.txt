    DENVER â€” Bennet for America today announced "Educators for Bennet," with endorsements from 75 educators from across the country, including former General Chair of the DNC, Colorado Governor, and Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Roy Romer. This new group reflects Michael Bennet's years of leadership on education, including as the former Superintendent of Denver Public Schools, a district with 95,000 students and a $1 billion budget.
"Michael has never lost the values that made him an extraordinary Superintendent: honesty, empathy, and a deep faith in the potential of every child in America," said Romer. "Securing a brighter future for the next generation starts by understanding why our schools fail so many students. Nobody's better qualified than Michael to reimagine the current system and put children on a path to success. He will be the education president America needs."
Under Bennet's leadership, the Denver Public Schools increased student learning, grew student enrollment, decreased dropout rates, and improved graduation rates and college enrollment. As a member of the Senate committee that oversees education, Bennet was instrumental in the 2015 passage of the sweeping, bipartisan overhaul of No Child Left Behind.
