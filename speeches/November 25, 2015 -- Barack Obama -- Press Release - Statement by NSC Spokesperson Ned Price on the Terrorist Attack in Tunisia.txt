    The United states condemns in the strongest terms yesterday's terrorist attack against members of Tunisia's security forces. We extend our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of those killed and wounded. We are prepared to assist Tunisian authorities in the coming days as they investigate this attack. Terrorists have sought to use fear and violence to undermine the important gains the Tunisian people have made in pursuit of a democratic, stable, and prosperous country. We will continue to provide robust security, economic, and governance support as they build upon the progress achieved since 2011.
