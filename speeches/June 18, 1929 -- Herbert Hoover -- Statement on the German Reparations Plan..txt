    I HAVE a question as to whether the administration would submit the Young reparations agreement to Congress or not, or whether we become a signatory to it. Our Government is not a party to that agreement, and therefore, would not be a signatory to it. There is no occasion to submit the agreement to Congress. The only point for congressional action is an authority to the administration to reduce Germany's treaty obligations in respect to the comparatively minor items of Army occupation costs and mixed claims.
