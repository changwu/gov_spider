Q. [Inaudible]—by your briefers before your debate?

Q. Why did you say you were in the Air Force last night at that dinner?
The President. That I was—
Q. In the Air Force.

Q. The way you're going to be briefed for your next debate with Mr. Mondale?

Q. Are you going to be yourself?.
The President. What?
Q. Are you going to be yourself this time?
