    McWherter, Eskind, Harper To Chair TN Effort
The Clinton campaign today announced its Tennessee Steering Committee, made up of over 100 community leaders from across the state who will mobilize grassroots support for Hillary leading up to Tennessee's February 5th primary. The committee will be chaired by Former Governor Ned McWherter, Former Chair of the Public Service Commission Jane Eskind, and State Senator Thelma Harper.
"Hillary's tireless commitment to provide quality, affordable health care to every American, rebuild the middle class and repair our standing in the world make her the clear choice to lead our country as President," said Former Governor Ned McWherter.
"Hillary's 35-year record fighting for children and families sets her apart," said Former Chair of the Public Service Commission Jane Eskind. "She's uniquely qualified to be President and hit the ground running on her first day in office."
"It's time for new leadership in Washington, and it's going to take someone with Hillary Clinton's strength, ability, sensitivity and experience to create the real change this country needs," said State Senator Thelma Harper.
"I'm delighted to have such strong support from across Tennessee," Clinton said. "We're going to run a grassroots campaign from Kingsport to Memphis and from Chattanooga to Clarksville."
