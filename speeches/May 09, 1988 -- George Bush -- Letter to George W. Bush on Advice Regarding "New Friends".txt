Dear George,
We are about to sail into unchartered waters, in terms of family scrutiny. We've all been through a lot of inquiry and microscopic probing; however, it'll get worse, not just for our family, but for Dukakis'/Jackson's, too. Hence this letter to family.
The attached article relates to a non-relative, Dick Dyer, but look what the paper does with it?
As we move closer to November, you'll find you've got a lot of new friends. They may become real friends. Or if the polls show Dukakis kicking us — there might be some friendships that will vaporize. They'll ask for things "Do you know anyone at Commerce? Can you call Joe Doakes at State?"
My plea is this: please do not contact any federal agency or department on anything. A call from a "Bush" will get returned, but there is a great likelihood that it will be leaked; maybe deliberately misrepresented.
If there is a legitimate inquiry, call my office. It is certainly appropriate to contact your own government, but let's do it through my office so no one can accuse any of the family of trying to use influence.
I know I must sound very defensive, but — believe me — every effort will be made to find some phone call, some inquiry, some letter that can be made to appear improper.
Soon the election will be at hand, and then you will not have to put up with preachy letters from your father, as in this case, maybe.
Devotedly,
[signed "Dad"]
P.S. Please keep me advised of any press calls. It is important that our communications's people know who is working what story.
