    37 Manchester area activists endorse Obama
Manchester, NH -- More than 60 grassroots activists from the Manchester area and around the state announced this week that they've joined Barack Obama's movement for change. The endorsements come as voters begin to focus in earnest on the kind of leadership that can bring about real change in Washington.
"Barack Obama recognizes that we need to change Washington in a fundamental way if we're going to make progress on pressing issues like health care and energy independence-and he's the only candidate in this race who can do it," Jack Resch said. "As he always says, we don't need a candidate who's good at playing the Washington game-we need a candidate who can put an end to the game-playing and focus on results."
The following activists joined Obama in calling for real change:
