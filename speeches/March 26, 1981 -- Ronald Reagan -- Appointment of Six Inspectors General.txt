There are 16 statutory Inspectors General, including that of the State Department, which has a slightly different statutory basis. President Reagan announced that the remaining 10 positions will be filled shortly and that previously serving Inspectors General are under consideration for some of those positions.
Shortly after assuming office, the President terminated the appointments of all the incumbent Inspectors General, exercising the prerogative of a newly inaugurated President. He announced at that time that he would seek the most qualified appointees for these important positions and that the former incumbents would be among those considered.
Each of the IG's appointed today has compiled an excellent record of uncovering fraud and other abuses in the programs under their surveillance. In some cases, their investigations have led to criminal indictments, and in all cases they have produced recoveries of moneys falsely expended or other savings.
