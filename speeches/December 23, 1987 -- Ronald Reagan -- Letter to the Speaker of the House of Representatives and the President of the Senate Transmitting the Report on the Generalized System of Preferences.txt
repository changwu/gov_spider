    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I herewith transmit my report on the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), as required by the Trade Act of 1974, as amended ("the Act").
Section 504(a)(2) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(a)(2)) requires that I report no later than January 4, 1988, on the application of sections 501 and 502(c) of the Act to the GSP program. It also requires me to document the actions I have taken to limit the application of duty-free treatment under the program with respect to any country which has failed to adequately take the actions described in section 502(e).
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
