StruckAxiom is a business of the future. They are on the cutting-edge in creative design and marketing technology, having done work for movies like Shrek and Spiderman, for Adidas and Nickelodeon, and for many other top brands.
StruckAxiom is exactly the type of 21st Century start-up you'd expect to find in Silicon Valley or on Madison Avenue. But they chose to grow their business and launch their dreams not in California or New York, and certainly not in Massachusetts - but in Salt Lake City.
They chose Utah because of the job-friendly environment that Gov. Huntsman helped create: historic tax relief, streamlined regulations, balanced budgets.
They tripled in size throughout Jon's governorship, even during the recession, and now employ 60 workers.
Earlier today, Gov. Huntsman visited StruckAxiom to demonstrate - to the President, in particular - the kind of jobs that free-market, pro-growth policies can help create. In fact, the policies that Gov. Huntsman championed helped make Utah the fastest growing state in the nation and number one in job creation.
StruckAxiom is a Utah success story. And when Jon gets to the White House, he'll help create success stories like that all across this nation.
