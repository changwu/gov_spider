    Today's PRIDE survey shows that American families can influence adolescents' attitudes and behaviors when it comes to drugs. This is a small step in the right direction. But we must all continue to warn our youth that drugs are wrong; that drugs are dangerous; and that drugs can kill you. That is why in the coming months, we will take our antidrug media campaign nationwide, fund more community antidrug coalitions, and work to enact our long-term drug strategy. These and other steps will help us to reach our ultimate goalâ€”cutting teen drug use in half.
