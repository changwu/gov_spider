LAKE JACKSON, Texas — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul drew a remarkable 2,000-plus supporters and undecided voters to his University of Rhode Island town hall meeting.
Big crowds comprised of the university and general community greeted the 12-term Congressman from Texas less than one week ahead of the state's Tuesday, March 24th Republican primary, and the day prior to the Paul campaign airing its celebrated television ad 'The Plan' to cement support in time for the Ocean State's nominating contest.
Dr. Paul's college campus town hall meeting took place at 7:00 p.m. ET in the University of Rhode Island's Keaney Gymnasium, located on Tootell Road in South Kingstown, RI 02881. At the event, Dr. Paul discussed his platform of constitutionally-limited government, restoring civil and economic liberties, and elements of his path-breaking 'Plan to Restore America.'
Ron Paul's town hall meeting in Rhode Island was organized by 'Youth for Ron Paul' (YFP). YFP, an initiative of the Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign, launched in September 2011, and since its inception, students nationwide have organized 607 chapters and recruited more than 76,000 people.
