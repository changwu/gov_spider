    OUR Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, is flying today to represent this country at the council meetings of the North Atlantic Treaty powers. He is leaving at a time when this country and the other nations of the free world stand in their greatest peril.
This is going to be a very important meeting. Out of it will come arrangements for a friendly integrated European defense system. Such a system will provide the basis for a strong and effective supreme command under distinguished leadership. This will be one more step in our broad plan to strengthen the free nations of the world for peace.
Our foreign policy must be a continuing and consistent policy. We shall continue here and in other areas of the world to build our strength and the strength of our allies to maintain peace in the world.
This meeting in Brussels will show that, contrary to Communist hopes, the peoples of the North Atlantic Community are determined to remain united.
Secretary Acheson goes to this meeting with my complete confidence.
