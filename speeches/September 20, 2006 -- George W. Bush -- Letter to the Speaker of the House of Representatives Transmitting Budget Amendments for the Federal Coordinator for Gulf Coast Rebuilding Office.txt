    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2007 Budget amendments for the Federal Coordinator for Gulf Coast Rebuilding Office in the Department of Homeland Security. The total discretionary budget authority in my FY 2007 Budget would not be increased by this request.
The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
