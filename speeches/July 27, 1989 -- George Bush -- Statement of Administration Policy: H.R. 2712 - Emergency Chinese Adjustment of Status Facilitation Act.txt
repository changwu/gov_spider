    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Pelosi (D) California and 259 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2712, because the blanket waiver of the foreign residence requirement for certain Chinese exchange students is both inappropriate and unnecessary at this time.
The Administration has already taken steps to ensure that nationals of the People's Republic of China are not deported against their will from the United States during a one-year period that began in June. Further, the immigration laws currently provide for the administrative waiver of the foreign residence requirement under appropriate circumstances. The Administration believes that this waiver authority should only be exercised on a case-by-case basis, and that the relief provided by H.R. 2712 is overly broad.
The Administration is continuing to monitor developments in China and intends to provide further immigration relief as circumstances warrant.
