    President Donald J. Trump appreciates the support from both the Senate Armed Services Committee and the full Senate for his nomination of General H.R. McMaster to continue to serve in the United States Army at the rank of Lieutenant General while also serving as his National Security Advisor. General McMaster's distinguished career has included multiple overseas tours in the service of our country, experiences that will be invaluable as he provides President Trump with advice on the many challenges facing the United States around the globe. The Senate's broad, bipartisan support for General McMaster affirms that he is the right person for this job.
