    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Helms (R) North Carolina and three others)
The Administration opposes S.J. Res. 82 because it would be counterproductive. On February 28, 1989, the President certified that Mexico, among others, has cooperated fully with the United States, or taken adequate steps on its own to control narcotics production, trafficking, and money laundering.
The Administration carefully and thoroughly reviewed all aspects of this certification. It was based on the conclusion that, on balance, our fight against drugs will be more effective if we do not interrupt or jeopardize joint U.S.-Mexico efforts. Mexico, under its new President, has and will be taking steps to further enhance drug enforcement. We are working with Mexico to assure that progress continues.
