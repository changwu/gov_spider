    IN ONLY 2 weeks time, unless there is affirmative action by the Congress, the Federal Election Commission will be stripped of most of its powers. We must not allow that to happen.
The Commission has become the chief instrument for achieving clean Federal elections. If it becomes an empty shell, public confidence in our political process will be further eroded and the door will be opened to abuses in the coming elections.
We can and we must reconstitute the Commission in the next 2 weeks. I am today submitting essential legislation to get that job done, and I urge the Congress to join with me in quick and effective action. There can be no retreat on an issue so fundamental to our democracy.
Thank you very much.
