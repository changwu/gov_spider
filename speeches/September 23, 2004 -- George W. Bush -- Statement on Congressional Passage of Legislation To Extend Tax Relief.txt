    The tax relief I worked with Congress to pass is putting more money into the hands of the American people and helping to grow our economy. As the economy strengthens, the last thing hard-working American families need is a tax increase. I commend the Members of Congress for acting to extend marriage penalty relief, the $1,000 child tax credit, and the broader 10-percent individual tax rateâ€”which would otherwise expire this year and raise taxes on nearly 94 million Americans. This legislation will give families and small businesses added certainty and keep us on the path to greater prosperity, and it brings us one step closer to making the tax relief permanent.
