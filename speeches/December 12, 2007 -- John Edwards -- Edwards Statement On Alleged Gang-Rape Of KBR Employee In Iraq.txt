    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement today concerning the allegation that an American woman was gang-raped by her Halliburton/KBR coworkers in Baghdad:
"These extremely troubling allegations point to the disgraceful lack of legal oversight over military contractors like Blackwater. This problem that has been aggravated by the Bush Administration's cozy relationship with contractors. I believe these disturbing allegations should be investigated swiftly and thoroughly by the Department of Justice. As president, I will put the Pentagon back in charge of security missions wherever possible, and I will restore legal jurisdiction over contractors so terrible crimes like those alleged will result in the severest penalties."
