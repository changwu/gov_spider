    Laura and I and the entire Bush family are saddened by Lloyd Bentsen's death. Lloyd Bentsen served in the House of Representatives for 6 years, and he represented the people of Texas in the United States Senate for 22 years. During his time in Congress, he was known for his integrity and for seeking bipartisan solutions to issues facing our Nation. He later became Secretary of the Treasury in President Clinton's administration.
As a young man, Lloyd Bentsen served our country in battle in the United States Army Air Forces, and he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. In 1999, in recognition of his lifetime of service to the United States, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civil award. Lloyd Bentsen was a man of great honor and distinction. We send our condolences and prayers to B.A. and the Bentsen family.
