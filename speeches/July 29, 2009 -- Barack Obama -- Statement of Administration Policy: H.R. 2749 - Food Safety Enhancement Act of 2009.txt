(House)
(Rep. Dingell, D-Michigan, and 5 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 2749, the Food Safety Enhancement Act of 2009. The legislation includes many of the recommendations of the President's Food Safety Working Group and focuses on key Administration goals by prioritizing prevention, strengthening surveillance and enforcement, and improving response and recovery. This bill addresses longstanding challenges in the food safety system and provides the Federal Government with the appropriate tools to accomplish its core food safety goals. The bill also would complement efforts that the Administration has already undertaken administratively to improve food safety and would, among other things, require all food facilities that operate within the U.S. or import food into the U.S. to register annually with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The legislation enables the FDA to implement further preventative measures by issuing new food safety regulations and increasing site inspections and also provides additional authorities to the Federal Government, improving its ability to engage in surveillance and enforcement and respond to food safety emergencies quickly. In addition, the legislation provides the FDA with mandatory recall authority and grants the FDA a new dedicated source of funding to help conduct its vital work of protecting the food supply. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on this legislation.
