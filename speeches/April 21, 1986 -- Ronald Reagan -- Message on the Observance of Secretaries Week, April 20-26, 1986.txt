    During Secretaries Week I am pleased to call on all Americans to join me in recognizing the vital role of secretaries in our society and economy. Skilled, professional secretaries are essential to the smooth, efficient functioning of business, government, and the professions.
One of the most important functions of any enterprise is communication, and secretaries—whether by scheduling, preparing correspondence, or working directly with the public—are among any organization's most important communicators. The efficiency and reputation of an organization are largely attributable to the skill, tact, dedication, and understanding of its secretaries.
Recent advances in technology present new challenges for secretaries, yet with each challenge comes a new opportunity. As America's secretaries master the new technologies, office efficiency will increase and secretaries will be freed from some tedious tasks to take on exciting and rewarding challenges. We should all keep in mind that much of the technological revolution that will keep our nation growing into the Twenty-first Century will be implemented by our nation's secretaries.
I am happy to call attention to the important role of secretaries in our national life and the widening opportunities opening up for them as we move into the future. Nancy joins me in saluting America's secretaries and in expressing the gratitude of our citizens for the great contribution they make to their country and its economic strength. They have our warmest good wishes.
