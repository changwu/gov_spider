    I welcome the opportunity to express my warmest greetings to Chinese the world over as they celebrate this New Year 4680, the year of the Dog.
Throughout America, we see the many important contributions which Americans of Chinese ancestry have made to the growth and development of this country. Their talent, vitality, and rich cultural heritage have helped forge our nation into one of the greatest in the history of mankind.
The New Year is a time for optimism and reconciliation, a time when we put behind us the quarrels of the past and work to achieve greater understanding of ourselves and those around us, both friend and foe alike. It is a time when we look to the future with a sense of pride in all the human race has accomplished and in all which we have before us.
Mrs. Reagan joins with me in extending our sincere best wishes to the Chinese American community for peace and prosperity and a very Happy New Year.
RONALD REAGAN
