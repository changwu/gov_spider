    I am pleased that the House has taken the vital step to ensure our Nation's security by passing the Defense authorization bill. The legislation will improve the quality of life for the men and women of our Armed Forces by providing the most significant pay raise in recent memory. Equally important, the bill strengthens the United States' ability to meet the security challenges ahead. I look forward to signing a strong bill into law.
