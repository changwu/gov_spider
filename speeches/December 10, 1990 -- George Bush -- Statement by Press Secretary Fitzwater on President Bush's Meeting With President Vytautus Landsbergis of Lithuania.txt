    President Bush met for one-half hour today in the Oval Office with Lithuanian President Vytautus Landsbergis and an accompanying delegation of officials from Lithuania. Landsbergis, who requested the meeting, is on a private visit to the United States. President Bush noted the value of personal contacts with the Baltic leaders, who have shown discipline and foresight in their commitment to a nonviolent solution to their problems with the Soviet Government.
President Bush reaffirmed United States policy pertaining to the Baltic States. He told President Landsbergis the United States supports the right of Lithuania and other Baltic States to self-determination. President Bush added that the United States has never recognized the forcible incorporation of the Baltic States into the U.S.S.R. and assured President Landsbergis that this policy would not change. President Bush indicated that he and other senior administration officials had made this point directly on more than one occasion to senior Soviet officials.
President Bush stressed that the United States wanted a peaceful solution to the problem between the Baltic States and the U.S.S.R. and hoped the Soviet Government would work constructively with Baltic leaders without resorting to threats, intimidation, or the use of force.
