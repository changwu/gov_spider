    Houston, TX â€“Former U.S. Representative Chris Bell today announced his endorsement of Hillary Clinton for President.
"It is no longer about being a great candidate - because of the many challenges we face, it's now about being a great president on day one," Bell said. "Hillary Clinton is the only candidate who has the experience, passion and vision to start turning our dreams of change into a reality on her first day in the oval office. She is also the only candidate who has faced the right-wing smear machine head on and lived to tell the tale. We need a battle tested nominee."
Bell, the Democratic nominee for governor of Texas in 2006, says he plans to appeal to his supporters throughout the state on behalf of Senator Clinton.
"Chris Bell has been a strong voice for Texans and I am so proud to have his support of my candidacy," Clinton said. "From the economy, to education, to health care, Congressman Bell knows it will take experience and strength to make change happen in the White House. I look forward to having his help in spreading our message across Texas."
Born in Abilene, Bell represented a Houston area U.S. House district from 2003 to 2005. He was also a member of the Houston City Council from 1997 to 2001. In the race for governor, he received over a million votes, trouncing two well funded independents and coming within nine percentage points of defeating the incumbent Republican.
Congressman Bell is a strong advocate for health care reform, public school education and a passionate supporter of stem cell research. He has long fought for issues important to Texans, including comprehensive immigration reform and improving transportation.
