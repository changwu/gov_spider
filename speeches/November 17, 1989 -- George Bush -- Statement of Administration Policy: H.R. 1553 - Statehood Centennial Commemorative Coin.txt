    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Williams (D) MT and 229 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 1553, which would require the issuance of coins to commemorate the centennial of the statehood of six northwestern States. The Administration recognizes the historical importance of the settlement of these States. However, Congress has already authorized two commemorative coin programs for 1990 (i.e., the bicentennial of Congress and the centennial of the birth of President Eisenhower). Another commemorative program would: (1) lessen the special nature of such coins; (2) likely result in lower sales and profits for each of the existing commemorative programs; and (3) be difficult to undertake given the coin production capabilities of Mint facilities.
