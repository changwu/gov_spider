    (SAN FRANCISCO, CA, January 27, 2020) — Today, presidential candidate Tom Steyer issued the following statement on the United States Supreme Court's ruling allowing the Trump administration to deny green cards to immigrants based on how much government assistance they would require:
"This ruling is un-American. Trump's immigration policies are racist and have been systematically deployed to hurt communities of color. The idea that green cards should be for sale to the highest bidder is morally bankrupt and goes against our values.
"We need a commander-in-chief who recognizes that immigrants are — and have always been our nation's strength — who will help our country heal from Trump's unjust policies, and who will empower immigrants of every background to build a life in our country. As president, I will make it my duty to not only undo his policies but also create a system that allows immigrants of every background a chance to build a life in our country."
