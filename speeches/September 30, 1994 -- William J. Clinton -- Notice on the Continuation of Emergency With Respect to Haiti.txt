    On October 4, 1991, by Executive Order No. 12775, President Bush declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the actions and policies of thede facto regime in Haiti, blocking all property and interests in property of thede facto regime and the Government of Haiti. President Bush took additional measures to prohibit trade and other transactions with Haiti by Executive Order No. 12779 of October 28, 1991, and to the same end I issued Executive Orders No. 12853 of June 30, 1993, No. 12872 of October 18, 1993, No. 12914 of May 7, 1994, No. 12917 of May 21, 1994, No. 12920 of June 10, 1994, and No. 12922 of June 21, 1994.
Because thede facto regime in Haiti has not yet fulfilled its commitments under the Governors Island Agreement of July 3, 1993, by relinquishing power, and therefore continues to obstruct the restoration of democracy in Haiti, the national emergency declared on October 4, 1991, and the measures adopted pursuant thereto to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond October 4, 1994. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to Haiti. This notice shall be published in theFederal Register and transmitted to the Congress.
