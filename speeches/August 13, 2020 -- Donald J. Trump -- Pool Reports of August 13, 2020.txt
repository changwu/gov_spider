"It was like love."

"I've kept us out of war."
"We're doing very well in the Middle East."
Q: Does he support annexation of Palestinian land?
"We're talking to Israel about that right now."
Q: What about snap back sanctions on Iran?
He compliments the questioner but does not answer.
Q: Asked why the deal happened now.
Trump quickly turned to how great it was that he withdrew from the "ridiculous" Iran nuclear agreement.
"Money hasn't been going to some horrible, horrible groups…. Because Iran isn't getting money."
"If I win the election, I will have a deal made with Iran within 30 days."
"They'd much rather negotiate with Sleepy Joe Biden than with us."
"Rightfully they're waiting until after the election because, there's nothing China, Iran, Russia, all of them, would like to see more than have Trump be defeated,, where they can deal with Joe Biden, because that would be like a dream."
The visit to the Oval was held to tout the new agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, which will bring full diplomatic relations between the two nations. He said he had just finished a conversation with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and UAE Mohammed bin Zayed.
He and his foreign policy leadership agreed this was a major accomplishment and will advance peace for Israel and isolating Iran.
"UAE is big stuff. UAE is very powerful, very strong, has one of the strongest militaries."
Said there would be a formal signing at the WH within a few weeks.
