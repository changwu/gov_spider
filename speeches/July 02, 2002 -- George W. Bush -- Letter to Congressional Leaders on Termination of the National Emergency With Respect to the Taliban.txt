    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Pursuant to section 202(a) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622, I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order that terminates the national emergency described and declared in Executive Order 13129 of July 4, 1999, related to the actions and policies of the Taliban, and amends Executive Order 13224 of September 23, 2001, to include reference to Mohammed Omar and the Taliban in the Annex to that order, thus preserving the sanctions imposed against the Taliban.
I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
