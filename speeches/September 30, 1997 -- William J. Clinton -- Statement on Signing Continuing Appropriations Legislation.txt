    I am pleased to have signed into law today House Joint Resolution 94, a short-term continuing resolution for fiscal 1998.
The Act provides 1998 appropriations for continuing projects and activities of the Federal Government through October 23, 1997, except those funded by the Military Construction Appropriations Act, 1998, which I signed into law earlier today.
On May 2, 1997, I reached agreement with the congressional leadership on an historic Bipartisan Budget Agreement that balances the budget while honoring our values. Over the next few months, my Administration worked closely with the leadership to translate the agreement into law. On August 5, I was proud to sign two key elements of the agreementâ€”the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the Taxpayers Relief Act of 1997. As the current fiscal year comes to a close, we must work together to enact the third element of the agreement, the appropriations bills for fiscal 1998.
But to date, in a number of important instances, the Congress has failed to address matters specifically called for under the agreement. In certain other instances, the Congress has addressed policy issues in ways that make the pending appropriations bills unacceptable. I urge the Congress to approve 1998 spending bills that include the items contained in the agreement and to provide funding for other priority programs.
To give the Congress time to adopt such bills, I have approved this continuing resolution.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
