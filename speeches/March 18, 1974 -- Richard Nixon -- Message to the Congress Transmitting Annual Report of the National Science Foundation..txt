    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to submit to the Congress the Twenty-Third Annual Report of the National Science Foundation.
The Nation today is faced with scientific and technological challenges and opportunities of unprecedented importance. As this report shows, the National Science Foundation is funding projects across a broad spectrum of scientific inquiry, from basic research to highly focused and sophisticated engineering techniques. Concurrently, National Science Foundation programs are encouraging the more rapid transfer of technological knowledge from the laboratories to the marketplace and are increasing the scientific and technical manpower base which the United States must have in the future.
I believe the annual report of the National Science Foundation merits the close attention of the Congress. It is a record of a very productive year.
