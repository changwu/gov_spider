    THE DEATH of Ambassador Llewellyn E. Thompson deprives the Nation--and, indeed, the entire world---of one of its wisest and most experienced counselors in statecraft.
He served a succession of Presidents with consummate skill in the arts of diplomacy.
I was particularly indebted to him when he came out of well-earned retirement to advise me personally, on the crucial SALT talks, and to participate in the early negotiating sessions as a member of the U.S. Delegation.
I deeply regret the passing of this great public servant, who contributed so much to the successes of American foreign policy over the past generation.
Mrs. Nixon and I join Ambassador Thompson's wife and children--and his many friends, colleagues, and admirers in Washington and around the world in mourning this grave loss to the Nation.
