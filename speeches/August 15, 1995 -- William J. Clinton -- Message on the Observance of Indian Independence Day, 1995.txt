    Greetings to all those celebrating Indian Independence Day.
Our two nations share a commitment to democracy and a reverence for freedom that has nurtured our warm friendship. India's ongoing economic transformation offers the people of India great hope for fulfilling their aspirations, and we stand beside them. The United States looks forward to realizing a full range of new personal, political, and economic ties with India in the future.
Please accept my best wishes for a joyous celebration and for peace, prosperity, and the continued blessings of liberty in the future.
BILL CLINTON
