    I have today signed S. 2727, the Amateur Sports Act of 1978.
The President's Commission on Olympic Sports reported that the frequent disputes between some of our amateur sports organizations have hindered the grassroots development of amateur sports as well as the performance of United States athletes in international and Olympic competition. This legislation, based on the recommendations of the President's Commission on Olympic Sports, establishes procedures and guidelines to resolve disputes without placing the Federal Government in control of amateur sports. The act designates the United States Olympic Committee as the coordinating body for amateur sports, restructures the Olympic Committee and many of its constituent organizations, and gives the Olympic Committee a mandate to resolve disputes through arbitration.
I hope that this legislation will strengthen United States participation in international amateur sports competition and broaden opportunities for all Americans to enjoy amateur sports.
