    On the final weekend before California's presidential primary election, Bernie and Jane Sanders made Sunday afternoon stops in neighborhoods across sunny Southern California. He walked through at the Historic Downtown Farmer's Market in LA. He spoke to the brunch crowd during a stop at Hamburg Mary's in West Hollywood. The afternoon schedule also included taking grandkids Ella and Dylan on amusement park rides at the Santa Monica Pier.
