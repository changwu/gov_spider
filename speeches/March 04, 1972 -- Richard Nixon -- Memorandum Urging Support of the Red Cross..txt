    Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
This March the Nation will once again observe Red Cross Month--a traditional time when the American National Red Cross seeks the support of every American citizen for its humanitarian services.
The historic record of mercy and service of the Red Cross needs no detailed explanation. Its efforts this past year have alleviated the suffering of disaster victims at home and abroad, trained hundreds of thousands to deal effectively in matters of health and safety, and through its blood donor program, saved the lives of untold numbers. These contributions are practical manifestations of the very best in the human spirit.
As President of the United States and Honorary Chairman of the American National Red Cross, I extend my warm personal support to its varied activities on behalf of mankind in need.
I know that all of you will join me in this support, and that you will take an affirmative lead in seeing that every Federal employee and every member of the Armed Services is made aware again of the many ways in which they can help the Red Cross stand fully equipped to help them. It is essential to the Nation that the Red Cross continue to receive that wide public support, both in funds and in manpower, that permits it to wage its creative attack.
Let us all respond generously.
RICHARD NIXON
