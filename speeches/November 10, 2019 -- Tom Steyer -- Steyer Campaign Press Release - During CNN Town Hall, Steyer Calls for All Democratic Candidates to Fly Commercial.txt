    (SAN FRANCISCO, November 10, 2019) — At his CNN Democratic Presidential Town Hall tonight, presidential candidate Tom Steyer called on all campaigns in the race for the Democratic nomination to join him in only flying commercial.
"I don't fly private. I hope nobody else running for the Democratic nomination will choose to fly private," Steyer stated during the town hall. "We're going to have to 'walk the walk' ... we're going to have a much better future together. And we're going to create something that we're going to be proud of for the rest of our lives."
As a way for all Democratic candidates to "walk the walk" on climate change, Steyer asked the campaigns to forgo private travel, as it emits far more carbon than flying commercial. As a candidate, Steyer has been committed to flying commercial — a clear statement of his values and his promise to the American people to tackle the climate crisis head on when elected president.
Steyer is the only candidate who would declare the climate crisis a national emergency on his first day as president and commit to using the emergency powers of the presidency to address the crisis. For a decade, Steyer has won big on climate in Nevada, Michigan, and California by mobilizing grassroots campaigns to beat big oil and gas companies to reduce carbon emissions and protect our air and water. He also started NextGen America to mobilize young people around the issue of climate change. His leadership on climate makes him best suited to present a bold and actionable path forward to take the climate crisis head-on.
