    Memorandum for the Attorney General 
Subject: Benefits for Survivors of Public Safety Officers
I hereby direct you to implement procedures to streamline the application, approval, and payment process for claims for benefits under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Act of 1976 by eligible survivors of firefighters, police officers, medical rescue personnel, and other public safety officers who died in the line of duty as a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.
I further direct that you work with Federal, State and local officials and deploy the resources of the relevant offices within the Department of Justice to provide immediate assistance to the survivors of those public safety officers who have sacrificed their lives for our communities and country.
GEORGE W. BUSH
