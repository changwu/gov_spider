    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to Section 8093 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1986, Public Law 99-190, I hereby certify with respect to the binary chemical munitions program that the United States:
(1) has submitted to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a force goal stating the requirements for modernization of the United States proportional share of the NATO chemical deterrent with binary munitions and said force goal has been adopted by the North Atlantic Council;
(2) has developed, in coordination with the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, a plan under which U.S. binary chemical munitions can be deployed under appropriate contingency plans to deter chemical weapons attacks against the United States and its allies; and
(3) has consulted with other member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on that plan.
I note with regard to the first numbered paragraph that the force goal was adopted by the North Atlantic Council constituted as the Defense Planning Committee in accordance with the North Atlantic Treaty. I am pleased to make this certification on a program so vital to our national defense. We are earnestly seeking, as our top priority in the chemical weapons area, a comprehensive and verifiable ban on all chemical weapons. Until we achieve that goal, we must maintain a safe and viable chemical weapon stockpile to deter use of chemicals by our potential adversaries. I appreciate your continued support for this program.
