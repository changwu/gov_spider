    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Dymally (D) California)
The Administration opposes the enactment of H.R. 2050, which would give the District of Columbia (D.C.) Board of Parole exclusive jurisdiction over the parole terms of prisoners convicted of violating D.C. laws or any U.S. laws applicable exclusively to D.C., regardless of the institution in which the prisoner is confined. H.R. 2050 is objectionable for the following reasons:
— This transfer of authority is premature in that: (1) the D.C. Parole Board has not yet demonstrated the clear capability to assume the additional responsibilities which would be imposed under H.R. 2050; (2) the effectiveness of recent parole guideline changes instituted by the D.C. Parole Board still needs to be evaluated; and (3) the Congressionally-established U.S. Sentencing Commission will be considering the parole jurisdiction questions addressed by this legislation.
— Prisoners in Federal institutions should be subject to the same parole conditions, and H.R. 2050 would add to the number of situations in which different parole standards are applied to such prisoners.
