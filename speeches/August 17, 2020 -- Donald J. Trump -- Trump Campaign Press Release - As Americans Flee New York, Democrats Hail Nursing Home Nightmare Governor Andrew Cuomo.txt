    Joe Biden praised Cuomo's virus response as the "gold standard." Victims of his nursing home policy would probably disagree.
Democrats are celebrating Governor Andrew Cuomo as a model of leadership, but he's no hero. Not only do nearly 270 people flee New York City every day, but his terrible response to the coronavirus was the worst in the country by far. 
More than 33,000 New Yorkers have died from the coronavirus, more than double the number of fatalities in New Jersey, the state ranked second in number of deaths. Cuomo refuses to take responsibility for forcing nursing homes to accept coronavirus patients, a reckless policy that may have killed thousands more elderly than Cuomo has officially acknowledged. He could have sent coronavirus patients to the Navy hospital ship or Javits Center temporary hospital that President Trump provided, but instead he sent them into nursing homes.
When questioned about his failure, Cuomo blamed nursing home staff. His administration is also covering up the true impact of his nursing home policy and refusing to provide all the data to lawmakers. The Associated Press has also been denied access "despite filing a public records request with the state health department nearly three months ago."
Cuomo's mismanagement in the early days of the pandemic made New York's situation far worse. Moreover, in part because Cuomo refused to consider President Trump's advice, infections spreading from New York at one point accounted for up to 65% of cases across the country.
Cuomo's fearmongering likely contributed to that as well. He claimed there would not be enough ventilators, spreading fear and causing rich New Yorkers to leave for other parts of the country.
Despite all of this, Joe Biden praised Andrew Cuomo on April 1, calling his coronavirus response the "gold standard." He has "done one hell of a job," Biden said. It was yet another display of Biden's poor judgement and penchant for false statements about the virus.
