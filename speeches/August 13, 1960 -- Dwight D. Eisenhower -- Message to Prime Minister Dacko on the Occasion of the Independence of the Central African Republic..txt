    Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
On the occasion of the independence of the Central African Republic, I extend in my own name and on behalf of the United States most cordial greetings and felicitations to you and the people of the Central African Republic.
The United States has followed with great interest the progress of the Central African Republic towards independence while carrying out the traditions of the late Barthelemy Boganda. That this independence is being reached in harmony and friendship with France is a source of great satisfaction.
On this memorable day, the Government and people of the United States look forward to close and friendly relations with the Government and people of the Central African Republic.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
