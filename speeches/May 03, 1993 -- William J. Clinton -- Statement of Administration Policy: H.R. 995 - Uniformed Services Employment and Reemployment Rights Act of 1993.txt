    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Montgomery (D) Mississippi and 15 others)
The Administration supports H.R. 995, as reported by the House Veterans' Affairs Committee. The Administration may seek certain improvements to the legislation as it continues through the legislative process.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 995 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary estimate is that the pay-as-you-go cost of H.R. 995 is zero.
