    IN THE FIRST 101 days of this unique national war effort we have brought nearly 400 transfusions of new opportunity to disadvantaged Americans in every part of this land. We have made a major and significant beginning to throttle want and elevate hope. We have changed what some have called the Government's war on poverty to truly every American's war on poverty. From every State in the Nation men and women have come forward to help in this effort.
