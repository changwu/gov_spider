    The President has accepted the resignation of Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Joseph Califano. The President will nominate Patricia Harris, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to be Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.
The President said, "Secretary Harris has established an admirable record of efficient and compassionate leadership at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. She has my full confidence and support as she begins to assume the responsibility for leading the department which more than any other directly touches the lives of those who must depend most upon government."
Secretary Harris and Secretary Califano have already discussed plans for an orderly transition. A successor to Secretary Harris at the Department of Housing and Urban Development will be named in the near future to ensure no interruption in the operations of that department.
