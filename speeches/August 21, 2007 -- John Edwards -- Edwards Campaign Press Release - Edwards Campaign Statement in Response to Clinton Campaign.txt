    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ John Edwards for President Communications Director Chris Kofinis released the following statement in response to a charge from Senator Clinton's Communications Director Howard Wolfson that the Edwards campaign was distorting Senator Clinton's position on Iraq.
"The issue of Iraq is one of the most important issues facing the country and the Clinton campaign knows that. The attempt to belittle these serious concerns by suggesting this is about poll numbers is insulting to the American people and the brave men and women who are waiting for a leader to come up with a real solution to end this war. Senator Edwards has a specific plan that will end this war, but after yesterday's speech, voters have a right to be confused about what Senator Clinton's plan for Iraq is. Does Senator Clinton support George Bush's surge or not? Does Senator Clinton have a specific timetable for withdrawing troops or not? Does Senator Clinton have a specific plan for ending the war in Iraq or not? The American people deserve specific answers, not more rhetoric, and surely not more personal Washington-style attacks."
