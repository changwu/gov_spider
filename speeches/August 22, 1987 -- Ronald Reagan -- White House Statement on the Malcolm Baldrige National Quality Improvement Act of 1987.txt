    The President has signed H.R. 812, the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Improvement Act of 1987, which establishes an awards program that will provide special recognition for companies demonstrating high achievement in improving the quality of their goods or services. Improved quality enhances productivity, lowers costs, and increases profitability. These components are essential to the well-being of the Nation's economy and its ability to compete effectively.
The President felt this award should be named for the late Secretary of Commerce, Malcolm Baldrige. As Secretary of Commerce and as a successful businessman, he practiced the kind of management the award will promote: close attention to the needs of the customer and emphasis on delivering quality products and services.
