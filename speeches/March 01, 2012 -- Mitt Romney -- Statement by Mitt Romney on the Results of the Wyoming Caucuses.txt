    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the results of the Wyoming caucuses:
"I want to thank the voters of Wyoming who took the time to participate in their state's caucuses, and who gave me their support.Â  It is a thrill to have taken first place in Wyoming. Our country is engaged in a great debate about its future direction. The voters here have spoken loudly and told the rest of the country that they want change, and they want a leader who understands that fixing the nation's economy, and ending Obama's runaway spending and borrowing, is priority number one."
