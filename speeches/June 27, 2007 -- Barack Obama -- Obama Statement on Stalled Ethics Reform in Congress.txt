    WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barack Obama, who proposed the most sweeping ethics reform in history last week, released the following statement about reports today that ethics and lobbying reform has stalled in Congress.
"These cynical partisan maneuverings on ethics reform are exactly what allows the lobbyists and special interests to stand in the way of progress on the issues that matter to the American people. This is why the oil industry continues to hold sway over energy policy and the drug industry has blocked reform that would lower prices for Americans. It is time for Congress to finally pass the strongest possible ethics reforms as soon as possible so that the voices of average Americans are heard in Washington once more."
