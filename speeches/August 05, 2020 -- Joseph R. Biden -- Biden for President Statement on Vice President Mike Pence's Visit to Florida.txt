    Today, as Vice President Mike Pence travels to Clearwater and Tampa in Florida, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield released the following statement:
"Floridians do not need another photo-op from Vice President Pence, especially with the risk of another visit that fails to meet public health guidelines to keep Floridians safe. The state continues to see some of the highest number of cases in the nation right now and that is in large part due to Donald Trump's failures. This pandemic has taken the lives of over 7,000 Floridians and Donald Trump's response this week: 'It is what it is.' The truth is President Trump has made the situation worse, whether it's been by suggesting Americans inject disinfectant or publicly admitting he asked his own administration to slow COVID-19 testing down to make him look better. Every step of the way, Vice President Pence has followed in lockstep as President Trump's number one cheerleader and defender. Floridians deserve real, presidential leadership - someone who has a plan to get us through this pandemic and beyond, someone who the American people can trust to be honest with them, and someone who will be a president for all Americans. They will get that in Joe Biden."
