    OF THE actual decisions reached at Geneva, the first to be put to practical test is the decision to renew talks on limitations of armaments.
Today, in New York City, the Subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Committee is meeting to continue these discussions, pursuant to a directive from the four heads of government issued at their final session at Geneva.
I sincerely trust that the Subcommittee meeting will be marked by the same spirit of frankness and cooperation which typified the meetings at Geneva. If this is so, then I am sure that the Subcommittee work, in the end, can produce practical results that should lead to an easing of the tensions and the heavy burdens of armament that the world is presently carrying.
