SUBJECT: Fiscal Year 1975 Budget Cuts
As I noted at the last Cabinet meeting, the suggestions which you and others have made for reducing 1975 spending are insufficient if we are to hold spending to $300 billion or below. I have asked Roy Ash and his staff to work with you and your staff in finding further reductions.
I recognize that this will be a very difficult task. There are few programs in which large cuts are desirable from the point of view of achieving agency missions. Nevertheless, under current economic conditions, it is essential that we present the Congress with a significant package of legislative and budgetary proposals that would allow us to reach our 1975 goal.
Time is short. We are well into the fiscal year. It is essential, therefore, that we complete work on our proposals so that I can send them to the Congress at an early date. I attach special urgency to this effort and look forward to your support and cooperation.
