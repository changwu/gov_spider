    Dear Mr. President:
On the occasion of the independence of the Republic of Gabon, I extend in my own name and on behalf of the United States most cordial greetings and felicitations to you and the people of the Republic of Gabon.
The United States has followed with great interest the progress of Gabon toward independence in harmony and friendship with France. It welcomes this historic event with deep satisfaction.
The close ties between our countries and the excellent climate Gabon has provided for United States and other Western investments constitute a favorable omen for the future of your country.
On this memorable occasion, the Government and people of the United States look forward to continued close and friendly relations with the Government and people of Gabon.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
