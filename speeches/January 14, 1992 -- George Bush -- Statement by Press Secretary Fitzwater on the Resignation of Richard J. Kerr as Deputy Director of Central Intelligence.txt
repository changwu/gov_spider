    President Bush accepted with regret today the resignation of Richard J. Kerr, who has served as Deputy Director of Central Intelligence since March 1989. Mr. Kerr will return to private life after serving 32 years as a professional intelligence officer. His resignation will become effective March 2, 1992.
Mr. Kerr has served the country and CIA with dedication and creativity for more than three decades. He played a critical role in the recent transition at CIA, serving with distinction as the Acting DCI, and he provided critical leadership at a time when CIA and the intelligence community were confronted with profound changes in the world. He was an important member of the intelligence team during Desert Shield and Desert Storm, for which he was awarded the Presidential Citizen's Medal. He also made an extraordinary contribution to the NSC Deputies Committee during his tenure as DDCI. The President has great respect for Dick and is grateful for his counsel and support throughout this administration.
