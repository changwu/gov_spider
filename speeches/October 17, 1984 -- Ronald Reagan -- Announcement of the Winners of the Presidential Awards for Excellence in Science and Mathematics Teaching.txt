    The President today announced the selection of 104 secondary school teachers to receive Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teaching. The first awards in the program were made in 1983 as a way of acknowledging the contribution of outstanding teachers and to provide models of excellence and encouragement to their colleagues and students.
The awards carry with them $5,000 grants from the National Science Foundation to the teachers' schools for use in science or mathematics instructional programs, and also stimulate additional support from participating private sector organizations. Teachers are selected by a group of professional teaching societies, coordinated by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and the National Science Teachers Association.
