    I am pleased that the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources has recognized the talents and capabilities of Dr. Joycelyn Elders. As Surgeon General, she will be an effective advocate for clinical and educational programs to address the fundamental health and social problems that affect all Americans. I am especially grateful to Chairman Kennedy for his steady leadership during the committee's consideration of Dr. Elders' nomination. I look forward to her speedy confirmation by the full Senate.
