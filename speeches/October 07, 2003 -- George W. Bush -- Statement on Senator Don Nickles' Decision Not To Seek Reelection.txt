    For more than two decades, Don Nickles has served the people of Oklahoma and America as a distinguished United States Senator. As a longtime member of the Senate leadership and most recently as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, he has led efforts to keep Government spending in check and to keep more money in the pockets of American taxpayers. He has left his mark on virtually every major issue that has moved through the Senate. Senator Nickles is a friend and trusted adviser, and I look forward to working with him for the remainder of his time in the Senate and in the future.
Laura and I extend our thanks and best wishes to Don, Linda, and their four children, Don, Jenny, Kim, and Robyn, for their commitment to public service, and we wish them all the best.
