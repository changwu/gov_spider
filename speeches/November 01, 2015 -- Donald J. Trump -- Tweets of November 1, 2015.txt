Gov. John Kasich has really failed on the campaign trail. I thought he would have been far more talented. He is just wasting time & money!Retweets: 1218Favorites: 2949

Jeb's new slogan - "Jeb can fix it". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word "fix" is not a good one to use in politics!Retweets: 2160Favorites: 3746

I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor!Retweets: 1304Favorites: 2805

Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a "lightweight".Retweets: 2003Favorites: 3788

If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered!Retweets: 1219Favorites: 2907
