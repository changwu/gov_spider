    First Lady Melania Trump visited Microsoft Innovation and Policy Center in Washington D.C. today. As part of her Be Best campaign, the First Lady met with students involved in Microsoft's Council for Digital Good. The council is comprised of 15 students from the United States who provide ideas and feedback for Microsoft's youth-focused online safety policy work. The students had designed art projects representing individual expressions of digital civility. Mrs. Trump viewed all of the projects and listened as the students shared their process for creating their pieces.
The First Lady also participated in a listening session held by the students, learning about the 15 tenets of responsible digital behavior established by the teen council.
"To see students taking action and being positive leaders in the digital world for youth is exactly what Be Best is focused on," said First Lady Melania Trump. "Peer-to-peer leadership can be one of the strongest influences on our children. Using their artistic talents, these students provide unique perspectives on how youth should conduct themselves responsibly online. Thank you to Microsoft for having me, and to the students of the council for sharing their impressive and encouraging work."
