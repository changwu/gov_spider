    Office of Management and Budget Director-designate Neera Tanden met with leaders in the small business community for a virtual discussion yesterday. The conversation focused on how the current economic downturn is impacting businesses and how to foster economic recovery, and the need to continue to support American businesses and workers through the COVID-19 public health and economic crisis.
Director-designate Tanden listened to the concerns of these leaders, including the challenges facing businesses and the need for an economy that works for everyone. They also discussed areas where the public and private sector can work together to ensure the country Builds Back Better, including with regard to infrastructure and tackling climate change, and how they can support building an equitable economy.
Director-designate Tanden also shared the importance of the Office of Management and Budget in this moment when the country is facing a historic economic downturn triggered by a global pandemic, particularly focusing on the need for a government that delivers effective, efficient results to help move the country and economy forward, and ensuring our nation's budgets and programs reflect our shared values of hard work, fairness, and respect.
Director-designate Tanden shared her personal background and experience growing up using social safety net programs while being raised by a single mom, and her experience putting bold, practical policy proposals into action that support working families, foster broad-based economic growth, and curb rampant inequality. She noted how those experiences have shaped her view of government, and positioned her to help President-elect Biden address the urgent economic and financial policy decisions facing the nation, including: the clear need for more stimulus to support workers and small business owners; the economic fallout for women and people of color; and women's exodus from the workforce.
