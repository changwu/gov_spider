    Today, I have signed into law H.R. 7010, the "Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020" (the "Act"). The Act provides greater flexibility to restaurants, hotels, and other small businesses to use Federal Government loans under the Paycheck Protection Program to pay for payroll, employee benefits, and other expenses while weathering the coronavirus outbreak. Because the Act is essential to protecting jobs as the Nation begins to reopen the economy, I have signed the Act into law without delay. Nevertheless, given the uncertain constitutionality of the Act in light of an unprecedented proxy voting system used by the House of Representatives that permitted Members to cast votes on behalf of, and record the presence of, other Members who were not actually present, I urge the Congress to pass the Act anew through traditional in-person voting at the earliest available opportunity.
