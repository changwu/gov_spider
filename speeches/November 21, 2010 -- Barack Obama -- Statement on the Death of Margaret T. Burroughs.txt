    Michelle and I are saddened by the passing of Dr. Margaret Burroughs, who was widely admired for her contributions to American culture as an esteemed artist, historian, educator, and mentor. In 1961, Dr. Burroughs founded the DuSable Museum of African American History on the South Side of Chicago, which served as a beacon of culture and a resource worldwide for African American history. She was also admired for her generosity and commitment to underserved communities through her children's books, art workshops, and community centers that both inspired and educated young people about African American culture.
Our thoughts and prayers go out to Dr. Burroughs's family and loved ones. Her legacy will live on in Chicago and around the world.
