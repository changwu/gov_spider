    Hillary and I are deeply saddened to learn of the death of Congressman Sidney Yates.
From his 2 years in the Navy during World War II to his more than four decades representing the people of Chicago and the North Shore in Congress, Sid Yates was always a fighterâ€”for his district, for the environment, and most notably, for the arts. He once said, "I've always wanted Washington to be the artistic capital of the country as well as the political capital." To that end he succeeded in getting Congress time and time again to finance the National Endowment for the Arts. In appreciation, Congressman Yates was honored in 1998 by the National Symphony Orchestra at a performance at the Kennedy Center. No public official battled harder or more successfully to support our Nation's cultural and artistic life than Sid Yates. In recognition of that effort, I had the pleasure of presenting him in 1993 with the Presidential Citizens Medal. After retiring from the House, he continued serving the public as a member of the council of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Everyone who knew Sid will miss his warmth, urbanity, and dedication to his country.
Our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, Addie, and to his family and friends.
