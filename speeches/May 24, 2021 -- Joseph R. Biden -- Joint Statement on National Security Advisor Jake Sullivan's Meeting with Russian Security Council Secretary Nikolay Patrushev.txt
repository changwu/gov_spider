    National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and the Secretary of the Russian Security Council Nikolay Patrushev held consultations on United States-Russia relations as part of regular Security Council contacts. The meeting was a logical continuation of the recent discussions held in Reykjavik between Secretary of State Blinken and Foreign Minister Lavrov.
The meeting was an important step in the preparation for a planned U.S.-Russia summit, the date and location of which will be announced later.
The discussions were held in a constructive manner and, despite outstanding differences, allowed for a better understanding of each other's positions.
A wide range of issues of mutual interest were discussed with a high priority given to the topic of strategic stability. The sides expressed confidence that mutually acceptable solutions could be found in a number of areas.
The sides agreed that a normalization of U.S.-Russian relations would be in the interest of both countries and contribute to global predictability and stability.
