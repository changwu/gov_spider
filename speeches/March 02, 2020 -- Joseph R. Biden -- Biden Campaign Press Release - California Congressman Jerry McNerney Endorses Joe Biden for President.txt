    Today, California Congressman Jerry McNerney released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President:
"As one of the only scientists serving in Congress the Trump Administration's refusal to accept basic facts is truly an abomination. Joe Biden recognizes that climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time and I know he has the experience, grit, and know-how to deliver real results in tackling this dire challenge and the many others facing our country. I know Joe Biden is best suited to unite our country and offer real comprehensive solutions to kitchen table issues like making healthcare more affordable, investing in education and creating good paying jobs -- issues that so many struggle with in my district and around the country. I'm proud to endorse Joe Biden for President."
McNerney was first elected to Congress in 2006 and serves on the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the United States House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.
McNerney's endorsement builds on the wide support for Joe Biden in California, which includes prominent leaders like Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steingberg, Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia, Los Angeles County Supervisor and former Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, Congressman Tony CÃ¡rdenas, Congressman Ami Bera, Congressman John Garamendi, Congressman Lou Correa, and more than 50 others.
Biden for President has announced more than 1,500 endorsements from national, state and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, and community leaders.
