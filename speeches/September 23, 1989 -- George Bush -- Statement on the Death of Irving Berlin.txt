    I was saddened to hear of the death of Irving Berlin. Very few composers have come to touch the soul of a nation, reflecting its spirit and traditions. Mr. Berlin ranks among such composers, having become a living legend in his own lifetime. His love of country and fellow man, so vividly demonstrated in his songs, were characteristics which we all admired and which will be part of his legacy. His songs, such as "God Bless America" and "White Christmas," have become woven into the very fabric of American society, touching the lives of generations of Americans. Barbara and I extend our sympathies to his family and join the American people in mourning the loss of this great American.
