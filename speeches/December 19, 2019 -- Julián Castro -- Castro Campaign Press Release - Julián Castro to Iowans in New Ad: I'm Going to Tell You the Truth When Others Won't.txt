    Castro campaign releases new ad in Iowa during presidential debate telling Iowans why he believes they should no longer hold first-in-the-nation status
SAN ANTONIO, TX (December 19, 2019) – On Thursday, December 19, surrounding the DNC's December presidential debate, the presidential campaign of former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for President Obama and Mayor of San Antonio, Texas, Julián Castro will release a new advertisement airing on broadcast stations across Iowa and on social media about telling voters the truth when other candidates won't. The ad's release comes after the most recent national poll showed Secretary Castro at four percent, ahead of Senator Amy Klobuchar, Senator Cory Booker, Andrew Yang, and trailing Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Mayor Michael Bloomberg by one percent.
The ad, which will air across broadcast stations in Iowa and on social media on the day of the debate, features footage from Secretary Castro's recent town hall on the Iowa caucuses, where he told Iowans why he believes Iowa and New Hampshire should no longer go first in the nominating process. Secretary Castro is the only candidate to publicly express support for changing the nominating schedule—citing the lack of diversity and low participation rate in the first two states.
During the debate on Thursday, Secretary Castro and supporters will highlight on social media issues that are left unaddressed by the candidates on stage, as well as Secretary Castro's leadership and positions on the issues that are debated.
Secretary Castro secured the grassroots donations required to make the debate, but did not secure the necessary polling. For the November debate, although Secretary Castro did not secure the necessary polling to secure his spot on stage, "Julian Castro" trended #14 in the nation and the campaign had a better fundraising day than the previous two debates.
