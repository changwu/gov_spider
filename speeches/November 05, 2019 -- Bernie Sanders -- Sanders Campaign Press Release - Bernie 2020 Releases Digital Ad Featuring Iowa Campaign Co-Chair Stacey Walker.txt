    New Digital Spot Follows Announcement of Stacey Walker as Speaker at Des Moines Climate Crisis Summit and Coralville Rally
DES MOINES -- Bernie 2020 on Tuesday released a new digital ad in Iowa highlighting Linn County Supervisor Stacey Walker's endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders.
"We were raised on food stamps and lived in Section 8 housing. We lived in a very precarious position â€¦ I was gonna have to work twice as hard, be twice as good, in order to get ahead in this world. And it shouldn't be that hard for folks," Walker says in the video. "I would say to young folks out there, folks who are disaffected and are cynical about their politics, right now is the opportunity to change it and we've got to be a part of this movement to usher in a new era of progress."
The video follows the announcement that Walker will join Sen. Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at the Des Moines Climate Crisis Summit and speak at their rally in Coralville on Saturday.
Walker, who was named as the first Bernie 2020 Iowa Co-Chair, has adopted a vigorous campaign schedule since endorsing Sen. Sanders. Walker spoke to over 1,300 Iowans at an Iowa City rally, hosted an education roundtable with National Campaign Co-Chair Sen. Nina Turner in Cedar Rapids and helped lead over 1,500 supporters in last Friday's March to End Corporate Greed.
