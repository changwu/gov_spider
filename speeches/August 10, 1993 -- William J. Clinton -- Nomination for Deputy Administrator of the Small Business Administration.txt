    The President today announced his intention to nominate small business entrepreneur Cassandra Pulley Robinson as Deputy Administrator at the Small Business Administration.
"As someone who has started a business herself, Cassandra Robinson understands the challenges new business people face. I am confident she will do an excellent job assisting Erskine Bowles at the head of SBA as we work to better opportunities for small and growing businesses," the President said.
