    YESTERDAY the producers of wheat, one of the many farm commodities, participated in an election without parallel in the world. In no other countries do wheat producers have the opportunity to vote on the kind of a program they will operate under. Wheat farmers in this instance voted for the right to produce whatever they desire in 1964, for whatever the market will pay, rather than for higher prices and limited production.
We accept this judgment and it is my sincere hope that this will prove to be a wise choice for wheat farmers and for the country.
