    Dear Mike:
I was extremely interested to learn about the admirable initiative undertaken by you and 30,000 other young people at the Miami Teen-age Rally for Decency held last Sunday.
This very positive approach which focused attention on a number of critical problems confronting society strengthens my belief that the younger generation is our greatest natural resource and therefore of tremendous hope for the future.
I hope that you will express my appreciation to everyone involved and my congratulations on the success of their efforts.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
