It's widely supported by the American people, business, labor, local elected officials, economists, and patient advocates The Inflation Reduction Act is bipartisan – everywhere but Capitol Hill. 
The Inflation Reduction Act will cut families' prescription drug, health care and energy costs, invest in our energy security, and reduce the deficit – paid for by asking the super wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.
