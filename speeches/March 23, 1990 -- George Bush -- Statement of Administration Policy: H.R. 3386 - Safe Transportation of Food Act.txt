    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Clinger (R) Pennsylvania and 59 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 3386. The Administration appreciates the public health concerns expressed by the sponsors of this legislation. The Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture already have sufficient authority and expertise to protect the public from food contamination. H.R. 3386 would assign food safety responsibilities to the Department of Transportation, which does not possess regulatory expertise in this area.
