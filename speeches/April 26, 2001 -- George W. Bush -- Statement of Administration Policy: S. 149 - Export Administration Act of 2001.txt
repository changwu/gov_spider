    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Sen. Enzi (R) WY)
The Administration supports S. 149, as reported by the Senate Banking Committee. The bill provides authority for controlling exports of dual-use goods and technologies. The Administration believes that S. 149 would allow the United States to successfully meet its national security and foreign policy objectives without impairing the ability of U.S. companies to compete effectively in the global marketplace. As reported, S. 149 includes a number of changes that the Administration sought to strengthen the President's national security and foreign policy authorities to control dual-use exports. The Administration will continue to work with Congress to ensure that our national security needs are incorporated into a rational export control system.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
S. 149 would affect receipts and direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimates is that the PAYGO effect of this bill is minimal. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
