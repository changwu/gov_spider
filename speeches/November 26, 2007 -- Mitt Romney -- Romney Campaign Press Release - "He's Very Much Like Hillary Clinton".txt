It's Hard To Differentiate Mayor Giuliani From Sen. Hillary Clinton:
Gov. Mitt Romney: Mayor Giuliani Is "Very Much Like Hillary Clinton." GOV. MITT ROMNEY: "I think he's found himself having to stand up and explain why it is that we ought to make him the nominee when he's very much like Hillary Clinton. He's pro-choice like Hillary Clinton. He's pro-gay civil union like Hillary Clinton. He's pro-sanctuary cities like she is, and the record of ethical conduct, particularly with someone like Bernie Kerik in the administration, reminds us of the Hillary Clinton era. So he's got some challenges, and I understand that." (Fox News Radio's "Brian And The Judge," 11/26/07)
