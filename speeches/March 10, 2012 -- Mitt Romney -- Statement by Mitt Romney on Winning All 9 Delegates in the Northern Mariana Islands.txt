    Mitt Romney made the following statement on winning all 9 delegates in the Northern Mariana Islands:
"The Northern Mariana Islands may be far away from the mainland, but one of the great things about our democracy is that every voice has a chance to be heard in selecting a presidential candidate. Now the voters of the Northern Mariana Islands—nearly 8,000 miles from Washington, D.C.—have spoken.  And what they've said today is that they want to bring change to their beautiful islands by bringing change to our nation's capital.  My son Matt told me about his visit to Saipan and the warm reception he received, and I am honored and delighted to have the support of all nine of the CNMI's delegates."
