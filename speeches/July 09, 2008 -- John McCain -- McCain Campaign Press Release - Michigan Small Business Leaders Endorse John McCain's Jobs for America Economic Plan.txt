    FARMINGTON HILLS, MI -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced its Michigan Small Business Leaders for McCain coalition chairs. Several small business owners across the state endorsed John McCain's economic plan today, joining business leaders across the country who have praised John McCain's jobs-first plan to grow the economy as president.
"In this struggling economy, John McCain's plan for lower taxes and less regulation shows his commitment to supporting small businesses, which are the driving force behind creating jobs," said Rocky Raczkowski, Chairman and CEO of Star Tickets, Inc. "Small business owners in Michigan will benefit greatly from John McCain's proven leadership and experience."
This coalition brings together a diverse group of business leaders, representing industries ranging from computer sciences to auto, entertainment and food.
Linda Jolicouer added, "With his Jobs for America economic plan, John McCain has offered real solutions to small business owners, whether they are a Democrat, Republican or Independent. He understands what he needs to do to help Americans hurting from high gasoline and food costs."
Tomorrow in Michigan, John McCain will meet with small business owners and hold a town hall to outline the cornerstones of his economic plan: immediate relief for American families, reforming Washington to regain the trust of taxpayers, pro-growth and pro-job creation tax policy, affordable health care for every American, energy security and ensuring America's economic preeminence in the global market place.
