    I want to thank Ken for his hard work and leadership on behalf of the American people. As the Secretary of the Interior, Ken has helped usher in a new era of conservation for our Nation's land, water, and wildlife.
Ken has played an integral role in my administration's successful efforts to expand responsible development of our Nation's domestic energy resources. In his work to promote renewable energy projects on our public lands and increase the development of oil and gas production, Ken has ensured that the Department's decisions are driven by the best science and promote the highest safety standards. Ken has also made historic strides in strengthening our nation-to-nation relationship with Indian Country, helping to resolve longstanding disputes and make tribal communities safer and stronger.
I have valued Ken's friendship since we both entered the Senate in 2005, and I look forward to receiving his counsel even after he returns to his home State of Colorado.
