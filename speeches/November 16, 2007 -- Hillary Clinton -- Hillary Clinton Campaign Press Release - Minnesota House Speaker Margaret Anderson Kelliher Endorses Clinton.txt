    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Minnesota House Speaker Margaret Anderson Kelliher.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to deliver the change this country needs," Speaker Anderson Kelliher said. "She is uniquely qualified to lead this nation from her first day in the White House, and set about tackling the challenges we face at home and abroad."
In her first year as Speaker of the Minnesota House, Anderson Kelliher passed into law the nation's leading renewable energy standard, requiring that 20% of the state's energy consumption be renewable by 2020. Speaker Anderson Kelliher also emphasized the connection between higher education and job creation and provided the largest funding boost to Minnesota's higher education system in years. In the aftermath of the tragic I35W bridge collapse, Anderson Kelliher has pressed for additional state and federal resources to rebuild and improve Minnesota's transportation infrastructure.
After growing up on a farm in southern Minnesota, Anderson Kelliher now represents an urban neighborhood and brings a unique perspective to Minnesota politics.
"I'm honored to have Margaret's support, and I'm delighted she'll help bring our message of change across Minnesota," Clinton said.
