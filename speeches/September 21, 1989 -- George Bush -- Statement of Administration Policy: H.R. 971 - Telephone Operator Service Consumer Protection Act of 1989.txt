    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Cooper (D) Tennessee and 33 others)
The Administration recognizes that H.R. 971 responds to a problem of concern to many consumers. The Administration believes, however, that the bill is unnecessary, in light of the FCC's existing statutory authority, as well as the regulatory actions that have been undertaken at both the Federal and State levels. Nonetheless, the Administration has no objection to enactment of H.R. 971.
