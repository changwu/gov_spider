"We are excited to welcome Ron Paul on the occasion of his first visit to Minnesota this campaign cycle," said Marianne Stebbins, the Ron Paul 2012 Presidential Campaign's Minnesota Chair.
"Dr. Paul's message of Constitutionally-limited government, sound money and a traditional Republican noninterventionist foreign policy is already resonating here. With this kickoff event we expect to further boost the campaign's visibility and our volunteer capacity," said Ms. Stebbins.
The kickoff event will be emceed by Twin Cities radio hosts Bob Davis and Tom Emmer. In addition to Dr. Paul's speech, campaign staff will familiarize volunteers with some aspects of the national campaign's plans to target Minnesota. Staff also will distribute campaign materials such as bumper stickers, yard signs and literature, and there will be live music amid a family-friendly atmosphere.
In the coming weeks, the Ron Paul 2012 Presidential Campaign will formally launch its Minnesota state operations with a new office in Minnetonka.
