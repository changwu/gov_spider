    The Central Intelligence Agency today held a memorial service at its headquarters for the seven Americans killed in eastern Afghanistan on December 30th. Family members and more than a thousand Agency officers gathered in attendance, along with guests including President Obama and senior officials from the Intelligence Community, the White House, and the Pentagon, as well as members of Congress.
President Obama spoke of the country's gratitude to the families. "Everything you instilled in them -- the virtues of service and decency and duty -- were on display that December day. That is what you gave them. That is what you gave to America. And our nation will be forever in your debt." He told CIA officers that their "seven heroes" were at the vanguard of a mission vital to national security. "Let their sacrifice be a summons. To carry on their work. To complete this mission. To win this war, and to keep our country safe."
CIA Director Leon E. Panetta paid tribute to the talent and accomplishments of the fallen, telling their loved ones that Agency officers "simply cannot do these jobs—we can't do these jobs—without the love and support of our families." He called the seven "genuine patriots" who "lived up to our highest principles," and pledged that CIA would strive to be worthy of them. Panetta added: "As they worked to protect lives, they sacrificed their own. For this, we honor them—now and always…We will carry this fight to the enemy. Our resolve is unbroken, our energy undiminished, and our dedication to each other and to our nation, unshakable."
