    The agreement reached today by NATO and Serbian military officials is another important step toward achieving our objectives in Kosovo. It lays out the details to meet the essential conditions for peace: the rapid, orderly withdrawal of all Serb forces from Kosovo and the deployment of an international security force, with NATO at its core, which means a unified NATO chain of command, so that Kosovars can return home safely. We and our Allies will watch carefully to see whether the Serb forces are peacefully leaving Kosovo in accordance with the agreed timetable. We have made clear to the leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army that we expect them not to hinder the Serb withdrawal.
