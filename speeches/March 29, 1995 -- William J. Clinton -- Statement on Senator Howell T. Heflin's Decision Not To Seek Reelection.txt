    I was sorry to learn of Senator Heflin's decision not to run for reelection. His strong voice, his solid belief in right and wrong and his sense of humor have helped the Nation confront some of our toughest issues head on, while his efforts in areas of education and race relations have changed the course of the country. Although we will miss his leadership here in Washington, I wish him all the best in Tuscumbia.
