Piers Morgan: As an African-American who rose from humble beginnings, what did you make of that column and how much do you believe you have the chance to win this nomination now? 
Sen Scott: Well, I certainly know I have the chance to win the nomination and I plan to be the nominee. I didn't read the story and I thank God that Mr. Galston spent some time talking about how any American, from any community can live the American dream. I believe America can do for anyone what she's done for me. And that's why I'm focusing on restoring hope, creating opportunities, and protecting the America that we all love, and Pierce, I gotta tell you, Mesha is a hundred percent right. It is time for us to understand and appreciate that the Democrats, the far left weaponizes, the issues of race and class to hold onto their power and vulnerable people continue to be underrepresented in their party. Lots of folks being elected, but the difference in the communities can be measured in progress. I look forward to presenting a solution that works for all of America, because all of America wants their kids going to a safe school, all of America wants their kids growing up in safe neighborhoods, all of America wants their grandparents not locked in their houses from the time the sun goes down until the time the sun goes up. We have the solution. In my administration, we'll make sure that streets are safer, kids have a chance because their parents have a choice. This is not just a GOP message, this is what we call in America, common sense.
