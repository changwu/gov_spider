For humanitarian reasons, the passengers from the two CoronaVirus stricken cruise ships have been given medical treatment and, when appropriate, allowed to disembark, under strict supervision. Very carefully done. People we're dying & no other countries would allow them to dock!Retweets: 16025Favorites: 78381

Thank you Gayle. I only wish the public could fully understand how corrupt & dishonest so much of our Lamestream Media is. My Press Conferences are vital. They are reaching millions of people that are not being told the truth, & haven't been for years (Witch-Hunts, Fake News)! https://t.co/DN4DDoHPtuRetweets: 19699Favorites: 72240

Advertising in the Failing New York Times is WAY down. Washington Post is not much better. I can't say whether this is because they are Fake News sources of information, to a level that few can understand, or the Virus is just plain beating them up. Fake News is bad for America!Retweets: 32090Favorites: 161870

Joe Biden wanted the date for the Democrat National Convention moved to a later time period. Now he wants a "Virtual" Convention, one where he doesn't have to show up. Gee, I wonder why? Also, what ever happened to that phone call he told the Fake News he wanted to make to me?Retweets: 35254Favorites: 173958
