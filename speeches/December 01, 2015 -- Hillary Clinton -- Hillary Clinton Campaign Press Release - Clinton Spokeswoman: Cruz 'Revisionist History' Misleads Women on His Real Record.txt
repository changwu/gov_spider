    In response to Ted Cruz's comments in Iowa attacking Hillary Clinton and misrepresenting Republican efforts – including his own – to undermine women's health care, Hillary for America spokeswoman Christina Reynolds released the following statement:
"Ted Cruz's colorful comments can't hide his revisionist history on the sustained Republican effort to restrict access to women's health care. He threatened to shut down the government to defund Planned Parenthood. He tried to roll back protections that prevent women from being fired for using contraception. He claimed that emergency birth control was an 'abortifacient,' which is both medically and scientifically incorrect. As Cruz tries to police women's health care decisions and deny a war on women, Hillary Clinton will fight every day to protect them against this seemingly endless Republican assault."
THE FACTS
The reality is that, for years, Ted Cruz has fought access to women's health care, including contraception – all while denigrating certain women's health services and falsely attacking Planned Parenthood:

Cruz voted to block legislation to "ensure that employers cannot interfere in their employees' birth control and other health care decisions."
Cruz maligned birth control as "abortifacients," which is both medically and scientifically incorrect.
Cruz said that Planned Parenthood "is not worthy of taxpayer funding," despite PPFA providing health care services to millions of women in disproportionately low-income communities, and claimed "women's health is not Planned Parenthood's top priority."
Cruz said we should prosecute Planned Parenthood.
Cruz supports a personhood amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which could ban some forms of birth control.
Cruz sought to unravel a Washington, D.C., law that "would prevent employers from taking action against workers based on their decision to use birth control or seek an abortion."
