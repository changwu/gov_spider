    The Lord loves righteousness and justice; The earth is full of his unfailing love.
Psalm 33:5
Yom Kippur is a day of holy reflection and reverence. Jewish tradition sets this day aside as a time to seek atonement, and to return, in forgiveness, to the enduring love of the Almighty. As you pray, may you place your trust in the promises of God, and look to the future with hope.
As we face the challenges of a new era, faith is an important source of strength and goodness in America. At this time of renewal, I encourage you to recommit to a life of compassion, love, and service. Together we can transform our Nation, one heart and one soul at a time.
Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a blessed day.
