    I applaud the Members of Congress for this overwhelming statement of support for the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act. By extending this vital program for 5 additional years, lawmakers of both parties are sending a message of support to thousands of Americans who are living with HIV or AIDS and to their families and friends who offer them love and support each and every day. In its first 5 years of existence, the Ryan White CARE Act has provided high-quality medical care and support services that help to extend the length and improve the quality of life for people living with HIV/AIDS. I have been proud of our recent success in increasing funding for this program by more than 110 percent in the last 3 years, including a $105 million increase in the recently enacted budget agreement for fiscal year 1996. I look forward to signing this bill and continuing this record of bipartisan support.
