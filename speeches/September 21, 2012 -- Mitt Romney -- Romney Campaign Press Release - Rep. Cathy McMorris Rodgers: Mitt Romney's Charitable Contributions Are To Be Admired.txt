    Washington Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers released the following statement on Mitt Romney's tax returns:Â 
"Governor Romney's tax returns show that not only has he been successful, he has also been incredibly generous. His millions of dollars in charitable contributions are to be admired. He has truly lived according to the Parable, 'to whomever much is given, of him will much be required.'"
