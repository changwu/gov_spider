Marco was asked Sunday morning on Face the Nation about Ted Cruz's unclear views on immigration.

He pointed out that it's not just immigration where Senator Cruz has told voters one thing and then done another:
There are multiple issues on which he's tried to do these sorts of things. For example, when the free trade agreement was up, he wrote an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, he wrote it with Paul Ryan. And just three days later, he flipped on it, after I don't know why — he got some pressure on the fast track authority. He's done it on votes on farm issues. In fact, changed his vote on the floor of the Senate.
So there is always some of that, because new facts are presented. But I think my concern is the voters: If you're going to attack someone on a policy issue, you need to be clear where you stand on the issue, and where you stood in the past. . . .
I think when you spend your whole time telling people you are a clear talker and you say what you mean, and everyone else is a sellout, but you're the only purist, I think it is fair to say hold on a second. Here is where you have been in the past on some issues, and here is where you are now. The truth is everyone running on the Republican side supports strong, conservative positions.
