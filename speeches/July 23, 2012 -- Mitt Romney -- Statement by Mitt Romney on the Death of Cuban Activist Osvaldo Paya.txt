    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on the death of Cuban activist Osvaldo Paya:
"The cause of freedom in Cuba has lost one of its strongest voices and respected leaders yesterday. The news of Osvaldo Paya's death is profoundly heartbreaking and infuriating. The circumstances surrounding Mr. Paya's death again raise questions about the pattern of conduct by a despotic regime that is constantly seeking ways to annihilate all internal dissent while the world stands in silence. The international community should demand that the facts concerning Paya's death be accurately determined and that the surviving witnesses be protected.  Ann and I wish to convey our deepest condolences to the Paya family and to Cuba's pro-democracy movement for the loss of Osvaldo Paya, a man of extraordinary courage, conviction, and peace."
