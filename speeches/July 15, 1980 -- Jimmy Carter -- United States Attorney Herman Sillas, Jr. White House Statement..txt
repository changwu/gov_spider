    The matter of Herman Sillas' continued service as United States attorney in Sacramento is now under review by the President's Counsel. The Counsel is proceeding to evaluate Department of Justice recommendations regarding Mr. Sillas' case and after full evaluation will make a recommendation to the President.
The primary concerns of the President's Counsel, since beginning his evaluation of the Sillas case, have been to protect the integrity and public reputation of the office of the United States attorney, while at the same time affording Mr. Sillas and his own legal counsel a fair opportunity to present his side of the matter. In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate for the White House to respond to Mr. Sillas' remarks at his press conference today.
