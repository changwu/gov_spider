    I would like to offer, on behalf of our Nation, my heartfelt thanks and appreciation for Jim Courter's important contributions in leading the 1991 and 1993 base realignment and closure reviews.
I am proud of the success of the Base Closure Commission during my administration. The base closure process has been nonpartisan, very effective, and continues to be of the highest importance to our efforts to reduce unnecessary base infrastructure in order to keep our military forces ready and strong.
While serving as Chair to the Commission, Mr. Courter recommended base closures and realignments which will enable the Federal Government to save billions of dollars over the next several years.
I am grateful for Jim Courter's tenacity, hard work, and commitment to building a stronger economy, and I wish him the very best in his new endeavors.
