    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the provisions of section 5305 of Title 5 of the United States Code, I hereby report on the pay adjustment I ordered for the Federal statutory pay systems in October 1980.
The Secretary of Labor, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, who serve jointly as my agent for Federal pay, found that an overall increase of 13.46 percent in General Schedule rates of pay would be appropriate if comparability with private enterprise salary rates for the same levels of work were to be achieved. The Advisory Committee on Federal Pay recommended that the findings of my agent be implemented.
After considering the findings of my agent and the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Federal Pay, I determined that economic conditions affecting the general welfare necessitated a lesser increase in accordance with the alternative plan provisions of section 5305 (c) of Title 5 of the United States Code. Accordingly, on August 29 I sent to the Congress an alternative plan which called for an increase of 9.1 percent at each grade, except that the full comparability increase would take effect to the extent that it did not increase a rate of pay to more than $9,069 per year. Neither House of Congress disapproved this alternative plan so on October 16, I signed Executive Order No. 12248 implementing it.
Under this Executive Order:
—The scheduled rates of pay under the General Schedule were increased by an overall 9.11 percentage in accordance with the alternative plan. (This is a correction of the overall percentage figure forwarded to Congress on August 29, 1980.)
—The scheduled rates of pay under the other statutory pay systems, the Foreign Service and the Department of Medicine and Surgery of the Veterans Administration, were increased by an overall 9.10 percentage in accordance with the alternative plan.
—The scheduled rates of pay for the Vice President and the Executive Schedule and Congressional and Judicial salaries were increased under the provisions of Public Law 94-82, based on the overall 9.11 percentage increase in the rates of pay under the General Schedule.
—The scheduled rates of pay for the Senior Executive Service were increased under the provisions of section 5382 of Title 5 of the United States Code based on the new rate of pay for CS-16, step 1, of the General Schedule and the new rate of pay for level IV of the Executive Schedule. (The rates included in this Order are a correction of the rates forwarded to Congress on August 29, 1980.)
—The scheduled rates of pay and allowances for members of the Uniformed Services were increased 11.7 percent in accordance with the provisions of section 801 of Public Law 96-342, approved September 8, 1980.
I am transmitting herewith copies of the reports of my Pay Agent and the Advisory Committee on Federal Pay, the alternative plan, and the Executive Order I promulgated to put this pay adjustment into effect. Also included is Executive Order 12249 which puts into effect a new Foreign Service Schedule authorized by section 403 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (Public Law 96-465, approved October 17, 1980), in accordance with the provisions of section 5305 of Title 5 of the United States Code.
