    "I congratulate the Iowa Office of Energy Independence for laying out a bold and innovative blueprint to make Iowa energy independent by 2025.
By setting ambitious goals alongside achievable milestones, this report shows how Iowa and our country can create a new 21st century green economy and millions of new jobs while preserving our environment. Iowa is already on the cutting edge of this transformation. With the most ethanol capacity in the country and the third largest wind power capacity, Iowa has a strong start and a great opportunity to continue as a national and global clean energy leader.
"For the past seven years, the Bush Administration has abandoned Iowa and other states that are ready to move forward on energy independence. I believe we need a new beginning on energy and global climate change. As President, I would work hand-in-hand with Iowa and other states to tackle energy independence and global warming. I have outlined a comprehensive plan to reduce our dependence on foreign oil by 2/3, cut greenhouse gas emissions 80% by 2050, and create at least 5 million new green collar jobs. And as President I will work with the states to get it done."
