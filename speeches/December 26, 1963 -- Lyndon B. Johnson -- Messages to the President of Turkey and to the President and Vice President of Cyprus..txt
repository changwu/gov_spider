    Dear General Gursel:
I have received your telegram dated December 25 on the tragic events occurring in Cyprus. I, too, am deeply concerned, and have sent the following message to President Makarios and Vice President Kutchuk. This message, I assure you, represents my heartfelt feelings.
You may be sure that I will continue to do everything I can to support any and all actions proposed by the three guarantor powers which offer any reasonable hope of assisting in a peaceful solution.
Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[General Cereal Gursel, President of the Republic of Turkey ]
Dear Friends:
My Christmas holiday hours, and those of my fellow Americans, are saddened by the thought that Cypriots of both communities whose hands I have pressed less than eighteen months ago are killing and wounding one another. I will not presume to judge the root causes, or rights and wrongs as between Cypriots of the two communities. This is, in any case, inappropriate when innocent human lives are at stake.
I cannot believe that you and your fellow Cypriots will spare any efforts, any sacrifice, to end this terrible fraternal strife. I hope and trust that tomorrow will find all Cypriots living at peace with one another and with the three nations which have special treaty responsibilities for the security of Cyprus.
Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Archbishop Makarios, President of the Republic of Cyprus; Dr. Fazil Kutchuk, Vice President of the Republic of Cyprus]
