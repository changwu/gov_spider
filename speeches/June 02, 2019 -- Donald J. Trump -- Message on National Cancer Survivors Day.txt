    On National Cancer Survivors Day, we honor the remarkable Americans who have survived cancer. As we continue working toward a cure for this horrible disease, we are encouraged and inspired by the courageous spirit of survivors throughout our Nation and around the world.
The more than 32 million cancer survivors worldwide—including nearly 17 million in the United States—stand as a testament to the outstanding work of our Nation's dedicated health care professionals and researchers to improve the prevention and treatment of all cancers. Because of their tireless efforts, deaths from cancer continue to decline for both men and women.
With more than 15,000 children and adolescents diagnosed with pediatric cancer each year, we must continue our efforts to increase the survival rate for these brave young people and to give them hope for a better quality of life post cancer. Last year, I signed into law the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research (STAR) Act of 2018, to help give our Nation's children, adolescents, and young adults with cancer every advantage possible as they battle the disease. This legislation will advance critical research on childhood cancers and effective treatments, better identify and track pediatric cancer rates, and support survivors.
Additionally, as I announced in my 2019 State of the Union address, I am working with Congress to invest $500 million over the next decade to give our Nation's researchers and doctors expanded opportunities to comprehend fully the unique causes and the best cures for childhood cancer.
As we observe this National Cancer Survivors Day, we recognize the incredible strength and resolve of the millions of Americans who have overcome tremendous challenges while facing cancer. Melania and I continue to keep all those living with this disease in our hearts and prayers.
