    On August 24, 2006, President Bush directed Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne to identify major goals and signature programs throughout America's National Park System that should be accomplished by 2016.
Today, Secretary Kempthorne delivered a report that will strengthen the President's National Parks Centennial Initiative and help ensure that National Parks remain a vital part of the fabric of our country. The President looks forward to reviewing Secretary Kempthorne's recommendations for enhancing family experiences in parks through interactive interpretive programs, improving visitor services, restoring historic and cultural sites for public enjoyment, and engaging Americans in preserving their heritage through volunteerism and philanthropy. He is confident that this vision will continue to put America's National Parks on track for another century of conservation, preservation, and enjoyment.
