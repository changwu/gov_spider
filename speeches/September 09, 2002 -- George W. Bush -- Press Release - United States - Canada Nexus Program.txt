    The NEXUS alternative inspection program allows pre-screened, low-risk travelers to be processed with little or no delay by United States and Canadian border officials. Approved applicants are issued photo-identification and a proximity card. Participants cross the border in a dedicated lane, where they present their membership identification and proximity card, and make a declaration. They are then released, unless chosen for a selective or random secondary referral.
The U.S. Customs Service (USCS), the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (USINS), the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA), and Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) are cooperating in this venture to simplify border crossings for pre-approved, low-risk travelers.
WHO QUALIFIES FOR NEXUS?
Individuals may qualify to participate in NEXUS if they are a citizen or permanent resident of the United States or Canada, or are a non-permanent resident who can demonstrate a need to use the NEXUS lanes. However, individuals may not qualify if they:
 

Are inadmissible to the United States or Canada under applicable immigration laws;
Provide false or incomplete information on their application;
Have been convicted of a criminal offense in any country for which they have not received a pardon;
Have been found in violation of customs or immigration law; or
Fail to meet other requirements of the NEXUS program.

To participate, an individual's application must be approved by both the United States and Canada. If an individual does not meet the requirements of the program, their application will be denied.
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF NEXUS?
Individuals approved to participate in NEXUS receive an identification card to use at the border that will allows them to:
 

Use NEXUS-dedicated lanes in the United States and Canada; and
Cross the border without routine customs and immigration questioning.

Because NEXUS is a harmonized program, applicants complete a single application form.
NEXUS also allows United States and Canadian Customs and Immigration officials to concentrate their efforts on potentially higher-risk travelers and goods, which helps to ensure security and integrity at our borders.
