    Once called "America's tuning fork," Pete Seeger believed deeply in the power of song. But more importantly, he believed in the power of community to stand up for what's right, speak out against what's wrong, and move this country closer to the America he knew we could be. Over the years, Pete used his voice, and his "hammer," to strike blows for workers' rights and civil rights, world peace, and environmental conservation. And he always invited us to sing along.
For reminding us where we come from and showing us where we need to go, we will always be grateful to Pete Seeger. Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to Pete's family and all those who loved him.
