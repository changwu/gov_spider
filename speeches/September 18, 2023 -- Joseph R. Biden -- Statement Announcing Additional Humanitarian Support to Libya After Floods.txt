    Today—as the people of eastern Libya continue to recover and rebuild in the aftermath of catastrophic flooding— the United States will provide an additional $11 million to local and international organizations responding to their urgent humanitarian needs. The Department of State and USAID will help coordinate the delivery of this aid to the people who need it most, joining the concerted efforts of nations and non-profits around the world providing critical support such as water, food, shelter, and medical assistance. And—as the United States continues to stand with the Libyan people during this difficult hour—we remain committed to supporting a political path toward a unified, freely and fairly elected government in Libya that can effectively respond to its people's needs.
