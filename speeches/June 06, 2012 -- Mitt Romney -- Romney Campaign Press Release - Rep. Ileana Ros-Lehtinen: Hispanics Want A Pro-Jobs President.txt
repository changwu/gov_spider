    Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen today made the following statement on how President Obama's policies have been hostile to job creators:
"From higher unemployment to higher levels of child poverty, and everything in between, Hispanics have been hit particularly hard by President Obama's failure to turn the economy around. For many young adults in the Hispanic community, the unemployment rate is unacceptably high. In America, a land of promise and opportunity, this is heartbreaking and unacceptable. Mitt Romney has a plan to get our country back to work. Like all Americans, the Hispanic community wants a President who will help job creators not hinder them. In November, by electing Mitt Romney, we can choose a different path and begin the work of restoring America's promise."
