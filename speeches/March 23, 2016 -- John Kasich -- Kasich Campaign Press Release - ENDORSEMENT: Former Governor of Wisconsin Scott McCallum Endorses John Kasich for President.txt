    Today, Scott McCallum endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich for president and joined the Kasich for America leadership team in Wisconsin.
"Governor Kasich doesn't just talk about pro-growth solutionsâ€” he has put them into action," said McCallum. "As chairman of the House Budget Committee, Kasich led the successful effort to balance our country's budget and as Governor of Ohio he cut spending and lowered taxes to expand his state's economy. To see those results nationwide, we need to send him to the White House."

McCallum served as Wisconsin's 43rd governor from 2001-2003.
"I am grateful for Governor McCallum's endorsement," said Kasich. "Like my dad, his father was also a letter carrier who rose from humble beginnings to provide for his family and teach his son the value of a hard day's work. With Scott's help, I look forward to continuing our efforts to share a positive, commonsense message across the great state of Wisconsin."
