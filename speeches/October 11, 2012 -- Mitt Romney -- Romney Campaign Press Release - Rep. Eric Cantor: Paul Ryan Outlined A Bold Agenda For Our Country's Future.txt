    House Majority Leader Eric Cantor made the following statement on tonight's vice-presidential debate:
"Congressman Ryan laid out a clear path for real recovery tonight. Instead of settling for four more years of the same — a stagnant economy, rising taxes and debt, and more Americans trapped in government dependency — voters can choose a path based on job creation and opportunity for all. Congressman Ryan clearly won this debate by outlining a vision for economic prosperity and a bold agenda for our country's future. Voters have a big choice in November, and their choice was made even easier tonight."
