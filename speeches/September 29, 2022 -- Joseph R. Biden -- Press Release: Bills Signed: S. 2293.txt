    On Thursday, September 29, 2022, the President signed into law:
S. 2293, the "Civilian Reservist Emergency Workforce Act of 2021" or the "CREW Act," which grants employment protections under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act to Federal Emergency Management Agency reservists who deploy to major disaster sites.
