    Spot highlights Delaney's grandfather, who was detained upon arriving in the US in 1923
WASHINGTON â€“ Congressman John K. Delaney (MD-6), the first declared Democratic candidate for President, will air a new ad Thursday that shares his grandfather's immigration story and calls for a spirit of "shared humanity." The spot, titled "A Shared Humanity" will air during MSNBC's Morning Joe in the D.C. market on Thursday and will run in the Des Moines and Cedar Rapids markets in Iowa starting next week. The several hundred-thousand dollar buy for this ad is the first of a multi-ad, summer-long Iowa television buy. This will be Delaney's sixth television ad to air in Iowa since February.
The ad can be viewed online here, transcript below.
The ad's script:
Delaney:
One of my grandfathers came to this country when he was a little boy in 1923
with his brothers and sisters,
but he's detained
because he has one arm.
His family got an appeal and the judge walks in
and my grandfather saw that the judge had one arm,
and he used to tell this story around the Thanksgiving table,
"That's when I knew I would be an American."
Voice over:
95 years ago an act of shared humanity kept a family together.
If it seems like we've lost that lately,
maybe it's time to get it back.
