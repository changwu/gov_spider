    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Jones (D) North Carolina and 20 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 897 because it sets inflexible and extremely detailed limits on the size and mix of the NOAA researchâ€™vessel fleet. Funding for the fleet is provided in the President's Budget at levels that more realistically meet anticipated modernization requirements, while recognizing budgetary constraints. In addition, foreign governments may consider the bill's Buy American requirement a violation of U.S. obligations under the international Agreement on Government Procurement.
