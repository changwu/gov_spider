In my Environmental Message of August 2, 1979, I recognized that integrated pest management (IPM) has both economic and environmental benefits and should be encouraged in both research and operational programs of federal agencies. Therefore, I am directing that each of your agencies:
• Modify as soon as possible your existing pest management, research, control, education, and assistance programs to support and adopt IPM strategies wherever practicable within the limits of existing resources.
• Review your pest management research, control, education, and assistance programs to assess the potential for increased emphasis on integrated pest management.
• Report actions taken to implement IPM strategies and the results of this review and assessment to the IPM coordinating committee in six months.
I am establishing an interagency IPM Coordinating Committee to assure implementation of this directive and to oversee further development and implementation of integrated pest management practices. The Committee shall be chaired by the Council on Environmental Quality. Your agency should appoint one representative to serve on this Committee who is an Assistant Secretary, Assistant Administrator, or the equivalent. The Committee is to report to me by June 30, 1980 on progress made by federal agencies in the advancement of IPM and on any institutional barriers thereto.
The Committee may request any Executive agency to furnish such information, advice, and service as may be useful for the fulfillment of the Committee's functions. Each of your agencies shall cooperate with and furnish support to the Committee as needed to carry out its functions.
Please give these assignments your immediate attention.
