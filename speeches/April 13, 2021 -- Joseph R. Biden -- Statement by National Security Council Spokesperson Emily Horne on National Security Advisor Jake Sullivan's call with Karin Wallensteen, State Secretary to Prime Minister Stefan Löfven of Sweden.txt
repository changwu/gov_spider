    National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke by phone today with Karin Wallensteen, State Secretary to Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven of Sweden. Mr. Sullivan expressed the Biden Administration's appreciation for the strong relationship between the United States and the Kingdom of Sweden, and he underscored the desire to further strengthen transatlantic ties. He thanked Ms. Wallensteen for Sweden's leadership as Chairperson-in-Office of the OSCE. The two discussed their shared concerns over Russia's sudden military build-up and provocations in occupied Crimea and on Ukraine's borders. They discussed the critical role the OSCE is playing in conflict resolution efforts in Donbas, offering support for increased monitoring and reporting in response to Russia's destabilizing moves. They agreed to work together on addressing the climate crisis, promoting democracy, and coordinating on shared foreign policy priorities, including achieving a ceasefire in Yemen and easing the human suffering there. Mr. Sullivan lauded Sweden's actions to protect its critical communications infrastructure and its strong stance on China human rights abuses.
