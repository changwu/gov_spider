Looked into the eyes of the spouses, of the parents, who lost their loved ones. Looking into the eye of young Americans who held their hand up and said, "Here am I, send me." Who have come home and who feel like they have been left behind. Because we have agencies of government, the VA in particular, that is not serving them well. They need a champion in the White House. They need a champion that goes to the Oval Office every day to defend their sacrifices—to deliver to them the services that we promised. And we're failing them today."
