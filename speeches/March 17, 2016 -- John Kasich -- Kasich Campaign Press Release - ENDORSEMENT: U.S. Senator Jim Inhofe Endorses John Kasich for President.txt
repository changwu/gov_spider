    Today U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK) announced his support for Gov. John Kasich's presidential campaign.
Said Inhofe, "Out of the three still in the race for president, John is my guy. I served with John in Congress when he successfully spearheaded the effort to balance the federal budget and, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, helped President Reagan enact his national security agenda. During this time, I also attended a weekly Bible study with him for eight years. You learn a lot about a person when you attend a Bible study together, so I can tell you personally that he is a man of his word. When he talked, people listened. Now the country is listening to his message of optimism and results. That's refreshing. I'm proud to stand by his side as we spread this message to voters in the weeks ahead."

Inhofe is an Army veteran and avid pilot who serves as Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and Senior Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Several publications, including National Journalmagazine and Human Events, have ranked Inhofe among the Senate's most outstanding conservative members. Prior to his election to the Senate in 1994, Inhofe represented Oklahoma's 1st Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives.
"It is an incredible honor to receive the support of my friend and former colleague, Senator Jim Inhofe," said Kasich. "Jim is a role model to several generations of conservatives, and I trust his expertise and judgment implicitly. He knows Oklahoma voters better than just about anyone, so it's a major win to have him in our corner going forward."
