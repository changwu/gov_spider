    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to send you the annual report of the National Science Foundation for Fiscal Year 1987. This report describes research supported by the Foundation in the mathematical, physical, biological, social, behavioral, and computer sciences; engineering; and education in those fields. Achievements such as those described in this report are the basis for much of our Nation's strengthâ€”its economic growth, national security, and the overall well-being of our people.
The National Science Foundation has been and will remain a key part of the national effort to expand our research achievements and productivity and to remain competitive in world markets through innovation and new discoveries.
I commend the Foundation's work to you.
RONALD REAGAN
