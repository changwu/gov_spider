In-town pool report #1: Good morning
Greetings from the White House on a rather gray day. As you know from the overnight guidance, POTUS is scheduled to depart the White House at 18:10 for Georgia.
The guidance is otherwise rather vague on other events today. Pool will endeavour to keep you posted as the day progresses. There is currently nothing to add to reports that Devin Nunes is to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom today other than to say, for planning purposes, keep an eye out for statements later this morning.

Out-of-town pool report #4: Color from the rally
From the press vantage point, it was hard to get a sense of the crowd size. But there were lots of red MAGA hats in the crowd, which at one point broke out into a chant of "Fight for Trump!"
Some in the crowd wore face masks. Others did not.
Behind POTUS as he spoke were a couple of Jumbotrons with the message: "Save The Senate & Save America!" In the background, a couple of American flags were suspended from giant cranes and flew above the crowd.
The crowd booed when Trump mentioned Stacey Abrams and Democratic Senate candidate Jon Ossoff. A loud cheer arose when Trump said he'd be back in Georgia to campaign against Gov. Brian Kemp "and your crazy secretary of state."
"Please win tomorrow," Trump said when referring to Sen. Kelly Loeffler.
If Democrats prevail in tomorrow's Senate runoffs, "there will never be another fair election," Trump said.
"This could be the most important vote you ever cast in your life," he said.
Trump complained about the Supreme Court, which he said is "not stepping up to the plate" and "has let us down." He claimed he got "badly screwed" in the November election and warned, "You can't let that happen again."
