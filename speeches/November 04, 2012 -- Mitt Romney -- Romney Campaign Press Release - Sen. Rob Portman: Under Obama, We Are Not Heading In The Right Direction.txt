Instead of being 7.9%, it's 10% or more, and, you know, here in Ohio it's a little lower than that. But when you add the folks back in who left looking for work, it's almost 10% too. So it's not going well here." â€” Sen. Rob Portman

SENATOR ROB PORTMAN: "Look, Ohio's economy is not doing well. People don't feel like it's doing well. Our wrong track numbers, which is something that's polled constantly, are as bad as the rest of the country. I think the jobs numbers last week were really disappointing. I heard Rahm Emanuel bragging on them too. But it showed the unemployment number going up, not down. In fact, unemployment is higher today than it was when President Obama was sworn in and the real number is even worse, because, as you know, a lot of people have left the workplace. Instead of being 7.9%, it's 10% or more, and, you know, here in Ohio it's a little lower than that. But when you add the folks back in who left looking for work, it's almost 10% too. So it's not going well here. I just got done with five events all around the state. In the last month, I have been at about 20 of these events where I go and talk to folks about what's going on, and what they tell me is look at these empty storefronts, look at these factories that aren't at capacity. We've got serious headwinds from Washington. It's not working."
