    John Bridgeland has been a valuable advisor to me for nearly 4 years. He started on the policy staff of my Presidential campaign in early 2000. Since January 20, 2001, he has faithfully served in my administration, first as Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and Director of the Domestic Policy Council and then as Assistant to the President and the first Director of the USA Freedom Corps Office. He has worked tirelessly to strengthen a culture of service in America and to ensure that we all love our neighbors as we want to be loved ourselves. His work has had a positive and vitally important impact on government, nonprofit and community service organizations, businesses, and many men, women, and children who need a helping hand. I appreciate and thank John for his friendship and wise counsel. This good man has touched many people through his dedicated public service, and I wish him, Maureen, and their three children all the best.
