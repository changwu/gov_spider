    WASHINGTON â€“ Today, President Barack Obama designated Austan Goolsbee as the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA).
Goolsbee, a long time economic advisor to President Obama, is currently a member of the Council of Economic Advisers and Chief Economist of the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board.
President Obama said, "Austan has been one of my good friends and close economic advisors for many years. He is one of the finest economists in the country, and he's worked as a member of the Council of Economic Advisers since we arrived in office. He's not just a brilliant economist, he's someone who has a deep appreciation of how the economy affects everyday people, and he talks about it in a way that's easily understood. He already knows and works with the rest of the team very well, and I have complete confidence he'll do an outstanding job as CEA Chair."
Goolsbee replaces Dr. Christina Romer as Chair, who last week returned to her teaching career at the University of California at Berkeley. Goolsbee was previously confirmed by the United States Senate as a member of the CEA and will not need to be reconfirmed by the Senate.
