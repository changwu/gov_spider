    
To build the most innovation-friendly economy in the world, we must build the most business-friendly economy in the world. Right now we have the exact opposite. The United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. We have a tax code that punishes American companies for competing in the global economy, and a regulatory system that prevents small businesses — the primary engines of innovation and job creation — from competing against established players.
Marco has a 100 percent rating with both the National Federation of Independent Business and the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council.
How:

Reverse the damage President Obama has done by repealing his unconstitutional and illegal executive orders that are hurting job creation.
Enact pro-growth, pro-family tax reform that cuts taxes for all businesses to 25 percent and allows all businesses to immediately expense every dollar that they invest in the economy.
Resist calls to enact a European-style Value-Added Tax (VAT) and new taxes on the Internet.
Put a ceiling on the amount U.S. regulations can cost our economy, allowing businesses to grow without interference from Washington.
Modernize higher education to equip workers with the skills they need in the 21st century.
Fully utilize our energy resources and embrace the 21st century energy economy.
