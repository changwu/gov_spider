    I am pleased to announce the return of Governors Island to the people of New York. Last April, I informed the Governor and the mayor of my intention to make this transfer, and today, the transfer is complete. Also, I am reaffirming our support for the Governors Island National Monument, which now will encompass approximately 22 of the Island's 172 acres, including historic Castle Williams and Fort Jay.
Governor Pataki and Mayor Bloomberg have shared with me their vision of a Governors Island dedicated to public and civic purposes. New York's stewardship of the island combined with the National Park Service's management of the monument will lead to the development of an outstanding resource for the people of New York and all who visit.
I commend the parties that worked together to make this historic transfer a reality, including the National Park Service, the General Services Administration, the United States Coast Guard, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and especially the State and City of New York.
