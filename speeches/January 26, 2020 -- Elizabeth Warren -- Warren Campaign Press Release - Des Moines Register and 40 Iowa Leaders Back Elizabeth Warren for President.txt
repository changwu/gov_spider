    Fresh Off Des Moines Register Endorsement, More than 40 Iowa Leaders Back Elizabeth Warren for President
West Des Moines, Iowa—The Iowa for Warren campaign today announced endorsements from more than 40 Iowa leaders, further demonstrating the breadth and depth of Elizabeth Warren's support as Iowans prepare to caucus on Feb. 3.
The new wave of support follows Elizabeth's endorsement on Saturday by the Des Moines Register.
Among the new endorsers are Iowa state Rep. Beth Wessel-Kroeschell, Johnson County Supervisor Royceann Porter, Iowa City City Councilwoman Mazahir Salih, Tri-County Democrats Chairman Kurt Meyer and former U.S. Attorney Nick Klinefeldt.
"When you sit down with Elizabeth Warren, you realize something right away: she listens and she cares," Johnson County Supervisor Royceann Porter said. "She's real. She knows who she is, where she comes from and who she's fighting for—and she's fighting for all of us. I'm proud to endorse her, and I'll be proud to call her our next president."
"I have not endorsed in previous races, but this time is different," Tri-County Democrats Chairman Kurt Meyer said. "In a field that ranges from good to better, and ultimately best, Elizabeth Warren stands out. After much reflection, I will caucus for Elizabeth with great conviction, and I urge my friends to do likewise."
The Register's editorial board endorsed Elizabeth on Saturday evening, calling her "tough and fearless" and "the best leader for these times."
"Warren's competence, respect for others and status as the nation's first female president would be a fitting response to the ignorance, sexism and xenophobia of the Trump Oval Office."She is a thinker, a policy wonk and a hard worker. She remembers her own family's struggles to make ends meet and her own desperation as a working mother needing child care."She cares about people, and she will use her seemingly endless energy and passion to fight for them."At this moment, when the very fabric of American life is at stake, Elizabeth Warren is the president this nation needs."
This new wave of endorsements bolsters Elizabeth's existing statewide slate of support from elected officials, political leaders and grassroots activists who span the spectrum of the Iowa Democratic Party.
Elizabeth has now been endorsed by State Treasurer Michael Fitzgerald, Senate Democratic Leader Janet Petersen, former Lieutenant Governor Sally Pederson, prominent Iowa Democrat John Norris, the Storm Lake Times newspaper, numerous incumbent state legislators, dozens of the leading Polk County Democrats, and scores of local officials and activists.
