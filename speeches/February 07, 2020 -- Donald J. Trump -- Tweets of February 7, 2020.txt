"The Senate acquitted President Trump of both charges fabricated by Congressional Democrats, led by Speaker Pelosi and Adam Schiff, to carry out the most egregious and partisan attack against any president in our history - a man they knew to be innocent." @LouDobbs @FoxBusinessRetweets: 21029Favorites: 87103

Just had a long and very good conversation by phone with President Xi of China. He is strong, sharp and powerfully focused on leading the counterattack on the Coronavirus. He feels they are doing very well, even building hospitals in a matter of only days. Nothing is easy, but...Retweets: 16717Favorites: 97671

....he will be successful, especially as the weather starts to warm & the virus hopefully becomes weaker, and then gone. Great discipline is taking place in China, as President Xi strongly leads what will be a very successful operation. We are working closely with China to help!Retweets: 9392Favorites: 51978

I think they should blame RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA again! If they can't count votes properly, how are they going to run U.S. HealthCare? https://t.co/JsNB8jvKooRetweets: 25882Favorites: 108521

The Democrat Party has given up on counting votes in Iowa. Looks like it all got computer "fried". Nobody knows who the real winner is. Maybe it's Sleepy Joe, but it's not looking that way. They lost millions & millions of dollars, all for NOTHING. But I WON Iowa big!Retweets: 26988Favorites: 149995

Great to be in Charlotte, North Carolina as we expand and grow this unprecedented economic momentum. Today, we launched a brand new nationwide campaign to revitalize under-served cities and towns across America â€“ it's called OPPORTUNITY NOW! https://t.co/jh2Ve6BUtJRetweets: 17414Favorites: 74961

I was very surprised & disappointed that Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted against me on the Democrat's totally partisan Impeachment Hoax. No President has done more for the great people of West Virginia than me (Pensions), and that will....Retweets: 26365Favorites: 121824

....always continue. Every Republican Senator except Romney, many highly religious people, all very smart, voted against the Impeachment Hoax. @SenCapito was all in (a great person). I was told by many that Manchin was just a puppet for Schumer & Pelosi. That's all he is!Retweets: 17688Favorites: 75540
