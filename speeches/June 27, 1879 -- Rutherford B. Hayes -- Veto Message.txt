    To the Senate of the United States:
I return without approval Senate bill No. 595,* with the following objection to its becoming a law:
*An act to amend "An act for the relief of Joseph B. Collins, approved March 3, 1879."
Doubts have arisen upon consideration of the bill as to whether Major Collins will be required under it to refund to the United States the pay and allowances received by him at the time he was mustered out of the service. Believing that it was not the intention of Congress to require such repayment, the bill is returned without my signature to the House in which it originated.
