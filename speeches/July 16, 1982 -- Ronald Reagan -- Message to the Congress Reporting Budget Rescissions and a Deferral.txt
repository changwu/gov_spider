    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report two new proposals to rescind $63.6 million in budget authority previously provided to the Congress and one revision to an existing deferral increasing the amount deferred by $61.1 million.
The rescissions include $47.4 million previously deferred for the employment and training assistance program administered by the Department of Labor, and $16.2 million for the exploration of national petroleum reserve in Alaska account in the Department of the Interior. The deferral affects the facilities and equipment account (Airport and Airway Trust Fund) in the Department of Transportation.
The details of the rescission proposals and revised deferral are contained in the attached reports.
