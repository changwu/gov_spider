    Today, after receiving the endorsement of the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce—the first time the organization has endorsed a candidate for president—Hillary Clinton issued the following statement:"I am honored to have earned the first-ever endorsement of the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce.
"For nearly 15 years, the NGLCC has paved the way for LGBT-owned and –allied businesses to succeed, grow, and find new clients and partners. Just this month, they brought together a record-breaking number of LGBT business leaders at their annual convention.
"The stakes in this election could not be higher for LGBT Americans. When Donald Trump says he'll 'make America great again,' that's code for 'take America backwards.' He has said he would appoint judges who would overturn marriage equality. The man Trump chose as his running mate signed a law that opened the door for Indiana businesses to discriminate against LGBT people and said marriage equality could cause 'societal collapse.'  As we've seen in North Carolina, discrimination isn't only wrong – it's bad for business. North Carolina's egregious HB2 measure has caused companies to pull jobs and millions of dollars out of the state.
"We have our work cut out for us. As President, I'll keep fighting for equality and opportunity for LGBT Americans by passing the Equality Act. And I want to be the small business president and make things easier for small businesses every step of the way. In America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it – no matter where you come from, what you look like, or who you love. That's why I have a comprehensive plan to make it easier to start a business, get the financing to grow, file taxes and work with the federal government, and provide good benefits to workers.
"I am proud to stand with the NGLCC in this election and every day."
