After eight years of a lagging economy, failing foreign policy, and broken healthcare system, the American people are making clear that they want a new type of leader in the White House. While Hillary Clinton offers the same failed policies of Barack Obama, Trump represents a movement away from the status quo in Washington.

I look forward to continuing to work hard to make sure that Trump becomes the next president of the United States."
