    The President met today with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos to discuss Colombia's peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The President congratulated President Santos and the Colombian people on this historic achievement and recognized the challenging task ahead to fully implement the agreement and build a just and lasting peace. Noting the U.S. bipartisan tradition of support for Colombia, the President committed that the United States, through the Peace Colombia framework he announced in February, would remain Colombia's partner as it pursues peace and seeks to expand on the security gains of the past 15 years. The two presidents additionally underscored their commitment to take steps to improve our joint efforts to combat organized crime and narcotics trafficking. They also agreed on the need to defend and advance democracy and human rights throughout the Western Hemisphere.
