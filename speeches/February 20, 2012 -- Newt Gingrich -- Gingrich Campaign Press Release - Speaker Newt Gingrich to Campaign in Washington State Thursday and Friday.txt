    SEATTLE, WA â€” Former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and current GOP Presidential candidate Newt Gingrich will campaign in Washington State on Thursday, Feb. 23rd and Friday, Feb. 24th. He will be in Spokane and the Tri-Cities on Thursday, and in several Puget Sound locations on Friday.
Newt2012 Washington Chairman Pastor Joe Fuiten noted, "We are very excited to have the Speaker come campaign in Washington. As Speaker he balanced the budget, reformed welfare, and created millions of new jobs. Today, we need his vision and experience to transform our bloated government, free our people to create jobs, and keep America safe in a dangerous world."
"We have been building strong support at the grassroots and new excitement has come with the news of the Speaker's visit here this week. We look forward to thousands of Washingtonians standing up for Newt at the caucuses March 3rd" said Newt2012 State Caucus Director Lew Moore.
Details of the two day trip will be announced shortly.
