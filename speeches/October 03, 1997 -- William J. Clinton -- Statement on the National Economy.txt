    Today the Labor Department announced more good news for America's workers and their families. Real wages are rising, the American economy has created 13.2 million new jobs since the beginning of my administration, and for the first time in 24 years, the unemployment rate has remained at or below 5 percent for 6 consecutive months. We have the most solid American economy in a generation, with strong investment, low unemployment, and low inflation.
While the economy is strong, we still have more to do to keep the American jobs machine on the move and ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to benefit from our growing economy. We must continue our three-part economic strategy that is helping move America forward. We must ensure fiscal responsibility for future generations. We must continue to invest and expect the most of our people through initiatives such as national education test standards. And Congress must provide traditional trade negotiating authority so we can reach fair trade agreements with other countries, breaking down trade barriers to American goods, and creating high-paying jobs for American workers.
