    Romney for President National Steering Committee Chairman Governor John Sununu issued the following statement on President Obama's visit to New Hampshire:
"Three years ago in New Hampshire, then-candidate Obama criticized his opponent for not wanting to talk about the economy. Today President Obama and his campaign are afraid to talk about the economy because his policies have failed to put people back to work."
"The real tragedy is this President's unwillingness to lead America in the right direction. His failure to even put forward a serious proposal to deal with the enormous fiscal problems facing this country will keep us in the Obama recession even longer. It is becoming apparent to more Americans that this country needs a new leader in the White House."
"Mitt Romney's experience in the private sector and as governor is the perfect combination to give us a president who can produce jobs and spur economic growth. It's a shame that we have to wait another year to make the change."
