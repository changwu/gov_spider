MANCHESTER, N.H. â€“ On the heels of Sen. Sanders' successful trip to the Granite State where he officially filed to be on the First-in-the-Nation primary ballot, New Hampshire for Bernie announced its latest staffing and office numbers.
The team now includes 90 staffers, the majority of whom are focused on field and community organizing. To accommodate its expanding ground game, NH for Bernie has opened a total of 13 field offices, plus its headquarters in Manchester. The campaign's newest offices are located in Exeter and Claremont, along with locations in Berlin, Concord, Conway, Dover, Keene, Laconia, Manchester, Nashua, Portsmouth, Plymouth, and West Lebanon.
"We are in it to win it," said Shannon Jackson, New Hampshire State Director. "For months, we have been steadily building the ground game needed to win in New Hampshire. Granite Staters expect candidates to work hard and earn their votes, and that's exactly what we are doing. Recent polls and endorsements show we are building momentum here and across the country, and we will continue to ramp up our campaign to bring home a win on February 11th."
