    Strategist David Gergen Compared Mayor Giuliani's Performance To Reagan's. "I think Rudy Giuliani won the night … [Giuliani] seized a moment when Ron Paul sort of opened up this argument that maybe we had it coming, with 9/11 and Giuliani just jumped into the debate, he disrupted the debate. To just say no, no, that's not right and I just don't agree with that. … [I]t was like a minor Nashua moment when Ronald Reagan, you know, seized the microphone, there was a quality here about showing his sort of, not only his anger but strength that I think served him well tonight." (CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360," 5/15/07)

National Review's Katherine Jean Lopez: "Rudy references Fort Dix before 9/11. Dealing with today, and the war that remains as real as it was five years ago.

The Hotline's Marc Ambinder: "Rudy Giuliani did very well. … His outrage when Ron Paul said something loopy about 9/11 was genuine, and his emotions overflowed into the audience; he bonded with them.
