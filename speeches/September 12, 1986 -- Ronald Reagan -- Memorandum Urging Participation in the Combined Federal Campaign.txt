    Memorandum for all Federal Civilian Employees and Military Personnel
The spirit of America was celebrated this summer at the Statue of Liberty celebration. Let us all take the opportunity provided by the 1986-1987 Combined Federal Campaign to demonstrate once again the American spirit of voluntary giving.
Through the 25 years of the Combined Federal Campaign, Federal civilian employees and members of the Armed Forces have shown their concern for those less fortunate in the United States and around the world by contributing generously through the Campaign.
You have a record of generosity and concern for others. I am confident that that proud record will continue in this fall's Campaign. While the decision to give is personal and voluntary, I encourage each of you to join me in wholeheartedly supporting the 1986-1987 Combined Federal Campaign.
