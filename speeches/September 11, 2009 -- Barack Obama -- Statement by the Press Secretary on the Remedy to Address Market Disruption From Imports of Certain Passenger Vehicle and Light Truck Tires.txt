    After reviewing recommendations from the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the President today signed a determination to apply an increased duty to all imports of passenger vehicle and light truck tires from China for a period of three years in order to remedy a market disruption caused by a surge in tire imports. As part of its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), China agreed to a special safeguard mechanism that would allow its trading partners to implement remedies in response to import surges and under other circumstances. The President decided to remedy the clear disruption to the U.S. tire industry based on the facts and the law in this case.
The additional duty to passenger vehicle and light truck tires – complementing the existing 4 percent duty– will be set at 35 percent ad valorem for the first year, 30 percent ad valorem the second year, and 25 percent ad valorem the third year.
A presidential proclamation and memorandum are attached.
