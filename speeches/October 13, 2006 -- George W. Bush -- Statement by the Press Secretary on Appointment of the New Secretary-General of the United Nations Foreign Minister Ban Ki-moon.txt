    President Bush welcomes the U.N. General Assembly's appointment of Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon of the Republic of Korea as the next Secretary-General of the United Nations. The President has had the opportunity to get to know Foreign Minister Ban during the course of his Administration and looks forward to continuing their excellent working relationship. Foreign Minister Ban assumes his role at a time of great challenge and opportunity at the United Nations. We will rely on his leadership to help steer the U.N. Organization through the reforms already underway, and to propel the Organization even further on the path of reform.
Foreign Minister Ban will succeed Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has been a good friend of the United States, a good friend to the President, and a tireless advocate for the ideals and promise of the United Nations Organization. Secretary-General Annan's vision, initiatives, and strong support for reforming the United Nations have been essential for the progress achieved thus far. We wish to extend our sincere appreciation for his dedication, his service, and his achievements.
