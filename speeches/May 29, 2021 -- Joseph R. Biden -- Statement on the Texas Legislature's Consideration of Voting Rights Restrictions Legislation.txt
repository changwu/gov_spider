    Today Texas legislators put forth a bill that joins Georgia and Florida in advancing a State law that attacks the sacred right to vote. It's part of an assault on democracy that we've seen far too often this year and often disproportionately targeting Black and Brown Americans.
It's wrong and un-American. In the 21st century, we should be making it easier, not harder, for every eligible voter to vote.
I call again on Congress to pass the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. And I continue to call on all Americans, of every party and persuasion, to stand up for our democracy and protect the right to vote and the integrity of our elections.
