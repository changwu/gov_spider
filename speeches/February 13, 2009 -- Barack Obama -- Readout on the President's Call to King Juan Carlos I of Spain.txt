    This afternoon, President Obama spoke with King Juan Carlos I to convey his desire to build on the close relationship the United States and Spain enjoy. The President noted the historical bond between the American and Spanish people and regretted that he will not be able to join the King when the King and Queen Sofia visit Florida to celebrate the 450th anniversary of the first Spanish settlements in Pensacola. The President recognized the King's important role in advancing Spain's modern democracy and said he looks forward to working with President Zapatero to address the common challenges our countries face.
