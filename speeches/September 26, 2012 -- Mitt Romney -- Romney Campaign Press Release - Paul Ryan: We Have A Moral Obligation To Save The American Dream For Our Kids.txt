PAUL RYAN: "[Our nation's debt] has a big effect on jobs. It hurts jobs now. It threatens businesses with uncertainty today, and it for sure, positively, without hesitation, gives our kids a diminished future.Â  It is our moral obligation to save the American dream for our children and our grandchildren, and we need political leaders who will do that, and we don't have them right now, and we'll get them by electing Mitt Romney the next President of the United States."
