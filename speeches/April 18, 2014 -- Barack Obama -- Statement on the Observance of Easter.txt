    This weekend, Michelle and I join our fellow Christians in marking Good Friday and celebrating Easter. We will reflect on the sacrifice that Jesus Christ made for us and rejoice in the triumph of the Resurrection. This season reminds us that God is always with us, in suffering and in celebration. We give thanks for the many blessings in our lives and renew our commitments to follow Christ's example by loving God and loving our neighbors as ourselves. We wish all who celebrate a blessed Easter.
