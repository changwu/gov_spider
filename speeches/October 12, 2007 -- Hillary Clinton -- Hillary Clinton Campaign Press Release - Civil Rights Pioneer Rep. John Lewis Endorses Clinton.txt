    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of civil rights leader Congressman John Lewis.
"I have looked at all the candidates, and I believe that Hillary Clinton is the best prepared to lead this country at a time when we are in desperate need of strong leadership," Rep. Lewis said. "She will restore a greater sense of community in America, and reclaim our standing in the world."
"I am proud and deeply honored to have the support of John Lewis, a great American hero," Clinton said. "John helped transform this nation, and his vital role in establishing civil rights for all Americans will never be forgotten."
Rep. Lewis is a civil rights pioneer who has devoted his life to equal rights for all Americans. From his days as a Freedom Rider and the head of the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee, to his leadership of the "Bloody Sunday" march in Selma, Alabama, Lewis has been one of the most respected figures in the civil rights movement for four decades.
Rep. Lewis later served as Director of the Voter Education Project, helping register millions of new minorities to vote, and was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to direct more than 250,000 volunteers of ACTION, the federal volunteer agency.
Elected to the Atlanta City Council in 1981, Rep. Lewis was later elected to Congress in 1986, where he's represented Georgia's 5th Congressional District for the last 20 years. He is Senior Chief Deputy Whip for the Democratic Party leadership in the House, a member of the House Ways & Means Committee, a member of its Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support, and Chairman of its Subcommittee on Oversight. ###
