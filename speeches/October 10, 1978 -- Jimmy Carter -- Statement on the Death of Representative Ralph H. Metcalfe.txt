    With deep regret I learned today of the death of Representative Ralph It. Metcalfe. His life was genuinely inspiring. As a famed Olympic sprinter—second only to Jesse Owens in 1936—as a strong, independent voice for the people of Chicago and most recently, as a visionary leader in the Panama Canal Treaty ratification, he was uncompromising in the pursuit of excellence.
He stood always for equity. His political energy was invested always on behalf of his constituents, and his unexpected passing deprives his community, his colleagues, and the Nation of a staunch and honest leader.
