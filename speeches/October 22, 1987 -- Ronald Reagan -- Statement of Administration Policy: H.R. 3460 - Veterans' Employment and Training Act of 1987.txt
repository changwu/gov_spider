    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Dowdy (D) MS and 11 others)
The administration opposes H.R. 3460 because many of its provisions would seriously interfere with the efficient operation of the veterans' employment and training program. The bill would mandate in law personnel requirements that would not provide improved service to veterans, but would be costly and interfere with the Secretary of Labor's ability to effectively manage the program.
