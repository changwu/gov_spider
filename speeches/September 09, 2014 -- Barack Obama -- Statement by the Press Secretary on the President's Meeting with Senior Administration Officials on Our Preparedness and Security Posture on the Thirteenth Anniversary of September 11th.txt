    Earlier today the President met with key national security principals on our preparedness and security posture as we approach the thirteenth anniversary of September 11th. Over the past several months, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Lisa Monaco has convened counterterrorism and homeland security leaders across the government to review our security posture in light of not only this anniversary but the range of global threats we face, including that posed by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).
The President's National Security team is continuing to take measures to prevent attacks against the Homeland and ensure the protection of U.S. persons and facilities abroad â€” the Administration's top national security priorities.
