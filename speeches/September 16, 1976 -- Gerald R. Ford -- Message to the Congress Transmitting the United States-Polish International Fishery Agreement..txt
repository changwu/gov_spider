    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with The Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (P.L. 94-265; 16 U.S.C. 1801), I transmit herewith a governing international fishery agreement between the United States and the Polish People's Republic, signed at Warsaw on August 2, 1976.
This Agreement is significant because it is the first to be negotiated in accordance with that legislation. I recommend the Congress give favorable consideration to this Agreement at an early date. I further recommend that, in the event 60 calendar days of continuous session as required by the legislation are not available before March 1, 1977, the Congress consider issuance of a joint resolution in order to bring this Agreement into force by that date.
