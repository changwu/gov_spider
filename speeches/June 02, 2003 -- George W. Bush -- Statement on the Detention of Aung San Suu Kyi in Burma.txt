    I am deeply concerned by reports from Burma of the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and members of her political party as well as reports that military authorities have closed her party headquarters in Rangoon. The military authorities should release Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters immediately and permit her party headquarters to re-open.
The situation in Burma has long been of concern to the United States. We have urged Burmese officials to release all political prisoners and to offer their people a better way of life, a life offering freedom and economic progress. We welcomed the release of Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest more than a year ago. This step gave the military regime an opportunity to enter into a substantive dialog with Aung San Suu Kyi and all political groups to promote national reconciliation and democracy. This is still the only path to peace and prosperity for all of Burma's people.
