    I am pleased that the Treasury Department and the United States Customs Service have joined today with the Justice Department to take a significant step to protect our Nation and its children from drugs. The indictments today send a clear message that those who help finance drug operations, who launder drug money, who make it possible for drug dealers to earn their illegal profits will not escape the long arm of our Nation's law enforcement. We still have much to do, but let no one doubt that we will press this fight relentlessly against the drug cartels and all their partners in crime.
