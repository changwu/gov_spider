VP pool report #4 - Speech excerpts 
The VP's office passes along excerpts of her remarks scheduled for 10:45 this morning:

What happened on Flight 93 tells us so much. About the courage of those on board,who gave everything. About the resolve ofthe first responders, who risked everything. About the resilience of the American people.
On this 20th anniversary, on this solemn dayof remembrance, we must challenge ourselves to, yes, look back. For the sake of our children. For the sake of their children.And for that reason, we must also look forward.We must also look toward the future.
Because in the end, that is what the 40 were fighting for: Their future. And ours.
On the days that followed September 11th, 2001, we were all reminded that unity is possible in America. We were reminded, too, that unity is imperative in America. It is essential to our shared prosperity, our national security, and to our standing in the world.

"We are gathered today on hallowed ground, at this place that has been sanctified by sacrifice."
"We must challenge ourselves to look back, remember, for the sake of our children. For the sake of their children."
