    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question covering the period August 1 to September 30, 1998. The previous submission covered events during June and July 1998.
United States efforts to bring about a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus issue based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation remained steadfast. United States officials encouraged the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leadership to focus on the core issues of the Cyprus dispute and encouraged all parties to prepare for eventual comprehensive negotiations. My Special Presidential Emissary for Cyprus, Richard C. Holbrooke, and the Special Cyprus Coordinator, Thomas J. Miller, underscored this message in a series of important meetings in September with Cypriot, Greek, and Turkish representatives attending the United Nations General Assembly.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
