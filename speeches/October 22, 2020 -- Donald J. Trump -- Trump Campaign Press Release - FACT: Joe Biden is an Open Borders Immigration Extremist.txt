    Biden has fully embraced the far left open borders extremism of his party.
Joe Biden, who once called illegal immigration a "gift" to the United States, has embraced extreme and lawless immigration policies that would open the flood gates for illegal immigrants and put American jobs and safety at risk:


Biden has pledged to shut down detention facilities for illegal immigrants, opening up the border to anyone who can make it across.

Biden promised that no illegal immigrants will be deported from the United States in his first 100 days in office, and after that only if they commit a felony.


Despite the many Americans killed by illegal immigrants driving drunk, Biden has said he does not consider DUIs a felony. 



Biden insisted that America could take in two million more immigrants in a "heartbeat" and wants to vastly expand low-skill immigration.

Biden has pledged to give healthcare to illegal aliens.

Biden supports dangerous sanctuary policies that jeopardize Americans' safety.

Even Obama-Biden's own DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said that such policies are "too far to the left" and amount to open borders.
