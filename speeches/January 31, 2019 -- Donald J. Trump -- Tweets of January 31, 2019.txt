So great to watch & listen to all these people who write books & talk about my presidential campaign and so many others things related to winning and how I should be doing 'IT.' As I take it all in I then sit back look around & say 'gee I'm in the White House & they're not!Retweets: 25687Favorites: 136805

Large sections of WALL have already been built with much more either under construction or ready to go. Renovation of existing WALLS is also a very big part of the plan to finally after many decades properly Secure Our Border. The Wall is getting done one way or the other!Retweets: 19979Favorites: 97316

Very sadly Murder cases in Mexico in 2018 rose 33% from 2017 to 33341. This is a big contributor to the Humanitarian Crises taking place on our Southern Border and then spreading throughout our Country. Worse even than Afghanistan. Much caused by DRUGS. Wall is being built!Retweets: 12018Favorites: 49052

With Murders up 33% in Mexico a record why wouldn't any sane person want to build a Wall! Construction has started and will not stop until it is finished. @LouDobbs @foxandfriendsRetweets: 16595Favorites: 71953

China's top trade negotiators are in the U.S. meeting with our representatives. Meetings are going well with good intent and spirit on both sides. China does not want an increase in Tariffs and feels they will do much better if they make a deal. They are correct. I will be......Retweets: 14219Favorites: 67216

....meeting with their top leaders and representatives today in the Oval Office. No final deal will be made until my friend President Xi and I meet in the near future to discuss and agree on some of the long standing and more difficult points. Very comprehensive transaction....Retweets: 13750Favorites: 68736

....China's representatives and I are trying to do a complete deal leaving NOTHING unresolved on the table. All of the many problems are being discussed and will be hopefully resolved. Tariffs on China increase to 25% on March 1st so all working hard to complete by that date!Retweets: 13327Favorites: 61814

Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee are wasting their time. Democrats despite all of the evidence proof and Caravans coming are not going to give money to build the DESPERATELY needed WALL. I've got you covered. Wall is already being built I don't expect much help!Retweets: 25261Favorites: 104681

More troops being sent to the Southern Border to stop the attempted Invasion of Illegals through large Caravans into our Country. We have stopped the previous Caravans and we will stop these also. With a Wall it would be soooo much easier and less expensive. Being Built!Retweets: 24957Favorites: 105206

Looking for China to open their Markets not only to Financial Services which they are now doing but also to our Manufacturing Farmers and other U.S. businesses and industries. Without this a deal would be unacceptable!Retweets: 15779Favorites: 73305

Schumer and the Democrats are big fans of being weak and passive with Iran. They have no clue as to the danger they would be inflicting on our Country. Iran is in financial chaos now because of the sanctions and Iran Deal termination. Dems put us in a bad place - but now good!Retweets: 21401Favorites: 94728

Just concluded a great meeting with my Intel team in the Oval Office who told me that what they said on Tuesday at the Senate Hearing was mischaracterized by the media - and we are very much in agreement on Iran ISIS North Korea etc. Their testimony was distorted press.... https://t.co/Zl5aqBmpjFRetweets: 21253Favorites: 87158

....I would suggest you read the COMPLETE testimony from Tuesday. A false narrative is so bad for our Country. I value our intelligence community. Happily we had a very good meeting and we are all on the same page!Retweets: 17401Favorites: 77907
