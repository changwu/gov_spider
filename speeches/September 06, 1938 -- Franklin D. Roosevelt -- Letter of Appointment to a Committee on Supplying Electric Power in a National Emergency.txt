    Dear Mr. Johnson:
The reports regarding the supply of electric power in the event of a national emergency made to me by the War Department and the Federal Power Commission in response to my request of March 18, 1938, have given me much concern. These studies have disclosed a shortage of power to meet the needs of the nation's industry in the event of war, such as to constitute a serious threat to the national security.
In order to take immediate steps toward the solution of this pressing problem I am appointing a committee of representatives from the War and Navy Departments, the Federal Power Commission, the National Power Policy Committee, the National Resources Committee and the Securities & Exchange Commission.
It is my desire that this committee find and recommend to me definite ways and means of meeting this problem. This will include drafting enabling legislation, recommending necessary appropriations, and other measures which appear appropriate.
Yours sincerely,
Hon. Louis Johnson,Asst. Secretary of War,Washington, D. C.
