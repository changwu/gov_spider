    Mitt Romney today announced that Governor Terry Branstad and Senator Chuck Grassley will serve as Honorary Co-Chairmen of his Iowa campaign.
"I am proud to have Governor Branstad and Senator Grassley as advisors to my campaign in Iowa," said Mitt Romney. "Working with these leaders, who share my passion for smaller government and balanced budgets, will be key to winning the Hawkeye state and working to get our economy back on track."
"President Obama's trillion-dollar deficits have driven this country toward the same fiscal cliff as Europe. Iowans know this is a threat to our livelihoods and the future of our country, and we must act quickly to avoid fiscal calamity," said Iowa Governor Terry Branstad. "I am dedicated to helping Governor Romney win our crucial state so he can put our country back on a path toward a balanced budget."
"Iowa is positioned to make the difference in this year's presidential election, and we know the country can't afford another four years of the Obama agenda," said U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley. "Our candidate, Mitt Romney, knows that big government, high taxes and heavy-handed regulations are a wet blanket on job creation. They take away our freedoms and limit opportunities. Mitt Romney knows it's the economy that needs to get bigger, not government. Working together, common-sense Iowans can help reclaim America's future by electing Mitt Romney."
