    Former U.S. Ambassador Joe Wilson and Valerie Plame Wilson say Hillary Clinton has the strongest plan to end the Iraq War and bring our troops home safely in a new TV ad airing in Oregon.
The 30-second spot, entitled "Strongest Plan," comes as Oregonians vote by mail in the run up to the state's May 20th primary.
The Wilsons played a critical role in drawing attention to the Bush Administration's exaggerated claims about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and have been outspoken critics of the conduct of the war.

Ambassador Joe Wilson: We challenged the Bush administration when they wouldn't tell the truth about weapons of mass destruction.

She has been a leader in pushing the administration for a serious exit strategy.
Ambassador Joe Wilson: And Hillary has the strongest plan for bringing our troops home, starting within sixty days.
Valerie Plame Wilson: If you care about ending the war, we urge you to join us in supporting Hillary Clinton for President.
Ambassador Joe Wilson: She'll get the job done.
