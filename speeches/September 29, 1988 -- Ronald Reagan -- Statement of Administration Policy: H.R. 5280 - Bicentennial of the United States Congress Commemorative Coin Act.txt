    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Fascell (D) Florida and Annunzio (D) Illinois)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5280, because the bill would require that surcharges received upon sale of the proposed coins be deposited in the Capitol Preservation Fund for the benefit of the United States Capitol Preservation Commission. These surcharges should, instead, be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury. Funds for the Commission, to the extent they may be necessary, should be appropriated directly. Accordingly, the Administration urges that H.R. 5280 not be considered under suspension of the rules, and that it be amended in a manner consistent with the foregoing.
