    We have noted the press reports that, according to FBI memoranda delivered by the Justice Department to the House Committees on the Judiciary and Foreign Affairs, Billy Carter told the FBI that the President had shown Billy Carter State Department cables concerning Libya and that Billy Carter has possession of such cables. We have not seen the FBI reports referred to and cannot comment on the accuracy of press reports connecting them.
The President's best recollection is that the only State Department cables he has ever discussed with Billy Carter are low classification cables from our Embassy in Libya, reporting on Billy Carter's first trip to Libya in September 1978 and indicating that the trip had gone well from the Embassy's point of view. The President does not now recall whether he saw the texts of these cables himself or heard about them from others. He does not now recall showing the texts to Billy Carter or giving him copies.
