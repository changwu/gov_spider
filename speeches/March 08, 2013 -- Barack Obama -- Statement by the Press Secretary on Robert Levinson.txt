    Six years ago tomorrow, retired FBI agent Robert Levinson went missing during a business trip in Iran. Finding him remains a high priority for the United States, and we will continue to do all that we can to bring him home safely to his friends and family, so they may begin to heal after so many years of extraordinary grief and uncertainty.
The Iranian Government previously offered assistance in locating Mr. Levinson and we look forward to receiving this assistance, even as we disagree on other key issues. The FBI has also announced a $1 million reward for information leading to Mr. Levinson's safe return. This year, we again reaffirm our commitment to bringing him home to those who love him.
