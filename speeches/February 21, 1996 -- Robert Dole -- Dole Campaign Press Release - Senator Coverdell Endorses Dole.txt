    The Dole for President campaign today won the endorsement of Paul Coverdell, Republican U.S. Senator from Georgia. Senator Coverdell was National Vice Chairman of the recent presidential campaign of Senator Phil Gramm.
"I've worked closely with my friend Bob Dole in the Senate and I've seen his unique ability to unify the conservatives and moderates in our party," said Senator Coverdell. "Senator Dole will be a dynamic president who cuts taxes, balances the budget and revitalizes our economy."
"We're delighted to have the supports of the distinguished Senator from Georgia," said Dole Campaign Manager Scott Reed. "Paul Coverdell is an articulate, highly respected conservative leader who will be a major asset to our campaign in the South."
Georgia will hold its presidential primary on March 5 and will send 42 delegates to the Republican National Convention in San Diego in August.
