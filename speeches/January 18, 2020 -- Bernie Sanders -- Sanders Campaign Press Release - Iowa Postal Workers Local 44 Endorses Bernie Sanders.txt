    DES MOINES -- Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign on Saturday announced the workers of American Postal Workers Union (APWU) Local 44 in central Iowa have endorsed Sanders for president.
"Donald Trump wants to privatize the Postal Service and threaten over 630,000 jobs. That absolutely cannot happen," said Sen. Sanders. "I'm proud to stand together with the postal workers of Local 44 as we fight to strengthen USPS, protect jobs and allow post offices to provide basic banking services."
"Senator Bernie Sanders stands for the working class people of this country. He is a champion for postal workers against postal privatization which would lead to higher costs and less service. He will fight for postal banking that would bring in revenue to the Postal Service and stop the legalized loan sharking of check into cash and payday loans that feed on the working poor," said DMI APWU LOCAL 44 President Mike Bates. "Senator Sanders is a proven leader -- he has our backs and we will have his back in this election. The DMI Area Local 44 of the American Postal Workers Union will do everything we can to elect Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States of America."
Local 44 members voted to endorse Sanders at their standing meeting this week in Des Moines. The union boasts a membership of over 700 in and around the greater Des Moines area. The APWU Local 44 endorsements adds to the more than 130 individual union worker endorsements already announced for Sen. Sanders in Iowa in 2019.
