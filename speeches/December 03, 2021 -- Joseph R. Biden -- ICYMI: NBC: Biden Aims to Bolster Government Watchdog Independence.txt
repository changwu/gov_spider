    As part of an effort to build public trust and ensure that public funds are spent responsibly and effectively, the Biden Administration issued a new directive today to federal agencies pushing for increased cooperation with independent watchdogs. As the Biden Administration moves to nominate and confirm new inspectors general throughout the federal government, the memo released from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) today recommends proactive steps to seek and incorporate their oversight and feedback.
"As President Biden has made clear, results and accountability go hand-in-hand," said acting OMB Director Shalanda Young and Deputy Director for Management Jason Miller in a memo sent to agency and department heads Friday. "To deliver results for all Americans, now and in the years to come, the Federal Government must undertake its work, and support appropriate oversight of its activities, in a manner deserving of public trust."
The new directive reflects President Biden's longstanding commitment to responsible and effective oversight and cooperation with inspectors general. The memo institutionalizes the collaborative, proactive oversight approach developed for the American Rescue Plan, as well as President Biden's approach implementing the Recovery Act of 2009. As the Biden Administration begins implementing the bipartisan infrastructure law and works toward the passage of Build Back Better, the plan represents a major step in ensuring that taxpayer funds are being spent honestly, fairly, and effectively.
