    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Skaggs (D) CO and 2 others)
The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 631, but will seek clarifying amendments in the Senate to address constitutional concerns regarding the bill's approach to water rights issues.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 631 could reduce collections that offset spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. The preliminary OMB PAYGO estimate is zero.
