    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY

The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 638 but, during further consideration, will seek provisions to:

delay some of the Northern Mariana Islands (NMI) construction funding to later years;   
reimburse Guam and the NMI for the impact of immigration, from the freely associated states, under the compacts of free association;   
accelerate funding for critical construction projects (especially in American Samoa); and   
accelerate funding for correction of immigration and labor abuses in the NMI.
