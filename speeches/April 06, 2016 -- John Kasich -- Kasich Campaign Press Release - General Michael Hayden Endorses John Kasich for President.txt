    Today General Michael Hayden announced his support for Ohio Governor John Kasich for president and joined the Kasich for America National Security Advisory Group.
"Governor John Kasich, who served 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee, is the one candidate in the entire field with the best experience, expertise and leadership skills required to be Commander-in-Chief," said General Hayden. "Governor Kasich has serious proposals to strengthen our military, defeat ISIS and stand up for freedom around the worldâ€”proposals that rise far above bumper-stickers and amateur rhetoric."

Michael Hayden is a retired Air Force four-star general. He served as the Director of the CIA from 2006-2009 and as the Director of the NSA from 1999-2005.
Said Kasich, "It's an incredible honor to receive the support of General Hayden. He has played a pivotal role in our nation's efforts to enhance our intelligence capabilities and strengthen our national defense to combat terror threats at home and abroad. His counsel and expertise will be invaluable as we look ahead to addressing the dangerous and unpredictable threats to our national security that may loom on the horizon."
