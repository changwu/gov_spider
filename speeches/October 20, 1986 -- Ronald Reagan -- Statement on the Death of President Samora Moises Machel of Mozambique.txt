    It was with deep regret that we learned of the death of the President of the People's Republic of Mozambique, Samora Moises Machel. I wish to extend to the Government and people of Mozambique the condolences of the American people in the loss they have suffered. President Machel led his people with courage and unfailing determination in the long struggle for Mozambique's independence and nonalignment.
President Machel understood the urgent need for cooperation in the interest of peace in southern Africa. His agreement to Nkomati accord with South Africa was a courageous milestone in the effort of all the peoples of southern Africa to live together in mutual security and good will. He was a voice for moderation in the region.
Since his meeting with President Reagan a year ago, President Machel dedicated his government to improving relations between Mozambique and the United States. We hope to work closely with his successors to continue the improvement in our bilateral relations and to further the cause of peace in southern Africa.
