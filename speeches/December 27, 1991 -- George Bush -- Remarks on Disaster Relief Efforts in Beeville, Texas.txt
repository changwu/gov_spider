    Let me just say first, I'm pleased to be back here in Beeville. But last night I signed a statement declaring a major disaster in the State of Texas, due to the severe thunderstorms and flooding that began last week.
This declaration will allow Federal funding to be made available to affected individuals and local governments in a five-county area, which includes Bastrop, Bosque, Brown, Dallas, and Travis counties.
Grant Peterson, with me here today, the Associate Director of FEMA, of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. And he's here to ensure that all aspects of the declaration are promptly implemented. He'll also make sure that the Federal funds are rapidly put into the hands of the families and individuals who need them.
These funds will help to provide shelter, temporary housing, and transportation to individuals and families whose lives have been disrupted by this disaster. The funds will also help to recover the cost of damaged personal property and allow the victims of the storms and floods to begin rebuilding their lives.
I know that this disaster has been a source of great personal tragedy to many here in Texas, a particularly bitter calamity during this holiday season. And to those who have lost loved ones as a result of this catastrophe, Barbara and I send our deepest sympathies.
We had a chance to see some of the flood damage. We went over Austin and flew by some flooding in Travis County, Bosque County, and it is severe.
So anyway, we wish those families all the best as we approach the new year.
Thank you very much.
