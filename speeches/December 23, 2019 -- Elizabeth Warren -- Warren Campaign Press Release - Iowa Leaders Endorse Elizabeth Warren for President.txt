    West Des Moines, Iowa—The Iowa for Warren campaign today announced endorsements from 21 leaders from across the state, adding to a long list of Iowans committed to supporting Elizabeth Warren and her plans for big, structural change at the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3.
Among the new endorsers are former state Sens. Jim Riordan and Steve Sovern, former Linn County Supervisor Jean Oxley, and Iowa State University economist Dave Swenson.
"I'm supporting Elizabeth Warren because it's time for a woman in the White House fighting for rights and equality," Jean Oxley said. "Her plans support women in every stage of life—from early childhood to retirement."
"Elizabeth Warren is a breath of intellectual fresh air," Dave Swenson said. "She's proposing well-grounded and progressive approaches to solving our country's greatest challenges, and offering practical pathways for making those plans a reality."
The new endorsements follow recent announcements of support from prominent Iowa Democrat John Norris and the Storm Lake Times newspaper.
They join State Treasurer Michael Fitzgerald, former Lieutenant Governor Sally Pederson, state Sens. Joe Bolkcom, Claire Celsi, Eric Giddens, and Zach Wahls, state Reps.
