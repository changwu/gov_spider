    Little Rock, AR – Chip Saltsman, Huckabee for President Campaign Manager, issued the following statement in response to a YouTube video being circulated on the Internet. The video is from an anonymous source and contains excerpts taken out of context from a speech when then-Governor Mike Huckabee was opening a special legislative session in 2003.
"The governor called a special session. Several proposals had been made by legislators for raising the revenue to address a budget shortfall for necessary services. In the end, a state income tax surcharge was passed with the provision that it would be a temporary tax. Most temporary taxes become permanent. The governor made sure the legislature kept its promise to keep the tax temporary.
"More than 90% of the state budget pays for prisons, education, and Medicaid. None of those would have been funded without that budget. The governor acted responsibly to protect Arkansans who are the most vulnerable but the least connected politically.
"The fact is that Mike Huckabee cut taxes 94 times – including the first broad-based tax cut in the history of the state of Arkansas. While governor, he balanced the budget and returned almost $400 million to Arkansas taxpayers, and left office with almost a $1 billion surplus. The ‘Huckabee Surplus' enabled his successor to follow Huckabee's lead to begin the elimination of the state sales tax on food.
"Despite what some Washington insiders who don't understand the fundamentals of governing or leadership will have you believe, when you discern the facts, the reality is that Mike Huckabee is a true fiscal conservative."
