FLOTUS Pool #8 - More background
More background on the event from FLOTUS office:
New Cancer Moonshot / United States Government Actions as Part of U.S.-Africa Leaders SummitLeaders across U.S. departments and agencies and the private sector have demonstrated unwavering commitment to improve cancer outcomes in countries in Africa through a number of new announcements and commitments [read the FACT SHEET]. These include efforts to strengthen national public health infrastructure and build resilient healthcare systems, as well as funding for robust and impactful initiatives across the African continent on cancer prevention, screening, treatment, and research totaling approximately $300 million.
U.S.-Africa Partnership in Health CooperationOn Tuesday, December 13th, the Biden-Harris Administration released a fact sheet on its partnership with governments and institutions in Africa, including the African Union (AU) and Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), to advance shared public health goals. Since the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, the United States has invested and committed to provide nearly $20 billion in health programs in the African region.
For decades, the United States has partnered with African nations to meet shared health challenges, working together to invest billions of dollars and saving countless lives. However, despite much progress, non-communicable diseases like cancer are now estimated to lead all causes of death across the African continent. A new Lancet Oncology commission for sub-Saharan Africa estimates more than one million cancer deaths will occur per year in those countries by 2040. There are actions we can take to prevent this outcome.
Background on the Cancer Moonshot:As Vice President, in 2016, Joe Biden led the Cancer Moonshot with the mission to accelerate the rate of progress against cancer. The cancer advocacy, patient, research and health care communities responded with tremendous energy and ingenuity. Now, President Biden and Dr. Biden have reignited the Cancer Moonshot and set new national goals: if we work together, we can cut the death rate from cancer by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years, and improve the experience of people and their families living with and surviving cancer.
The Cancer Moonshot's mission extends around the world. The Cancer Moonshot's global work is focused on equity, including increasing access to screening, treatments, tools, and resources for all cancer patients and their families, especially to lower- and middle-income countries that have less access. Some of the First Lady's recent global work includes engagements in Spain at the Asociación Española Contra el Cáncer (Spanish Association Against Cancer) with Queen Letizia during the NATO Summit, in Costa Rica at theNational Children's Hospital, and in New York at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center during the United Nations General Assembly.
The Role of African First Ladies and CancerThe Organization of African First Ladies for Development (OAFLAD) prioritizes addressing non-communicable diseases, including cancers, and improving women's and children's health. This focus is a recognition of the growing cancer burden in Africa. Recently, OAFLAD members issued a joint appeal for more effective measures to fight cancer and use innovative technologies for cancer screening, diagnosis, treatment, and palliative care. The World Health Organization, together with large international cancer organizations, agree that eliminating cervical cancer and decreasing the impact of childhood and breast cancers is a top priority. Many First Ladies in Africa who are attending the U.S.-Africa Leaders' Summit have started cancer-related initiatives.
