VP Pool Report #6 
We're at about 3:55p.m. Vice President Kamala Harris is continuing to speak in the "We Can Do This" tour in the TCF Center in Detroit, MI.
"There are still a whole lot of folks who are not yet vaccinated, and that is certainly true here in Detroit," said VP Kamala Harris.
"We are bringing the facts, not misinformation — the facts," Harris said.
They have goals to "bring the vaccine directly to the people." They are having people go door-to-door for vaccines. "We shouldn't require that people knock on our door to find out what's going on." They're also giving vaccines to pediatricians and setting up vaccine clinics.
"This delta variant is no joke," Harris said. She said virtually every person in the hospital sick with covid-19 right now is unvaccinated. "It's a fact," she added. She also said virtually everyone who has recently died from covid-19 is also unvaccinated.
She joked that she was feeling a little sick on the second day of her covid-19 vaccine which she received in January. "Just a few hours that can save your life."
She recommends talking to people "out of love" and encourage people to get vaccinated.
She ended her speech at p.m.
VP ended her remarks at 4:07 p.m. She will deliver remarks at a Whitmer for Michigan finance event after.
