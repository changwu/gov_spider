    Following President Biden's fruitful conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Bennett on April 24, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with his Israeli counterpart, National Security Advisor Dr. Eyal Hulata, to discuss a range of regional and global security issues. Mr. Sullivan emphasized that the United States is attuned to Israel's concerns about threats to its security, including first-and-foremost from Iran and Iranian-backed proxies. They agreed to further enhance the ongoing coordination through the U.S.-Israel Strategic Consultative Group and strengthen security and diplomatic cooperation wherever possible with other regional partners. They also discussed Israel's relationships with key Indo-Pacific countries. Sullivan and Hulata continued their discussions regarding Russia's war on Ukraine and the need to continue supporting our Ukrainian partners. They committed to continue their close coordination on the range of security issues of importance to both the United States and Israel, and they look forward to President Biden's visit to Israel in the coming months.
