    The United States strongly condemns the outrageous targeted killings of civilians including women and children in Al-Qubeir in Hama province as reported by multiple credible sources. This, coupled with the Syrian regime's refusal to let UN observers into the area to verify these reports, is an affront to human dignity and justice. There is no justification for this regime's continued defiance of its obligations under the Annan Plan, and Assad's continued abdication of responsibility for these horrific acts has no credibility and only further underscores the illegitimate and immoral nature of his rule.
The future of Syria will be determined by the Syrian people, and the international community must come together in support of their legitimate aspirations. We call once more on all nations to abandon support for this brutal and illegitimate regime, and to join together to support a political transition in Syriaâ€”one that upholds the promise of a future for which far too many have already died.
