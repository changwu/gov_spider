Boston, MA â€“ Today, Massachusetts House Republican Leader Brad Jones issued the following statement on the Giuliani campaign conference call hosted by Jim Rappaport:
"Today, the Giuliani campaign is continuing their negative personal attacks. Governor Romney is the only candidate in this race who has brought Republicans and Democrats together to achieve great results for the people they represent. Under Governor Romney, we passed tax cuts, achieved health care reform and improved our education system. Jim Rappaport's attacks on Governor Romney are nothing more than sour grapes from a candidate passed over in 2002 for the Republican Lt. Governor nomination."
