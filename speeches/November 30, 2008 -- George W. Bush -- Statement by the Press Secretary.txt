    President Bush has asked Secretary Rice to travel to India this week in the wake of the terror attacks that killed nearly 200 people, including 6 American citizens. Secretary Rice will depart tonight on already scheduled travel to London. She will attend the NATO meeting on Tuesday, and then proceed to India, arriving in New Delhi on Wednesday.
Secretary Rice's visit to India is a further demonstration of the United States' commitment to stand in solidarity with the people of India as we all work together to hold these extremists accountable.
