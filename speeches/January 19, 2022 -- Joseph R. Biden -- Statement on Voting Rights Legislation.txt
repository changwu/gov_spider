    At the core of our democracy is a basic principle: the right to vote, and to have that vote counted. That principle was assaulted 1 year ago, when a violent mob attempted a coup seeking to overturn the will of the people. And today, in State after State, Republican State legislatures are engaged in an unprecedented effort to suppress the sacred right to vote and subvert the American bedrock of free and fair elections.
In the face of those threats, I am profoundly disappointed that the United States Senate has failed to stand up for our democracy. I am disappointed, but I am not deterred.
My administration will never stop fighting to ensure that the heart and soul of our democracy—the right to vote—is protected at all costs. We will continue to work with allies to advance necessary legislation to protect the right to vote. And to push for Senate procedural changes that will protect the fundamental right to vote.
As dangerous new Republican laws plainly designed to suppress and subvert voting rights proliferate in States across the country, we will explore every measure and use every tool at our disposal to stand up for democracy. The Vice President will continue to lead this effort, as she has for the past year.
