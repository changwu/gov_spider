    Judge Shirley Hufstedler has one of the best minds in the country. To fill the position of first Secretary of the new Department of Education, I wanted a strong, creative thinker who could take a new, fresh look at the way we educate our children. In Judge Shirley Hufstedler, we have found that person.
She is deeply committed to the quality of education and enjoys my full confidence and support. I am certain she will be an outstanding Secretary.
