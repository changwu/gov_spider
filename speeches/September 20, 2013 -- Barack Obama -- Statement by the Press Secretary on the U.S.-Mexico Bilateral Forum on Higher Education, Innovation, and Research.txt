    Today in Mexico City, Vice President Biden joined U.S. and Mexican academic leaders and government education officials as they met on the margins of the U.S.-Mexico High Level Economic Dialogue to discuss the future of the U.S.-Mexico Bilateral Forum on Higher Education, Innovation, and Research. A result of the shared vision of President Obama and President Pe√±a Nieto to improve educational achievement in both our countries, the Forum brings together Mexicans and Americans from government, universities and colleges, and research institutions, to collaborate on educational and research programs. We share with Mexico a commitment to quality, accessible education for all, and the United States will continue to work with Mexico to prepare the next generation for the challenges of the 21st century, to increase North American competitiveness, and to help ensure economic prosperity.
In his remarks, the Vice President recognized the great opportunities our countries share for increased academic and student exchange, robust joint research, and greater linkages among our higher education and research organizations.
The work of the Bilateral Forum complements President Obama's 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative, which is increasing opportunities for academic exchange between the United States and Latin America, including Mexico. Similarly, the Bilateral Forum supports the goals of the U.S-Mexico High Level Economic Dialogue (HLED) by ensuring that Mexicans and Americans work together on the cutting edge of new technologies and thinking to invigorate both our economies.
