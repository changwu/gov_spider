At 11:58am, the First Ladies walked inside of the Members Room to sign the guest book. Library staff then showed what appeared to be mostly Mexican artifacts, books and art along a line of table displays to Dr. Biden and Dr. Gutiérrez.
At 12:12 during the exhibition, Dr. Biden inquired about whether they buy the artwork or if they are donated. She was told by a staff that it's a mix of both.
One artist in particular that seemed to be of interest to Dr. Biden is Ester Hernandez. She inquired about her name to ensure she would remember.
