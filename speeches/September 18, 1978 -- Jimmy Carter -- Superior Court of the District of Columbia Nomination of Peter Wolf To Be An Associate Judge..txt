    The President today announced that he will nominate Peter Wolf to the District of Columbia Superior Court. Wolf will fill the seat vacated by former Chief Judge Harold Greene, who left the Superior Court when the President appointed him to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.
Wolf, 43, received Bachelor's and Master's Degrees in engineering from Cornell University and attended law school at Harvard. He has engaged in civil and criminal practice since being admitted to the bar in the District of Columbia in 1962 and is now partner in the law firm of Wolf and Kovner.
