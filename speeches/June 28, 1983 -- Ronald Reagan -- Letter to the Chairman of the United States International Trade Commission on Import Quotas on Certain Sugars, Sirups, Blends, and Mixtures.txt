    Dear Mr. Chairman:
Pursuant to Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended, I have been advised by the Secretary of Agriculture, and I agree with him, that there is reason to believe that certain articles containing sugar or sirups derived from sugarcane or sugar beets are practically certain to be imported under such conditions, at such prices, and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price support program for sugarcane and sugar beets undertaken by the Department of Agriculture.
Specifically, reference is made to the following articles:
Blended sirups provided for in TSUS item 155.75, containing sugars derived from sugarcane or sugar beets, capable of being further processed or mixed with similar or other ingredients, and not prepared for marketing to the retail consumers in the identical form and package in which imported;
Articles provided for in TSUS item 183.01 and 183.05, containing not less than 25 percent by dry weight of any sugars or blends of sugars provided for in Subpart A of part 10 of Schedule 1 of the TSUS, whether or not mixed with other ingredients, and capable of being further processed or mixed with similar or other ingredients; and
All other articles, wherever classified in the TSUS, containing over 65 percent by dry weight of sugars derived from sugarcane or sugar beets, whether or not mixed with other ingredients, and capable of being further processed or mixed with similar or other ingredients, except articles within the scope of other import restrictions provided for in part 3 of the Appendix to the TSUS.
The United States International Trade Commission is therefore directed to make an investigation under Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended, to determine whether the above described articles are being, or are practically certain to be, imported under such conditions, at such prices, and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective or materially interfere with the price support program of the Department of Agriculture for sugarcane and sugar beets, and to report its findings and recommendations to me at the earliest practicable date.
The Secretary has also determined and reported to me, pursuant to Section 22(b) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended, that a condition exists requiring emergency treatment with respect to certain articles containing sugar or sirups derived from sugarcane or sugar beets as described below, and has therefore recommended that I take prompt action under Section 22(b) to restrict the quantity of these articles which may be entered. I have therefore this day issued a proclamation establishing quotas of zero pounds for the following articles:
Blended sirups provided for in TSUS item 155.75, containing sugars derived from sugarcane or sugar beets, capable of being further processed or mixed with similar or other ingredients, and not prepared for marketing to the retail consumers in the identical form and package in which imported; and,
Articles containing over 65 percent by dry weight of sugars derived from sugarcane or sugar beets, whether or not mixed with other ingredients, capable of being further processed or mixed with similar or other ingredients, and not prepared for marketing to the retail consumers in the identical form and package in which imported; all the foregoing articles, provided for in TSUS items 155.75, 156.45, 183.01, and 183.05, except articles within the scope of other import restrictions provided for in part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States.
These quotas will continue in effect pending the report and recommendations of the United States International Trade Commission and action that I may take thereon. Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
[The Honorable Alfred E. Eckes, Chairman, United States International Trade Commission, 701 E Street NW., Washington, D.C. 20436]
