    I called the President that we were informed shortly after 7:30 a.m. that the bodies and survivor had been returned. I called the President immediately. The President welcomed the release of the survivor and return of the bodies; however, he deplored the loss of life and the excessive reaction to an unarmed and inadvertent intrusion.
He and Mrs. Carter again expressed their sympathy and condolences to the families of those who died.
