    Pinal County (Ariz.) Sheriff Paul Babeu made the following statement on tonight's debate in Las Vegas:
"Mitt Romney was the clear winner of tonight's debate because he again showed that he is the only candidate committed to implementing policies that will secure our border. While some candidates support the magnets that draw illegal immigrants into our country, Mitt Romney will put a stop to incentives for illegal immigrants to cross our border. Governor Romney stands with all of us who believe that we can and must secure our border -- that's why I'm proud to stand with him and support him as our next president."
