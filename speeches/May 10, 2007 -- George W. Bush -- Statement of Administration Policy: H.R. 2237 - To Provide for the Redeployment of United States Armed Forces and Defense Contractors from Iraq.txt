    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Sponsor: McGovern (D), Massachusetts)
The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2237, as introduced in the House. Precipitous withdrawal from Iraq is not a plan to bring peace to the region or to make our people safer here at home. Withdrawal could embolden our enemies and confirm their belief that America will not stand behind its commitments. Setting a date for withdrawal is equivalent to setting a date for failure, and could lead to a safe haven in Iraq for terrorism that could be used to attack America and freedom-loving people around the world. It is likely to unleash chaos in Iraq that could spread across the region. In addition to infringing upon the President's constitutional authority as Commander in Chief, the bill would require a precipitous withdrawal of troops that itself could increase the probability that American troops would have to one day return to Iraq â€“ to confront an even more dangerous enemy. If H.R. 2237 were presented to the President, he would veto the bill.
