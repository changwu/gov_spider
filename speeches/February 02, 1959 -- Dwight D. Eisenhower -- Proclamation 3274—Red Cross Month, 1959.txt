  A Proclamation

Whereas the American National Red Cross is the organization officially designated by the Congress to carry out certain great humanitarian works, including welfare services to the armed form of the United States and their families; and
Whereas under Federal laws and regulations the Red Cross provides emergency relief to our citizens in time of disaster and gives needed assistance in restoring stricken communities to normal living; and
Whereas, true to the broad principles on which the Red Cross was founded, the American National Red Cross has worked with eighty-one other Red Cross societies for the alleviation of suffering and distress in our land and overseas; and
Whereas through its blood program, home nursing, first aid, water safety, and other voluntary services, the Red Cross helps to safeguard the health of our people and to advance the American traditions of generous and responsible citizenship:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American National Red Cross, do hereby designate March 1959 as Red Cross Month; and I urge all Americans to honor the Red Cross during that month by fully supporting it as a channel of charitable concern for their neighbors in need.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this second day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-third.

DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
