    On behalf of the American people, I want to express our deepest condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives and homes in the devastating floods and mudslides in Mexico, which have taken hundreds of lives and left tens of thousands of people homeless. It was less than a month ago that Hurricane Floyd brought flooding to the States along our own east coast, reminding us of the pain such tragedies can bring and of the importance of neighbor helping neighbor in times of crisis. In the days ahead, our thoughts and prayers will be with our good friends, the people of Mexico, as they work to rebuild from these terrible tragedies. As a people and a Government, we stand ready to help in any way we can.
