    In Cairo, Second Lady Karen Pence participated in a discussion about the growing need for more art therapists in Egypt. Mrs. Pence was joined by the only practicing art therapist and staff from the Wellness Hub, which is one of the locations where the art therapist provides art therapy to clients.
"Art therapy is a new profession in Egypt with only one art therapist who is trained to provide art therapy treatment," said Mrs. Pence. "I appreciate the opportunity to meet with art therapist Carol Hammal and the founder of the Wellness Hub. The visit was very insightful and I hope our discussion brings awareness to the need for more art therapists in Egypt. Currently, there isn't a program in Egypt where people can study to become art therapists. I was encouraged to learn that one of Carol's main goals is to get an art therapy education program in Egypt."
