Subject: in-town print pool report #1 -- no timing yet for address 
This is your pooler check-in. Debra Saunders of the Las Vegas Review Journal kindly agreed to swap pool duty with me today.
I have asked and there is no word from the White House yet on the timing for the president's televised address to the nation on Iran.
The only other thing on the president's schedule is a 2:15 p.m. intelligence briefing.
I'll be sure to update you when I get the word on a time for the address.

Subject: Print pool report #3 - pool gathering 
Pool has been called to gather at the Palm Room doors to wait for entrance into the Grand Foyer for the president's address on Iran.
The remarks will be public - both on tv and live-streamed here: https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/
I will provide any color I see from my vantage point both before and after the address.

Subject: Print pool report #4 - Grand Foyer scene 
Pool was ushered into the Grand Foyer at 10:28 am.
There is no word from White House whether POTUS will stick to prepared remarks or take questions.
There's two teleprompters set up in front of the podium with the official presidential seal and an audience of roughly 40 people seated in gold chairs. No one recognizable to pool in the audience - and I have not been given a list of guest names.
No sign of Pompeo or other top administration officials yet. Other than the usual din of television preset and microphone checks, there's been a few sets of musical chair rearranging of the audience but otherwise fairly calm.
I am including a phot of the scene.

Subject: Print pool report #5 - updated photo 
The room is much more crowded now with press and cameras filling in the far corners around the audience.
I'm sending an updated photo. POTUS is now 18 mins late with no official word on when he will make his entrance and begin the address.
I'm also told pool will likely be getting a read-our/list on the "guests" that formed the audience.

Subject: print pool report #8 - more color and lunch lid until 2 p.m. 
Fellow reporters point out that Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley was one of the military leaders standing behind the president.
Colleagues also confirm that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was also in the room for the speech, standing on the right-hand side, behind the audience next to a column.
No word yet on the identity of the audience members. Pool saw one of audience members wearing a lanyard with the words "White House Situation Room" on it. I could not make out what identification card was on the lanyard.
White House just called a lunch lid at 2 p.m.
