    The Democratic Party and its allies in the media, academia, Hollywood and corporate America are weaponizing race to divide our country and win political power. According to the radical left, racism is rampant in America and must be remedied by a progressive agenda that defunds our police, releases violent criminals without bail, and indoctrinates our children to believe their future is dictated by their skin color.

When the Biden liberals cynically play the race card, they cheapen my grandfather's journey. He was born in 1921 in the Jim Crow south and watched his family go from cotton to Congress in his lifetime.
When the radical left claims America is an evil, declining country, they cheapen my single mother's sacrifice. She worked 16-hour days as a nurse's aide to keep our lights on. Now the hands that changed bedpans hold the Bible when her son takes the oath of office.
