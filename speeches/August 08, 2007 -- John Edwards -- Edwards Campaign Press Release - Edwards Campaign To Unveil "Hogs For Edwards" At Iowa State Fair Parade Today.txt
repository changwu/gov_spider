    Unique display highlights Edwards' support of family farms, not agribusiness, and a moratorium on environmentally harmful concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs)
Des Moines, Iowa - At today's Iowa State Fair Parade, the John Edwards for President Campaign will unveil "Hogs for Edwards" – a unique float with eight Berkshire hogs from an Iowa family farm. The float will call attention to the need to support the Iowa family farm, and a moratorium on concentrated animal feeding operations that have devastated rural economies and water quality.
"The State Fair Parade is a great Iowa tradition and the campaign is looking forward to participating and having some fun," said John Edwards for President Iowa Communications Director Dan Leistikow. "It's also a chance to call attention to a serious issue. As president, John Edwards will stand up for the family farm by passing a moratorium on these huge hog operations that do so much damage to the environment and to the tradition of family farming."
Since 1978, the number of hog farms in Iowa has declined from 59,143 to 8,900 as more and more family farms have gone out of business and huge agribusiness operations have taken over. Senator Edwards supports a moratorium on these huge, concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and the environmental destruction they produce. This is part of the Rural Recovery Act – a comprehensive plan by Edwards to revitalize rural communities and help family farmers compete.
