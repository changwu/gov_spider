    President Bush. Mr. Prime Minister, welcome back. It's such an honor to have you here.
I have been most impressed by Jose's leadership style, his candor, and his honesty. And I appreciate very much his friendship. We have had a lot of dialogs over the past months. Of course, he welcomed me and others to the Azores. And I value his advice. He's a good, honest fellow who cares deeply about basic values. He cares deeply about peace and freedom. And I treasure my relationship with the Prime Minister.
I'm really glad you came. I want to thank you for being here. I look forward to a good, candid discussion today and a good lunch and, on behalf of the American people, welcome you back to the Oval Office.
Prime Minister Durao Barroso. Thank you very much, Mr. President, for this warm welcome. I believe that recent trials put our nations even closer. It was a great European that once said that no noble things can be done without risks. You were able to take great risks in Iraq; we supported you.
Now you are taking great risks in the Middle East peace process. Let me congratulate you for that initiative, for reenergizing the peace process. I think the United States of America and Europe—Portugal being a European country—we have a lot to do together, and I am very much looking forward to this opportunity to discuss with you and, always with the spirit of friendship that exists between the Portuguese and the American people, discuss all these ideas.
And we'll stand by you, because I think that what you have been doing is really great achievement. We have won the war. Now we all have to win the peace. And I think that we are going to reach that goal.
President Bush. Thank you.
