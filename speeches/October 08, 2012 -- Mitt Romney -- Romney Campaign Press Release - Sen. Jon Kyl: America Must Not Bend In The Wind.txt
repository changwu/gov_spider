    Arizona Senator Jon Kyl today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's foreign policy speech:
"As recent events in the Middle East make plain, we are perhaps at one of the great turning points of the world order. This is not a time for America to bend to the wind, but instead we must apply our influence and our principles to shape the course of events. In his speech today, Mitt Romney set forward a vision to preserve our interests and ideals that flows directly from the best aspects of our country's character and experience. His clear thinking, acknowledgment of history, and commitment to restore American leadership are essential for a successful foreign policy."
