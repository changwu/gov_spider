    George Christian was an honorable, decent, and kind man who represented the best of public service, and he was devoted to his family. He was a statesman of the highest integrity. He also was a great Texan, whose wise counsel was sought by generations of leaders. Laura joins me in offering our most heartfelt condolences to the Christian family. We are grateful for the life he lived and the many positive contributions he made to his country and to his State.
