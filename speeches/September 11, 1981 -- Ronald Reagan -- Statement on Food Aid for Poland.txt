    Today's shipment by Catholic Relief Services will provide food for thousands of children, the aged, and the infirm who have experienced severe shortages during the past months. Through the initiative of Catholic Relief Services, the spirited people of Poland will feel the compassion of the American people, who have frequently demonstrated their willingness to lend a hand to the needy around the world.
The milk shipped today was purchased by Catholic Relief Services from the U.S. Government at a favorable price using funds collected in Catholic churches throughout the United States. The distribution in Poland will be handled by the Catholic bishops there and will be based solely on need, rather than on religious or political considerations. I am happy that we are able to be a part of this important humanitarian effort. It is through voluntary agencies like Catholic Relief Services that the American people can express their concern for those who suffer the indignities of hunger and poverty.
