    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 6/24/91)(House)(Moakley (D) Massachusetts)
The Administration does not object to House passage of H.R. 2332. However, the Administration will seek an amendment in the Senate to shorten the four month extension period currently specified in the bill.
Congress intended this registration program to be self-funding. However, as the result of a recent District Court order, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is no longer permitted to collect fees from all registrants. To the extent that fees do not recover the costs of the program, the INS will therefore be required to reduce funding for other Immigration programs.
