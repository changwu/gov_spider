    Today, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement on the ongoing flood response in Louisiana: 
"This month's floods in Louisiana are a crisis that demand a national response. More than 30,000 people have been rescued by the Coast Guard, National Guard, and other emergency responders. Thousands of people have lost everything. At least 13 lost their lives. We must make sure that all resources are brought to bear in responding to the crisis and helping communities rebuild.
"That is why I have called on supporters of this campaign to give what they can to the Red Cross, to bring much-needed aid and supplies to the more than 100,000 people affected by the floods. We also need to make sure that this crisis is not compounded by another, by ensuring mosquito abatement is happening hand-in-hand with flood response, to reduce the riska of mosquitoes that could carry the Zika virus from gaining a foothold in Louisiana.
"The best way to help Louisianans affected by these terrible floods is to make sure they have the resources they need today. I am committed to visiting communities affected by these floods, at a time when the presence of a political campaign will not disrupt the response, to discuss how we can and will rebuild together.
"In times of crisis, Americans have always come together to lift each other up, support each other, and rebuild stronger and better than before. That is what we must do now in Louisiana, and I am committed to standing with Louisianans every step of the way."
