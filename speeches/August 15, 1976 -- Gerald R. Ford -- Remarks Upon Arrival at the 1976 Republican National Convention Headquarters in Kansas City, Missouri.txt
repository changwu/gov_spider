    It is wonderful to be back in Kansas City. What a wonderful welcome. And I can say without any hesitation or qualification, this is the kind of enthusiasm that will give us a victory on Wednesday night.
Now, let me say I am not going to make a speech. But I do want to introduce some very good, very close friends of mine: first, the Vice President of the United States, Nelson Rockefeller; then, one of my best friends and one of the most ardent and effective supporters, a great Governor of my State, Governor Bill Milliken, and Mrs. Milliken; then, another very good friend--and you can't miss him--the chairman of the President Ford Committee, Rog Morton.
I have got a few of the members of my wonderful family here. First, a young lady who is going to be a temporary resident of the great State of Kansas when she goes to--she will be entering Kansas University this fall. She loves her photography like I love those uncommitted delegates. [Laughter] Susan.
And then, our third son, Steve, he likes to ride the ranges up in Montana or Utah or California. He's promised to stay in the saddle for the next 4 years. [Laughter] Then Jack, who has been out campaigning month after month after month. Jack Ford.
And then last but not least, the most effective campaigner in the Ford family [Betty Ford]. She has more President buttons with her name on it than I do. [Laughter]
Mike and his wonderful wife, Gayle, are going to come out here on Tuesday. The whole Ford family will be here for a reunion before we win on Wednesday night.
Thank you all. We are really just tremendously impressed with the warmth, the numbers, and the wonderful welcome that you have all given us. Let me say we will not let you down, and we know we are going to win. Thank you very much.
