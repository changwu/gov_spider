    
  By the President of the United States of America
  A Proclamation

1. On May 17, 1995, the United States and Poland signed a Record of Understanding Between Poland and the United States of America on Agricultural Items, which provides for an increase in the allocation to Poland of the in-quota quantity of the tariff-rate quota on Italian-type cheeses.
2. Section 404(d)(3) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act ("the URAA") (19 U.S.C. 3601(d)(3)) authorizes the President to allocate the in-quota quantity of a tariff-rate quota for any agricultural product among supplying countries or customs areas and to modify any allocation as the President determines appropriate.
3. Accordingly, pursuant to section 404(d)(3) of the URAA, I have determined that it is appropriate to proclaim an increase in the allocation to Poland of the in-quota quantity of the tariff-rate quota for Italian-type cheeses.
4. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended ("the 1974 Act") (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States ("the HTS") the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. The modification of the allocation to Poland of the in-quota quantity of the tariff-rate quota for Italian-type cheeses is such an action.
Now, Therefore, I, William J. Clinton, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to section 404(d)(3) of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3601(d)(3)) and section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), do proclaim that:
(1) Additional U.S. note 21 to chapter 4 of the HTS is modified by deleting the quantity "1,100,000" set out opposite Poland and inserting "1,325,000" in lieu thereof.
(2) This proclamation is effective with respect to goods entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after the date of signature of this proclamation.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twentieth.

WILLIAM J. CLINTON
