    Today I have signed into law H.R. 4649, the "District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 1995." This Act provides $712 million in Federal appropriations for the District of Columbia.
The Act requires the District of Columbia to reduce total FY 1995 spending from District funds by $140 million. The Act includes enforcement mechanisms that require a reduction in the FY 1996 Federal payment if the District fails to balance its FY 1995 budget. The Act also includes a provision that requires the District to reduce its total employment level by 2,000 full-time equivalent positions in FY 1995.
Consistent with the Administration's request, the Act directs the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study that addresses the longerterm capital improvements and operation and maintenance requirements of the Washington Aqueduct facility. The study will consider alternative methods of financing such operation and maintenance and capital improvements, as well as alternative arrangements for ownership of the Washington Aqueduct facility. The study will be conducted in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of Management and Budget, and the nonfederal public water customers of the Washington Aqueduct.
