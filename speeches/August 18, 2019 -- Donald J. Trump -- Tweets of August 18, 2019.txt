The Failing New York Times in one of the most devastating portrayals of bad journalism in history got caught by a leaker that they are shifting from their Phony Russian Collusion Narrative (the Mueller Report & his testimony were a total disaster) to a Racism Witch Hunt.....Retweets: 27562Favorites: 113734

.....'Journalism' has reached a new low in the history of our Country. It is nothing more than an evil propaganda machine for the Democrat Party. The reporting is so false biased and evil that it has now become a very sick joke...But the public is aware! #CROOKEDJOURNALISMRetweets: 26514Favorites: 110332

Juan Williams at @FoxNews is so pathetic and yet when he met me in the Fox Building lobby he couldn't have been nicer as he asked me to take a picture of him and me for his family. Yet he is always nasty and wrong!Retweets: 22046Favorites: 99343

Our economy is the best in the world by far. Lowest unemployment ever within almost all categories. Poised for big growth after trade deals are completed. Import prices down China eating Tariffs. Helping targeted Farmers from big Tariff money coming in. Great future for USA!Retweets: 18612Favorites: 77659

House Democrats want to take action against Israel because it is fighting back against two (maybe four) people that have said unthinkably bad things about it & the Israeli people. Dems have such disdain for Israel! What happened? AOC Plus 4 is the new face of the Democrat Party!Retweets: 23467Favorites: 92002
