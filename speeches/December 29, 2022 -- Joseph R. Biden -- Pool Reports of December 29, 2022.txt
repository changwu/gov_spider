Out of town pool report #3 — Biden signs omnibus
From the White House:
The President signed the fiscal year 2023 bipartisan government funding bill, which advances key priorities for our country and caps off a year of historic bipartisan progress for the American people.
The bill will advance cutting-edge research on cancer and other diseases, make communities safer, deliver for our veterans, prioritize mental health care, improve access to high quality health care for Indian country, and strengthen worker protections for pregnant women. It also provides the resources needed to support Ukraine, provides the highest funding level for the Violence Against Women Act in history, and takes long overdue action to shore up our democracy and preserve the will of the people by reforming the Electoral Count Act.
