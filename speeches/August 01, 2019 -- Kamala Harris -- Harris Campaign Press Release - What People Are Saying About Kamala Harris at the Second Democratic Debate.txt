    The Reviews Are In: Kamala Harris Delivers Commanding Performance at Second Debate
"Strong," "Powerful", "Dominated" are just some of the reviews after another great debate
Last night, Senator Kamala Harris delivered another commanding debate performance, focusing on the issues that keep people up at night, and once again proving she's the best candidate to prosecute the case against four more years of Donald Trump.
Harris dove deep into the issues and focused on her 3AM Agenda that will have a direct and immediate impact on everyday Americans' lives. She emphasized the need for equal pay and holding businesses accountable for paying employees unfairly. She took on Trump's reckless trade policy harming American farmers, and she made the case for why her Medicare for All plan is the best way to ensure universal coverage.
By focusing on policy and calling out Trump for his broken promises to American families, Harris did exactly what the voters are looking for: she demonstrated why she is the best candidate to beat Donald Trump.
Here's what people are saying after Harris' successful debate night:

Robert Garcia, Mayor of Long Beach, CA: Kamala Harris is the candidate who can make clear arguments and take tough questions from anyone. She can take the heat and look poised while doing it. She's the candidate to take on Donald Trump


Mike Memoli, NBC News: Harris has one of the clearer hits on Trump record not matching his campaign rhetoric


Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL: Kamala Harris calls out the predator in the White House in a very compelling way. She really knows how to make the case.


Joe Garofoli, San Francisco Chronicle: Harris with a strong general election argument against Trump: He let people down -- especially the people who voted for him.


Paul Begala, Democratic strategist: Kamala Harris's closing is chilling. Usually these statements are formulaic. Hers is so powerful. Trump as a predator will ring true to many Democrats.


Charlotte Clymer, communications at the Human Rights Campaign: Kamala Harris hit the pay inequality question out of the park. Perfect.


Bradley Whitford, actor: Strong close by @KamalaHarris


Mo Elleithee, former DNC communications director: Harris with a powerful close.


Charlotte Clymer, communications at the Human Rights Campaign: Kamala Harris is having a very strong second half. I would say better than anyone.


DJ Jackson, South Carolina Faith Leader: Kamala Harris is looking to fix the health care crisis. Her plan for Medicare-for-All will ensure South Carolinians receive universal coverage WITHOUT raising middle class taxes, what's to argue about?


Pramila Jayapal, United States Congresswoman from Washington: Thank you Kamala Harris for raising the Hyde Amendment. We must repeal it. Period. Full stop. We should never have allowed it to become law to start with.


Kevin de Leon, CA Senate President pro Tempore Emeritus: Can we just skip to the part where Kamala Harris shows Trump what it means to be a President that fights For The People? She's ready.


Natasha Korecki, Politico: Kamala Harris in her element on this question about the Mueller Report.


Ilyse Hogue, President of NARAL: A conversation about the urgent need to repeal Hyde on stage at Democratic Debate is so important for a party that relies on women, especially women of color, to prevail. Glad to hear it; Thx to Kamala Harris for raising it and thx to all for who fight fir reproductive freedom!


Lauren Rankin, reproductive rights activist: Thank you, Kamala Harris, for calling out Joe Biden's egregious defense and support of the discriminatory Hyde Amendment, which bars low-income women from exercising their constitutional right to a safe, legal abortion.


Wajahat Ali, opinion writer at the New York Times: Kamala bringing all the receipts about unequal pay for women, mentioning black women and native American women as well. Talking about fining corporations.


Sarah Silverman, activist and entertainer: Kamala's plan for equal pay is RIGHT ON

Jack Buckley, Former Mayor of Dover, NH: "Kamala dominated on the debate stage tonight.

Susan Riordan, co-founder of Emerge South Carolina: "@KamalaHarris is fighting for the 100,000 South Carolinians without health insurance. Joe Biden is basically chanting 'Better things aren't possible'. I'm proud to back the fighter and leader in this race."
