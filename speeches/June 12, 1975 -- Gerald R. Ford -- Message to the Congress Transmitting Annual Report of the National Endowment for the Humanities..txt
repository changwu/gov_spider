    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit the Ninth Annual Report of the National Endowment for the Humanities for fiscal 1974.
The humanistic traditions upon which this Nation was built still provide the moral and political basis of our life as a people. In fiscal 1974, the Humanities Endowment approached its first decade of grant making with projects designed to bring the insights of the humanities to all Americans.
The Endowment's efforts over the past ten years have been noteworthy. Public support for its programs and objectives can be measured by its increasing ability to attract public contributions that have, in the past five years, exceeded the federally appropriated funds set aside to match them. I am happy to note that in 1974 private citizens, foundations, and corporations donated over $6.5 million. This reaffirmation of public confidence justifies, I believe, the strong support the Endowment has received from both the legislative and the executive branches.
