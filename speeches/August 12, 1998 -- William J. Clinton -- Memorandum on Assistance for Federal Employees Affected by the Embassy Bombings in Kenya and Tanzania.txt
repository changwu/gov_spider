    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies 
Subject: Assistance for Federal Employees Affected by the Bombings at U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
I am deeply saddened by the loss of life and suffering caused by the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. I convey my deepest sympathy and heartfelt sorrow to those affected by these senseless acts of violence. The Federal Government is committed to assist employees and their families in responding to this tragedy.
As part of this effort, I ask the heads of executive departments and agencies having Federal civilian employees affected by the bombings (including Foreign Service National employees) to excuse from duty, without charge to leave or loss of pay, any such employee who is prevented from reporting to work or faced with a personal emergency because of the bombings and who can be spared from his or her usual responsibilities. This policy should also be applied to any employee who is needed for security, relief, or recovery efforts as authorized by the chief of mission at each embassy.
I am also directing the Office of Personnel Management to establish an emergency leave transfer program under which employees in any executive agency may donate unused annual leave for transfer to employees of the same or other agencies who were adversely affected by the bombings and who need additional time off for recovery. Workers' compensation benefits are available in the case of Federal employees who were injured or killed in the bombing, as are certain other benefits. I am further directing the Office of Personnel Management and the Department of Labor to provide additional information and assistance as appropriate.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
