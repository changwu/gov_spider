    Hillary and I were saddened today to learn of the death of Carl Albert. Carl served his country in Congress through three decades, as majority whip, majority leader, and ultimately, Speaker of the House.
Working with President Johnson, he played an invaluable role crafting the greatest effort America had ever launched against poverty. And as the 46th Speaker, he led the House during a trying time in our Nation's history. Through it all, he kept his gaze focused on the national interest. Carl Albert was a true statesman. Our prayers go out to family and friends.
