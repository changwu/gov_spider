    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act, as amended by the Social Security Amendments of 1977 (Public Law 95-216, 42 U.S.C. 433(e)(1)), I transmit herewith a social security totalization agreement with Hungary, titled, "Agreement on Social Security between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Hungary," and a related agreement titled, "Administrative Arrangement for the Implementation of the Agreement on Social Security between the United States of America and the Government of Hungary" (collectively the "Agreements"). The Agreements were signed in Budapest, Hungary, on February 3, 2015.
The Agreements are similar in objective to the social security agreements already in force with most European Union countries, Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Norway, the Republic of Korea, and Switzerland. Such bilateral agreements provide for limited coordination between the United States and foreign social security systems to eliminate dual social security coverage and taxation, and to help prevent the lost benefit protection that can occur when workers divide their careers between two countries.
The Agreements contain all provisions mandated by section 233 of the Social Security Act and the provisions that I deem appropriate to carry out the purposes of section 233, pursuant to section 233(c)(4) of the Social Security Act.
I also transmit for the information of the Congress a report required by section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act on the estimated number of individuals who will be affected by the Agreements and the estimated cost effect. The Department of State and the Social Security Administration have recommended the Agreements to me.
I commend the Agreements and related documents.
