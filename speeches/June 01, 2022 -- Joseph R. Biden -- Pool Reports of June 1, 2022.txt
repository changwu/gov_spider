In-town pool report #9 — virtual roundtable ending
POTUS was seated at a desk on stage with in-person and virtual on-screen guests. The meeting lasted about an hour as POTUS walked in at 2:47 PM, (not "pool" as stated on the previous report). The meeting ended at 3:45 PM. Biden took a few questions from press.
POTUS spoke for around eights minutes at the top of the meeting, laying out recent efforts by the administration to address the baby formula shortage.
POTUS also announced the latest effort to fly the equivalent of 4.6 million 8-ounce baby bottles of Bubs Australia infant formula to Pennsylvania and California on June 9 and June 11, respectively.
POTUS asked several questions to manufacturers throughout the hour-long meeting and briefly.
POTUS took a few questions afterwards. Here's a rough transcription. Please refer to WH transcript.
POTUS to press when asked if the administration anticipated the shortage after one manufacturer's executive said that he and his company did anticipate what it meant for a large facility to close
"I don't think anyone anticipated the impact of the shutdown of one facility… And so once we learned the extent of it, and how broad it was it kicked everything into gear."
When pushed about manufacturers saying they anticipated the formula deficit, Biden responded "The did. But I didn't."
Pooler will send more after press secretary briefing to start in "two minutes."
