    Hoosiers are saddened today to learn of the passing of one of our greatest statesmen, Senator Richard Lugar. Senator Lugar's contributions to the life of our nation are countless. Richard Lugar was a leader not only in the Senate but also on the world stage, where he worked tirelessly to bring pressure to end apartheid in South Africa and enforce treaties that destroyed Soviet weapons of mass destruction. As the longest serving member of Congress from Indiana, and a Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient, he leaves behind a legacy of public service that will inspire Hoosiers for generations. Senator Lugar was also a friend and mentor throughout our public career and we will miss his kindness, example and wisdom. Indiana and America will never forget the leadership and service of Senator Richard Lugar. Karen and I offer our deepest sympathies to his wife Char, the entire Lugar family and all who cherish the memory of this good man and truly remarkable public servant.
