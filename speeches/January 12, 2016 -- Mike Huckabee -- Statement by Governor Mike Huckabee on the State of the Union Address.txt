    DES MOINES, Iowa- Gov. Mike Huckabee released the following statement in response to the President's State of the Union address:
"Obama's endless excuses are out-of-control and Americans have had enough. He pats himself on the back for giving us an Affordable Care Act no one can afford. He glows and grins about an economy that's punching millions of Americans in the gut. And he refuses to accept an ounce of responsibility for his epic foreign policy disasters. Set aside our Union, Obama's mind is in a state of confusion, delusion and decay.
"It's time we stop bankrupting Social Security, Medicare and our childrens' future and start acting like the United States. It's time we quit making excuses for radical Islam, attacking Christians and apologizing for being Americans. I'm running for President to burn down the corrupt Washington political machine and put Americans first."
