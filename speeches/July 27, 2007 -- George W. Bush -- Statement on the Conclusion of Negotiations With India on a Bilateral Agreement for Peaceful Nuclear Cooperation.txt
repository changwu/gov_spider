    I welcome the conclusion of negotiations on a bilateral agreement between the United States and India for peaceful nuclear cooperation. I commend those from both countries who have worked hard to make this deal happen, and I look forward to working with Congress to realize this important initiative. This marks another step in the continued progress that is deepening our strategic partnership with India, a vital world leader.
