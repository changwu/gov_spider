Boston, MA – Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced that 13 additional Tennessee state elected leaders have joined the Romney for President team. These Tennessee leaders were previously part of Senator Fred Thompson's campaign team, and they represent a wide cross section of the Tennessee population including all of the State's three Grand Divisions.
"I'm proud to support Governor Mitt Romney for President. Washington is broken – and we're not going to fix it by sending the same people back just to sit in different chairs. Governor Romney is uniquely qualified to bring change to Washington, D.C. Throughout his career, he has been an agent of change. He created jobs in the private sector. He turned around the ethically and financially challenged 2002 Winter Olympic Games. And as the chief executive of Massachusetts, he cut taxes and promoted innovative solutions that created jobs and expanded health coverage," said former Tennessee Governor Winfield Dunn.
In making today's announcement Governor Romney said, "I appreciate the support of these strong Republican leaders from Tennessee. All over the country people are saying that Washington is broken. I believe that I have the experience and plan to fix it. Together, we can stimulate our economy by cutting taxes, we can strengthen our military, we can end illegal immigration, and we can build stronger families. I look forward to working with these leaders to earn the support of as many Tennesseans as possible."
