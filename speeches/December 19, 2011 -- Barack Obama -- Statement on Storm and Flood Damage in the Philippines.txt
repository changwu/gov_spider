    On behalf of the American people, I wish to express my deep condolences for the tremendous loss of life and devastation caused by recent flooding in the Philippines. In the spirit of our long history of friendship and cooperation with the Philippines, the United States stands ready to assist the Philippine people and Government should humanitarian assistance and recovery efforts be needed.
