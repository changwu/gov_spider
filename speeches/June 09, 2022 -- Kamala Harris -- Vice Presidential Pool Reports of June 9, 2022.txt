VP travel pool report #4 - CARICOM meeting
Delegations from the 14 Caribbean nations entered the "multilateral room" at 12:30pm. Pool waited outside as they filed in.
Pool entered at 12:40 pm. The VP was already seated at the center of the room at a U-shaped table and began welcoming Caribbean leaders.
She said US partnership with CARICOM is "key to our shared prosperity and security."
"Today, our main focus will be the climate crisis, which of course is an existential crisis for our entire planet," she said. The Caribbean " is on the frontlines of this crisis."
She announced the launch of her initiative, calling it the "United States government's primary mechanism for addressing energy security as a climate crisis in this region."
"Through this partnership, we will support energy, infrastructure, and climate resilience at every stage of development, from beginning to end."
She said the US will provide technical assistance, bring in investors and improve access to development financing to "make these projects a reality."
CARICOM Secretary General Dr. Carla Barnett gave a few remarks, noting that the pandemic has "had a disproportionate impact on the already overwhelmed socioeconomic fabric of the Caribbean."
Barnett said they see "energy security is a critical matter" as they transition energy systems to more modern and reliable supplies.
Pool was escorted out at 12:48pm.
