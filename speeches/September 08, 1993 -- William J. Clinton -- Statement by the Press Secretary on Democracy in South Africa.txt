    The President welcomes the historic decision in South Africa to establish a transitional executive council in anticipation of South Africa's first democratic election next April. He commends all those who achieved this important step along the road to a peaceful transition to democracy in South Africa and looks forward to the ratification of the agreement by South Africa's Parliament next week.
In separate phone calls this afternoon to State President F.W. de Klerk and African National Congress President Nelson Mandela, President Clinton congratulated the two leaders on the historic breakthrough and said, "The historic agreement on the transitional executive council paves the way for the transition to a multiracial, democratic South Africa. The United States will remain a partner in the process of building democracy and promoting economic development in South Africa." President Clinton indicated that the United States looks forward to announcing a number of new initiatives to support the smooth transition to democracy.
