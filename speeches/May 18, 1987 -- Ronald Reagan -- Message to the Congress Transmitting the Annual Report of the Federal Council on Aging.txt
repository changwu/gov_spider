    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with Section 204(f) of the Older Americans Act of 1965, as amended, I hereby transmit the Annual Report for 1986 of the Federal Council on Aging. The report reflects the Council's views in its role of examining programs serving older Americans.
It should be noted that the Council's recommendations do not reflect the Administration's views on reauthorization of the Older Americans Act. I urge the Congress to act favorably on the reauthorization proposal transmitted to the Congress by the Department of Health and Human Services.
RONALD REAGAN
The White House,
May 18, 1987.
