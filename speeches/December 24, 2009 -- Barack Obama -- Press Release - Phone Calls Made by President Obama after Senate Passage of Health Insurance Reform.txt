    President Obama made the following phone calls this morning following the Senate's passage of H.R. 3590:
-- Mrs. Vicki Reggie Kennedy.
-- Mr. David Turner of Little Rock, Arkansas. Mr. Turner had his health insurance rescinded in January of last year, after his insurance company went back into his record and alleged that he failed to disclose his full medical record at the time he applied for coverage. Mr. Turner was the First Lady's guest at the President's address to the joint session of Congress in September of 2009. The President told Mr. Turner that stories like his motivate him every day to keep working on health insurance reform, and he assured Mr. Turner that he will continue to work to pass health legislation to ban rescission and other abusive practices.
