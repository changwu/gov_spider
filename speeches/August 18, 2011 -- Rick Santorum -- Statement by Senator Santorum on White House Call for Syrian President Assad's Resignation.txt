    Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following statement in response to President Obama's call for Syrian President Assad to step down.
"Assad's regime has the blood of freedom seeking Syrians on its hands. It is about time that the Obama Administration stepped to the plate and called for the long-awaited resignation of President Assad. Nearly a decade ago I worked to remove the Syrian threat from the doorstep of our ally Israel, and it is shocking that it has taken President Obama this long to realize that Syria is a threat to not just the region, but to its own people," concluded Senator Santorum.
Senator Santorum was the author of the bipartisan Syria Accountability Act, which was signed into law by President Bush in 2003. This critical piece of legislation to not just American security, but Israeli security, worked to end Syria's presence in Lebanon and end the illegal shipment of military goods to anti-U.S. forces in Iraq.
