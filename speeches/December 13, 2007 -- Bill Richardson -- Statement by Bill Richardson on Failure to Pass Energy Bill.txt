    DES MOINES, IA-- New Mexico Governor and Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Richardson today released the following statement on the failure of the Senate to pass the energy bill:
"The Congress and the President are locked in a dysfunctional relationship, and it is not working for the American people. Yesterday the President vetoed health care for kids. Today he is threatening to veto the green jobs and clean air that come from real energy reform. Stripping the tax incentives to make it palatable to President Bush denies the American people the key mechanism for energy reform.
"Tax incentives work. I have used them in New Mexico, and they are imperative to stimulating the new energy economy that this country so desperately needs.
"This is the deepest, coldest part of winter, and sustained gas and home heating and fuel prices are hurting American families. President Bush is offering no leadership, and now the Senate once again has failed to pass meaningful legislation. Now, instead of continuing to push for reform, the Republicans are siding with big oil against the interests of the American people.
"We do not need more half-measures on energy; we need a revolution. I am proud that the Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters have called my energy plan the most aggressive offered by any candidate running for President.
"I am proud to recently have authored a book on this subject, LEADING BY EXAMPLE: How We Can Inspire an Energy and Security Revolution, and I am proud to be the only candidate in the race to seriously have tackled this issue as Secretary of Energy and Governor of New Mexico."
