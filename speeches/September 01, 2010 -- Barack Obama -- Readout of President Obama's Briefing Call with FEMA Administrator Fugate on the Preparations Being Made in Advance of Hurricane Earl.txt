    President Obama was briefed this morning via phone by FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate on the preparations for potential impacts of Hurricane Earl on the East Coast and New England. A Hurricane Watch is currently in place for portions of the North Carolina and Virginia coastlines.
Administrator Fugate discussed FEMA’s close coordination with state and local officials in potentially affected states from North Carolina to Maine. FEMA is continuing to monitor the storm’s movement in conjunction with the National Hurricane Center, and has deployed teams to North Carolina and other East Coast states to support storm preparations as well as response and recovery efforts as needed. FEMA has also prepositioned commodities for rapid delivery, including water, meals, tarps, blankets, generators and other essential items.
Administrator Fugate also briefed the President on the impacts from Hurricane Earl on Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, both of which have had FEMA teams on the ground since the weekend supporting the Governors’ efforts related to the storm.
The President stressed that the team needs to be prepared for all scenarios, including the worst case and do everything needed to protect the residents and communities along the East Coast, including encouraging residents and visitors in potentially affected areas to follow all evacuation orders issued by local and state officials.
