    The President today declared a major disaster exists for the Navajo Nation and ordered Federal aid to supplement the Tribe's efforts in the area affected by a severe freeze during the period of December 15, 2012 to January 21, 2013.
Federal funding is available to the Navajo Nation and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe freeze.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures for the Tribe.
W. Craig Fugate, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Mark A. Neveau as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
FEMA said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the Tribe and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
