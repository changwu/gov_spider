    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(FINAL)(House)(Fuqua (D) Florida and 12 others)
The Administration would support House passage of H.R. 1714 if it is amended to: (1) delete Title II, which establishes a sliding scale pricing policy for commercial use of the space shuttle and (2) eliminate the additional $45 million for spare parts for the space shuttle, and restore those funds to the accounts requested in the 1986 Budget. The Administration would support amendments allowing for more discretionary, authority and flexibility regarding full cost recovery for commercial use. The Administration will continue to work with the Senate to achieve these objectives. The Administration has established a full-cost recovery policy for commercial and foreign users of the Space Shuttle, but an appropriate price to be charged to these users has yet to be determined and is presently under review within the Administration.
