    Good morning. This weekend I am at home in Crawford, Texas, with my wife and my family. Millions of other families are also spending time together this weekend, and Laura and I wish you all a happy Easter.
Our thoughts are also with the men and women of our military, deployed around the world and away from their families. They have our sincere gratitude. And on this holiday, we offer the thanks of our Nation to the 24 service men and women who are no longer in China and are now home.
This weekend also marks the close of Passover, when Jews recall their deliverance from oppression. We hope this Passover has been a time of reflection and renewal.
Renewal is the hope of every person and the promise of many religions. This season signifies the hope of renewal, a reawakening, a fresh vision of our lives and our possibilities. And in this season, we are reminded that on the path of renewal, we are not alone. We have one another, family members and friends, who know us and accept us as we are. And if we're very fortunate, we have people in our lives who see us not just as we are but also as we can be. That is the love of family.
And many of us trust a Creator who knows us and loves us and has a plan for our lives. We cannot know where that plan will lead us on Earth, but we are assured that it leads nearer to God. This is the comfort of faith.
In this season of renewal, we remember that failures in life are never final, that hope leads us closer to the truth, that in the end, even death itself will be defeated. And that is the shared belief of many faiths, and that is the promise of Easter morning.
Thank you for listening.
