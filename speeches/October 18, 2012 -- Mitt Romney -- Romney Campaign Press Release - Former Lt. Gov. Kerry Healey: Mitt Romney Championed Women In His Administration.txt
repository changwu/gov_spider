FORMER LT. GOV. KERRY HEALEY: "My personal experience has obviously been extraordinary. Governor Romney is a great leader, and he also creates a work environment which is enormously friendly, it's family friendly, it's professional. It's everything that women in the workforce could hope for. But I also think this is so ironic because it's giving us an opportunity to talk about one of the great strengths of Governor Romney during his time in office which was that he did want to bring women's voices into government. That he did have half of the women in his top appointed positions, right there with him; his chief of staff was a woman. Obviously he asked me to run with him. I am clearly a female, and his top policy adviser was also female in addition to all the cabinet secretaries he brought forward."

"Governor Romney went way beyond just equal pay for equal work. Governor Romney went out and aggressively championed, mentored women, put them in leadership positions again and again throughout his time in government, and just there are so few political leaders, male or female who bothered to do that. In the first year after we were in office there was a survey that he mentioned by SUNY Albany that looked how governors were putting women in different positions in their administrations and Governor Romney's Administration was the best in the country in terms of advancing women. I just think the proof is in the pudding, and again, the Obama Administration is just trying to create a distraction here away from the horrible economic failures of his last four years."
