    The President today announced the appointment of Richard L. Armitage as Special Negotiator for the future status of U.S. access to military facilities in the Philippines. Mr. Armitage most recently served as Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, and he has had a long career of distinguished public service. The President is pleased that he has accepted the assignment.
Discussions are expected to begin soon on the future of the U.S. military facilities, which contribute to the security of the Philippines, the United States, and the other countries of the region. We look forward to productive talks leading to the conclusion of a mutually beneficial new agreement.
