    President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke this morning with Governor Henry McMaster of South Carolina to discuss the steps the Biden-Harris Administration is taking to support South Carolina in preparation for the landfall of Hurricane Ian, including the issuance of an Emergency Declaration for South Carolina last night. The President told the Governor that the Administration is here to provide whatever assistance the people of South Carolina need, and asked the Governor to stay in touch.
