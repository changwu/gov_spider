    The factual report on industrial relations in Sweden' has been given me by the Secretary of Labor. It parallels the statement on industrial relations in Great Britain, prepared and submitted by the same nine eminent representatives of different points of view and interests within our country.
It, like its predecessor, is a unanimous report. It comes to me in response to my request for an impartial statement on labor employer relations in Sweden.
The widespread interest and praise which the report on conditions existing in Great Britain received warrants my adding to my own thanks, the appreciation of all Americans concerned with the adjustment of our own problems. This report deserves the same thoughtful and thorough reading which I recommended for the British study.
Although differences between the practices within the two countries are apparent, the striking fact emerging from a study of the two documents is the similarity of approach and the widespread satisfaction with the procedures adopted. In Sweden, as in Great Britain, employers generally have fully accepted a program of collective bargaining; there is extensive independent organization of both groups and all concerned live up to the rules of the game, participating with restraint and mutual respect in the processes of collective bargaining.
