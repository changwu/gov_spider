    MANCHESTER â€” Environmental activist and attorney and New Hampshire State Representative Bob Backus today endorsed Michael Bennet for President of the United States. He had previously endorsed Cory Booker's campaign. Backus has represented the Hillsborough 19 district since 2012. He serves on the Committee on Science, Technology, and Energy.
"He's not as young as Mayor Pete, he's not as old as some of the other candidates, and I kind of like that," Backus said in a video statement. "He's got great experience as the school superintendent in Denver and a strong record in the Senate, and he's got thoughtful positions."
Bennet represents Colorado in the Senate, but he has not spent a lifetime in politics. He turned around failing businesses in the private sector and improved outcomes for kids as superintendent of the Denver Public Schools. Bennet is the only candidate in this race who has won two elections in a swing state. He has released comprehensive, field-leading proposals, including to provide high-quality, affordable health care with a public option, reward hard work, fix our broken political system, and tackle climate change by working with our farmers and ranchers.
