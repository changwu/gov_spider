    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Solomon (R) NY)
H.R. 1122 contains the same serious flaws as H.R. 1833, an identical bill that was passed during the 104th Congress and vetoed by the President on April 10, 1996.
The President will veto H.R. 1122 for the reasons he expressed in his veto message of April 10, 1996, which is attached.
