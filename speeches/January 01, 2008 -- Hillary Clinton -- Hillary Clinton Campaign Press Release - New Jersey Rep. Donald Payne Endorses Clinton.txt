    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of New Jersey Congressman Donald M. Payne.
"These serious times call for a leader with Hillary Clinton's ability to tackle our biggest challenges from her first day in office," Rep. Payne said. "Her 35-year record fighting for children and families demonstrates the kind of change she will deliver as President. Having worked closely with Hillary in the White House and in the Senate, I can personally attest to her effectiveness and commitment to the issues facing our community."
Rep. Payne was first elected to Congress in 1988, becoming the first African-American to represent New Jersey in the House of Representatives. A past Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, he is a member of the Democratic Whip Organization and has served as a member of the House Democratic Leadership Advisory Group.
Since 2003, he has served as one of two Congressional delegates to the United Nations, and is a senior member of the Education and Labor Committee and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa. He was the sponsor of the House resolution declaring genocide in Darfur, Sudan.
Before his election to Congress, Rep. Payne was a member of the Essex County Board of Chosen Freeholders and served on the Newark Municipal Council. He also served as National President of the YMCA and as an educator in the Newark public school system.
"Donald has devoted his life to serving the people of Newark and New Jersey," Clinton said. "I'm honored to have his support and look forward to rolling up our sleeves together to solve America's challenges."
