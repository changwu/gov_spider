    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 8/1/94)(House)(Meehan (D) Massachusetts)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 4448, but will seek an amendment in the Senate to eliminate Section 1(a)(7), which would establish the Lowell National Historical Park Advisory Committee. In the interest of making Government work more effectively and at less cost, the Administration urges the Congress to show restraint in creating new advisory committees, especially where the charter of the committee is not national in scope.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 4448 would affect offsetting receipts and direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. The preliminary OMB PAYGO estimate is zero. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
