    Today, President Donald J. Trump sends warm wishes to Sikh Americans and Sikhs around the world as they celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji, the founder and first guru of Sikhism. The Sikh community today exemplifies the fundamental values that all Americans share: peace, tolerance, compassion, and service. President Trump also recognizes the many contributions Sikh Americans have made to our great Nation for more than 100 years, including through military and public service.
