    I was saddened to learn of the death of former Representative Millicent Fenwick of New Jersey. Mrs. Fenwick represented the highest ideals of public service: integrity, devotion to principle, and commitment to the public interest. I knew and admired her.
Mrs. Fenwick dedicated herself to New Jersey and to the United States. Mrs. Fenwick's service as town council member, State assemblywoman, consumer affairs director, and U.S. Representative are a testimony to her devotion to her State and her country. She will be missed but also long remembered as a conscientious and effective public servant.
