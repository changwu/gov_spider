    Today former Hillsborough County, New Hampshire Sheriff Walt Morse announced his support for John Kasich for President
Said Morse, "I've had the opportunity to host most of the Republican candidates in my store, but John Kasich stands out as someone who really understands the challenges small business owners face in New Hampshire and across the country. He has a record of lowering taxes and cutting regulations so we can create jobs and serve our customers well. He has an 'A' rating from the NRA, which is important to me given my industry and background in law enforcement. Perhaps most important, he has a spirit of optimism that allows him to get his message across without resorting to negative attacks. That's the kind of leader America needs."
Morse's career in law enforcement spans 61 years, from reaching the rank of Captain in the New Hampshire State Police to serving as Hillsborough County Sheriff from 1993 to 2003. Morse currently owns Morse Sporting Good Store in Hillsborough and serves as a Fish and Game Commissioner.
"I'm honored to receive the support of one of New Hampshire's most distinguished public servants and business owners," said Kasich. "Walt Morse has an incredibly deep knowledge of the issues that matter to Granite Staters, and I'm humbled by his support and hospitality on the campaign trail."
