President Poroshenko updated the Vice President on Ukraine's financial situation and reaffirmed Kyiv's commitment to continue implementing a robust program of reforms, including measures to combat corruption. The Vice President noted that the United States remains committed to working with international partners, including the International Monetary Fund, to ensure that Ukraine will have the macroeconomic support it needs as it implements its reform program.
