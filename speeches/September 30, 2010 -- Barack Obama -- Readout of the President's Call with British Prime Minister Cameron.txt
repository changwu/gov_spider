    The President called Prime Minister David Cameron today to convey the good news that the U.S. Senate provided its Advice and Consent to the U.S.-U.K. Defense Trade Cooperation Treaty last night. The ratification of the Treaty was a high priority for both the President and the Prime Minister, and its passage is evidence of the broad, bipartisan support that undergirds the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom. The President noted that implementation of the Treaty will generate jobs for both of our economies, and further deepen the close ties and cooperation between our countries. The President and the Prime Minister also discussed our close ongoing counterterrorism cooperation, and agreed on the importance of advancing the Middle East Peace process.
