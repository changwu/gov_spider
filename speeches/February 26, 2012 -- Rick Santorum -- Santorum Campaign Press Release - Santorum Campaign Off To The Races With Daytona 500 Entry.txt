    Verona, PA - The Rick Santorum for President campaign is proud to sponsor Front Row Motorsports' No. 26 Ford Fusion in today's Daytona 500. Veteran driver Tony Raines will be behind the wheel of the No. 26 entry after qualifying on speed for the starting field last Sunday in the feel-good, underdog story of the day.
Rick Santorum said: "NASCAR and the Daytona 500 are about as American as you can get - and it's great to have my campaign represented by one of these incredible machines. The race weekend is a wonderful tradition that we're excited to be a part of as we spread our message. I like how Tony Raines turned some heads last weekend with his qualifying run and we'd like to keep turning heads too. I think we're both looking for a win in the end."
Team Owner Bob Jenkins said: "We're glad to partner with the Santorum campaign. We know there will be millions of eyes on these cars on Sunday and we know we can help get their message out. It's a pretty tight battle for the Republican nomination right now, and the former Senator is right in the thick of it. We hope we're in the thick of it come Sunday out on the racetrack, too."
The Rick Santorum for President's campaign messaging will be on the hood and quarter panels of Raines' Ford Fusion for Sunday's season-opening NASCAR Sprint Cup Series event at the 2.5-mile superspeedway in Daytona Beach, Fla. 
Sunday's Daytona 500 will air nationwide today on FOX, with coverage beginning at noon (ET).
