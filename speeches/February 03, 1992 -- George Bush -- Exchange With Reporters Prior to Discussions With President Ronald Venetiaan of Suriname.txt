Q. Any defense of American workers in response to what Mr. Miyazawa said?
The President. Just go by what Marlin Fitzwater told you guys when you asked the same question about 6 hours ago. [Laughter]
Q. Have you seen the -- --
The President. Strong support. I just heard what Marlin said, and I back it 100 percent. I also saw the correction by Mr. Miyazawa, I'm pleased to say. So, that was fine.
Q. Do you accept that, sir, as an apology?
The President. I accept it for what it was, a very clear statement from a good man, a man who has said clearly that they're going to live up to their commitments, and I support him for that. And we had a very good visit. So, you know, he's gone out of his way to make clear that he was not denouncing all American workers. And I strongly support them and continue to say so. We can compete with anybody in the world if we're given access. Marlin summed up our position very well.
