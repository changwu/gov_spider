Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced that several Miami-Dade County leaders have endorsed his candidacy for President of the United States, including Miami-Dade County Commissioner Jose "Pepe" Diaz, Sweetwater Mayor Manny Marono, Miami-Dade County School Board Chair Agustin "Gus" Barrera and Raquel Rodriguez, who served as General Counsel to former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Commissioner Diaz will serve as a Co-Chair of Governor Romney's campaign in Miami-Dade County, joining Theresa Ashkar and Andreina Figueroa.
"We have a strong grassroots organization in South Florida and I'm pleased to welcome these prominent leaders to our campaign," said Governor Romney. "I look forward to traveling to Miami this weekend and participating in the historic Univision Republican Presidential Forum to substantively address issues important to voters in South Florida and Hispanic-Americans across the country."
These individuals join a growing team in South Florida led by Al Cardenas, former Chairman of the Republican Party of Florida and a Chair of the Romney for President Florida Steering Committee, and State Representative Anitere Flores, a Co-Chair of the Romney for President Florida Steering Committee. Previously announced South Florida leadership includes Miami-Dade County Commission Chairman Bruno Barreiro, former Miami-Dade School Board member Frank Bolanos, former Broward County Commissioner Ed Kennedy, Coral Springs Commissioner Ted Mena, former Broward County Property Appraiser Rocky Rodriguez and City of Miramar Commissioner Troy Samuels.
"The addition of this impressive group of Miami-Dade leaders to our team indicates Governor Romney's vision for building a stronger America with a strong military, strong economy and strong families is resonating with Republicans in South Florida," said Chairman Cardenas. "As we prepare for next month's primary, these men and women bring a wealth of experience to Governor Romney's campaign in the Sunshine State, especially to our outreach efforts in the Hispanic community."
