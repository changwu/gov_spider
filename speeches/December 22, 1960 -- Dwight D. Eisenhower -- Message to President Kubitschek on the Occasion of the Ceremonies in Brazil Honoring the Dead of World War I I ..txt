    Dear Mr. President:
The memorial ceremonies which are being held today in honor of the Brazilians who gave their lives in the Second World War have a special significance for me personally and for the people of my country. As wartime Commander of the Allied Forces, I had personal knowledge of Brazilian courage on the field of battle, where members of the armed forces of the United States of Brazil and of the United States of America, allied in the struggle against totalitarianism, fought and died together. I am convinced that the spirit of common endeavor, which characterized our relations then, still permeates them today.
Now we are partners in a common struggle to develop and strengthen our free institutions, to make the benefits of our growing economies available to all our citizens, and to find ways to further understanding among all nations. On behalf of myself and the people of the United States, I salute the memory of your countrymen who, in time of war, made the ultimate sacrifice. Remembering their courage, we can continue to work together in time of peace for the high purposes they so gallantly defended.
With warm regard,
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
