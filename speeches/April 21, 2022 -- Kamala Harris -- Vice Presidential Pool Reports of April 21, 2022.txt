On Background from a White House Official 
Today the Vice President will visit the University of California San Francisco Mission Bay as a part of her continued leadership addressing the maternal health crisis.
While at the William J. Rutter Center at UCSF, the Vice President will discuss the EMBRACE program, which uses an innovative approach to improving maternal health outcomes, particularly for Black women. She will meet with expecting families, join a group perinatal session, and speak with members of the health care workforce. At 2:30 PM PDT, the Vice President will deliver remarks about the maternal health crisis, which will be livestreamed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ro8wwUXcI.
This visit follows last week, when the Vice President marked Black Maternal Health Week by convening a historic meeting with Cabinet Secretaries and agency leaders to discuss the Administration's whole-of-government approach to addressing maternal mortality and morbidity. The Vice President brought together leaders across the federal government â€“ including agencies that may not have historically taken a leading role addressing the maternal health crisis.
During the meeting the Vice President, announced several key actions to address maternal health and combat the systemic inequities that lead to worse maternal outcomes for Black, Native American, and rural women. The next day, she announced that in response to her Call to Action, Michigan is extending postpartum coverage from 2 weeks to 12 months. Michigan joins Louisiana, Virginia, New Jersey and Illinois' extension of postpartum coverage. The Administration is working with another 11 states to extend postpartum coverage.
Additional Background

As Vice President, Kamala Harris has worked closely with President Biden and other leaders in the Administration to improve outcomes for Black women and their families.

The White House released a Presidential Proclamation to mark Black Maternal Health Week in 2021 and 2022.
Last week, the Vice President hosted a meeting with Cabinet Secretaries and agency leaders to discuss the Administration's whole-of-government approach to addressing maternal mortality and morbidity.


In December 2021, the Vice President led a Maternal Health Day of Action Summit, noting the urgent need to address this crisis.


At the Summit, the Vice President announced guidance to help states provide 12 months of continuous postpartum coverage through their Medicaid programs, up from 60 days; a new HHS report showing the impact of state extensions of Medicaid postpartum coverage to 12 months; and CMS's plan to propose the establishment of a "Birthing-Friendly" hospital designation. She also announced that more than 20 companies and nonprofits have pledged to invest over $150 million and take other critical actions to address the maternal health crisis.


In April 2021, the Vice President hosted a roundtable on Black Maternal Health with Domestic Policy Advisor Ambassador Susan Rice. She was joined by women who shared their experiences with complications from pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum as well as their work in advocacy and research, highlighting the disparities that Black women face in maternal health.




The Omnibus spending bill passed in March and signed by the President includes both the Maternal Health Quality Improvement Act and an expansion of the Rural Maternal and Obstetric Modernization of Services (Rural MOMS) program.

These foundational bills authorize and improve programs to address the maternal mortality crisis in this country and build on current funding at the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality.




Last fall, the Administration released the first-ever National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality, which includes its vision to strengthen health care and women's health, including through addressing the maternal mortality crisis in the United States and abroad.


As a Senator, Vice President Harris was a champion on the issue of maternal health. She brought racial disparities in maternal mortality, particularly for Black women, to the forefront legislatively, increasing awareness among her colleagues and leading to a broader discussion of racial disparities across other health issues.

She convened roundtables, lifted up local organizations that are focused on the issue, and ensured that initiatives on maternal health included references to racial disparities and relevant solutions.
She introduced several bills in the Senate specifically targeted to addressing racial disparities in maternal mortality, including the Maternal CARE Act and the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act.
