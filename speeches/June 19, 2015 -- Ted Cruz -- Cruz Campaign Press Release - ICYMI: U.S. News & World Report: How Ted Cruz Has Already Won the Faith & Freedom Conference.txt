How Ted Cruz Has Already Won the Faith & Freedom Conference
U.S. News & World Report

There are two full days left of the Faith & Freedom Coalition's annual Washington conference.
But Ted Cruz already won it on Thursday.
The Texas senator measurably outperformed his two Senate GOP colleagues, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, with a tightly woven sermon on religious liberty delivered with vigor and conviction. He was rewarded with the most frequent and loudest applause and the highest praise from the gathering of social conservatives at the Omni Shoreham Hotel.
It wasn't just the dramatic delivery that separated him on the dais, though – it was his smartly tailored speech that began with a silent prayer for the victims of the mass church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, and ended with a spontaneous leap off the stage into the center of the ballroom audience, where he was swarmed like a rock star.
There are still more than a half-dozen 2016 contenders who will speak on Friday and Saturday. But none is likely to match Cruz's dynamism.
