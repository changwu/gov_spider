    Jill and I continue to pray for all those affected by Hurricane Laura and those who lost their lives to the storm. Our hearts go out to so many families who had to flee their homes in the middle of the worst economic and health crisis in modern history. We have seen homes, communities, and families ravaged by a mighty force â€” especially tragic for families who have already withstood so much damage after Hurricane Rita. As we have before, we will come back and we will be there to help you build back better.
Families from across Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, and the other affected states responded with bravery, vigilance, and grace. Thank you for reminding Americans that no disaster, no single person, no injustice can match the humble, personal, courageous ways that Americans choose decency every single day.
