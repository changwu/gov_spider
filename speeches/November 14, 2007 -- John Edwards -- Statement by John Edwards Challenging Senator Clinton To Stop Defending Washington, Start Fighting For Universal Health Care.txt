    Dubuque, Iowa – Today, Senator John Edwards made the following statement:
"Here's what I believe. We must have universal health care – real universal health care, mandated by law for every man woman and child in America. And to make sure we get it, here's what I'll do when I'm sworn in as president in January 2009.
"I'm going to say to members of Congress and members of my administration, including members of my cabinet: I'm glad that you have health care coverage. Good for you. Good for your families. But I'll tell you this. As your president, if you don't pass universal health care for America by July of 2009, I will use every power I have available to me to take your health care coverage away from you.
"There's no excuse for politicians in Washington having health care when you don't have health care and other Americans don't have health care. I might have missed something, but I think they work for you. What are they doing protecting their health care when America doesn't have health care?
"I started saying this out on the campaign trail and I've said it in a commercial that just started airing yesterday in Iowa. And guess what happens? The politicians in Washington are circling the wagons. Senator Clinton's campaign has started saying, 'Well, wait a minute, he can't do this.' So instead of talking about what we need to do to bring health care to every American, they're talking about how to protect health care for politicians. Well, I think the politicians have been protected long enough – it's time they start protecting regular Americans."
