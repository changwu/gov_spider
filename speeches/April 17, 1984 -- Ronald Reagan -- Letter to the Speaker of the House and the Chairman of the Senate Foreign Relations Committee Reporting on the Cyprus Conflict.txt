    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384, I am submitting herewith a bimonthly report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question.
Since my last report to you of January 24, 1984, President Kyprianou met with the U.N. Secretary General in Paris on February 4. Shortly thereafter, State Department Counselor Edward Derwinski and Special Cyprus Coordinator Richard Haass paid separate visits to the region to discuss developments with the governments of Greece, Turkey and Cyprus and to urge their cooperation with the Secretary General. In March, Turkish Cypriot community leader Denktash visited New York for discussions with the Secretary General and with Messrs. Derwinski and Haass. Also in March, Cypriot Foreign Minister Iacovou met with both the Secretary General and with Secretary Shultz.
These meetings have been held to discuss the proposal made by the two sides in early January, as described in my previous report, and to support the efforts of the Secretary General to promote negotiations between them in accordance with his Security Council mandate.
We are pleased to report at this time that the Committee on Missing Persons has met and agreed on the procedure it will follow at future meetings. We expect the committee to begin its first working session shortly.
We are encouraged by the Secretary General's active involvement in seeking common ground for progress, and we continue to offer him our support. We are hoping for positive results from this intensive diplomatic activity.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
