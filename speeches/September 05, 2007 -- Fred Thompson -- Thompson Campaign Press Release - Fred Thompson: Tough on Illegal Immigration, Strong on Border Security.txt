Thompson understands mainstream conservative's view about the problem of illegal immigration in America and their frustration that government can't seem to get the most basic responsibilities right for its citizens.
FRED THOMPSON SAID IT...
"Most Americans know that we have an illegal immigration problem in this country, with perhaps as many as 20 million people residing here unlawfully. And I think most Americans have a pretty good idea about how to at least start solving the problem - secure our nation's borders. ...
"Is it any wonder that a lot of folks today feel like they're being sold a phony bill of goods on border security? A 'comprehensive' plan doesn't mean much if the government can't accomplish one of its most basic responsibilities for its citizens - securing its borders. A nation without secure borders will not long be a sovereign nation." (May 21, 2007, http://www.aei.org/)
