    As people around the world, including nearly 4 million proud Indian Americans, celebrate the 75th anniversary of India's independence on August 15, the United States joins the people of India to honor its democratic journey, guided by Mahatma Gandhi's enduring message of truth and non-violence.
This year, we also celebrate the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our great democracies. India and the United States are indispensable partners, and the U.S.-India strategic partnership is grounded in our shared commitment to the rule of law and the promotion of human freedom and dignity. Our partnership is further strengthened by the deep bonds between our people. The vibrant Indian American community in the United States has made us a more innovative, inclusive, and stronger nation.
I am confident that in the years ahead our two democracies will continue to stand together to defend the rules-based order; foster greater peace, prosperity, and security for our people; advance a free and open Indo-Pacific; and together address the challenges we face around the world.
