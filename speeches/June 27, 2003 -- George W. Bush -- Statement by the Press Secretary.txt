The agreement represents a first significant joint step toward implementation of commitments made by each party at the Aqaba summit. While it is important that the parties have reached this agreement, it is now crucial that each side take steps not only to meet their new commitments but also to build on implementation of this agreement to achieve the goal of two states living side by side in peace and security as outlined by President Bush in his June 24, 2002 Rose Garden speech.
