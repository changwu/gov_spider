    I urge all Americans to join me in this traditional salute to those who deliver newspapers in cities and towns across our country.
The carrier's job builds qualities of responsibility, integrity and good citizenship. It is a wonderful preparation for any future employment, and it often provides a useful base for later success in a chosen career.
I admire the dedication and energy of our nation's newspaper carriers, and I hope that their paper routes will continue to bring them rewarding experiences that will enrich their lives in years to come.
