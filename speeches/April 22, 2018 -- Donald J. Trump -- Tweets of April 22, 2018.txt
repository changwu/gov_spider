Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Fake News NBC just stated that we have given up so much in our negotiations with North Korea and they have given up nothing. Wow we haven't given up anything & they have agreed to denuclearization (so great for World) site closure & no more testing!Retweets: 25871Favorites: 102315

Kim Strassel of the WSJ just said after reviewing the dumb Comey Memos 'you got to ask what was the purpose of the Special Counsel? There's no there there.' Dan Henninger of the WSJ said Memos would show that this would be one of the weakest obstruction cases ever brought!Retweets: 24359Favorites: 95011
