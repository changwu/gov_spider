    To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 12047, entitled "An act granting an increase of pension to George Colwell."
The record shows that this beneficiary was enrolled in the military service August 10, 1862, and was mustered out June 1, 1865. There is no record of any disability during his service.
He was pensioned at the rate of $2 a month for a dog bite just above the ankle.
In September, 1865, three months after his discharge, he strained the knee of the leg which had been bitten.
In 1887 he applied for an increase of pension, alleging increased disability. This increased disability appears plainly to be the result of the strain or injury to the knee, and in no way connected with the bite for which he was pensioned.
