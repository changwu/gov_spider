    The secretary of Labor has reported to me that your committee has been deadlocked on the question of negotiating a new wage agreement. The differences in viewpoint of representatives of workers and operators appear not to be insurmountable and the orderly process of collective bargaining should suffice to bring about their adjustment.
Because of this, I urge that the present negotiations with the Federal Commissioner continue and that all sit down with the intention to reach a fair, honorable and workable agreement in a spirit of give and take. Time is now important and agreement must be reached promptly.
It is in the public interest as well as your own that you arrive at such an adjustment. The public interest is paramount and above that of any group. As President of the United States, I caution the negotiators on both sides to keep this in mind and continue negotiations until a speedy settlement is made in justice to the two groups in conference and to the American people.
