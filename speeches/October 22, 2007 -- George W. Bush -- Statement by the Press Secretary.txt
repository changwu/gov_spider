    Request to Fund Security Cooperation with Mexico and Central America
To combat the threats of drug trafficking, transnational crime, and terrorism in this Hemisphere, the President today is requesting $500 million as part of a $1.4 billion program to fund security cooperation with Mexico. President Bush and President Calderon have discussed on many occasions the importance of the United States and Mexico working together in a strategic partnership against the common threats our nations face. The President greatly appreciates the bold actions President Calderon has taken in confronting these dangers, and his desire to raise our relationship to a new level of cooperation. Already, President's Calderon's decisive actions have had a positive effect in the United States. They have disrupted drug trafficker supply lines and have contributed to shortages in cocaine and methamphetamine supply across the nation.
The United States will do all it can to support Mexico's efforts to break the power and impunity of drug organizations and to strengthen Mexico's capabilities to deal with these common threats, as well as enhance cooperation as outlined in the March 2007 Joint U.S.-Mexico Communiqu√© in Merida. We also aim to strengthen regional security cooperation from the U.S. Southwest border to Panama. In support of that effort, the President is requesting $50 million for Central American countries to confront the same dangers caused by organized crime, violent gangs, and drug traffickers.
Together our countries can defeat criminal organizations that threaten our region, and we look forward to working closely with our neighbors to realize that goal.
