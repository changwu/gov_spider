    AUSTIN — Today Governor Rick Perry released the following statement on the video showing a Planned Parenthood staffer attempting to sell the body parts of aborted children:
"The video showing a Planned Parenthood employee selling the body parts of aborted children is a disturbing reminder of the organization's penchant for profiting off the tragedy of a destroyed human life. It is because of stories like this that I signed legislation defunding Planned Parenthood in the state of Texas — to protect human life and the health and safety of Texans."
