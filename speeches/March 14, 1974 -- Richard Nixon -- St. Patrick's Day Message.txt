    OF ALL the ethnic and cultural strands that make up the rich fabric of American culture, none is more distinctive and at the same time more harmonious than the rich emerald green of Ireland.
Irish wit and warmth, grace and charm, have enriched our literature, our music, and of course, our politics, and by so doing have added immeasurably to the texture of American life.
On this St. Patrick's Day, Patricia Ryan Nixon and I join with all Americans in celebrating that sparkling joyfulness and love of life that represent one of the very finest features of the American national character, a feature that in large part has been bequeathed to us by the sons and daughters of the Emerald Isle.
