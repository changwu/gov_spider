Federal funding is available to commonwealth and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storm and snowstorm in the counties of Berkshire, Franklin, Hampden, Hampshire, Middlesex, and Worcester.
Federal funding also is available to commonwealth and eligible local governments on a cost-sharing basis for snow assistance for a continuous 48-hour period during or proximate to the incident period in Berkshire, Franklin, Hampden, and Hampshire Counties.
