    New employment data continues to show that the labor market has improved under President Biden, with 42 states reporting drops in unemployment in December and 12 states reaching record lows. No states experienced a decline in employment. Year-over-year payroll figures have now increased in 48 states and DC.
Thanks to the President's economic plan and his success in getting Americans vaccinated, the unemployment rate nationally dropped to 3.9% - four years earlier than expected, wages are up, and 6.4 million jobs have been created â€“ the most in any one year on record. The President's economic strategy is working: strengthening our economic growth and creating millions of jobs across the country.
