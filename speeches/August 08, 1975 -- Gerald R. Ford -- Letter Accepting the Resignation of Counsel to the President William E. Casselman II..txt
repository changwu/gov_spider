    We have been through some tough times together. I have been fortunate to have your advice, assistance and unstinting effort for almost two eventful years. You can be proud of your fine contributions not only to my administration but throughout your career in government extending back to our first association in the House of Representatives.
As a fellow lawyer who reveres the law as the bulwark of all our liberties, I wish you great success in the practice of our profession. More personally, let me thank you for your kind and generous observations about the first year of my conduct of the Presidential office and extend, on behalf of Mrs. Ford and myself, warm good wishes to Caroline and you.
Sincerely,
JERRY FORD
[The Honorable William E. Casselman II, The White House, Washington, D.C. 20500]
