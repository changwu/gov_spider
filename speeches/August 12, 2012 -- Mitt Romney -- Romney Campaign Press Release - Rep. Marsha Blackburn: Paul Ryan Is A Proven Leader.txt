"Paul Ryan is great choice to serve as Governor Romney's running mate. Paul is a proven leader who understands how to get things done when it comes to getting our nation's fiscal house in order. As President and Vice President, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will put in place the policies necessary to get our economy back on track and make America great again.
