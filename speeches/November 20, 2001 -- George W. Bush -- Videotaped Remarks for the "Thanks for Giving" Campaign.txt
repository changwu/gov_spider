    The President. This year, Thanksgiving will mean more than it ever has before.
The First Lady. So many have given their time, their talent——
The President. ——their bravery, their sacrifice, and courage to keep this country strong. Some believe it's astonishing; I believe it's the American character.
The First Lady. As your family gathers, give thanks, and think of all that can be done in your community.
The President. Thanks for making such a difference. Thanks for giving.
God bless you, and God bless America.
