    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with The Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (P.L. 94-265), I transmit herewith a governing international fishery agreement between the United States and Cuba, signed at Havana on April 27, 1977.
This Agreement, one of a series to be negotiated in accordance with that legislation, is significant because it is the first to be negotiated personally by representatives of the two governments since 1958. Favorable action by Congress on this Agreement will constitute a tangible step in the improvement of United States-Cuban relations.
In that regard I note that the Fishery Conservation and Management Act provides for 60 calendar days of continuous session for review of the Agreement by Congress. Since the Agreement in all material respects is in accordance with the provisions of the Act, I strongly recommend that the Congress consider extending the provisions of the Fishery Conservation Zone Transition Act (P.L. 95-6) to this Agreement in order that it may be brought into force at the earliest possible date.
