    Sioux City, IA – Montana Governor Steve Bullock sat down with NPR's Scott Detrow and Kate Payne during his "Fighting for Rural Iowa Tour" to talk about his record of bringing people together to get things done.
As the only candidate in the field to have both won and governed in a Trump state, Governor Bullock highlighted his major successes like securing healthcare for one in ten Montanans while working with a 60% Republican legislature.
Key Quotes:
"I'm the only one that won a Trump state. I was on the ballot for reelection in 2016 — Donald Trump took Montana by 20, I won by 4… If we can't both bring out our base but also win back some of the places that we lost, we're not going to win this election."
"To me, it's about more than 271 electoral votes. I'm the only one in the field that's gotten progressive things done through a legislature that's more Republican than this one in Iowa, and I think we've got to figure out a way to bridge some of these divides and make government work again."
"We're still 240 days away from any voter expressing his or her preference. I got in ‘too late' because I needed to get my legislature over… 100,000 Montanans getting healthcare depended on that. Being able to get a package of bills for missing and murdered indigenous women depended on that. And if I had to make that choice again, I'd make that very same choice."
"At the end of the day… I'm going to continue to do what I've been doing the last few days on a rural tour… It's the voters that get to decide this, not any DNC rules or anything like that. So that's where I'll focus."
