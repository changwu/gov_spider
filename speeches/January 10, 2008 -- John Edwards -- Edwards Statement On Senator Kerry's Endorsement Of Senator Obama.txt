    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ John Edwards released the following statement today about Senator John Kerry's endorsement of Senator Barack Obama.
"Our country and our Party are stronger because of John's service, and I respect his decision. When we were running against each other and on the same ticket, John and I agreed on many issues. I continue to believe that this election is about the future, not the past, and that the country needs a President who will fight aggressively to end the status quo and change the Washington system and to give voice to all of those whose voices are ignored in the corridors of power."
