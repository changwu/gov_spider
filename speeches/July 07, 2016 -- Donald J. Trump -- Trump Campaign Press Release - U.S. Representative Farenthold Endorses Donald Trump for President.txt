    Congressman Blake Farenthold (R-TX-27) today formally endorsed presumptive Republican Presidential Nominee Donald J. Trump.
Although originally a supporter of fellow Texan, Senator Ted Cruz, Congressman Farenthold says the time for contentious debate has passed and it is now time for the Republican Party to unify around its duly elected nominee.
"I think we're going to see some conservative motion in the country," said Farenthold on MSNBC in May. "The thing I'm really most excited about is Donald Trump is a deal maker. I spent my six years in Congress with a 'my way or the highway' president. I want a dealmaker who will come in and will get some stuff done and I think that's what the American people want. They're tired of gridlock in Washington."
Farenthold said he believes Donald Trump should not stop talking about the scandals that have plagued the campaign of presumptive Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton.
"Given the choice between Mr. Trump and Secretary Clinton, this is a no-brainer. I don't want someone in the oval office that is 'extremely careless,'" Farenthold said.
Farenthold took office in 2010 during the "Tea Party" wave that saw the Republican Party take over the leadership of the House of Representatives. He defeated 28-year incumbent Solomon Ortiz in a predominately Hispanic congressional district. He has been re-elected in 2012 and 2014 by a 52% and 56% majority respectively.
Farenthold serves on the Transportation Committee, Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and the Committee on the Judiciary.
