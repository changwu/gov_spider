    The President announced today that he will nominate Archer Durham, a retired Major General in the U.S.. Air Force, to be Assistant Secretary of Energy for Human Resources and Administration. He also formally announced his intent to nominate Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn to be Ambassador to the Holy See.
"Through his long and exemplary career in the Air Force, Archer Durham had a reputation of being a hands-on manager who consistently led the Air Force in management efficiency indicators," said the President. "Secretary O'Leary has called for that kind of management at her Department, and I am glad that General Durham will be providing it."
"I am also very pleased to be formally announcing my intention to nominate Mayor Flynn for the important post of Ambassador to the Holy See," the President added. "As I said on St. Patrick's Day here at The White House, he has been one of the best mayors to serve in my lifetime, and I think he'll do a great job in a wide range of areas."
