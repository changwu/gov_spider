    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Boschwitz (R) Minnesota)
The administration opposes S. 1467 because this bill would overturn recently-published Veterans Administration regulations limiting routine travel payments for VA beneficiaries. These regulations were the result of several years of effort to control rapidly escalating expenditures for this travel without impairing access of veterans to needed care. The resulting savings could be more effectively devoted to providing direct health care for veterans.
