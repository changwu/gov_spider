    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 6/21/93)(House)(Doolittle (R) CA)
The Administration supports H.R. 1183.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 1183 could reduce collections that offset spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary PAYGO scoring estimate is zero.
