    While Joe Biden has spent forty-seven years in Washington making failed promises to the Black community, President Trump has delivered major policy achievements in his first administration to radically improve Black America. The Democrats think that they own the Black vote, but President Trump's growing support among the community proves the left wrong. Pastor Darrell Scott, Black Voices for Trump Co-Chair, and Leo Terrell, civil rights attorney and talk radio show host, discussed all this and more on tonight's 'Team Trump Online' broadcast hosted by Lara Trump, Trump 2020 Senior Advisor.

"While Joe Biden has pandered to Black voters, President Trump illustrated his great achievements for the Black community during this week's Republican National Convention," said Lara Trump, Trump 2020 Senior Advisor. "To continue criminal justice reform, school choice, and economic advancement, Americans of all backgrounds need to come together to support President Trump."
"Black support for President Trump is growing by leaps and bounds as members of my community begin to realize the failures of the Democrat Party," said Pastor Darrell Scott, Black Voices for Trump Co-Chair. "This November, I am confident that Black America will come out in force to re-elect President Trump."
"For too long, Democrats have made promises to Black America that they never intended to keep, and my community is waking up to this reality," said Leo Terrell, civil rights attorney and talk radio show host. "We need President Trump to keep order in our cities, defend our freedoms, and protect us from Democrat Party overreach."
