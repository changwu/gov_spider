Here's what Marco had to say:
[Senator Cruz] clearly was a supporter of legalization and the amendment [to the comprehensive immigration bill allowing legalization], and he wanted the bill to pass. He said, I wanted immigration reform to pass. Basically, the argument he was making is we can pass immigration reform but we can't do citizenship. Let's just do legalization, and if we do that this bill has a chance of passing.
He doesn't mention that in the speeches in Iowa. He obviously mentioned that at the time because that's what he wanted. And now of course, in this campaign, he is looking for a political advantage so he tries to obscure the lines on it.

This isn't personal, Marco emphasized:
I want to be clear, I like Ted personally very much. These are important differences, particularly on the defense stuff that we should talk about. On the issue of immigration, look, in 2013, I live in a state that is deeply impacted by immigration and I said I want to try and make a difference. Now, I know that Harry Reid controls the Senate, so let's do the best we can in the Senate. Hopefully the House can make it even better and let's see if we can make some progress. Because after 30 years this problem was only getting worse, not better. Now I realize that we are not going to be able to do anything on immigration until you bring illegal immigration under control.
