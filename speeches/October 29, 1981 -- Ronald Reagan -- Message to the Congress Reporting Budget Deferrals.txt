    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report 51 deferrals totaling $1,260.6 million.
Forty-nine of the deferrals totaling $763.7 million represent the third group in a series that I am transmitting deferring fiscal year 1982 funds made available by the Continuing Resolution, P.L. 97-51. The other two deferrals, totaling $496.9 million, represent withholdings of funds carried over from 1981 that will not be needed until later this fiscal year.
The 49 deferrals of funds made available by P.L. 97-51 are being taken in accord with the stated intent of the Congress to provide minimal and temporary funding for the duration of the Continuing Resolution which expires November 20, 1981. As indicated in my special message of October 20, I plan to restrain spending to insure that the Congress has the opportunity to enact regular appropriations for the entire fiscal year at levels that are consistent with my revised budget request.
Deferrals under the Continuing Resolution are included in this special message for Funds Appropriated to the President and ten departments and agencies. The deferrals of funds carried over from 1981 affect Funds Appropriated to the President and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The details of each deferral are contained in the attached reports.
RONALD REAGAN
