    I am pleased with the strong bipartisan support for a national energy policy that will use technology, conservation, renewables, and increased production of energy at home. For the past 2 years, the passage of a comprehensive national energy policy has been a top priority for my administration, and I commend the House for its vote today and urge the Senate to act expeditiously as well. America will be more prosperous and more secure when we are less dependent on foreign sources of energy. Reliable and affordable energy is critical to our economic security, our national security, and our homeland security.
