    I'm Newt Gingrich and I'm announcing my candidacy for President of the United States because I believe we can return America to hope and opportunity, to full employment, to real security, to an American energy program, to a balanced budget.
I worked with President Ronald Reagan in a very difficult period. We got jobs created again, Americans proud of America, and the Soviet Union disappeared.
As Speaker of the House, I worked to reform welfare, balance the budget, control spending, to cut taxes to create economic growth â€“ unemployment came down from 5.6% to under 4. For four years we balanced the budget and paid off $405 billion in debt.
We've done it before, we can do it again.
I want your help because no one person from the oval office can get this done. We Americas are going to have to talk together, work together, find solutions together, and insist on imposing those solutions on those who don't want to change.
There are some people who don't mind if America becomes a wreck so long as they dominate the wreckage. But you and I know better.
We owe it to our children, our grandchildren, our country and frankly to ourselves. So let's get together, look reality in the face, tell the truth, make the tough choices and get the job done.
There's a much better American future ahead: with more jobs, more prosperity, a better health system, longer lives, greater independent living, in a country that is decentralized under the 10th Amendment, with power once again back with the American people and way from the Washington bureaucracies.
No one person can accomplish this. It can't be done from the oval office. We have to work together. We Americans have to get it done.
I hope you will decide to join me. Let's work side by side. Let's get this done for ourselves, our children and grandchildren, and for our country.
I hope you will come to Newt.org, see what we are trying to get done, and to join us in getting American back on the right track.
