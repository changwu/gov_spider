In-town pool report #1 - delay 
Good morning from the White House, where your pool has not yet gathered for the scheduled 10:30 a.m. POTUS remarks on the July jobs report.
I will provide more information when it's available. When it happens, it should be streaming in the usual place.
Also, you may have noticed that the president's departure for Wilmington has been moved up to 11:35 a.m., so the pool may have a quick movement. That will be open press.

He then spoke about the jobs report and touted highlights of his administration's accomplishments to date. As always, check quotes against transcript and video.
