    Prescription drug abuse and heroin use have taken a heartbreaking toll on too many Americans and their families, while straining law enforcement and treatment programs. Today, the President will travel to West Virginia to hear directly from individuals and families affected by this epidemic and the health care professionals, law enforcement officers, and community leaders working to prevent addiction and respond to its aftermath.
As part of today's event, the President will announce federal, state, local and private sector efforts aimed at addressing the prescription drug abuse and heroin epidemic. These include commitments by more than 40 provider groups – representing doctors, dentists, advanced practice registered nurses, physician assistants, physical therapists and educators -- that more than 540,000 health care providers will complete opioid prescriber training in the next two years. In addition, CBS, ABC, the New York Times, Google, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and other companies will donate millions of dollars in media space for PSAs about the risks of prescription drug misuse produced by the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids.
Today, the President issued a Memorandum to Federal Departments and Agencies directing two important steps to combat the prescription drug abuse and heroin epidemic:
•      Prescriber Training: First, to help ensure that health care professionals who prescribe opioids are properly trained in opioid prescribing and to establish the Federal Government as a model, the Presidential Memorandum requires Federal Departments and Agencies to provide training on the prescribing of these medications to Federal health care professionals who prescribe controlled substances as part of their Federal responsibilities.
•      Improving Access to Treatment: Second, to improve access to treatment for prescription drug abuse and heroin use, the Presidential Memorandum directs Federal Departments and Agencies that directly provide, contract to provide, reimburse for, or otherwise facilitate access to health benefits, to conduct a review to identify barriers to medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders and develop action plans to address these barriers.
More Americans now die every year from drug overdoses than they do in motor vehicle crashes and the majority of those overdoses involve prescription medications. Health care providers wrote 259 million prescriptions for opioid pain medications in 2012 – enough for every American adult to have a bottle of pills. Opioids are a class of prescription pain medications that includes hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, and methadone. Heroin belongs to the same class of drugs, and four in five heroin users started out by misusing prescription opioid pain medications.
In 2010, the President released his first National Drug Control Strategy, which emphasized the need for action to address opioid use disorders and overdose, while ensuring that individuals with pain receive safe, effective treatment. Since then, the Administration has supported and expanded community-based efforts to prevent drug use, pursue 'smart on crime' approaches to drug enforcement, improve prescribing practices for pain medication, increase access to treatment, work to reduce overdose deaths, and support the millions of Americans in recovery.
The most recent data show that the rate of overdoses involving prescription pain medication is leveling off, although it remains at an unacceptably high level. But the dramatic rise in heroin-related overdoses – which nearly doubled between 2011 and 2013 – shows the opioid crisis is far from over.
State, Local and Private Sector actions announced today include:
•      More than 40 provider groups – including physicians, dentists, advanced practice registered nurses, physician assistants, physical therapists and educators -- committed to:
•      Have more than 540,000 health care providers complete opioid prescriber training in the next two years;
•      Double the number of physicians certified to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder treatment, from 30,000 to 60,000 over the next three years;
•      Double the number of providers that prescribe naloxone--a drug that can reverse an opioid overdose;
•      Double the number of health care providers registered with their State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs in the next two years; and
•      Reach more than 4 million health care providers with awareness messaging on opioid abuse, appropriate prescribing practices, and actions providers can take to be a part of the solution in the next two years.

•      The White House will host a Champions of Change event this spring to highlight individuals in communities across the country who are leading the fight to respond to prescription drug abuse and heroin use.
Today's actions build on the Administration's commitment to confronting this epidemic: 
In 2010, the President released his first National Drug Control Strategy, emphasizing the need for action to address opioid use disorders and overdose, while ensuring that individuals with pain receive safe, effective treatment. The next year, the White House released its national Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Plan to outline our goals for addressing prescription drug abuse and overdose.
The President's Fiscal Year 2016 budget includes $133 million in new investments aimed at addressing the opioid epidemic, including expanding state-level prescription drug overdose prevention strategies, medication-assisted treatment programs, and access to the overdose-reversal drug naloxone.
Examples of additional actions by the Administration to address the opioid epidemic include:
Community Prevention and Overdose Response
•      In 2015, the CDC launched the Prescription Drug Overdose: Prevention for States Program, which provided $20 millionto states to support strategies to improve prescribing practices and prevent opioid overdose deaths.
•      Through the National Take Back Days to remove unused prescription drugs from the community, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has collected more than 5.5 million pounds of medication and introduced several new ways to dispose of unused prescription drugs – including pre-paid return-mail packages. DEA also finalized a new rule making it easier for communities to establish ongoing drug take-back programs.
•      In 2012, the Department of Veterans Affairs established an Opioid Safety Initiative to enhance safe and effective pain care for veterans. VA medical centers have filled more than 6,500 naloxone kit prescriptions, and VA's efforts to make opioid overdose kits available has resulted in at least 100 lives saved.
•      With support from the Department of Justice (DOJ) and other funders, 49 states have established Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs to help prescribers identify potential opioid misuse issues.
•      In 2015, HHS announced a targeted initiative to combat opioid related overdose, death, and dependence focused on increasing prescriber training, increasing the use of the overdose reversal drug naloxone, and expanding the use of medication-assisted treatment.
•      The federal government is expanding access to prescription drug monitoring program data throughout federal agencies. DoD's Pharmacy Data Transaction Service automatically screens all new medication orders against a patient's computerized medication history and permits DoD to monitor for concerning drug usage patterns. DoD's Polypharmacy Medication Analysis Reporting is being used to identify high risk active duty service members based on their medication use and emergency department encounters. The Indian Health Service has successfully piloted integrating this data into their electronic systems, and a pilot to integrate data into the workflow of physicians in the DoD health system is slated to launch in 2016.
•      The DOJ Bureau of Justice Assistance released a Law Enforcement Naloxone Toolkit to support law enforcement agencies in establishing naloxone programs. The toolkit has been downloaded more than 2,200 times in the last year.
•      DOD is ensuring that opioid overdose reversal kits and training are available to every first responder on military bases or other areas under its control.
•      The Office of National Drug Control Policy supports local Drug Free Communities coalitions to reduce youth substance use through evidence-based prevention. In recent years, hundreds of these coalitions have specifically focused on prescription drug misuse issues in their areas.
Treatment
•      Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, substance use disorder and mental health services are essential health benefits that are required to be covered by health plans in the Health Insurance Marketplace.
•      New rules finalized by this Administration ensure that covered mental health and substance use disorder benefits are comparable to medical and surgical benefits.
•      HHS is investing up to $100 million in Affordable Care Act funding to expand substance use disorder treatment, with a focus on medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders, in community health centers across the country.
•      HHS Secretary Burwell announced that the Department will engage in rulemaking related to the prescribing of buprenorphine-containing products approved by the FDA for treatment of opioid dependence to expand access to medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders. HHS will take a strategic approach in order to minimize diversion and ensure evidence-based treatment.
•      The CDC has been working over the last year with clinical experts and other stakeholders to develop new, peer-reviewed guidelines on prescribing opioids for chronic pain outside end of life settings to help improve the way opioids are prescribed and ensure patients have access to safer, more effective chronic pain treatment, while reducing opioid misuse and overdose.
•      HHS recently awarded $11 million in new grants to States to support medication-assisted treatment and $1.8 million to help rural communities purchase naloxone and train first responders in its use.
Enforcement and Supply Reduction
•      The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy's High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program is funding an unprecedented network of public health and law enforcement partnerships to address the heroin threat across 15 states.
•      In October of 2015, DOJ's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office) awarded $6 million through the Anti-Heroin Task Force Program, which is designed to advance public safety by providing funds to investigate illicit activities related to the distribution of heroin or unlawful distribution of prescriptive opioids, or unlawful heroin and prescription opioid traffickers through statewide collaboration.
•      DOJ's enforcement efforts include targeting the illegal opioid supply chain, thwarting doctor-shopping attempts, and disrupting so-called "pill mills."
•      DOJ has cracked down on those who use the Internet to buy and sell controlled substances.
•      DEA agents and investigators are integrating with other federal, state, and local law enforcement officers in 66 Tactical Diversion Squads stationed across 41 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. Outcomes of this effort include the largest pharmaceutical-related takedown in the DEA's history in an operation that resulted in 280 arrests.
•      Since 2007, through the Merida Initiative, the Department of State has been working with the Government of Mexico to help build the capacity of Mexico's law enforcement and justice sector institutions to disrupt drug trafficking organizations and to stop the flow of illicit drugs including heroin from Mexico to the United States.
