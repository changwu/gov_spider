    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Markey (D) Massachusetts and Rinaldo (R) New Jersey)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 3265, but will seek an amendment in the Senate to delete section 9. Section 9 could be interpreted inappropriately as giving trade policymaking authority to the FCC, an independent commission.
