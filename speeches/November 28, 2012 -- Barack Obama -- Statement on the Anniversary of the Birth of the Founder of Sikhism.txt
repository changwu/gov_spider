    I send my best wishes to all those here in America and around the world who are observing the anniversary of birth of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the first Sikh guru. As always, this is a time to celebrate the principles of equality, respect, service, and interfaith cooperation that are the core of the Sikh faith and to recognize the extraordinary contributions that Sikh Americans make to our country every day. This year, we also remember the innocent lives that were lost in the unspeakable violence directed against the Sikh congregation at the gurdwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. I can think of no better way to honor their memory and to join our Sikh friends as they mark this sacred time than to recommit ourselves to the spirit of pluralism, equality and compassion that define both the Sikh community and our Nation.
