    Today, Republican and former Congressman Larry Hopkins endorsed Ohio Gov. John Kasich for President and joined the Kasich for America Leadership team in Kentucky.
Hopkins represented Kentucky's 6th district from 1979-1992. He previously served in the Kentucky State House of Representatives and the State Senate from 1972-1978.
"I deeply respect and trust John Kasich," said Hopkins. "As our neighbor across the river, Kentuckians have had a front row seat to his record of success of balancing the budget and cutting taxes in Ohio. I am proud to endorse him and support his candidacy to the White House to bring fiscal responsiblity to the federal government."
Said Kasich, "I welcome Congressman Hopkins to the team. It is an honor to have his endorsement as we work to bring real, commonsense solutions to the American people. He will be a remarkable asset to our team in Kentucky."
