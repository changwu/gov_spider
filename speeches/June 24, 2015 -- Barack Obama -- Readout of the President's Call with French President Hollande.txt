    President Obama spoke this morning with President Francois Hollande of France. The President affirmed our unwavering commitment to the bilateral relationship, including our ongoing close cooperation in the intelligence and security fields. The President reiterated that we have abided by the commitment we made to our French counterparts in late 2013 that we are not targeting and will not target the communications of the French President. As the President noted during President Hollande's State Visit to Washington, D.C., in February 2014, we are committed to our productive and indispensable intelligence relationship with France, which allows us to make progress against shared threats, including international terrorism and proliferation, among others.
