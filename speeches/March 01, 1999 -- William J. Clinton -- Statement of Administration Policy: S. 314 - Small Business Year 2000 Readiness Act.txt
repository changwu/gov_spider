    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Bond (R) MO and 16 cosponsors)
The Administration has no objection to Senate passage of S. 314. The Administration notes, however, that there are existing loan programs at the Small Business Administration that could be used by most small businesses to address their Y2K readiness needs.
