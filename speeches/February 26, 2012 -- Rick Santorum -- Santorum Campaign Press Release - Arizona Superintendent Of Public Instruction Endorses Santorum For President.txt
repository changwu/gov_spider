    Verona, PA - The Rick Santorum for President campaign is proud to announce that it has received the endorsement of Arizona's Superintendent of Public Instruction, John Huppenthal.
John Huppenthal said: "I have been closely following the race and learning about the values and positions of each of the candidates. Our nation is facing serious issues - issues that require a President with the conservative conviction and experience to guide America back towards the ideals that made our county great. Senator Santorum's values most closely align with my own, that is why I am proud to endorse him as our party's nominee for President of the United States of America."
Rick Santorum said: "I am thrilled to receive John's endorsement today. We have seen a terrific surge in support in Arizona in recent weeks, and I am confident that with John's help, our momentum will continue. I look forward to working with John in the coming days and the months to come to ensure Arizona remains a strong, Republican strong-hold this November as we work to defeat Barack Obama."
John Huppenthal currently serves as Arizona's Superintendent of Public Instruction. Prior to his election as Superintendent of Public Instruction, Huppenthal served as on the Chandler City Council, in the Arizona State House of Representatives, and in the Arizona State Senate.
