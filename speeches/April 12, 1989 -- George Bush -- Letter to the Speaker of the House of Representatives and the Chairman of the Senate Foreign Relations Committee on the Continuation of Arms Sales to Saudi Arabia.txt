    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
I am writing to you with respect to Section 1307 of the National Defense Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1989, which prohibits the sale of any defense articles subject to Section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act to any nation which has acquired intermediate-range ballistic missiles made by the People's Republic of China. Section 1307(b) includes a provision that this restriction will cease to apply if the President certifies to the Congress that the nation which has purchased the missiles does not have chemical, biological, or nuclear warheads for those missiles.
After a review of the information available to the United States Government, I have certified that Saudi Arabia does not possess chemical, biological, or nuclear warheads for its intermediate-range ballistic missiles purchased from the People's Republic of China.
A copy of my certification pursuant to Section 1307 of the National Defense Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1989, is enclosed. Additional information concerning this action is contained in the enclosed justification.
Sincerely,
George Bush
