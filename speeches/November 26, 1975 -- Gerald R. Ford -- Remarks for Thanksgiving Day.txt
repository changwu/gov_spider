Aa Americans celebrate Thanksgiving Day, we once more count our bountiful blessings. We give thanks, first and foremost, to the Supreme Creator. We are thankful that our Nation is at peace.
This holiday reminds us of our duty to provide responsibly for the needs of our families and of our neighbors--the same values that guided those who celebrated our first Thanksgiving.
We recognize anew our national motto which proclaims "In God We Trust." We continue to trust. Our faith has been vindicated as we approach a bicentennial of national thanksgiving.
Our belief in America's goodness, in America's greatness, and in America's future continues to inspire us.
In that spirit, my family and I gratefully give thanks and wish all of you a very happy Thanksgiving Day.
