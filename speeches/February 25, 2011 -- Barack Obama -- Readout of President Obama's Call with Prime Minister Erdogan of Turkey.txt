They affirmed their strong support for the universal rights of the Libyan people, including the right to peaceful assembly, free speech, and the ability of the Libyan people to determine their own destiny and agreed that these rights must be respected. They discussed the range of options that both the United States and Turkey are considering to ensure the security of our citizens in Libya and hold the Libyan government accountable for its actions. They also agreed on the importance of providing humanitarian assistance to the people of Libya. They agreed to maintain close contact on this issue going forward, and took note of the fact that Secretary of State Clinton will consult with her Turkish counterpart Foreign Minister Davutoglu when she travels to Geneva on Monday.
