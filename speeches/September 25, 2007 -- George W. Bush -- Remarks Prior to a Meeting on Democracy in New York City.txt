    Thank you all for coming. This is a meeting of people who love liberty and who understand that freedom is universal. I appreciate the ability to share thoughts about how to embolden those who seek reform to stand with those who are willing to fight tyranny and ways for us all to be effective.
As you know, there are people around the world who are desperate to live in free societies. I think, for example, of those in Burma. And it's incumbent upon those of us who live in free societies to help them. I can think of no better way to work toward freedom than to strategize with leaders from around the world who are willing to take the hard steps necessary to spread liberty.
And so I'm looking forward to our strategy session. I appreciate your time. I want to thank you very much for your interest in this vital subject. Thanks.
