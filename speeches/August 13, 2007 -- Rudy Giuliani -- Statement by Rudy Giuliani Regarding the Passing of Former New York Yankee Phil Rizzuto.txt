    Rudy Giuliani made the following statement today regarding the passing of former New York Yankee Phil Rizzuto:
"I send my deepest condolences to Cora and the Rizzuto family for the loss of a truly great Yankee.
"As a lifelong Yankee fan, Phil was one of my childhood heroes. He was also the Yankee announcer I grew up with and it was a great privilege for me later in life to become his friend.
"He was an excellent ballplayer, superb announcer, one of the greatest bunters in the history of baseball and a truly fine person. Everyone will miss the Yankee Scooter."
