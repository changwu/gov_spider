    National Security Advisor Susan Rice met today with Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond of the United Kingdom to discuss a range of issues. They continued their close coordination with regard to the ongoing P5+1 nuclear negotiations with Iran, reaffirming their commitment to achieving a long term, comprehensive deal that fully and verifiably addresses the international community's concerns about Iran's nuclear program. They also discussed Yemen, agreeing that a negotiated political solution remains the best outcome, as a military-only approach will lead to further suffering and destabilization in the region. On Libya, the two reiterated their agreement of support for the UN's efforts to help form a unity government and forge a political resolution to the conflict that is currently destabilizing the country.
