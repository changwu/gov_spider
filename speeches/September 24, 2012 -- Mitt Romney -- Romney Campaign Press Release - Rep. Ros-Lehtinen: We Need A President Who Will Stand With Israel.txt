    Florida Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen today made the following statement on President Obama calling Israel's concerns about an Iran armed with nuclear weapons "noise": Â 
"The contrast between President Obama and Mitt Romney when it comes to standing with Israel could not be clearer than in last night's 60 Minutes interview. Mitt Romney unequivocally reiterated the United States' alliance with Israel and argued for an even closer relationship. President Obama, on the other hand, referred to concerns about the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran as 'noise' coming from 'one of our closest allies in the region.' The President of the United States must be unwavering in his commitment and resolve to standing with our most loyal democratic ally. President Obama has fallen far short of that, which is one of the reasons we must have Mitt Romney in the White House."
