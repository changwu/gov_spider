    For several days now, we have been watching and waiting as Hurricane Erin approached the Florida coast, not knowing what to expect but preparing for the worst. We thank God that this storm did not pack the catastrophic punch that others have in the past. However, it did cause considerable damage.
Our hearts and prayers go out to all who have been impacted by the hurricane. We pray for a quick recovery. To help that process get underway, I have tonight signed an emergency declaration for the State of Florida and have asked James Lee Witt, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to coordinate all efforts to save lives and protect the health, safety, and property of those affected.
There are already FEMA trucks loaded with plastic sheeting, chainsaws, generators, and other tools headed for the impacted area. Director Witt will go to Florida first thing in the morning, inspect the damage, and report back to me.
I have spoken with Governor Chiles and asked him to convey to the people of Florida our commitment to this recovery effort. I am proud of the work Governor Chiles and all of the State and local emergency workers did in preparing for this storm. As a former Governor, I know how important emergency preparedness is in saving lives and protecting property. I applaud their efforts and salute the courage and strength of all Floridians dealing with the damage caused by the hurricane.
