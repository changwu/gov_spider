    This morning's attack in Riyadh against an American facility is an outrage. Our condolences and prayers go out to the victims and their families. We appreciate the speed and professionalism with which Saudi authorities have responded to this emergency and will work closely with them in identifying those responsible for this cowardly act and bringing them to justice.
