    I KNOW that all Americans will join with Mrs. Eisenhower and me in expressing deep regret at the passing of Samuel Cardinal Stritch, the first American prelate to be entrusted with the care of the foreign missions of his church. His spiritual leadership contributed much to the common good in America and will be greatly missed.
