    We congratulate Greece on successfully completing its parliamentary elections, and we look forward to working closely with its next government. The Greek people have taken many difficult but important steps to lay the groundwork for economic recovery. As a longstanding friend and ally, the United States will continue to support their efforts and those of the international community to strengthen the foundation for Greece's long-term prosperity.
