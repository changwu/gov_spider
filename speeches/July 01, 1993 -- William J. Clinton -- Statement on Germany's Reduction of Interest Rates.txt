    Today's news that Germany has cut interest rates again is welcome news. With over 22 million people out of work in Europe, and our economy at last beginning to create jobs again, Germany's responsible fiscal and monetary actions could not have come at a more critical time for both Europe and the United States. It is also another sign that when America takes the lead in cutting its deficit and getting interest rates down we encourage other major nations to follow our lead in spurring global growth.
By getting our house in order, we have facilitated pro-growth policies in Europe that mean more demand for American products overseas and more jobs and higher incomes for the Americans who make those products here at home.
Germany has taken an important step toward improved growth, and I look forward to further progress at the G-7 summit in Tokyo.
