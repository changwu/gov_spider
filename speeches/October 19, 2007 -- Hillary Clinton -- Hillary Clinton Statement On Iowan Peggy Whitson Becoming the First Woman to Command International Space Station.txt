    "Just as Americans celebrated the momentous journey of Dr. Sally K. Ride as the first American woman in space, today we reaffirm our commitment to the diversity and opportunity of the American experience. I stand with all Americans, young and old, in saluting Peggy Whitson as she becomes the first female Commander of the International Space Station.
It is moments like these, when we dare to defy boundaries, which provide young girls everywhere the evidence that if you work hard, you too can achieve whatever it is you seek to do. As president, I will bring the change our country needs and promote a nationwide commitment to innovation that includes an ambitious 21st Century Space Exploration program, and together, we will continue to reach for the stars."
