I don't know who Juaquin Castro is other than the lesser brother of a failed presidential candidate (1%) who makes a fool of himself every time he opens his mouth. Juaquin is not the man that his brother is but his brother according to most is not much. Keep fighting Juaquin!Retweets: 2390Favorites: 9206

Leaving El Paso for the White House. What GREAT people I met there and in Dayton Ohio. The Fake News worked overtime trying to disparage me and the two trips but it just didn't work. The love respect & enthusiasm were there for all to see. They have been through so much. Sad!Retweets: 21529Favorites: 101614

The Dems new weapon is actually their old weapon one which they never cease to use when they are down or run out of facts RACISM! They are truly disgusting! They even used it on Nancy Pelosi.

Just watched a world class loser Tim O'Brien who I haven't seen or spoken to in many years & knows NOTHING about me except that he wrote a failed hit piece book about me 15 years ago. Fired like a dog from other jobs? Saw him on Lyin' Brian Williams Trump Slam Show. Bad TV....Retweets: 19724Favorites: 111272

....I am so amazed that MSNBC & CNN can keep putting on over and over again people that have no idea what I am all about and yet they speak as experts on 'Trump.' Same people since long before the 2016 Election and how did that work out for the Haters and Losers. Not well!Retweets: 19748Favorites: 111268

As your President one would think that I would be thrilled with our very strong dollar. I am not!

....in the world there is nobody even close but unfortunately the same cannot be said about our Federal Reserve. They have called it wrong at every step of the way and we are still winning. Can you imagine what would happen if they actually called it right?Retweets: 15281Favorites: 77522

Iran is in serious financial trouble. They want desperately to talk to the U.S. but are given mixed signals from all of those purporting to represent us including President Macron of France....Retweets: 20366Favorites: 93182
