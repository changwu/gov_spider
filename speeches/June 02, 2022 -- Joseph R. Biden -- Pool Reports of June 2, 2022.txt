I'm waiting at the pooler desk and will cover.

In Town Pool Report #4 | Stoltenberg Gaggle
NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg started the gaggle at 12:47 pm.
He began by commending the US for its leadership and saying Finland and Sweden's decisions to apply for NATO membership are "historic." Then he discussed the upcoming Madrid summit. He took questions on the endgame in Ukraine, Turkey's opposition to the recent NATO applications, the US' role in mediating that process, and other topics. Some quotes below, but check everything against the transcript linked at the bottom.
"Wars are by nature unpredictable and therefore we just have to be prepared for the long haul."
The war is one of "attrition" on Ukraine's part, he said, and that Russia is taking "high casualties."
On unblocking Turkey's opposition to the Sweden and Finland applications he said all three countries are in close contact and will convene in a meeting in coming days: "Turkey is an important ally"
On whether Ukraine can win or will need to concede territory: "It's for us to support them."
On NATO escorting ships seeking to carry grain from Ukraine: a global food crunch"Is caused by Russia's war" so the easiest way to end that is to "end the war."
On whether Pope Francis could help mediate an end to the war: "I won't speculate about that"
He finished speaking at 12:58 p.m. and walked to Pebble Beach. Link to Otter transcript copied below. (Again, I could barely see my phone in the light so please check)

In Town Pool Report #12 | POTUS Ends
The president finished speaking at 7:48 p.m.
Gripping the front of the podium in a navy suit and dark speckled tie, he asked that Congress resume the provisions under the former assault weapons ban, expand background checks, and pass red flag and safe storage laws. Without an assault weapons ban, he called for the minimum purchasing age to be raised to 21. He also called for a repeal to the "liability shield" around firearms manufacturers and requested increased mental health services.
After finishing, he exited quietly and didn't take shouted questions about how to keep guns out of the wrong hands.
