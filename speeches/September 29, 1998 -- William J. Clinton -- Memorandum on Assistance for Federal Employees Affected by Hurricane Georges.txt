    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Subject: Assistance for Federal Employees Affected by Hurricane Georges
I am deeply concerned about the devastating losses suffered by many as a result of Hurricane Georges. Multiple parts of the Federal Government have been mobilized to respond to this disaster.
As part of this effort, I ask the heads of executive departments and agencies who have Federal civilian employees in designated disaster areas resulting from Hurricane Georges and its aftermath (including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) to use their discretion to excuse from duty, without charge to leave or loss of pay, any such employee who is prevented from reporting to work or faced with a personal emergency because of this disaster and who can be spared from his or her usual responsibilities. This policy also should be applied to any employee who is needed for emergency law enforcement, relief, or clean-up efforts authorized by Federal, State, or other officials having jurisdiction.
I am also authorizing the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to determine whether there is a need to establish an emergency leave transfer program to assist employees affected by this major disaster. An emergency leave transfer program would permit employees in an executive agency to donate their unused annual leave for transfer to employees of the same or other agencies who were adversely affected by the hurricane and who need additional time off for recovery. If the need for donated annual leave becomes evident, I direct OPM to establish the emergency leave transfer program and provide additional information to agencies on the programs's administration.
