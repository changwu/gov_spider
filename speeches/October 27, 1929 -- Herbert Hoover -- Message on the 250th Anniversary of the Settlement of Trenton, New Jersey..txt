My dear Mr. Kerney:
I congratulate the citizens of Trenton upon the 250th Anniversary of the settlement of their city. This is a memorable occasion in the life of a historic community. I would add my best wishes for continued growth in well-being and civic ideals for the future.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
