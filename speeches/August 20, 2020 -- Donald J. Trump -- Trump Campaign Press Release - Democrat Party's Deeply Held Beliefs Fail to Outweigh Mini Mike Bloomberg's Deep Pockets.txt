    Democrats ignore Bloomberg's racism and sexism for money.
A few short months ago, Democrats on the debate stage savaged Mini Mike Bloomberg as a racist and a sexist. Now, in another massive blow to their #MeToo credibility, they're giving him a prime speaking slot at their convention –right after they honored Bill Clinton.
Elizabeth Warren, who spoke last night after a segment emphasizing the importance of supporting survivors, led the charge against Bloomberg earlier this year. "Why shouldn't I believe" the woman who made allegations against Bloomberg, Warren asked. "I believe the woman… why would she lie?"
Joe Biden criticized Bloomberg for not doing enough to address the allegations against him. But then Bloomberg gave a whopping $18 million to the Democrat Party and all was forgotten.
Democrats are also hoping viewers forget Bloomberg's scathing attacks on Biden's capacity to be president.

Bloomberg warned that President Trump would "eat alive" Biden because Biden doesn't have "practical" plans and lacks "management experience."???????
Bloomberg said Biden isn't capable of being an effective president.

Whether he's standing on a box tonight or not, Mini Mike's appearance proves Democrats are willing to abandon their beliefs for the right price.
