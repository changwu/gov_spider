    FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD - John Delaney releases the following statement after the announcement of the first DNC Debate lineup:
"The focus of the first debate should be on how we solve the real problems facing hard-working Americans, particularly health care. I look forward to laying out how my health care plan - 'BetterCare' - is both superior health care policy, and a much smarter way forward, than Senator Sanders plan, Medicare for All. The American people want universal health care, but they don't want an approach that forces half the country to switch their plans or that under invests in quality. I am also pleased to be sharing the debate stage with many strong candidates, particularly Senator Warren who, like me, is talking about new ideas. I look forward to a debate on issues and solutions, not personality and politics."
