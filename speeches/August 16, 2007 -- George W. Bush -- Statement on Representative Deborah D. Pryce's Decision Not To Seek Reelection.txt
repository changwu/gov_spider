    Throughout her congressional career, Deborah Pryce has championed issues that matter to the families of central Ohio. Her commitment to reducing taxes, strengthening our national defense, and reforming our health care system has helped improve the lives of her constituents and made America a more hopeful nation. She has also earned national recognition as a persuasive advocate on behalf of women and children. Based on her strong legislative record and consensus-building skills, Deb'scolleagues selected her to lead the House Republican Conferenceâ€”the highest leadership post ever held by a Republican woman. She will be missed when she departs the Congress.
I look forward to continuing to work with her throughout the remainder of her service. Laura and I appreciate Deb's friendship and wish her and her family all the best.
