Elijah Cummings never even went to the Southern Border and then he screams at the very good people who despite Congresses failure to fix the Loopholes and Asylum make it work (crossings are way down and the Wall is being built). Even with zero Dem help Border getting strong!Retweets: 22363Favorites: 90956

Baltimore's numbers are the worst in the United States on Crime and the Economy. Billions of dollars have been pumped in over the years but to no avail. The money was stolen or wasted. Ask Elijah Cummings where it went. He should investigate himself with his Oversight Committee!Retweets: 31335Favorites: 117736

Somali refugees arresed in Tucson on way to Egypt. They were in touch with an agent posing as a terrorist. One of them stated 'The best wake up call is Islamic State to get victory or another 9/11.' Get smart people! #MAGA #KAG @foxandfriendsRetweets: 21914Favorites: 67618

Despite the Democrats wanting very unsafe Open Borders & refusing to change the Loopholes & Asylum tremendous progress is being made the the Southern Border. We all waited because we assumed the Dems would ultimately be forced to change the horrible Immigration Laws.They didn't!Retweets: 15111Favorites: 61768

China is doing very badly worst year in 27 - was supposed to start buying our agricultural product now - no signs that they are doing so. That is the problem with China they just don't come through. Our Economy has become MUCH larger than the Chinese Economy is last 3 years....Retweets: 18896Favorites: 95009

..My team is negotiating with them now but they always change the deal in the end to their benefit. They should probably wait out our Election to see if we get one of the Democrat stiffs like Sleepy Joe. Then they could make a GREAT deal like in past 30 years and continueRetweets: 13634Favorites: 72598

...to ripoff the USA even bigger and better than ever before. The problem with them waiting however is that if & when I win the deal that they get will be much tougher than what we are negotiating now...or no deal at all. We have all the cards our past leaders never got it!Retweets: 14923Favorites: 79619

Wow! Morning Joe & Psycho ratings have really crashed. Very small audience. People are tired of hearing Fake News delivered with an anger that is not to be believed.
