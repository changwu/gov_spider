    The President welcomes the constructive and helpful decision by the government of Israel to enable Chairman Arafat to travel freely, to accept international monitors with respect to six named prisoners now in Chairman Arafat's compound, and to withdraw Israeli forces from Ramallah. This decision follows intensive efforts aimed at achieving an urgent and nonviolent resolution to the situation in Ramallah, including a phone call yesterday morning from the President to Prime Minister Sharon. We are now in close contact with the Palestinian Authority and are working with both sides to implement proposals that we have advanced in order to achieve that objective.
