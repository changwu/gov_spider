    The people of the United States join the people of the Republic of Cyprus in celebrating its 50 years of independence today. This year also marks the 50th anniversary of bilateral relations between our countries, which are united by ties of kinship and common ideals. Our partnership is strengthened by the long history of friendship between our peoples and the many contributions Americans of Cypriot ancestry have made to our Nation. We look forward to deepening our relationship and strengthening cooperation in our many areas of mutual interest.
On this occasion, we recognize not just this history, but also the hopes for future security and prosperity. We applaud the determined efforts to achieve a comprehensive Cyprus settlement and support the reunification of the island as a bizonal, bicommunal federation. The United States is confident that a resolution meeting the aspirations of both communities is attainable.
We congratulate the people of the Republic of Cyprus on this historic anniversary.
