    The American people join me in extending our deepest condolences over the passing of a great leader and a great son of the Polish nation, Cardinal Wyszynski. Americans nurtured a deep respect and admiration for Cardinal Wyszynski as Primate of Poland. He played a vital role in helping to safeguard deep and enduring values which both our peoples share, and in the development of close relations between our two countries over the past quarter-century. My compatriots and I fully share Poland's deep sense of loss.
