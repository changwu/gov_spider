    On behalf of the American people, I congratulate the people of Zambia on the historic September 20 Presidential, parliamentary, and local elections, and I commend you for building on your commitment to multiparty democracy. Zambia's Electoral Commission, political leaders, civil society, and above all its citizens all contributed to this important accomplishment. The United States looks forward to working with President Michael Sata, Members of Parliament, and representatives of all of Zambia's political parties to build on the longstanding partnership between our two nations.
I also acknowledge former President Rupiah Banda's contributions to Zambia's democratic development, including his 3 years of distinguished leadership and his admirable acceptance of the will of the Zambian people. The hard work of a living democracy does not end when the votes are tallied and the winners announced. Instead, it offers the chance to reconcile and to advance greater security and prosperity for its people. Today is a day for Zambia to celebrate their democratic achievement. I hope that all Zambians will find common ground as you address the challenges and seize the opportunities facing your country and our world.
