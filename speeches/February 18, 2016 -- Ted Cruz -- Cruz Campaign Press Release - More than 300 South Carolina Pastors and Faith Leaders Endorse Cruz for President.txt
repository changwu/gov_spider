GREENVILLE, SC — Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today announced the endorsements of more than 300 South Carolina faith leaders.
"I believe we need to reassemble the Reagan coalition, to unite conservatives and libertarians and evangelicals and women and young people and Hispanics and blue collar workers to build a grassroots army of courageous conservatives, sharing common values and reigniting the promise of America," said Cruz. "Our pastor and faith leader endorsements today are a strong signal that the Reagan coalition is in fact coming back together, especially here in the Palmetto State."
"While the endorsement of a single pastor is important, over 300 pastors and faith leaders endorsing a candidate like Ted Cruz sends an amazing message about Ted Cruz's character, his consistent conservative record, and his defense of our shared values here in South Carolina," said Pastor Mike Gonzalez, Senior Pastor of Columbia World Outreach Church and Co-Chair of the South Carolina Cruz for President campaign.
The Cruz campaign is moving rapidly in South Carolina, with volunteers making 50,000 calls a day and knocking over 7,000 doors each day. The Cruz campaign has over 11,000 South Carolina volunteers, along with hundreds of out of state volunteers helping in campaign centers throughout the state. In addition, the campaign has campaign chairs and faith leaders in each county.
Titles and affiliations of all endorsers are provided for identification purposes only. This is one in a series of releases announcing leaders of faith who support Ted Cruz for President.
