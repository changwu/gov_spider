    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Ackerman (D) NY)
The Administration supports authority for annual leave sharing by Federal employees in personal emergencies, but opposes enactment of H.R. 3757 because this bill contains serious flaws that would add cost and complicate administration of the program. In particular, the bill would require an experiment with a "leave fund," which would involve much more administration and paperwork and be less effective than a person-to-person leave transfer program. It would also require experiments with the transfer of sick leave as well as annual leave, which would result in additional cost to the Government.
The Administration recommends that H.R.. 3757 not be considered under suspension of the rules so that it can be amended to delete these objectionable provisions. If the bill is so amended, the Administration would support its enactment.
