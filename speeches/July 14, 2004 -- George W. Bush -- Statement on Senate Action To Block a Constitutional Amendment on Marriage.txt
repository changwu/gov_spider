    I am deeply disappointed that the effort to pass a constitutional amendment affirming the sanctity of marriage as being between a man and a woman was temporarily blocked in the Senate.
Activist judges and local officials in some parts of the country are not letting up in their efforts to redefine marriage for the rest of Americaâ€”and neither should defenders of traditional marriage flag in their efforts.
It is important for our country to continue the debate on this important issue, and I urge the House of Representatives to pass this amendment.
