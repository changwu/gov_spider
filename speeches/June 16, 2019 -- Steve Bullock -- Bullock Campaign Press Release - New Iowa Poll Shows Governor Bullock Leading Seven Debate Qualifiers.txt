    Poll Comes Days After DNC Blocked Governor Bullock From June Debate
Helena, MT – This morning, a new CBS News/YouGov Poll in Iowa shows Montana Governor Steve Bullock meeting the DNC's debate threshold for the second debate in July. The poll comes just days after the DNC decided to exclude Governor Bullock from the first debate. Bullock also leads seven candidates who the DNC is allowing into the June debate.
As his fourth poll to meet the DNC's announced standards for qualification, Governor Bullock is showing early success with caucus-goers in Iowa. While many of the candidates joined the field early in the year, Governor Bullock entered just one month ago, working until mid-May in Montana's legislative session to expand Medicaid and ensure nearly 100,000 people could keep their healthcare.
"Today's CBS/YouGov poll of the first-in-the-nation caucus shows Governor Bullock's ability to build a base of support in Iowa," said Iowa State Director Megan Simpson. "If Democrats want to win back states like Iowa in 2020, Governor Bullock brings unparalleled experience as the only candidate who has won and governed in a Trump state."
