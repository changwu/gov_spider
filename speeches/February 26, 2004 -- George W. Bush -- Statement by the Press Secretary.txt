    On behalf of the American people, the President expresses his condolences to His Majesty King Mohamed VI and the people of Morocco on the terrible loss of life as a result of the tragic earthquake in Al Hoceima.
The American people and government stand ready to help in any way possible to assist our friends and allies in Morocco in this time of need.
Assistance provided thus far to the Kingdom of Morocco for use in the afflicted area includes a donation to the Moroccan Red Crescent for relief supplies and 10,000 woolen blankets. Additionally, we are sending plastic sheeting for emergency shelters, 1,000 tents, 50 diesel generators, and 3 medical kits with drugs and supplies for a total of 30,000 people. We have also sent a team of six American disaster experts to help coordinate relief activities and distribute supplies.
American assistance will continue to flow into Morocco to help the people of the region recover from this earthquake, and the United States is coordinating its efforts very closely with the Moroccan government.
The Moroccan and American people have been friends, partners, and allies for over two centuries. In this time of need, the people and government of the United States will do their utmost to respond to this tragedy.
