    The White House is pleased to announce that Susan E. "Susie" Morrison will serve as the next White House Executive Pastry Chef. Morrison is the seventh person and first woman to serve in this role. She begins just in time to spearhead the always highly anticipated Holiday Gingerbread House. The position was most recently held by William Yosses, who departed earlier this year to create the "Kitchen Garden Laboratory," a wellness through cooking advocacy group.
As Executive Pastry Chef, Morrison will be responsible for the day to day operation of the pastry kitchen. Morrison will oversee creating and executing the dessert menus for all social events at the White House, including receptions, luncheons and state dinners.
Morrison's career at the Executive Residence began in 1995 as a contract pastry employee while employed at the Ritz-Carlton, Tysons Corner Hotel. She was appointed to Assistant Pastry Chef in 2002. During her time working at the White House, Morrison worked with Executive Pastry Chefs Roland Mesnier, Thaddeus Dubois and Bill Yosses. Executive Chef Cristeta Comerford has continued to be a mentor, leader and inspiration for Morrison.
With an avid interest in assuring the health of the bee population and its honey production, Morrison will continue to tend the White House bee hive and support the White House Kitchen Garden. When her work schedule allows, you can find Morrison cycling, running, swimming and surfing.
