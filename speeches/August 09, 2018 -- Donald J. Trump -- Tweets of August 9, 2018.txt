'There has been no evidence whatsoever that Donald Trump or the campaign was involved in any kind of collusion to fix the 2016 election. In fact the evidence is the opposite that Hillary Clinton & the Democrats colluded with the Russians to fix the 2016 election.' @GrahamLedgerRetweets: 26362Favorites: 100528

@LindseyGrahamSC 'Why didn't the FBI tell President Trump that they had concerns about Carter Page? Is there a double standard here?' They told Senator Diane Feinstein that she had a spy - but not Trump. Is that entrapment or did they just want to use Page as an excuse to SPY?Retweets: 6715Favorites: 13653

Jenna Ellis 'FBI thought they wouldn't get caught because they thought that Hillary was going to win. There is overt bias and that depends on whether you are Democrat or Republican - a double standard that needs to stop.'Retweets: 29464Favorites: 112260
