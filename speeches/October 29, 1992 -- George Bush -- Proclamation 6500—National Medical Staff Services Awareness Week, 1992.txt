    By the President of the United States of AmericaA Proclamation
The professionals who direct or manage medical staff services, from hospital communications to the accreditation of physicians and nurses, play an important role in our Nation's health care system. In addition to serving in hospitals and other primary care facilities, these professionals also work in health maintenance organizations, medical societies, State licensing boards, and consulting firms. By administering rules and regulations, by ensuring accreditation compliance, and by providing a wide range of support to physicians, medical staff coordinators help to promote the quality and efficiency of health care.
Today many medical staff services professionals are striving to promote efficiency and professionalism in health care by working through the legal, financial, and regulatory requirements that have increased along with new challenges and opportunities in the health care industry. This week, we acknowledge the value of such efforts.
The Congress, by House Joint Resolution 399, has designated the week of November 1 through November 7, 1992, as "National Medical Staff Services Awareness Week" and has requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.
Now, Therefore, I, George Bush, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of November 1 through November 7, 1992, as National Medical Staff Services Awareness Week. I invite all Americans to observe this week with appropriate programs and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventeenth.
GEORGE BUSH
