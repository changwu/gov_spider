    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Greenwood (R) PA)
The Administration supports H.R. 3096, which would correct a technical error in section 8148(a) of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA). The bill would clarify that individuals who commit fraud in the receipt of FECA benefits would lose their entitlement to such benefits.
