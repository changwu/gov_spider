    The deaths of the two U.S. marines and wounding of three others in the early morning hours of September 6 saddened us all. We condemn those responsible for the continuing violence that has claimed thousands of innocent victims. We are proud of our own forces and the important role they are playing to achieve security for the Lebanese people.
The Lebanese Government has issued a call to all parties to unite to restore national dialog. We will continue to work with them toward that end. The goal of a newly united Lebanon, free of foreign forces, is a dream of the Lebanese people, regardless of their religious community. Together with our Italian, French, and British partners in the multinational force, we are performing a critical role in support of the effort of the central government. No one should mistake our determination to continue in this just cause.
