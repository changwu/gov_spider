    On behalf of the people of the United States, Laura and I extend congratulations to Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela on his 90th birthday. I applaud the leadership he is providing on many vital causes in South Africa and around the world. Mr. Mandela is a great example of courage, hope, and the power of freedom.
