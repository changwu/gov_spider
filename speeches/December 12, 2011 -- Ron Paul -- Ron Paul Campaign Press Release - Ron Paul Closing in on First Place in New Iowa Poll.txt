    Holding strong position, support growing
LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” A new American Research Group poll of likely Iowa caucus goers released today shows GOP presidential candidate Ron Paul tied for second place with 17 percent of the vote and within 5 points of Newt Gingrich, who garnered 22 percent of the vote. Of note, Congressman Paul wins 39 percent of the vote among independents, more than twice that of the nearest competitor.
"Our campaign is continuing to make strides in the key early-voting states, especially in Iowa," said Ron Paul 2012 Presidential Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton. "After witnessing packed rallies time and again in Iowa, it is no surprise that we are seeing these encouraging poll numbers."
This latest poll comes on the heels of a PPP poll, which showed Paul with 18 percent in Iowa. In addition, a recent NBC/ Marist poll had Paul at 17 percent in Iowa and also polling the best against Obama in an Iowa head-to-head matchup.
