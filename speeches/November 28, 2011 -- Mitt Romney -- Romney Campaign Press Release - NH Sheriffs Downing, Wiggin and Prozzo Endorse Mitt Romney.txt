    Mitt Romney today announced the endorsements of New Hampshire Sheriffs Mike Downing (R-Rockingham County), Craig Wiggin (R-Belknap County), and Michael Prozzo (R-Sullivan County). They join Sheriffs Scott Hilliard (R-Merrimack County) and Douglas Dutile (R-Grafton County) in supporting Governor Romney.
"I am proud to have earned the endorsements of these outstanding New Hampshire sheriffs," said Mitt Romney. "I am grateful for their support and am pleased that they have joined my campaign to shrink government, cut taxes for the middle class and create jobs."
"For three years, President Obama has failed to turn around our struggling economy. We have seen an increase in evictions and foreclosures. People need jobs, real jobs, to pay their rent and mortgages. Those that are released after being incarcerated have an even harder time finding employment and reintegrating into society. The cycle has to stop and people need results not empty promises," said Sheriff Downing. "Mitt Romney has spent 25 years in the private sector balancing budgets, growing companies and creating jobs. He understands how our economy works and how to get our country back on track. Mitt has the experience, knowledge and skills required to lead our country and to defeat President Obama in 2012."
