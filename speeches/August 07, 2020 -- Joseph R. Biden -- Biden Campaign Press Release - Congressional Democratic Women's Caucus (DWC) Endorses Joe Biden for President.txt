    Today, the Congressional Democratic Women's Caucus met with Vice President Joe Biden to discuss priorities and Joe Biden's agenda to move our country forward, as well as expand opportunities for women. Following today's meeting, the Congressional Democratic Women's Caucus is endorsing Vice President Joe Biden for President of the United States.
The leadership of the Democratic Women's Caucus, Co-Chairs Brenda L. Lawrence (MI-14), Lois Frankel (FL-21), Jackie Speier (CA-14), and Vice Chairs Veronica Escobar (TX-16) and Deb Haaland (NM-01), issued the following statement:
"We are proud and excited to endorse Joe Biden for President of the United States. Joe has been a champion for women throughout his entire career, and now more than ever we need his steadfast leadership, character, and experience to lead us out of the economic, racial, and pandemic crisis that we are experiencing thanks to the failed leadership of Donald Trump.
"Joe put forth a women's agenda that outlined how he will expand opportunities for women and girls, including investing in women owned small businesses, expanding access to childcare, addressing the disparate challenges facing women of color, protecting women's rights to access health care, including reproductive health, and caring for older Americans and people living with disabilities, as well as ending violence against women and supporting economic security for women and their families. We know that the stakes couldn't be higher this November and that our future is brighter with Joe Biden as President and his running mate - whomever is chosen - as Vice President. As President we know Joe Biden will put the wellbeing of the American people first.
"We look forward to working on behalf of Joe Biden to beat Donald Trump, restore dignity and respect to the office of the presidency, and elect Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States of America."
