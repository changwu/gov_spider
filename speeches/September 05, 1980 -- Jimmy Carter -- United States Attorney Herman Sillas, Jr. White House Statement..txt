    There have been a number of press reports about the Department of Justice's recommendations to the President concerning Mr. Herman Sillas, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of California. The President's Counsel, Lloyd N. Cutler, has reviewed these recommendations and, together with the Department of Justice, has afforded Mr. Sillas and his counsel a full opportunity to examine the record and submit their comments.
Mr. Cutler has presented his report to the President, who has reviewed and approved it. It concludes that the allegation against Mr. Sillas has not been proven. An unproven allegation, of course, should not damage Mr. Sillas' good reputation. However, the report also concludes that because of the course of the investigation and the events connected with it, the necessary relationship of mutual trust and confidence between the Department of Justice and Mr. Sillas, as a United States attorney, has been impaired to the point where either or both may wish to discontinue the relationship. Mr. Cutler has therefore called upon Mr. Sillas to examine his position in the light of these conclusions, before Mr. Cutler advises the President further concerning the matter.
