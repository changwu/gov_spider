In his remarks this afternoon, the President will express his thanks to the commanders and service members who executed a dangerous mission in Kabul and airlifted more than 124,000 people to safety; he will also offer thanks to the veterans and volunteers who supported this effort. He will lay out his decision to end the war in Afghanistan after 20 years, including the tough decisions he made over the last seven months since he took office to bring the war to a close.

Key stats from today's COVID-19 briefing:
Last week, 6 million Americans got a shot – the biggest weekly total since July 5. We are now averaging almost 900,000 shots in arms each day – up 80% from the 500,000 shots in arms we were averaging in mid-July.
Importantly, the pace of new vaccinations continues to accelerate. In August, over 14 million people got their first shot. That's almost 4 million more first shots in August compared to July.
