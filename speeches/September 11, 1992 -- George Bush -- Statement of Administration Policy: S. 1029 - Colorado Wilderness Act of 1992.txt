    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 9/14/92)(House)(Wirth (D) CO and Brown (R) CO)
The Administration supports House passage of S. 1029, as reported by the House Interior Committee.
Scoring for the Purpose of PAYGO
S. 1029 would decrease receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). A budget point of order applies in both the House and Senate against any bill that is not fully offset under CBO scoring. If the House waives any such point of order that applies against S. 1029, the effects of enactment of this legislation would be included in a look back pay-as-you-go sequester report at the end of the congressional session.
OMB's preliminary scoring estimates of this bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If S. 1029 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within five days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to Congress.
