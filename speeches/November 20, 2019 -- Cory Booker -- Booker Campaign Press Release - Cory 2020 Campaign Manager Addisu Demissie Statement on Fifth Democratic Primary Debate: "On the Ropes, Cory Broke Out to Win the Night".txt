    Newark, NJ â€” Cory 2020 Campaign Manager Addisu Demissie issued the following statement on Cory Booker's performance in the fifth Democratic debate:
"On the ropes, Cory Booker broke out to win the night. He rooted his responses in his lived experience and spoke passionately about issues impacting struggling communities. He didn't shy away from policy differences with other candidates, but always brought it back to a message of unity in the face of Donald Trump's division.
"Not only did he have the line of the night, but he made the case to voters as to why he belongs on the December debate stage--and they are responding. In the 20 minutes after Cory's closing statement, our campaign had its best fundraising hour so far.
"Tonight, Cory Booker showed why he has the temperament and leadership style needed to unite the party to defeat Donald Trump."
