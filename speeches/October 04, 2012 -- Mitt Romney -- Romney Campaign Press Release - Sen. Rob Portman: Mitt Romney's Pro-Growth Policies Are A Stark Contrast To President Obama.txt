    Ohio Senator Rob Portman made the following statement on tonight's presidential debate: Â 
"Mitt Romney was the clear winner of tonight's debate. The pro-growth policies he discussed stand in stark contrast to President Obama's failed policies. During the last four years in the Obama economy, middle-class families have struggled with less take-home pay, higher health care costs, unemployment above 8 percent for 43 months in a row, and sky-high debt that our children and grandchildren will have to pay. There's no doubt we can't afford another four years of President Obama's failed policies, and Mitt Romney presented himself as a clear alternative with the plan and the experience to get our country back on track."
