    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to Section 402(c)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, I shall issue today an Executive Order [11854] waiving the application of subsections (a) and (b) of Section 402 of the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to the Socialist Republic of Romania, and I am hereby making the report contemplated by Section 402(c) (1) of the Act.
I refer to the Declaration of the Presidents of the United States and of the Socialist Republic of Romania signed in Washington in 19731 wherein it was stated that "they will contribute to the solution of humanitarian problems on the basis of mutual confidence and good will." I have been assured that if and when such problems arise they will be solved, on a reciprocal basis, in the spirit of that Declaration. Accordingly, I am convinced that the emigration practices of Romania will lead substantially to the achievement of the objectives of Section 402 of the Act. I have therefore determined that the waiver contained in said Executive Order will substantially promote the objectives of Section 402 of the Act.
