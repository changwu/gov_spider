    The sounding of the shofar heralds the new year 5752 and calls Jews everywhere to examine their lives: "Awake, you sleepers, and ponder your deeds; remember your Creator, forsake your evil ways, and return to God!" These words of Maimonides describe the self-reflection that begins on Rosh Hashanah and continues through ten days of penitence to Yom Kippur. To prepare for this concluding Day of Atonement, the faithful seek reconciliation with the Almighty and reaffirm their commitment to charity and goodness.
On the occasion of the High Holy Days, I offer best wishes to American Jews and to our Jewish friends throughout the world. May the spirit of reconciliation and renewal that characterizes this period remind all Americans of our responsibilities toward our families, friends, and neighbors. May it also strengthen our mutual commitment to peace among nations. Indeed, as the eyes of the Diaspora are turned to Israel, let us pray that peoples throughout the world might be reconciled in the spirit of charity, forgiveness, and renewal.
Barbara joins me in sending our best wishes to Jews everywhere for the year 5752, and in saying, once again, L'Shana Tova Tekateivu -- may you be inscribed in the Book of Life for a good year.
