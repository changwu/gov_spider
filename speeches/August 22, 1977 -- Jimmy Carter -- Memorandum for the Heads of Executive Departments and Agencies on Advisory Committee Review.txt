    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Subject: Advisory Committee Review
We have completed the reviews of Federal Advisory committees directed by my memoranda of February 25 and May 24, 1977.
I am pleased that, as a result of the actions recommended, the 1,189 advisory committees reviewed will be reduced by 480 or forty percent of the total. I commend you for your part in this effort to make the government more effective and efficient.
The actions necessary to carry out the recommended terminations and consolidations should be completed as soon as possible. In addition, you should continue to give your personal attention to assuring that committees are terminated when no longer necessary, and that new committees are established only when absolutely necessary.
JIMMY CARTER
