    Today John Kasich made the following statement in response to North Korea's reported missile launch:
"North Korea's missile launch is completely unacceptable and not only violates Security Council resolutions but further signals that this rogue regime has no interest in constructive, normal international relations. The United States must act decisively to contain this threat by deploying anti-missile systems that protect our regional allies, and by banning North Korea from the world financial system so it can't profit from its missile sales. The Obama Administration's do-nothing policy toward North Korea is failing and must be reversed by standing up to the world's bullies to project American power, protect our way of life and promote stability in an increasingly chaotic world."
