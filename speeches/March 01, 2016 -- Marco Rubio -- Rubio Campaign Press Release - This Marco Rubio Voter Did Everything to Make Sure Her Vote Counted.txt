One Texas voter did everything she could to make sure her vote counts today:
Hey guys,
I'm a Texas native living in Tulsa while I finish a bachelor's in journalism â€” due to an administrative oversight at my local elections office my absentee ballot didn't make it into my mailbox until this past weekend. I paid $65 today to overnight it to Texas because I believe in Marco.
Thanks for all your hard work! Best of luck tomorrow! #marcomomentum

As long as Jenny's ballot makes it (and it sounds like it will) before polls close today in Texas, it's another vote in the bank for Marco. That's dedication!
Voters in 11 states, including Texas, have an opportunity to make their voice heard today!
