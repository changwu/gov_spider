    Good morning, everybody. I've come back to Pittsburgh, the city of champions, to remind all of you that we have less than a week to go before you make a judgment and cast a vote that will shape the future of this country.
I know that many of you observed the debate last night, when the issues between me and Governor Reagan, between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, were sharply drawn. There's hardly a person in this great audience that can't remember how your lives were benefited under the administrations of great Democratic Presidents of the past. President Truman, President Roosevelt, President Kennedy, President Johnson have all taken action, working with Democratic Members of the Congress, to give better lives to the aged, for those who are afflicted and disabled, for those who are deprived of basic rights, and for the working people of this Nation. They've also been very eager and have always been successful in giving us a better chance for jobs and for progress and for peace.
I ask you this next week not to forget your heritage, not to forget the past differences between Republicans and Democrats, to join with me as full partners, so on November the 4th, we'll whip the Republicans from the courthouse all the way to the White House. I need you, and I'll be depending on you.
Thank you, and God bless you.
