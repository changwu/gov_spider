(Senate)
(Sen. Inouye, D-Hawaii)
The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of H.R. 4899, with the Senate Committee-reported text, making supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010, and for other purposes. The legislation is essential for funding our ongoing military, diplomatic, and intelligence operations; supporting individuals and communities responding to major disasters; and maintaining ongoing humanitarian work following the earthquake in Haiti. The Administration appreciates that the bill includes many of the components of the President's request for funds that enable the response to the recent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico to continue expeditiously, and urges the Congress to act swiftly to enact all the elements of the request.
The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to further refine the bill as the legislative process moves forward and to meet these urgent and essential needs.
