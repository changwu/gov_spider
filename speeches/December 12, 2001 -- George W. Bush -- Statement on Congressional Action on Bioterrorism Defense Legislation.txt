    I commend Congressmen Tauzin and Dingell for successfully passing bipartisan legislation that will help meet our immediate bioterrorism defense needs. Their legislation includes many of my priorities, including proposals to expand the pharmaceutical stockpile, increase our supply of smallpox vaccines, strengthen State and local preparedness, and improve the safety of our food supply.
I look forward to working closely with Congressmen Tauzin and Dingell, as well as Senators Kennedy, Gregg, and Frist, to quickly reach a bipartisan consensus on this important legislation.
