    Florida Congressman Connie Mack today made the following statement on President Obama's comments on Venezuela:
"Five years ago, campaigning against Barack Obama for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton said that Barack Obama's views of Hugo Chavez, the Venezuelan strongman, were 'irresponsible and frankly na√Øve.' That was right in 2007, and it's still right today. In an interview earlier this week, President Obama gave a pass to Chavez, explaining that 'overall my sense is that what Mr. Chavez has done over the last several years has not had a serious national security impact on us.' Here we have Hillary Clinton's warning coming true. Hugo Chavez is a man who has spread anti-American hatred around the globe and has formed partnerships with countries that hate the United States, like Iran and Syria. He has been deeply engaged in supporting narco-terrorists who advance his interests. He has crushed opposition at home, seeking to model the internal workings of Venezuela on the Cuban revolution. His close friendship with Fidel Castro is legendary. And he has worked closely with the Castro brothers in subverting American policy and undermining freedom and democracy across Latin America. President Obama should be working to isolate Chavez, not downplaying the dangers he poses."
