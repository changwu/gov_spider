    Without pre-written answers to read, Biden's decline is on full display.
Joe Biden's handlers are keeping him hidden away in his basement for a reason, and his disastrous NABJ/NABH interview is a prime example. His string of incoherent ramblings, ineffective answers, and offensive comments was truly cringeworthy.
Here are the 9 worst moments from Biden's basement disaster:
1. Biden attempted to demonstrate that he does not need to take a cognitive test by bringing up a cocaine test and asking the reporter if he was a "junkie."
2. Biden painfully invited Americans to judge him on his mental fitness.
3. Biden let his racism show—again—by suggesting that Black Americans are all the same.
4. Biden doubled down on his support for giving health care to illegal aliens.
5. Biden answered a question about China with incoherent gibberish.
6. Biden admitted he would surrender to China on trade without any concessions from the Chinese.
7. Biden said he'd stop building the border wall, opening up our border for more illegal immigration, human trafficking, and deadly drugs.
8. Biden dismissed blue-collar manufacturing and energy workers as "obsolete."
9. Biden said he is "forward looking to" debating President Trump.
The American people see right through Joe Biden—which is why his handlers are keeping him hidden away.
