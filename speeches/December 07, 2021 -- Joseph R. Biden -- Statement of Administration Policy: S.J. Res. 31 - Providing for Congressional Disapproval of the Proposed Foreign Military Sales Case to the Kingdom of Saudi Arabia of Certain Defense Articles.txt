    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Senator Paul, R-KY, and 8 co-sponsors)
The Administration strongly opposes passage of S.J.Res. 31, a joint resolution prohibiting a proposed U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia of defense articles, including two hundred eighty (280) AIM-120C-7/C-8 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and related articles and services. This proposed FMS case would replenish Saudi Arabia's existing inventory of air-to-air missiles. These missiles are not used to engage ground targets; Saudi Arabia uses these munitions to defend against aerial cross-border attacks, such as Houthi explosive-laden drones.
The FMS case at issue is fully consistent with the Administration's pledge to lead with diplomacy to end conflict in Yemen and end U.S. support for offensive operations in the war in Yemen, while also ensuring that Saudi Arabia has the means to defend itself from Iranian-backed Houthi air attacks.
The passage of S.J.Res. 31 would undermine the President's commitment to aid in our partner's defenses at a time of increased missile and drone attacks against civilians in Saudi Arabia.
