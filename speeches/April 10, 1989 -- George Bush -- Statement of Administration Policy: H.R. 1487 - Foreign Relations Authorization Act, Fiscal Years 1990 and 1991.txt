    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Dymally (D) California and Snowe (R) Maine)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1487. The bill provides many useful authorities and sufficient appropriation authorizations for the conduct of the Nation's foreign relations, Although the Administration generally supports H.R. 1487, the following changes are recommended:

Add a provision to modify section 151 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (P.L. 100-204). Section 151 requires the President to terminate the United States-Soviet Embassy Agreement. This requirement intrudes on the President's exclusive constitutional authority to terminate treaties or Executive agreements;  
Amend sections 125 and 202 to repeal sections 122 and 204 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (P.L. 100-204). These sections prohibit the use of funds to close State Department and U.S. Information Agency (USIA) posts overseas. Although these sections are modified by H.R. 1487, a post may still not be closed until 365 days after Congress has been so notified. These provisions are unworkable and intrude upon the President's authority to decide when and where ambassadors or consuls shall be appointed;  
Amend section 141 to allow greater latitude for the State Department to open an unclassified consulate in Kiev;  
Modify section 152, which raises serious constitutional concerns regarding equal protection, and section 153, which also appears to raise similar concerns. The Administration strongly supports improving the recruitment of minority applicants in the Foreign Service, and will work with Congress to accomplish this objective in a manner that does not raise constitutional concerns;  
Delete section 131, which creates an unnecessary and wasteful new Bureau of South Asian Affairs;  
Amend section 401(c), which authorizes appropriations for the Israel Radio Relay Station, to make the minority set-aside provisions consistent with such provisions in existing law; and  
Amend sections 201 and 301, which authorize appropriations for USIA, to (1) delete earmarking for the TV and Film Service and for Voice of America and (2) increase the appropriation authorization for "Radio Construction" from $65 million to $89 million as proposed by the Administration.
