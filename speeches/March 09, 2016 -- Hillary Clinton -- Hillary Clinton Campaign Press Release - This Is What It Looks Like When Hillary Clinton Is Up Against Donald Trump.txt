    
"Two very different visions for our country" doesn't begin to cover it.

As Donald Trump delivered a 40-minute long victory speech at the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida, Hillary took the podium in Cleveland.
And the contrast was stark.
While Trump talked about providing branded Trump Water for his resorts, Hillary talked about the water crisis in Flint, Michigan.

While Donald Trump talked about the now-defunct "Trump University," Hillary talked about ensuring that Americans can graduate from college without a lifetime of debt.

While Donald Trump talked about Trump Steaks, Hillary talked about the stakes for Americans.

Nobody summed up this election better than Hillary:


  " We are better than what we are being offered by the Republicans."
