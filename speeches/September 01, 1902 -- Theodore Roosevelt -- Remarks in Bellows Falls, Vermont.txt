    My fellow citizens, my fellow Americans, men and women of Vermont:
I have counted myself fortunate to be in Vermont, and doubly fortunate to be here on Labor Day. A very, very good deal can be done by associations among ourselves, such associations as you see respected here today; associations which will teach us practically in the best way, that a lesson can be taught by applying it, that not only must each work for himself, but that each must work for all. We can accomplish by mutual self-help much, and there yet remains an immense amount to be done by individual self-help. In every association from the state, from the nation, to a union, to a corporation, we find that a man who is to accomplish good for his fellows must steadily endeavor not to be a passenger. He must pull his weight and a little more.
