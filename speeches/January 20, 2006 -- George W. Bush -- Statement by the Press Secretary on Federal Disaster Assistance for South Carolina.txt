    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of South Carolina and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by a severe ice storm from December 15-16, 2005.
Federal funding is available to State and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe ice storm in the counties of Anderson, Cherokee, Greenville, Laurens, Oconee, Pickens, and Spartanburg.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
