    Chapel Hill, North Carolina – Speaking today at a town hall event in Manchester, New Hampshire, Senator John Edwards made the following comments about General Petraeus' upcoming report on the success of President Bush's decision to send additional U.S. troops to Iraq earlier this year.
"I believe there was a mandate from the American people in the last election to make George Bush end this war," said Edwards. "Congress needs to stand its ground and should not send a single funding bill to the president that doesn't have a timetable for withdrawal – every bill. They also, in September, should use every single tool – including a filibuster – to ensure that no bill goes to the president without a timetable for withdrawal."
Edwards continued: "This isn't about politics, this is life and death. We have men and women whose lives are on the line in Iraq and George Bush is not going to change course unless he is forced to. We need the Congress to have courage and backbone and stand their ground and make George Bush change course."
Senator Edwards has called for an immediate reduction of 40,000 to 50,000 troops to stop the surge and get all regional parties to begin to find a political solution, for a diplomatic offensive with all regional parties, and for all combat troops to be withdrawn within the next year.
