    I am signing H.R. 8346 today even though I have serious reservations about several of its provisions. I decided to sign it primarily to avoid any possibility that certain commuter rail services might be disrupted.
This bill essentially benefits those who now use subsidized commuter trains. Special legislation providing temporary Federal assistance for these services was enacted in 1976. It was intended to help assist in an orderly transition to locally supported service. I am disappointed that the affected cities have not arranged to live within these original Federal emergency payments.
The administration is looking at more equitable ways to deal with urban transportation, including commuter rail service, on a long-term basis. Early next year, I will submit legislation providing a more flexible program of transit and highway assistance to urban areas. This expanded program would supplant funds made available by this bill for commuter train services and allow resources to be used for various kinds of transit, including commuter trains where local communities decide they are appropriate.
We should move away from the establishment of a new categorical grant program affecting only a few cities to a comprehensive surface transportation program.
