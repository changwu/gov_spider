    Obama Administration Announces 48 Additional Public Health, Medical, and Nursing Schools from 15 Countries Commit to Train Their Students to Address the Health Impacts of Climate Change, Increasing the Total Number of Schools Committing to 118 Around the World
Climate change is a global challenge that demands a global response, and President Obama is committed to leading the fight. That is why, today, in Paris, the White House will announce that more than 45 additional medical, public health, and nursing schools around the world have signed onto the Health Educators Climate Commitment to ensure their students, the next generation of health professionals, are prepared, through education and training, to effectively address the health impacts of climate change, and to ensure that the world has a cadre of climate change and health experts. With today's announcement we are expanding what was previously a U.S. initiative, launched at the White House in April 2015, to a global effort. The 48 new partners joining today increases the total number of schools signing on to 118 and expands participation to 14 additional countries:
•      Australia
•      Canada
•      China
•      Grenada
•      Ecuador
•      Finland
•      France
•      India
•      Malaysia
•      Mexico
•      Singapore
•      South Africa
•      Switzerland
•      United Kingdom
In addition to helping to recruit peer institutions, the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health will announce the creation of a Global Consortium on Climate and Health Education to carry forward the Health Educators Climate Commitment to action. In addition to continuing to expand the reach of the commitment, the Consortium will be a forum through which Schools of Public Health, Medicine, and Nursing around the world share best scientific and educational practices, and curricula; develop core sets of knowledge for graduates; and foster the development of global academic partnerships to support training of health professionals and climate and health specialists throughout the world, particularly in under-resourced countries.
Climate change is no longer a problem for future generations – we are already feeling its effects in every corner of our nation and across the globe, which threatens our economic and national security and our health. No country is immune, and therefore all countries must act together, and that is what the Paris climate negotiations are all about. Today's commitments reinforce not only how vast the impacts of climate change are, but also the opportunity to join together and address this problem.
Globally, health professionals are recognizing the growing impact that the changing climate is having on people's health, from extreme heat and life-threatening storms, to the length of allergy seasons and the intensity of smog episodes, to the availability of safe water and food, to the distribution and abundance of pathogens and their vectors. They are taking action to build resilience in the health sector, and in sectors that affect the determinants of health. And they are working to identify the large health co-benefits that accrue when communities transition to clean energy.
HEALTH EDUCATORS CLIMATE COMMITMENT
Deans of the following schools have signed onto the Global Health Educators Climate Commitment and pledged:
As leaders responsible for educating the health professionals of tomorrow, we are keenly aware of our obligation to ensure that they are fully prepared to address all health risks, including those resulting from the impacts of climate change. Our future health professionals must have the competencies needed to address the health needs of our communities and our patients, both now and into the foreseeable future. These competencies must be based on the best available science, and benefit from sharing best scientific and educational practices.
We commit to ensuring that we train the next generation of health professionals to effectively address the health impacts of climate change.
We commit to strengthening the knowledge base in the area of climate and health from a position of the best science and academic rigor.
