    Little Rock, AR â€“ Former Arkansas Governor and Republican Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee announced today the endorsement of professional wrestling legend "Nature Boy" Ric Flair, the former 16-time World Heavyweight Champion known worldwide for his "stylin' and profilin'" personality and his signature "Whooooooo" with which he ends interviews.
Flair will make his endorsement official by campaigning with Huckabee at a tailgate at 5:00 PM prior to the Clemson-Carolina game that will take place just outside the West Entrance to Williams Brice Stadium in Stadium Lot spaces 433-434 on Saturday, November 24.
"It's a tremendous honor to offer my support to such an outstanding leader as Mike Huckabee" Flair said. "His authentic conservative qualifications and level of executive leadership experience are unmatched by his opponents. And like I always say, to be the man, you've got to beat the man and Mike Huckabee is the man. Whoooooooo!"
Mr. Flair has previously campaigned for the presidential primary campaigns of George H.W. Bush, Bob Dole, and George W. Bush. His endorsement comes on the heels of the unveiling of a new Huckabee campaign ad featuring the endorsement of actor and martial arts expert, Chuck Norris.
"I am honored to have the support of Ric Flair. I'm a huge fan of the Nature Boy. My children grew up watching him and the Four Horseman. Most of all, I look forward to having Nature Boy join me on the campaign trail at the South Carolina-Clemson game this weekend. Ric's endorsement will help us put a figure four leg lock on our opponents."
