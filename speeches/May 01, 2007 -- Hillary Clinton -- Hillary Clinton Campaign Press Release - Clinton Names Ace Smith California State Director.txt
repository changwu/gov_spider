    The Clinton campaign today announced that longtime Democratic operative Ace Smith will serve as the campaign's California State Director, coming on the heels of Hillary's successful appearance before the State Democratic Party convention last weekend.
"Ace is a talented organizer who knows California and knows what it takes to win," Clinton said. "We're lucky to have him leading our effort in the Golden State."
Smith is President of political consulting firm SCN Public Relations, and most recently managed the successful campaigns of California Attorney General Jerry Brown and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. He has also worked for California Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer and former Governor Gray Davis.
As state director, Smith will oversee the day-to-day operations of Clinton's California primary campaign.
"As the father of two teenage children and a lifelong Californian, I believe passionately that our country needs the leadership of Hillary Clinton," Smith said. "Californians are ready for change, and Hillary is the leader who will stand up for the millions of Americans who have been invisible to this administration."
Last week, Hillary won the endorsements of California State Assembly Speaker Fabian NÃºÃ±ez and 16 other state legislators, illustrating her growing support in California.
