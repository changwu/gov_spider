    Today, following the endorsement of the Transport Workers Union (TWU), Hillary Clinton issued the following statement:
"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of the Transport Workers Union.
"Every day, members of the TWU keep America on the moveâ€”driving our buses and trains, flying our planes, and keeping our communities safe and healthy. For decades, transport workers have helped power our economy and keep families connected. And along the way, they've helped build the American middle class, standing up for workers' rights and fighting for the respect they deserve.
"As President, I will always stand with the TWU in the fight to protect workers' fundamental rights to organize, bargain collectively, be safe on the job, and retire with dignity and security after years of hard work. We will make the kinds of investments that grow the economy for everyone, including building 21st century roads, transit systems, and airports. In my first 100 days in office, I will put forward a plan to make the most ambitious investments in our infrastructure since the Interstate Highway System. And I will make sure workers always have a seat at the table and a champion in the White House."
