    HOUSTON, Texas â€” Yesterday, Presidential candidate Ted Cruz reacted to the news of the arrest of a terror suspect in Houston, who came to the United States as a refugee from Iraq and is accused of aiding terror groups including ISIS. Cruz said that along with passing the Expatriate Terrorist Act (ETA), "we need to see a systematic and careful retroactive assessment of refugees brought in from high risk countries to examine the public record, to examine all the evidence of whether these individuals have ties to radical islamic terrorists." He adds that we need a President less concerned about political correctness and more concerned about keeping this country safe, that's the leadership Americans are looking for.

CRUZ: The fact that these two have been apprehended underscores how real this danger is and how much we need a President who is focused on protecting the men and women in this country. We should not be allowing ISIS terrorists to come back to America with U.S. passports and wage jihad to attempt to murder innocent men and women in this country.
