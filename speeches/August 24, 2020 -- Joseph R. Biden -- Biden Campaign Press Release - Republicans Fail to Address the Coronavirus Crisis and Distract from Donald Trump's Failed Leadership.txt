    In response to the first night of the Republican Convention, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield released the following statement:
"If you tuned into the Republican convention tonight looking for some indication from President Trump that he has a strategy to contain the coronavirus, you're still waiting. Instead, what you heard tonight was a parade of dark and divisive fear-mongering designed to distract from the fact that Donald Trump does not have an affirmative case to make to the American people about why he should be re-elected. The truth is that his failed leadership has needlessly cost over 177,000 Americans their lives, tens of millions of Americans their jobs, and left the United States the hardest hit country by the pandemic in the whole world. Yet six months into this crisis, he still doesn't have what Joe Biden proposed months ago: a plan to get us out.
"Tonight, we were once again reminded that Donald Trump is in over his head and, as Michelle Obama said, cannot be the president we need. American families deserve so much more. They deserve a President who will take responsibility for getting us out of these crises, unify our nation under common purpose, and build back better with historic investments in our middle class."
