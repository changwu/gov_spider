    The Clinton campaign today announced the endorsement of Nevada State Assemblywoman Susan Gerhardt.
"My family has a long, proud tradition of military service - my son-in-law, who has already served one tour in Iraq, being the most recent," said Assemblywoman Gerhardt. "I am supporting Hillary Clinton because I believe she has the wisdom, strength, and experience to lead our country out of a disastrous war in Iraq. As Commander in Chief, she will work to regain the respect our country has lost around the world during the Bush administration. I look forward to working hard in my district to mobilize support and caucus goers for Clinton."
First elected to the Nevada State Assembly in 2004, Assemblywoman Gerhardt is an outspoken advocate on the issues most important to her constituents in District 29 and to all Nevadans. She currently serves on the Health and Human Services, Transportation and Judiciary Committees. She has previously served on a host of interim committees, including the Legislative Committee on Persons With Disabilities, the Advisory Commission on Sentencing, the NV State Council For Interstate Juvenile Supervision and the Blue Ribbon Panel Investigating Child Deaths in Clark County.
Gerhardt has always been an active member of the Las Vegas community. A former corrections officer with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, she has also served as a volunteer with the Special Emergency Response Team to present drug prevention programs to area elementary students.
"For many years, Susan Gerhardt has served the Las Vegas community as both a law enforcement officer and an elected official," said Clinton Nevada Chair Rory Reid. "In the Legislature, Susan has worked hard to provide our children with the necessary resources to succeed. We are honored to have her on our team and we look forward to working with her to deliver the Silver State for Hillary Clinton."
