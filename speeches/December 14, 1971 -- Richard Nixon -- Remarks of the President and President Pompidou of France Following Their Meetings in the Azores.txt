    President Pompidou and I have just concluded our very extensive discussions. In those discussions, we have made significant progress in the problem that I know many have been concerned with on the international monetary situation.
That progress will be indicated by the joint statement which will be read to the members of the press after the President and I have addressed you briefly now.However, in addition to that subject which is covered by our joint statement, the President and I discussed a wide range of international issues, and we also discussed a wide range of bilateral issues.
I can only characterize the meetings by saying that, as was the previous case when I have met with the President, our discussions were not only candid and frank but, above all, they were constructive and, we believe, contributed in this instance not only to good relations between our two countries but also to progress on the economic and other fronts for better understanding in the world.
[At this point, President Pompidou spoke in French. The President then resumed speaking.]
Ladies and gentlemen, I want to express, on my part, on behalf of all of the American party, our very deep gratitude to the Prime Minister of Portugal and to the Government of Portugal and to the people of this city and of this island for their very warm hospitality. We leave here with unforgettable memories of magnificent weather, of very friendly people, and also of hospitality and friendship which cannot be excelled any place in the world. The fact that we met--the President of France and I--under such pleasant circumstances, I am sure, contributed to the fact that our meeting was, we believe, a very successful meeting. Thank you.
