    For nearly 10 years, America has lacked trade promotion authority and the ability to fully take advantage of trade opportunities. I commend the House and Senate conferees for their leadership in reaching a landmark agreement on TPA, which will open markets, expand opportunity, and create jobs for American workers and farmers. The House has shown a commitment to getting something done on behalf of the American people, and I urge the Senate to vote on this good bill before the Senate goes home for the August recess.
