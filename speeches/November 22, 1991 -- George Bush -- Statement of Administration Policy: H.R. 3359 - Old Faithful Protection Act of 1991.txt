    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Williams (D) Montana and Campbell (D) Colorado)
The Administration is committed to protecting the geothermal resources of Yellowstone National Park, and we would view any adverse impact on the resources of Yellowstone as significant and unacceptable.
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3359. The bill would prohibit, by legislative fiat, all geothermal development within 15 miles of the park, on private as well as Federal lands. This prohibition on development of geothermal resources would pose a likelihood, depending upon the facts of each case, of financial exposure of the United States for compensable takings of private property. At a minimum, enactment of this legislation could result in the filing of numerous claims and heavy litigation costs for the Federal government.
The Administration's substitute bill would monitor activities on private lands surrounding the park and take positive, direct, and straightforward action-whenever harmful activity is likely.
