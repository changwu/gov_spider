    To Professor Allan McCleod Cormack
Congratulations! I know that all Americans join me in applauding the tribute you have received from the Nobel Assembly.
Untold numbers of persons stand to benefit—as have thousands already—from the advanced diagnostic procedures made possible by your work on the theoretical processes underlying the development of the CAT scan. Your work has meant not only a triumph for science but also a triumph for humanitarian concerns.
It gives me great pleasure to salute you on this occasion and to send you my wishes.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
