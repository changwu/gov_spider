    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced the Iowa Taxpayers for Rudy Leadership Team. The team consists of Iowa community leaders who are committed to helping spread Rudy's message of cutting taxes and restoring fiscal discipline to our government.
"Rudy is committed to ending earmarks and budgeting government like a business," said Giuliani's Iowa State Chairman Paul Pate. "He is the real fiscal conservative candidate in the race who can reduce spending in government and keep the tax cuts in place."
Mayor Giuliani kicked off his "Rudy Makes Cents" tour last week, highlighting his record as a fiscal conservative leader in New York City. During his eight years as Mayor, Giuliani helped stimulate the local economy by cutting taxes 23 times and turning a $2.3 billion deficit into a multi-billion dollar surplus. As part of Rudy's 12 Commitments to the American People, the Mayor pledges to cut taxes and reform the tax code as President.
