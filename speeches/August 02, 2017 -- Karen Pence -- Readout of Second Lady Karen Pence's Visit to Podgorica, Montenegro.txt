    Second Lady Karen Pence started the day with the Vice President and participated in a meet-and-greet with U.S. embassy employees and their families. Then, the Second Lady and Vice President took photos with the United State Marines Detachment Unit. The Second Lady continued her day to the Martinovic Honey Farm in Dubovik Village. There, Mrs. Pence joined the Prime Minister's wife, Mrs. Nata Markovi?, to tour the farm; observe the beehives; and learn about the process of honey producing. After the honey farm visit, the Second Lady and Mrs. Markovi? headed to Rijeka Crnojevica to participate in a scenic boat tour of Lake Skadar. The tour is well known for its calm waters, stunning nature views, and excellent bird watching. After the tour, Mrs. Pence had an enjoyable lunch with Mrs. Markovi? at family-owned Poslednja Luka Restaurant. After lunch, Mrs. Pence joined the Vice President for departure to Washington, DC.
