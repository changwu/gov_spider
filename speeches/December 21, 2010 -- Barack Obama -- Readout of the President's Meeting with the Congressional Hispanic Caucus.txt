    In an Oval Office meeting today, the President discussed immigration reform with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC). The President and the members discussed their deep disappointment with the DREAM Act failing in the U.S. Senate despite having the support of a majority of Senators and a majority of the American people, noting that it would have cut the budget deficit by $2.2 billion over the next 10 years. The President reiterated that he will not give up on the DREAM Act, and thanked the members for their tireless leadership on this issue.
The President further reiterated his commitment to comprehensive immigration reform, pointing out that we can no longer perpetuate a broken immigration system that is not working for our country or our economy. The President and the members agreed that the American people expect both parties to come together around common sense approaches to solve our toughest problems, not kick them down the road, and agreed to work together and with the Congress to get the job done. They also agreed that immigration reform should remain a top priority for the coming Congress, and to work together to advance proposals that not only to strengthen security at the nationâ€™s borders, but also restore responsibility and accountability to what everyone agrees is a badly broken immigration system.
