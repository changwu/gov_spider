    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the provisions of Public Law 91-230, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1209(d)), I herewith transmit the 1987 annual report of the National Advisory Council on Adult Education.
While my Administration and Members of the Congress may not agree with every recommendation of the Council, the report provides a constructive review of activities and issues related to adult education.
