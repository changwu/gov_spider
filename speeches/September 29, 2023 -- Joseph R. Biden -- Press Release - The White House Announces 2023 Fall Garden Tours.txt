    The President and First Lady will continue the annual tradition of opening the White House gardens and South Grounds to members of the public for Fall Garden Tours. This season's tour weekend is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. ET to 4:30 p.m. ET on Saturday, October 14 and Sunday, October 15. In the event that the federal government is shut down on these dates, the Fall Garden Tours will be postponed or canceled.
These tours are free and open to members of the public; however, a timed ticket is required for all attendees, regardless of age. The National Park Service (NPS) will distribute free, timed tickets outside the White House Visitor Center, located at 1450 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, each day beginning at 8:30 a.m. ET. Timed tickets will be distributed, one ticket per person, on a first-come, first-served basis.
Once attendees have received their tickets, the South Lawn entry point for everyone will be located on 15th St NW between E Street NW and Constitution Avenue NW near the Boy Scout Memorial. The ADA entrance will be located at 15th Street NW and Alexander Hamilton Place NW.
