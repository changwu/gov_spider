    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 953, as amended and passed by the Senate on November 2, 1987, and the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill if it were presented to him for signature. The bill is objectionable because it would:

— authorize appropriations for maritime programs totalling $401,297,000 for FY 1988 instead of $331,597,000, as proposed in the President's 1988 Budget;
— authorize new Title XI loan guarantee commitments after FY 1987 for all categories of vessels; and
— continue Federal financial assistance for the State maritime schools program. 
The administration, however, could accept H.R. 953 — as passed by the House on June 2, 1987 — which included a commendable three-year moratorium on Title XI loan guarantees for certain categories of vessels.
