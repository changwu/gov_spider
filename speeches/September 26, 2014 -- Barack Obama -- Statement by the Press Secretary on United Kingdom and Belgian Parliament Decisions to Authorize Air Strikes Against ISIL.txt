    The United States welcomes today's decisions in the parliaments of the United Kingdom and Belgium to authorize the use of military force against ISIL in Iraq. The air forces of these two countries will now join those of the United States and France, which along with the Iraqi air force have been conducting air strikes on ISIL positions in Iraq. We also welcome the announcement by the Danish Prime Minister that Demark plans to provide fighter aircraft to the coalition, and the decision of the Government of the Netherlands to do the same.
These decisions — along with those by Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Qatar to participate in airstrikes against ISIL in Syria — demonstrate the clear commitment of the international community to take action together against these terrorists. The United States will continue to work with our international partners to expand our sustained and comprehensive approach to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL.
