    Rudy Giuliani made the following statement today in honor of Veteran's Day:
"Throughout our nation's history, no group has done more to ensure we live in freedom than our servicemen and women. We have a responsibility to our veterans and their families that should not end with their tour of duty.
"While we remember and honor those who have fought in wars past, we must keep in our thoughts and prayers the men and women fighting today in the Terrorists' War on Us. The sacrifice made by all servicemen and women – in active duty, the National Guard, and the Reserves – must be recognized not just with praise, but with the assurance that they and their families will be taken care of once their service is completed."
