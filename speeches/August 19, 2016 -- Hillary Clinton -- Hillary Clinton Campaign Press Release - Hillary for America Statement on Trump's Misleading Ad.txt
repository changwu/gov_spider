    Today, in response to Donald Trump's new divisive and misleading campaign ad, HFA Deputy Communications Director Christina Reynolds offered the following statement:"From his divisive rhetoric to his erratic efforts to alienate our allies to his dangerous plans, Donald Trump has made our country less safe already. He is temperamentally unfit and unqualified to be commander in chief. No misleading ad can change the fact that Hillary Clinton is the only candidate with the experience and judgment to lead the country and keep our families safe."
