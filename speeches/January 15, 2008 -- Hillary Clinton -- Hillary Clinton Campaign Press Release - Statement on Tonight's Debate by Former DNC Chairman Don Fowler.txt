    "At tonight's debate, Hillary proved again she has the combination of strength of character and intellectual toughness to lead America to real, true change. She understands it takes hard work and solid plans, not just words, to create positive change. As we all saw tonight, Hillary has plans, not just aspirations, for making universal health care, improved education and an end to the Iraq War a reality.
"We have less than two weeks until we as South Carolinians get the opportunity to let the rest of America hear our voices. We already know that Hillary Clinton is the best candidate for the Democratic Party and for America. She has done her part. Now it's up to us, to continue to fight hard for Hillary for the next two weeks. Tonight, Hillary's sound leadership, intricate knowledge of the issues and experience came through clearly at the debate."
