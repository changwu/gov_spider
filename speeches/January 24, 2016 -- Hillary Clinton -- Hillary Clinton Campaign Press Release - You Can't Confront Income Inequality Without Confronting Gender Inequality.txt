At an event with NARAL Pro-Choice America and NARAL New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton reminded the crowd that abortion rights aren't only a health issueâ€”they're also an economic issue. 
"All women deserve to have access to the health services and choices they are entitled to," Hillary said.  
"Yes, we want to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. We want to get incomes rising. But those of us in this room also know ... " 
Women cannot succeed if they can't make the most fundamental decisions about their lives, families, and futures.
That's why Hillary has been fighting for reproductive rights for decades. She understands that gender inequality has to be addressed in order to take on economic inequality.
All of the Republican presidential candidates would defund Planned Parenthood, and many have said they will work to overturn Roe v. Wade. With so much at stake, women need a proven fighter in the White House.
