Travel pool #1: Rolling in Rome
Good morning from Rome. The pool was swept near Villa Taverna, the U.S. ambassador's residence. We saw POTUS roll by in his limo at 8:30. We're rolling to the airport for the flight to Scotland.
Please note that we expect an Air Force One gaggle with Principal Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan at roughly 10:30 Rome time. Check the live stream then.

Travel pool #2: Rome departure, updated gaggle time 
We pulled up to Air Force One at 9:06. We watched POTUS shake hands with a few people.
According to the White House, POTUS was greeted at the airport by:His Excellency Ignio Lambertini, Chief of Diplomatic Protocol, Ministry of Foreign AffairsMr. Thomas D. Smitham, Chargé d'Affaires, U.S. Embassy to ItalyMr. Patrick Connell, Chargé d'Affaires, U.S. Embassy to the Holy SeeMs. Jennifer Harhigh, Chargé d'Affaires, U.S. Mission to the UN Agencies in Rome
Biden boarded the plane and saluted and waved from the top of the stairs at 9:08.
We're rolling toward takeoff at 9:16.
We are now told to expect the gaggle closer to the beginning of the flight, so keep an eye out.
Arrivederci Roma.

Travel pool #3: Scotland arrival 
An addendum to this morning — the White House says POTUS attended mass at Villa Taverna in observance of All Saints Day before leaving for the airport in Rome
Air Force One touched down in Edinburgh at 10:54. (A reminder that we're now on local time here in the UK.) John Kerry and Secretary Blinken were aboard the flight.
According to the White House, POTUS will be welcomed at Edinburgh airport by:
T.H. Philip Reeker, Chargé d'affaires, Embassy of the United States to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern IrelandCouncilor Frank Ross, Right Honorable Lord Provost and Lord Lieutenant of the City of EdinburghMr. Nicholas Jarrold, Special Representative of the Foreign Secretary
As expected, there was a gaggle on the flight. However, your pooler is told that the live stream might have cut off an answer about Russian troop movements near Ukraine. Co-pooler Emily Goodin provides this quote from Jake Sullivan — "We had the opportunity to consult over this past weekend with key allies and partners." He said the U.S. wants to be "supporting Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. We'll continue to monitor the situation closely and I don't have anything else to add at this point."

Travel pool #4: Rolling to COP26
POTUS stepped off the plane at 11:04. He's wearing a blue suit and a striped tie. He spent about a minute talking with the officials mentioned in the previous pool report. It's overcast and windy on the tarmac.
The pool loaded into a shuttle bus for the drive to COP26. We began rolling at 11:09.
The drive is expected to be about an hour. For those keeping track, we're a little more than half hour behind schedule.



November 1, 202112:17 GMT

Travel pool #5: COP26 arrival
The ride to COP26 was uneventful. We passed wind turbines, sheep and cows grazing in green fields, and a big electronic sign that said "COP26 EVENT IN GLASGOW EXPECT DELAYS."
There was a heavy police presence as we approached COP26, with roads blocked off and officers wearing bright yellow vests or jackets. Spectators watched the motorcade and filmed it on their phones.
We arrived at COP26 at 12:11. We did not see POTUS, except for a brief glimpse of him in the limo as he was coming around a bend in the highway near arrival.



November 1, 202112:43 GMT

Travel pool #6: Pool hold 
The pool entered a packed conference center, weaving through crowds of people to make it to our hold room. At one point a tumbleweed of people blew by — it was President Macron surrounded by staff and press. Signs reminding people to keep physical distance were impossible to follow.
We ended up in a quieter corner of the conference center, where the pool is holding in a room. We're watching the opening session on screens here.
We did not see whether POTUS was greeted by Prime Minister Johnson or UN Secretary General António Guterres, as was listed on the schedule. We're seeking clarification on that.
POTUS is currently participating in the opening session.



November 1, 202112:50 GMT

Travel pool #6B: Biden greeting 
To resolve the question posed in the last report — yes, POTUS was greeted by Johnson and Guterres when he arrived at COP26. Here's video in case you missed it.

Travel pool #7: POTUS speech preparation
Your pooler entered the plenary room at 2:25. Once the program begins, POTUS will be the third national leader to speak. Live streams are available online. Your pooler will strive for a two minute warning.
It's a cavernous room with rows of long white desks and designated spots for various counties. On the stage are multiple lecterns and a dais. Behind that is a blue banner backdrop.
The White House sent a readout of POTUS meeting with Estonian prime minister. The White House says the meeting lasted from 1:52 PM to 2:05PM.

Travel pool #8: Biden up next
While leader statements got underway, the majority of seats in the room are empty.



November 1, 202115:11 GMT

Travel pool #9: Biden speech over
Biden ended his speech at 3:07 and left the room.
Large screens are set up to make it easier to see the speakers, and they display a timer to limit the time that each person talks. The green numbers count down from three minutes, then a chime sounds and red numbers track how much the speaker goes into overtime. Another chime sounds for each extra minute the speaker talks.
The president of Mauritania spoke for at least 2 extra minutes. Biden spoke for more than 8 extra minutes, a total of 11:25.

Travel pool #12: Indonesia bilat
POTUS participated in a bilateral meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo.
The pool entered at 4:19. Biden and Widodo were sitting together with two translators. There were two American flags and two Indonesian flags behind them. National security advisor Jake Sullivan and Secretary Blinken were on the sidelines.
Biden said "we have so much we can work together on, and so much in common." He referenced the recent ASEAN summit and next year's G20, which Indonesia is hosting.
"There's much to talk about, but I'm taking too much time," Biden said.
Widodo spoke in English. He congratulated Biden on his inauguration.
Biden chuckled and said, "thank you for recognizing it."
The pool exited at 4:23. Biden did not respond to shouted questions.



November 1, 202117:21 GMT

The White House says Biden's bilat with the Indonesian president ended at 5:07.

Travel pool #15: Biden attends reception
There were a few dozen protesters as the motorcade left COP26. One big banner read: "Government in bed with climate criminals"
The motorcade traveled down streets lined with police and metal barricades.
