    The people of the United States join me in offering Reuven Rivlin congratulations on his election as the next President of the State of Israel.
Over more than six decades, the United States and Israel have developed a unique relationship based on shared democratic values, our unshakeable commitment to Israel's security, and our partnership in scientific research and innovative technology. President-elect Rivlin has a long and dedicated record of public service, and we look forward to continued strong ties, to the benefit of both our nations, under Mr. Rivlin's Presidency.
As President Shimon Peres nears the end of his term, he can look back on a remarkable legacy of courage, conviction, and compassion. He has dedicated his extraordinary life to the cause of peace, and I look forward to welcoming him in Washington later this month where he will receive the Congressional Gold Medal.
