    (SAN FRANCISCO, CA, January 28, 2020) — Today, Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer surged to 17% support in Morning Consult's latest early state tracker — a 2 point gain over last week's survey. The latest result, which is an average of poll responses in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina places Steyer in third place and underscores the campaign's traction in early states as suggested by a January Fox News Poll, which showed Steyer placing in second place with 15% and third place with 12% in South Carolina and Nevada respectively.

"With less than a week to go until the Iowa caucuses, Tom is continuing to connect with voters and they are resonating with the message that he is the unconventional candidate needed to expose Trump on the economy and beat him in November," said Campaign Manager Heather Hargreaves. "The people Tom is meeting with face-to-face are fired up and ready to end corporate control of the government. They know Tom is the candidate who will beat Trump, return our government to the people and ensure we can finally take action on the important policies that will improve people's lives."
The latest poll comes as Steyer embarks on his final bus tour of Iowa before the caucuses on February 3. Steyer is traversing the state to energize supporters, build on his continued momentum, and make the case to all Iowans that he's the best candidate to expose Donald Trump on the economy.
