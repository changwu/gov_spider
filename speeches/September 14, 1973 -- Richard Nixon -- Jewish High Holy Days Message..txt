    WITH the coming of 'the High Holy Days, Mrs. Nixon and I express our warmest greetings to our fellow citizens of the Jewish Faith.
This is a time of introspection and spiritual self-renewal for Jews. But for all Americans it is an occasion to remember the essentially democratic theme of Judaism: that the most exalted and the lowest stand equal before God.
May the High Holy Days provide for all of us an opportunity for renewed commitment to the sacred principles upon which our nation is established, and may the conduct of our national life be a testament to the strength and vitality of those principles in our personal lives.
RICHARD NIXON
