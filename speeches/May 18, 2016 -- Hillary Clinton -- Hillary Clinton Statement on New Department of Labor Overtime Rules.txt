    Today, in response to final overtime rules released by the Department of Labor guaranteeing overtime to workers who earn up to $913 a week or $47,476 over a year—more than double the previous threshold of $455 a week—Hillary Clinton issued the following statement:
"I applaud President Obama and Secretary of Labor Perez for these final overtime rules, which will lift up workers nationwide and help get incomes rising again for working families. Within the first year these rules are in effect, millions more workers will be eligible for overtime, finally getting paid in full for the hours they are putting in on the job.
"But we have more work to do. No one who works 40 hours a week should have to raise a family in poverty. No one should have their fundamental rights to organize and bargain collectively stripped away by Republicans and their corporate allies. That's why we need to raise the federal minimum wage back to the highest it's ever been in this country and make sure it keeps rising over time, protect workers' rights and safety on the job, and restore the basic bargain that built America's mighty middle class—that if you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead and stay ahead."
