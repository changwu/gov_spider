    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:) (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
Title VI of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 requires that the Secretary of Commerce identify 200 megahertz (MHz) of the radio spectrum assigned to Federal Government use for reallocation to the Federal Communications Commission for nonfederal use.
Under delegated authority, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is responsible for managing the Federal Government's use of the radio spectrum. On March 22, 1995, Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown submitted to you NTIA's Spectrum Reallocation Final Report that identified for reallocation in August 1995, the 2300-2310 and 2400-2402 MHz bands for exclusive nonfederal use and the 2417-2450 MHz band for mixed Federal and nonfederal use.
I am pleased to inform you that the Federal Government frequency assignments in the spectrum identified for reallocation for exclusive nonfederal use have been withdrawn by NTIA in compliance with section 114 of the Act. In addition, modifications were made to the National Table of Frequency Allocations for Government stations to reflect the reallocation of the spectrum.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
