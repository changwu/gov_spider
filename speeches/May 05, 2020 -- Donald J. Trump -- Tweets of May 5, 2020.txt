A group of RINO Republicans who failed badly 12 years ago, then again 8 years ago, and then got BADLY beaten by me, a political first timer, 4 years ago, have copied (no imagination) the concept of an ad from Ronald Reagan, "Morning in America", doing everything possible to....Retweets: 22318Favorites: 93302

....get even for all of their many failures. You see, these loser types don't care about 252 new Federal Judges, 2 great Supreme Court Justices, a rebuilt military, a protected 2nd Amendment, biggest EVER Tax & Regulation cuts, and much more. I didn't use any of them....Retweets: 8122Favorites: 33261

....because they don't know how to win, and their so-called Lincoln Project is a disgrace to Honest Abe. I don't know what Kellyanne did to her deranged loser of a husband, Moonface, but it must have been really bad. John Weaver lost big for Kasich (to me). Crazed Rick Wilson....Retweets: 12665Favorites: 56868

....lost for Evan "McMuffin" McMullin (to me). Steve Schmidt & Reed Galvin lost for John McCain, Romney's campaign manager (?) lost big to "O", & Jennifer Horn got thrown out of the New Hampshire Republican Party. They're all LOSERS, but Abe Lincoln, Republican, is all smiles!Retweets: 13855Favorites: 62268

Governors should let roads and highway construction begin before heavy traffic starts, which will be soon. Some Governors never stopped, which proved to be very smart. They built and fixed roads during long no traffic periods. Also, saved big dollars!Retweets: 27125Favorites: 128264

For the constant criticism from the Do Nothing Democrats and their Fake News partners, here is the newest chart on our great testing "miracle" compared to other countries. Dems and LameStream Media should be proud of the USA, instead of always ripping us down! https://t.co/8AwnPCNchFRetweets: 22856Favorites: 78278

The Do Nothing Democrats and their leader, the Fake News Lamestream Media, are doing everything possible to hurt and disparage our Country. No matter what we do or say, no matter how big a win, they report that it was a loss, or not good enough. The Enemy of the People!Retweets: 33584Favorites: 140943

Most of the money raised by the RINO losers of the so-called "Lincoln Project", goes into their own pockets. With what I've done on Judges, Taxes, Regulations, Healthcare, the Military, Vets (Choice!) & protecting our great 2A, they should love Trump. Problem is, I BEAT THEM ALL!Retweets: 19706Favorites: 82425

Well run States should not be bailing out poorly run States, using CoronaVirus as the excuse! The elimination of Sanctuary Cities, Payroll Taxes, and perhaps Capital Gains Taxes, must be put on the table. Also lawsuit indemnification & business deductions for restaurants & ent.Retweets: 32118Favorites: 123015

Wow! Congratulations to Greg Gutfeld, a one time Trump Hater who has come all the way home. His Ratings easily beat no talent Stephen Colbert, nice guy Jimmy Fallon, and wacko "last placer" Jimmy Kimmel. Greg built his show from scratch, and did a great job in doing so. @FoxNewsRetweets: 31199Favorites: 147006
