Republicans are doing really well with the Senate Midterms. Races that we were not even thinking about winning are now very close or even leading. Election night will be very interesting indeed!Retweets: 21355Favorites: 93794

The Dems have tried every trick in the playbook-call me everything under the sun. But if I'm all of those terrible things how come I beat them so badly 306-223? Maybe they're just not very good! The fact is they are going CRAZY only because they know they can't beat me in 2020!Retweets: 29744Favorites: 125431

If the U.S. sells a car into China there is a tax of 25%. If China sells a car into the U.S. there is a tax of 2%. Does anybody think that is FAIR? The days of the U.S. being ripped-off by other nations is OVER!Retweets: 32757Favorites: 133067

Wow NFL first game ratings are way down over an already really bad last year comparison. Viewership declined 13% the lowest in over a decade. If the players stood proudly for our Flag and Anthem and it is all shown on broadcast maybe ratings could come back? Otherwise worse!Retweets: 22782Favorites: 106928
