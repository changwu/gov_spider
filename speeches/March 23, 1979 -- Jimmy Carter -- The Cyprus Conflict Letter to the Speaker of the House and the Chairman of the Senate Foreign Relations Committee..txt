    To Speaker Tip O'Neill: (To Senator Frank Church:)
In accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-384, I am submitting the following report on the progress made during the past sixty days toward the conclusion of a negotiated solution of the Cyprus problem.
During the past two months, as I outlined in my report of January 29, the United Nations has persisted in its active efforts, to bring about a resumption of the Cyprus intercommunal negotiations on a sound and effective basis. The focus of this effort is to develop a meaningful agenda acceptable to both Cypriot parties. The Secretary General's Special Representative in Cyprus has held frequent consultations with both sides in Nicosia, eliciting their reactions to each other's comments on the present draft agenda and seeking their acceptance of compromise suggestions. These consultations are continuing on an intensive basis. Meanwhile, some consideration has also been given to the possibility of direct consultations involving representatives of the two Cypriot communities and the Secretary General this spring.
While we believe that both sides would welcome meaningful talks, we should not underestimate the magnitude of the differences between them on matters of substance. The compromises that must be made if an enduring settlement is to be achieved will be politically difficult for both sides.
The Department of State has remained in close and frequent contact with the United Nations Secretariat and with the parties concerned. We have urged both parties to show flexibility and to respond constructively and imaginatively to the ongoing United Nations initiative. We will continue to make every effort to help bring about a productive resumption of negotiations.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
