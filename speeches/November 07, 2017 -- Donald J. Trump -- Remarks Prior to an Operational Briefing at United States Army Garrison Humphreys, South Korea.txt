    Thank you very much. I just want to thank General Brooks and everybody that is working with us so hard on the situation in South Korea. Terrific people. I had a choice of having a beautiful, very fancy lunch, and I said, no, I want to eat with the troops. And we ate with the troops. And it was good eating. It was good eating. And I tell you, they've done a terrific job, very impressive.
And we have a very strong schedule today and, actually, for the next 9 days. As you know, we just got back from Japan where we had a very successful 2 days. Today will be pretty busy and tomorrow also. And then, we head to China. And I look forward to that.
But there's great cooperation. We have a terrific meeting scheduled on trade in a little while with President Moon and his representatives. And we will—hopefully, that will start working out and working out so that we create lots of jobs in the United States, which is one the reasons—one of the very important reasons—I'm here.
In addition to that, we'll be meeting with the various generals—General Brooks and the various generals—about the situation in North Korea. And I think we're going to have lots of good answers for you over a period of time, and ultimately, it will all work out. Because it always works out, has to work out.
So I want to thank you all for being here. We appreciate it. Thank you very much. We're going to see you in a little while. And I think about 4:30, we're going to be separately meeting with you.
But we appreciate it. I hope you had a good flight here. Many of you were on the flight with me, so I know it was pretty good. And I think you're probably just as impressed as I am. This is a very impressive group of people, beyond facilities—people. These are very impressive people.
So, General, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you.
