    Just hours after announcing, an unprecedented grassroots army coalesces to support Sanders in every state across the country
BURLINGTON, Vt. -- Twelve hours after announcing his bid for president, U.S. Sen. Sanders is shattering records and building unprecedented support for his vision to transform the country from the bottom up.
Representing every state, thousands of Americans have pledged to support his campaign. In all, almost 150,000 individuals gave more than $4 million, mirroring the 2016 campaign's average donation of $27. Individuals contributed a half-million dollars in donations that will recur every month.
"The only way we will win this election and create a government and economy that work for all is with a grassroots movement â€“ the likes of which has never been seen in American history," Sanders said in his message announcing his campaign. "They may have the money and power. We have the people."
In response, pledges of support for Sanders' campaign topped 330,000, with thousands signing on to volunteer. Sanders' launch video was viewed more than 5.7 million times across social media platforms, including 3.7 million views on Twitter.
In the first 12 hours since his announcement, Sanders proved a grassroots support of unprecedented size and excitement, clearing the way for a movement to win the Democratic primary, defeat Donald Trump, and create a government that works for all Americans.
