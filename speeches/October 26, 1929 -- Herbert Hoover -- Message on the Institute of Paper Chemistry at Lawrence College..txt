Dear President Wriston:
I am glad to know of the organization of the Institute of Paper Chemistry at Lawrence College. The importance of sound technical processes based upon scientific research is becoming ever more important to American industry.
Through the association of institutions of learning with business the colleges will be in a position more adequately to serve present day needs. By associating themselves with institutions of learning the industries may keep abreast of scientific developments and make a sound contribution to the progress of the nation.
I hope that the success of this cooperative effort will point the way to other fruitful enterprises of like character.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[ President Henry M. Wriston, Lawrence College, Appleton, Wisconsin]
