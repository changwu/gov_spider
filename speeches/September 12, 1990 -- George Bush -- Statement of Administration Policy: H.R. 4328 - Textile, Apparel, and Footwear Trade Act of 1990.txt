    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
Sent to House Rules - 9/13House - 9/14(House Rules)(Hollings (D) South Carolina and 54 others)
The President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto H.R. 4328 if it is presented to him.
H.R. 4328 would provide permanent, rigid protection from imports to domestic producers of textiles, apparel, and footwear. The quotas set by the bill would cause harm to consumers and the economy, violate our international obligations, and virtually destroy any chance of a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations.
