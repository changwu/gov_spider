    Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the United States Trade Representative 
Subject: Proposed North American Free Trade Agreement
Having considered the relevant measures taken by Canada and Mexico, together with the recommendation of the United States Trade Representative, I have determined that Canada and Mexico have implemented the statutory changes necessary to bring those countries into compliance with their obligations under the North American Free Trade Agreement and that they have made provision to implement the Uniform Regulations provided for under Article 511 of the Agreement regarding the interpretation, application, and administration of the rules of origin. The United States has completed necessary legal procedures in accordance with Article 2203 of the Agreement.
Pursuant to section 101(b) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Public Law 103-182), I hereby direct the Secretary of State to exchange notes with the Government of Canada and the Government of Mexico providing for the entry into force, on January 1, 1994, of the Agreement, in accordance with Article 2203 thereof.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
