    Helena, MT â€“ In response to the September DNC debate announcement, Montana Governor Steve Bullock released the following statement:
"I'm the only one in the field who has won and governed a Trump state. I'm now the only Governor running for the Democratic nomination. And I'm the only candidate who has made actual strides in getting the corrupting influence of money out of our elections," said Montana Governor Steve Bullock. "There are over 150 days before voters express their preference in Iowa and New Hampshire. It's those voters in early states and across the country who will decide this election."
Governor Bullock will be in Iowa talking directly with voters during the Houston debate. Further details to be announced.
