    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced the National Steering Committee of the Sportsmen for McCain coalition. These leaders in the angling, hunting and shooting communities are working across the country to emphasize John McCain's dedication to protecting American's right to gun ownership and his commitment to preserving and promoting our hunting, angling and shooting traditions.
John McCain said, "I am proud to have the support of these national and state leaders within the sportsmen's community and know that their support is integral to my bid to become your next president. It would be an honor to serve as your president and carry on the guiding principles of Theodore Roosevelt, America's foremost conservation president."
"John McCain has been a leader and a friend to sportsmen and gun owners for over 25 years," said National Sportsmen for McCain Co-Chair Governor Tim Pawlenty. "Sportsmen should know John McCain understands our community and will fight to protect and promote the sportsmen's agenda."
National Sportsmen for McCain Co-Chair, former Governor Frank Keating added, "While the choice for sportsmen is clear, we are going to continue to share that message with our friends at the range, on the lake and in the woods to ensure our fellow angler, conservationist, and friend John McCain is elected as our next president."
