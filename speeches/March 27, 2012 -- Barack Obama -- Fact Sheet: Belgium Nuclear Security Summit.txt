•      Belgium signed the NPT in 1975 as a non-weapons state, but has retained a leading nuclear technology research center and derives over 50% of its energy from nuclear power using 7 power reactors.
•      SCK-CEN is one of the largest research centers in Belgium whose mission includes among other areas, the backend of the nuclear fuel cycle, decommissioning of nuclear sites, and countering nuclear proliferation.
•      At the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit, Belgium has announced it will work jointly with the United States to eliminate its excess highly enriched uranium (HEU) and plutonium.
