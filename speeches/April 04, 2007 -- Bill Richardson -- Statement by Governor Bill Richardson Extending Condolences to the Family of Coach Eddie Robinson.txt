    Governor Bill Richardson today issued a statement extending condolences to the family of Coach Eddie Robinson.
"Coach Robinson was one of the greats, and his 57 years at Grambling State University will always be remembered."
Coach Robinson's record was an amazing 408-165-15, and he was the first college football coach to reach 400 victories. Over several decades he sent over 200 players to the NFL including, Doug Williams, the first African-American quarterback to win the Super Bowl. Arguably more amazing than his football record, was how Coach Robinson prepared his players to successfully handle the challenges of day to day life after their football careers.
In a time of segregation and throughout the civil right's struggles of the 1960s, Eddie Robinson's teams provided hope and unity to generations of football fans—black and white. His accomplishments and the lives he touched will be an inspiration to future generations to come. FDR was President when rookie coach Eddie Robinson first took the field at Grambling State University; almost 60 years and 11 presidents later, when he walked out of the stadium named after him, Eddie Robinson was a hall of famer, Louisiana icon and an American legend.
