    Today, Hillary for America Senior Policy Advisor Maya Harris released the following statement:
"The shooting of Charles Kinsey in North Miami shows that we still have work to do to strengthen the relationship between police officers and the communities they serve, and reduce the use of excessive force.
"The sad reality is that African American men are far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, or killed in police-involved incidents than white men. That is why Hillary Clinton supports national guidelines on the use of force by police officers, making it clear when deadly force is justified and when it isn't and promoting proven strategies for de-escalation.
"When everyone is respected by the law and everyone has respect for the law, our police officers, our communities, and our country are stronger."
