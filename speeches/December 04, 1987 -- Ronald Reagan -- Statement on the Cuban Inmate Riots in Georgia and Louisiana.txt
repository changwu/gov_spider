    I want to commend Attorney General Meese for his handling of the prison disturbances in Georgia and Louisiana. I am extremely gratified that all of the hostages are now safe.
I would like to thank all of the law enforcement agencies involved, including the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the FBI, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the U.S. Marshals Service, the Community Relations Service, and the State and local law enforcement agencies in Georgia and Louisiana. The patience and professionalism demonstrated by all of the agencies involved have been rewarded.
I would also like to thank Bishop Roman and the other members of the Cuban-American community for their assistance in addressing a very difficult problem.
