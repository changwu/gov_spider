    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Leader:)
This is to register my concerns with the provisions of H.J. Res. 395, the Continuing Resolution, which I understand is scheduled to be considered in the House in the near future. While members of the House and Senate are working to develop legislation that would implement our bipartisan budget agreement, it would be counterproductive for the Congress to act on a measure that clearly violates both the spirit and the terms of that agreement.
Let me also point out there are many extraneous provisions included in the Resolution to which I must take exception. In addition I am informed that further objectionable measures may be incorporated into the Resolution by the Rules Committee.
It is imperative in my view that essential nonlethal aid to the Nicaraguan democratic resistance be continued in the Resolution. To fail to provide such assistance at this critical time would undercut the peace process and undermine our commitment to democracy in Central America.
I trust that we can continue our bipartisan effort and work toward implementation of the agreement reached last month. I urge you and your colleagues to develop a Continuing Resolution that is faithful to our agreement.
We are working to carry out the Administration's part of this agreement, and I trust the House will do the same. If H.J. Res. 395 were sent to me in its current form for signature, I would have no hesitation in vetoing the measure.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
