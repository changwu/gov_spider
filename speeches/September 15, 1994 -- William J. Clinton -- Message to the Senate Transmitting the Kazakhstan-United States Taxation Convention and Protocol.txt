    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital, together with the Protocol and the two related exchanges of notes, signed at Almaty on October 24, 1993. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
The Convention replaces, with respect to Kazakhstan, the 1973 income tax convention between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It will modernize tax relations between the two countries and will facilitate greater private sector U.S. investment in Kazakhstan.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Convention, Protocol, and the two related exchanges of notes and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
