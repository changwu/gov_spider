    I have just been reviewing the dangerous situation in Lebanon with Secretary of State Vance.
The fighting today was particularly destructive and it seemed to be spreading. I was therefore greatly relieved to learn that President Asad of Syria had been personally involved in bringing about a cease-fire, which is holding for now. I call urgently on all involved to negotiate a permanent end to the cycle of confrontations which has gone on far too long and at such a heavy cost in innocent lives.
I hope other friends of Lebanon will join with the United States in efforts to bring an end to the tragedy in Lebanon and to assist President Sarkis of Lebanon in all appropriate ways as he tries to restore stability and calm.
