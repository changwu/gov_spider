    I wholly support the defunding of Planned Parenthood today and in the future. As president, I pledge I would never send a budget to Capitol Hill that contains a penny of funding for Planned Parenthood. Abortion related services comprise over 94 percent of Planned Parenthood's business. We can kill their funding while maintaining a robust commitment to providing access to important preventative medicine and prenatal services.
Organizations that harvest body parts from unborn children is neither Planned Parenthood nor right and should not receive any support from the Federal Government. I'm running for president to create a culture of respect for human life and look forward to not only eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood, but also ending abortions at 20 weeks when a child can feel pain. The United States is one of seven nations that allows such a practice and as President I would make sure we are no longer part of that club.
