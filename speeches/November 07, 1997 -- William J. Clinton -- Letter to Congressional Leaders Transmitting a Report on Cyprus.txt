    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question. The previous submission covered progress through May 31, 1997. The current submission covers the period June 1, 1997, through July 31, 1997.
The reporting period was marked by two important developments. The first was my appointment on June 4 of Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke as the new Special Presidential Emissary for Cyprus. This appointment of one of our most capable negotiators demonstrates our commitment to help promote a final political settlement for Cyprus.
The second key development was U.N. Secretary General Annan's June 9 invitation to the leaders of the two communities in Cyprus, President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, to engage in direct talks under U.N. auspices. These were the first faceto-face meetings of the two leaders since October 1994. Two rounds of direct talks were held, the first from July 9 to July 13 in Troutbeck, New York (which is treated in this report), and the second from August 11 to August 15 in Switzerland (which will be covered in the next report). United Nations Special Advisor for Cyprus Cordovez noted that the cordial atmosphere between the parties at Troutbeck was a good beginning for subsequent negotiating sessions. A U.S. diplomatic effort for the U.N. settlement process was led by Ambassador Holbrooke, who met with Messrs. Clerides and Denktash before and after the talks.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
