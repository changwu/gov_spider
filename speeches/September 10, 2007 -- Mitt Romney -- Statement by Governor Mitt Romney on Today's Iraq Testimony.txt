Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement on the testimony by General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker:
"Today's testimony from General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker confirms the progress being made by our troops in Iraq. This is good news for Americans and Iraqis. The importance of a successful conclusion to Iraq must be weighed in light of the global threat of violent Jihad and terror. America must continue its commitment to the strategy General Petraeus is executing.
"Americans owe a debt of gratitude to General Petraeus, Ambassador Crocker, our troops and the diplomats who are risking their lives to make success and progress possible. The integrity of General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker were on display today. Now it is time for Senator Clinton, Senator Obama and Senator Edwards to display their own integrity by expressly disavowing the baseless attack on General Petraeus by MoveOn.org."
