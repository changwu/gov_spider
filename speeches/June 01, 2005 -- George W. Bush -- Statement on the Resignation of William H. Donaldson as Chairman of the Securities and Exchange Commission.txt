    Bill Donaldson took on a tough job at a tough time, and he delivered for the American people. He vigorously and fairly enforced our Nation's securities laws and helped rebuild the public trust in corporate America that has been important to our economic recovery. I am grateful for his dedicated service, and Laura and I wish him and Jane all the best.
