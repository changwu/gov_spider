    AL AND Peg, first let me say that Betty is very, very sorry she couldn't join us tonight. She really looked forward to it. She worked so hard helping me get my polls up to her polls in Florida last week that she is taking it a little easy this week. But she wanted me to express to both of you, as I am going to express-Betty and Jerry Ford not only like Al Cederberg, we love him.
Last year on my birthday, Al and Peg were over with some others to celebrate and Al and Peg brought a very unique lamp--one where you could turn it on and off by just touching the flowers that were around the lamp. Well, it was a great gift and we really, really enjoy it, but they didn't know that it blew out the fuses in the White House. [Laughter] Now, Al, I am not going to give you anything on your birthday that would bring about such a disaster as that. [Laughter]
I don't have to sell all of you on Al Cederberg. I am deeply indebted to him-he got me started in all this trouble back on January 3, 1965, when he made an impassioned plea on the floor of the House that permitted me to win by a landslide margin of 73 to 67. [Laughter]
But Al has been one of my dearest and closest friends for a long, long time. And I can never repay you, Al, for all the many things that you did for me as minority leader and the things that you have done while I am President.
I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart because I mean it, I fed it, and you just express to me, in the day-to-day actions that you take, the finest in public service.
I congratulate you and thank you, and you are darn lucky to have Peggy as a wife.
