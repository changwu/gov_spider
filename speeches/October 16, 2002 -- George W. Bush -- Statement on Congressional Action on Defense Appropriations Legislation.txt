    I commend the House and Senate for responding to my call to pass the defense appropriations bill. This defense budget will provide our troops with the best pay, the best equipment, and the best possible training. It also sends an important signal that we are committed to defending freedom and defeating terror. The Congress acted responsibly in passing the defense appropriations bill first, and I look forward to signing it.
