    It is good news for all Americans that the House and Senate have again demonstrated bipartisan unity in pursuit of two vital national goals—strategic modernization and arms control. Their authorization of production of the Peacekeeper missile reaffirms the fact that, as a nation, we are united in our approach to arms reductions and protecting peace.
In May the Congress established a new bipartisan unity endorsing the Scowcroft commission recommendations. In the past 2 weeks, that unity was tested and sustained. Thanks to this bipartisan support, we are now in a stronger position to continue making progress at the START negotiations. If we can maintain our stable, bipartisan, consistent approach here at home, we have a great opportunity to achieve what we all want—lasting stability in the nuclear balance and significant reductions of nuclear arsenals on both sides.
