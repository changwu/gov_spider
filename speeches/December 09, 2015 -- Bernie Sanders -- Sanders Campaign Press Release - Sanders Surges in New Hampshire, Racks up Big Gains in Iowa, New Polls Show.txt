    WASHINGTON – Democratic Party presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has a sizable lead among New Hampshire Democratic Party primary voters and showed remarkable growth in a new poll of Iowa caucus goers, according to new surveys released this week.
A poll by the University of New Hampshire Research Center for CNN and WMUR-TV in Manchester, New Hampshire, found Sanders led former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by 50 percent to 40 percent. The new poll results announced on Wednesday showed Sanders picking up support since he posted a 46 to 30 percent lead over Clinton in September. He had trailed the former first lady in the same survey in New Hampshire last June.
In another measure of Sanders' support in the state that holds the first primary two months from now, 83 percent of those surveyed in New Hampshire have a favorable view of Sanders. Clinton, by contrast, was viewed favorably by only 68 percent, a big 10-point drop form her approval rating last June.
In Iowa, Clinton's lead over Sanders has fallen by 19 points since late October. In a Monmouth College Poll of "likely caucus goers," she led 55 percent to 30 percent. That figure shrank dramatically from the 65 percent to 24 percent lead Clinton held in the last Monmouth poll of previous primary voters.
"In New Hampshire and Iowa, Bernie is moving up," said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. "The surveys in these states where Bernie has campaigned the hardest are another sign that the more people know him the better they like him and his campaign to challenge our rigged economy held up by a corrupt campaign finance system."
