    President Bush. Mr. President, welcome. I'm looking forward to our discussion. I'm looking forward to our continued work together to make sure that Al Qaida and people affiliated with Al Qaida are brought to justice.
Today the world saw with horror the attacks on innocent people in Jordan by killers who defile a great religion. I spoke to King Abdullah. I expressed our Nation's deep concern and compassion for those who lost their lives and their families. The bombings should remind all of us that there is an enemy in this world that is willing to kill innocent people, willing to bomb a wedding celebration, in order to advance their cause. And for those of us who love freedom and for those of us who love— who respect every human life, no matter whether you're from the West or from your neighborhood, Mr. President, we have an obligation and a duty to remain strong, remain firm, and to bring these people to justice.
And so, Mr. President, welcome.
President Salih. Thank you, Mr. President. I am delighted to have this friend, George Bush. This is probably the third meeting that we have together. And we discuss a variety of mutual issues, and our mutual objective here is the declaration of war against terrorism and extremism. We have seen it during 9/11 and after. I am here to reaffirm Yemen's position that it is clear and firm—our resolve is firm—to continue to work with the United States and the international community in combating terror.
Since yesterday, I had the opportunity to have a variety of meetings with members of your administration. I am delighted to have the opportunity to see you and meet with you today, Mr. President. We will have a variety of issues that we will discuss, bilateral issues, as well as issues of interest to both the international community and world peace and stability.
I thank you very much for your hospitality and for receiving me.
President Bush. Thank you, sir.
