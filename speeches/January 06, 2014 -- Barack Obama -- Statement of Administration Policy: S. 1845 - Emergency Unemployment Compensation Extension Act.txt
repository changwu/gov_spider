(Senate)
(Sen. Reed, D-RI, Sen. Heller, R-NV, and 20 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 1845, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act. This bipartisan legislation would restore emergency unemployment insurance benefits that expired for 1.3 million Americans looking for work at the end of 2013. Extending these benefits would not only help these families pay their bills but it is also one of the most cost effective ways to strengthen the economy, according to independent economists.
Historically, Republicans and Democrats have worked together to make sure that unemployment insurance continues for job-seekers during times when there are still too many Americans out of work, and it is unprecedented for the Congress to allow emergency unemployment benefits to expire at a time when long-term unemployment is as high as it is today. The Congress should act immediately to pass this bipartisan three-month extension, restoring a vital economic lifeline for hardworking American families while giving more time for consideration of further extension through 2014. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on this and other measures to grow our economy and continue to create jobs, and to help Americans looking for work.
