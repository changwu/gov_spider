    President Obama is lecturing the country instead of leading it. He has presided over the largest and most irresponsible run up of debt in our nation's history, and he now threatens to preside over the first default in U.S. history. Once again, President Obama did not have the courage to offer real solutions to fix runaway debt. Where is his plan to fix Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid? Tonight's speech was all rhetoric and no results, and is another reason why President Obama needs to be removed from office.
