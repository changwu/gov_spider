    President Bush will welcome President Lech Kaczynski of Poland to the White House on July 16, 2007. Under President Kaczynski's leadership, Poland has been one of the United States closest allies in advancing and consolidating democracy in Europe and around the globe. Poland is a leading strategic partner in the war on terror, supporting stability and freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan. To protect Europe and the United States from emerging threats, Poland has also expressed its interest in contributing to a missile defense system. The two leaders look forward to discussing these and other regional and international issues.
