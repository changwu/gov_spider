    ABC's Kate Snow: 'A major boost for a candidate seeking the nomination of their party.' KATE SNOW: "This morning the most influential paper in the state of Iowa, one of the most influential states, has published its endorsements for candidates running in the January 3rd presidential caucuses there. Historically a vote of confidence from â€˜the Des Moines Register' has been a major boost for candidates seeking the nomination of their party, and that's exactly what this year's recipients are banking on." [ABC Good Morning America, 12/16/07]
The Atlantic's Marc Ambinder: 'Major boost for Clinton... many Democrats in Iowa unquestionably consult the Register's editorial voice before deciding.' "(1) It's a major boost for Clinton... Many Democrats in Iowa unquestionably consult the Register's editorial voice before deciding whom to vote for. (2) The Register endorses Clinton's theme: inspiration is nice, but in order to get things done, you need experience." [Marc Ambinder, 12/15/07]
Washington Chris Cillizza: 'A boost of momentum' for Hillary. "The Des Moines Register endorsed Democratic Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) this evening, handing Clinton a boost of momentum with the crucial caucuses less than three weeks away." [Washington Post, 12/15/07 ]
NPR's Juan Williams: Hillary 'did great in that [Des Moines Register] debate..she ended on a very strong point...you saw that reflected in the Register's endorsement.' "I think she did great in that [Des Moines Register] debate. And I think she ended on a very strong point when she said there were people like Obama who hoped for change, there are people like John Edwards who are out there lambasting the corporate titans as ruining and corrupting government, but that she is someone who will work for change. And you saw that reflected in the register's endorsement when they talked about her as someone that embodies competence and experience. And I think that that is a message that more and more voters have to come to as they approach what is the holiday season, when everybody's going to be busy. I think that's a message that sticks as you approach January 3rd." [Fox News Sunday, 12/16/07]

'That readiness to lead sets her apart from a constellation of possible stars in her party.'" [ABC This Week, 12/16/07]
