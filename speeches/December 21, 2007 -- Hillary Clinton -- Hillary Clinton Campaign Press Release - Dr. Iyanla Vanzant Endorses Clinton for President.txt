    Best-selling author, ordained minister and spiritual life coach Dr. Iyanla Vanzant announced her support for Hillary Clinton today. "Hillary Clinton has my complete support because she has the right combination of character, experience, strength, and values to be President and lead on her first day in office," Vanzant said. "For over 35 years, Hillary has demonstrated that she will work on behalf of all Americans." Vanzant's personal experiences have given her profound insight into life which she utilizes in her approach to coaching others through life's challenges and difficulties. She is hailed as one of the most dynamic African-America woman speakers in the country, is a five time New York Times best-selling author for her work on the following books: Yesterday I Cried; One Day My Soul Just Opened Up; and In the Meantime.
"I am honored to have Iyanla's support and look forward to her working with the campaign to further our message of change across the country," Clinton said. In 2001, Vanzant hosted her own television talk show Iyanla and two years later was a regular on the television series Starting Over as a life coach. Vanzant presently manages the Inner Visions Institute for Spiritual Development she founded in Silver Spring, MD.
