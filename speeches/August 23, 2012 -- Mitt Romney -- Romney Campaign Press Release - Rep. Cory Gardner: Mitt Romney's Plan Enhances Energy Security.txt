    Colorado Congressman and member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee Cory Gardner made the following statement on Mitt Romney's vision for America as an energy superpower:
"The Romney energy plan enhances our energy security, approves the long-awaited Keystone pipeline, and promotes responsible exploration and development within the U.S. that will help bring down prices at the pump. His blueprint will restore local control over decisions to develop and produce all forms of energy on federal lands. Under Governor Romney's plan, states will be empowered to do what is best for job creation within their own state boundaries, rather than having to kowtow to federal bureaucratic measures that prevent innovation and development."
