    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that former Congresswoman Nancy Johnson has endorsed Mayor Giuliani for President. Johnson represented Connecticut in the United States House of Representatives from 1983 until 2007.
"Mayor Giuliani will be a strong leader for our country," said Johnson. "He has the experience and vision to be President, and his commitments to fiscal responsibility, keeping our country safe and providing families with more healthcare options will serve America well. Rudy is the only candidate with the message needed to beat the Democrats next fall."
"Nancy is a distinguished public servant and was very effective representing the people of Connecticut," said Mayor Giuliani. "We're glad to have her support. She will be an asset for us in the state."
