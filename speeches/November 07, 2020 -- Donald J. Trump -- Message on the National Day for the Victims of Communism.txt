    On National Day for the Victims of Communism, we solemnly remember the more than 100 million lives claimed by communism in the 20th century. We commit ourselves to stopping the spread of this oppressive ideology that, without fail, leaves in its wake misery, destruction, and death. As proud Americans who cherish the blessings of freedom and democracy, we promise to support the more than one billion people currently captive within communist regimes and denied their unalienable rights to life and liberty.
This year marks the 100th anniversary of the decisive Polish victory against Vladimir Lenin's Bolsheviks in the Battle of Warsaw. Known as the Miracle on the Vistula, the Polish heroes of this battle halted the spread of communism in Europe for decades. Sadly, the Soviet Union erected an Iron Curtain around Poland and spread communism to neighboring countries and around the world. Since then, the United States and the free world have borne witness to the horrors of communism, including Chinese prison camps and Soviet gulags. Over the last century, communist regimes from Cambodia's Khmer Rouge to Ethiopia's Derg have confirmed the soul-crushing oppression inherent in Karl Marx's philosophy.
Still today, we observe the irony of "People's Republics" that belong not to the people, but to one-party and that exist only for the benefit of a select few. Over and over, communism and socialism have proven to be irreconcilable with the unalienable and fundamental rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. While Marxism promises equality, peace, and happiness, in practice it results only in inequality, violence, and despair.
On this National Day for the Victims of Communism, we commit to standing against this insidious ideology, and pledge with great pride that the United States will never be a socialist Nation. We memorialize all those who have lost their lives to communism and recommit to promoting freedom so that future generations can flourish.
