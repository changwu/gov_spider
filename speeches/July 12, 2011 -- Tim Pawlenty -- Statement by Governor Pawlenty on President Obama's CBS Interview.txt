    "Mr. President, stop trying to scare Americans into agreeing to higher taxes and spending. With our economy on the ropes and unemployment growing, it is unconscionable that President Obama would be proposing higher taxes and more spending, but not surprising coming from the same man who gave us the failed stimulus and ObamaCare. I would use the debt limit as a moment to stop out-of-control government, and force real spending cuts and balance the budget."
