    Each day, America's law enforcement officers pin on a badge and go to work, not knowing what the day will bring, and hoping to come home safely. With courage and dedication, they serve on the front lines of our communities, preserving public safety and responding to a wide range of daily challenges. On Peace Officers Memorial Day, and every day, we honor law enforcement officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty and thank them and their families for their extraordinary sacrifice and service.
Our country asks a great deal of our Federal, State, Tribal, and local law enforcement officers, and it is our responsibility to ensure that those who protect and serve us have the training and support they need to do their jobs safely. My administration is committed to supporting our law enforcement agencies and officers and making sure they have the resources, research tools, and funding they need to be safe, effective, trusted sources of protection in their communities. Today and each day, my thoughts and my sincere gratitude are with all those law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line.
