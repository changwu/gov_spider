    For the second time in 2 weeks, every single Republican in the United States Senate has chosen to obstruct a bill that would create jobs and get our economy going again. That's unacceptable. We must do what's right for the country and pass the commonsense proposals in the "American Jobs Act." Every Senate Republican voted to block a bill that would help middle class families and keep hundreds of thousands of firefighters on the job, police officers on the streets, and teachers in the classroom when our kids need them most.
Those Americans deserve an explanation as to why they don't deserve those jobs, and every American deserves an explanation as to why Republicans refuse to step up to the plate and do what's necessary to create jobs and grow the economy right now.
We must rebuild the economy the American way and restore security for the middle class based on the values of balance and fairness. Independent economists have said the "American Jobs Act" could create up to 2 million jobs next year. So the choice is clear. Our fight isn't over. We will keep working with Congress to bring up the "American Jobs Act" piece by piece and give Republicans another chance to put country before party and help us put the American people back to work.
