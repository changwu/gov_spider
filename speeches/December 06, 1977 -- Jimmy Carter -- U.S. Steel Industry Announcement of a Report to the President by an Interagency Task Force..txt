    The President has received and approved the recommendations of the Interagency Task Force report on steel prepared by the Under Secretary of the Treasury, Anthony Solomon.
The President indicated that the recommendations in the Task Force report will help revitalize the health of the domestic steel industry, will encourage its modernization, and will assist workers, firms, and communities that have been disadvantaged by its current problems.
The President stressed that these purposes would be achieved: --with maintenance of existing environmental goals;
--within the framework of existing antitrust laws;
--with a minimum of inflationary impact;
--with modest Federal budget expenditures;
--in a way which encourages greater productivity and modernization in the steel industry;
--consistent with competitive market forces.
The President noted the rapidity with which the administration had responded to the problems of the steel industry and applauded the expeditious work by the Task Force and particularly by Under Secretary Solomon.
