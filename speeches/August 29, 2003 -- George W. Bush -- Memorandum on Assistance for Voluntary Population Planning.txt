    Memorandum for the Secretary of State Subject: Assistance for Voluntary Population Planning
On March 28, 2001, I issued a memorandum for the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) directing that certain conditions be placed on assistance for family planning activities provided to foreign nongovernmental organizations by USAID.
Because family planning grants are awarded by the Department of State outside of USAID as well as through USAID, you are hereby directed to extend the requirements of the March 28, 2001, memorandum to all assistance for voluntary population planning furnished to foreign nongovernmental organizations and appropriated pursuant to the Foreign Assistance Act, whether such assistance is furnished by USAID or any other bureau, office, or component of the Department of State.
As set forth in the March 28, 2001, memorandum, this policy applies to certain assistance provided to foreign nongovernmental organizations. Such organizations do not include multilateral organizations that are associations of governments. This policy shall not apply to foreign assistance furnished pursuant to the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-25).
The foregoing directive is issued consistent with the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including sections 104 and 104A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended.
You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
George W. Bush [Filed with the Office of the Federal Register, 8:45 a.m., September 2, 2003]
