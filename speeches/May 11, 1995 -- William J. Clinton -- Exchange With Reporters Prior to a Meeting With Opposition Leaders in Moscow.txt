    Q. Good morning, Mr. President.
The President. Good morning. How are you?
Q. Very good, sir. Does President Yeltsin have any reason to be upset at this meeting you're having this morning?
The President. I don't think so. I'm looking forward to this breakfast. I want to have this opportunity mostly just to listen to all these leaders talk about the conditions here in Russia, what the people are going through. It's an opportunity for me to learn and to reemphasize that I came on this trip because, first, I wanted to express the feelings of the United States on the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II and to finally acknowledge the enormous sacrifice of the Russian people and, secondly, because I am trying to increase the security of the people of America and the people of Russia in this partnership. So I'm glad to have a chance to have this meeting.
Q. What are you going to tell them?
The President. Just what I told you just now. I'm going to listen. I'm going to listen.
Q. Do you think you have—you've been emphasizing the security aspect of your trip. Do you think you've succeeded?
The President. Yes. We're in better shape than we were before I got here. It was a good trip.
[At this point, one group of reporters left the room, and another group entered.]
Q. [Inaudible]—did you run today, Mr. President? Did you run today?
The President. I didn't. I ran yesterday, and I was——
Q. What about today?
The President. ——in the gym this morning. I ran away from the weather. I worked out in the gymnasium at the hotel. I was weak today. I gave in to the weather.
