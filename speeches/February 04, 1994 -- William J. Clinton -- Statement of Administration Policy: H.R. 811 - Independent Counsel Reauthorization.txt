    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Brooks (D) Texas and 5 others)
The Administration supports H.R. 811.
As stated in May 19.93, the Administration opposes mandatory application of the Independent Counsel Act to Members of Congress and would oppose any amendment to H.R. 811 to do so. Mandatory coverage of the Legislative branch would be inconsistent with the fundamental purpose of the statute, which is to avoid the potential of conflict of interest in the investigation and prosecution of high-level members of the Executive branch.
