    Mitt Romney is trying to run from the fact that President Obama used Romneycare as the model for Obamacare.
Romney bragged about Romneycare being a national model in his book, No Apology, published in March 2010: "We can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country." Mr. Romney deleted this Romneycare brag from the paperback version of, No Apology, published in Feb. 2011.
