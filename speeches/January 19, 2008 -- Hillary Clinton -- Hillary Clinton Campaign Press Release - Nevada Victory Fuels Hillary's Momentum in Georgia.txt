    With Nevada Win, Campaign to 'ËœTurn Up the Volume' in Peach State
Atlanta, Georgia - Hillary's focus on delivering real change and real solutions for working families helped her win a huge victory in Nevada today. As the nation's focus turns to the key states on the February 5 "Super Tuesday," major attention will be turned on Georgia.
"Hillary Clinton is offering real solutions to the very real problems that we face, and that is why her support in Georgia remains strong," Georgia Congressman John Lewis said. "With the eyes of the nation turning south, Georgia will be front and center on the political map."
In the days ahead of the primary, the campaign will highlight the real solutions that Hillary Clinton has proposed to the problems that Georgia families raise in every town hall meeting, issues of better jobs and more affordable health care, stronger protections against home foreclosures, and a smarter approach to national security. With more than 3,500 volunteers already signed up to help, Team Hillary is creating an impressive organization that will educate and motivate Georgia voters.
"We need an economic shot-in-the-arm in this country. Now more than ever, we need a president who understands how to create new jobs and how to give small businesses a solid boost. Hillary Clinton has the ideas and the ability to turn our country around and move us forward," said Atlanta entrepreneur Brooke Jackson.
Volunteers are joining the Hillary team through http://hillaryclinton.com/hq/georgia as well as through one-on-one contact with Clinton supporters. The Georgia team also is opening campaign locations throughout the state.
Hillary has been endorsed by every statewide elected Democratic official and several other prominent local and national leaders. Organizers are in place in all 13 Congressional Districts.
