    Seattle, WA – After a surge of interest following Wednesday night's debate, the Inslee for America campaign passed the 100,000 unique donor mark this afternoon.
Meanwhile, online engagement continues to surge, following Inslee's breakout performance and clarion call on climate change at the Detroit debate.
Since the debate, Inslee for America has seen:

Inslee stood out during Wednesday night's debate, taking the lead advocating for climate change action. The Washington governor drew headlines and applause by directly challenging Vice President Biden on the future of fossil fuels, and devoted his opening and closing statements to the importance of making climate change the next president's top priority.
Highlights from Inslee's debate performance included his criticism of the filibuster and declaration that President Trump is a "white nationalist," provoking strong support from Democrats both online and through donations.
"The last 48 hours have shown record momentum for the Inslee campaign, with Democrats responding strongly to Jay Inslee's clear message on defeating the climate crisis," said Aisling Kerins, campaign manager for Inslee for America. "Today, we crossed 100,000 donors - and we are fewer than 30,000 donors away from reaching the donor threshold for the next debates. Jay Inslee is driving the climate conversation in this race, and Democratic voters want a president who will put defeating climate change first."
