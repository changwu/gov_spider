One of the most important issues for Pennsylvania is the survival of your fracking industry. Joe Biden has repeatedly pledged to abolish fracking. When asked about fracking, Biden said he would make sure it's ELIMINATED! With me, you're going to FRACK!  https://t.co/tHt7Chh4jBRetweets: 11330Favorites: 44142

For years you had a President who apologized for America – now you have a President who is standing up for America, and standing up for Pennsylvania.

So terrible that Facebook and Twitter took down the story of Smoking Gun emails related to Sleepy Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in the @NYPost. It is only the beginning for them.
