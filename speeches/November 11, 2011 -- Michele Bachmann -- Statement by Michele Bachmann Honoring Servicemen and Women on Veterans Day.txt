    Columbia, SC – On this Veterans Day, Bachmann issues the following statement in honor of our brave men and women of our armed forces:
"Generations of military men and women have sacrificed their time, comfort, and too often, their lives protecting our Constitutional – and God-given – freedoms. Every single day our freedoms need defending, and I am thankful for all who have served this great country around the globe, ensuring our liberty. They are deserving of the distinction of the best Americans, and we owe them a debt we can never fully repay.
"Through decades of struggle, free nations have prevailed over tyranny because of the sacrifices of the men and women of the United States armed forces. Those we depended on to defend America should know that they can depend on us. Today we honor our veterans, but we should remember them everyday for the service they gave to our country, for every American and for the cause of freedom."
