    For millions of Americans, hearing aids and the doctor's visit to get them prescribed are too expensive. Last year, President Biden issued an executive order to increase competition in key industries and lower costs. In the order, he called on the FDA to make hearing aids available over the counter.
Today, the FDA issued a final rule allowing hearing aids to be sold over the counter, improving access and lowering costs for millions of Americans. As early as mid-October, Americans will be able to purchase more affordable hearing aids over the counter—without a prescription—at pharmacies and stores across the country.
This action will deliver nearly $3,000 in savings to American families purchasing a pair of hearing aids while providing more choices to improve their health and wellbeing.

Debara Tucci, Director of The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD): The United States marks a significant milestone in advancing hearing health care, as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued its final rule establishing guidelines for over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids. This landmark rule, released on August 16, 2022, is part of a broader effort to expand access to high-quality, affordable health care for all Americans. OTC hearing aids are intended to address perceived mild to moderate hearing loss in people 18 or older.

Maria Town, President and CEO, American Association of People with Disabilities: "Good news, indeed! This has been such a long time coming and is the result of years of advocacy from the hard of hearing communities including veterans, seniors, and other disabled people. I'm personally excited b/c this means my dad might be able to afford hearing aids. A recent study found that hearing aids were unaffordable for 77% of Americans with loss, and purchasing hearing aids would impoverish hundreds of thousands of people. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33112178/ #DisabilityTax#DemolishDisabledPoverty. This new rule is good news, but it isn't enough. Insurance, particularly Medicaid and Medicare, should cover hearing aids, and hearing care. By hearing care - I mean services that fit hearing aids and train people on how to use and maintain their devices. The work continues." [Tweets, 8/16/22]
Hearing Loss Association of America: "Millions of American adults with mild to moderate hearing loss will soon have more choices in hearing aids, and the ability to get them without seeing a doctor or hearing care professional first. The Hearing Loss Association of America (HLAA) – the leading voice for the growing number of Americans with hearing loss – calls the step a win for millions of adults who have hearing loss and may have been waiting to get the help they need."
