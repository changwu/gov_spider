Travel pool report 2 - clarifying Disney/gay comment @Seattle fundraiser
I've had questions about what POTUS said last night at the Seattle fundraiser about Disney and saying "gay." My audio is soft, but here's what I have. As always, check against WH transcript:
"This is not your father's Republican Party. This is a different deal, not a joke. And it's not just Trump, it's the MAGA crowd. It's all about things that have nothing to do with traditional conservative [outcomes? Hard to hear]. I respect conservatives. There's nothing conservative about deciding you're going to throw Disney out of its present posture because, Mickey Mouse? In fact, you think we should not be able to say, you know, 'gay'? I mean, what's going on here? What the hell is going on here? And it's just, it's so, I don't think this is where the vast majority of the American people are."
