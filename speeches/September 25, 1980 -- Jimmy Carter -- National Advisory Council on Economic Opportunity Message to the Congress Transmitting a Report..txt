In accordance with Title VI, Section 605 of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, I am transmitting herewith the Twelfth Annual Report to the Congress of the National Advisory Council on Economic Opportunity.
This report reflects the Council's views in its role of examining programs authorized by the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, and their impact in alleviating certain problems confronting low-income people.
