    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
I am pleased to transmit this report on the adherence of the United States to obligations undertaken in arms control agreements and on problems related to compliance by other nations with the provisions of bilateral and multilateral arms control agreements to which the United States is a party.
This report meets the requirements of Section 52 of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act, as amended in the FY 1986 ACDA Authorization Bill. It was prepared by the Director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Director of Central Intelligence.
In previous reports to the Congress, the United States has made clear its concerns about Soviet noncompliance. The United States Government takes equally seriously its own commitments to arms control agreements and sets rigid standards and procedures for assuring that it meets its obligations. The United States has been and remains in compliance with all treaty obligations and political commitments.
This report is unclassified and suitable for general release. However, a classified attachment, providing information on noncompliance by other nations with provisions of multilateral arms control agreements, is being provided under separate cover.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
