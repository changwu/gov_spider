    Memorandum for the United States Trade Representative
I have signed into law an Act "To approve and implement the protocol to the trade agreement relating to customs valuation, and for other purposes" (P.L. 96490). That action enables you to exercise delegated authority to accept for the United States the Protocol to the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Following such acceptance, that portion of the above-mentioned Act implementing the Protocol may become effective when the European Economic Community also implements the Protocol. I hereby delegate to you the authority to make that determination as required by section 2 of the Act.This document shall be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER.
