    Yesterday the Senate confirmed Raymond Kethledge and Helene White to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and Stephen Murphy to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. I appreciate the Senate's work on filling these important seats, which had been declared judicial emergencies.
For the first time in my administration, the Sixth Circuit will now have a full court to address important issues facing the residents of Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee. Unfortunately, too many other Federal judgeships across America remain vacant. This is unacceptable and inexcusable. Since the beginning of the 110th Congress, the Senate has confirmed only 10 circuit court nominees. In the last 2 years of the past three administrations, the Senate has confirmed an average of 17 circuit court judges. I strongly urge the Senate to hold hearings and votes on the 28 pending circuit and district court nominations to ensure that our Nation has a fully functioning judicial system.
