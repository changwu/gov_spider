Ohio always looms large in presidential politics, especially among Republicans. Beginning with Abraham Lincoln, no GOP candidate has ever been elected president without Ohio's electoral votes. In any Republican strategy to unseat President Barack Obama this November, Ohio is a must-win state.

Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, is the only remaining Republican contender capable of that.
Romney, who turns 65 next week, served only a single term as governor, and by the standards of most serious presidential contenders, his political resume is short: two statewide campaigns and an unsuccessful bid for the GOP presidential nomination four years ago.

But Romney's private-sector success is also critical to his appeal. He understands how businesses and investors make decisions. He has had to make tough choices, trade short-term pain for long-term gain. A serious debate between Romney and Obama about the proper role and size of government would be healthy for a nation facing grave fiscal challenges.
None of Romney's GOP rivals seem capable of such engagement -- or of appealing to a broad range of voters.
