    Support is 'More than Double Received by Any Other GOP Candidate'
Little Rock, AR - Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee announced endorsements from 27 elected Missouri officials today - a number representing more than double the number of endorsements for any other Republican presidential candidate in Missouri.
The endorsements come as new Rasmussen polling released Tuesday measuring head-to-head match-ups showed Huckabee edging Hillary Clinton in Missouri, and polling better than his GOP rivals.
"I am grateful for the endorsements of these legislators and the wealth of experience they bring to my campaign," Huckabee said, "These officials will be an incredible asset for the campaign in Missouri."
"Governor Huckabee represents the true conservative principals that many Missouri Republicans value," Missouri State Senator and Chair of Huckabee's Missouri organization Delbert Scott said. "When we met with the Governor last week, his sincerity really stood out."
Twenty-three state representatives and four state senators are publicly supporting Huckabee. "Governor Huckabee's recent surge in Iowa, South Carolina, and Florida has been reflected here in Missouri," Missouri State Representative Brian Yates said. "In the past two weeks, we have added many new endorsements from all areas of the state."
The campaign is building its grassroots organization in anticipation of helping Huckabee win the critical Missouri primary on February 5th.
