    To the Congress of the United States:
I hereby transmit the Fifth Annual Report of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission as required by Section 307 (c) of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974. This report covers the Commission's activities from October 1, 1978 to September 30, 1979, and also briefly describes additional actions taken later that year and in 1980.
This report highlights the March 1979 incident at Three Mile Island and details the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's response to the accidentâ€”and its shortcomings in acting.
In October of 1979, the President's Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island submitted recommendations for extensive reform and reorganization of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, many of which were outlined in my response to this report on December 7, 1979. The Administration is currently implementing a Nuclear Regulatory Commission reorganization plan, that will improve the management of the agency and enhance its ability to respond to emergency situations. I have also established through Executive order the Nuclear Safety Oversight Committee which will help me make sure that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and industry are taking the necessary steps to improve nuclear safety.
JIMMY CARTER
The White House,
November 13, 1980.
