    The release today by the Dutch Safety Board of its investigatory report on the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014 is an important milestone in the effort to hold accountable those responsible for the shoot-down of the aircraft and the killing of those aboard. This independent investigation has been conducted in accordance with international standards and recommended practices in a professional manner by the Dutch Safety Board authorities, and serves as a basis for further investigations to identify those responsible for the deaths of 298 innocent men, women, and children. The report also serves to remind us of this terrible tragedy and the impact it continues to have on those left behind. We maintain our support for the work being conducted by the countries of the Joint Investigation Team, and reiterate that the United States will fully support all efforts to bring to justice those responsible. Our assessment is unchanged â€” MH17 was shot down by a surface-to-air missile fired from separatist-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine. The victims and their loved ones remain in our thoughts and prayers.
