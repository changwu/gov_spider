TAPPED's Harold Meyerson: "His Personal Narration Is Powerful... Edwards Is the Master Here." 10:02 PM | "Edwards has just referred to his orientation as personal, not academic (read: Obama) or political (read: Hill). And his personal narration is powerful. Slowly, Obama moves to talking about his mother when she was suffering from cancer, but it's almost as if Edwards forced the story out of him. Edwards is the master here."

Matthew Yglesias: Edwards "Gave a Fantastic Response" on Answer to Rid the World of Nuclear Weapons.

Matthew Yglesias: On Pakistan, "Edwards and Obama both offered great responses." "UPDATE: Given a second, clearer shot at the nuclear proliferation issue Edwards and Obama both offered great responses. Clinton's decision to put bureaucratic reorganization of the non-proliferation apparatus -- rather than substantive shifts in policy -- struck me as a bit odd, but perhaps in line with her broader argument about experience. She knows the nitty-gritty details of executive branch organization." [http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/01/pakistan_questio...
