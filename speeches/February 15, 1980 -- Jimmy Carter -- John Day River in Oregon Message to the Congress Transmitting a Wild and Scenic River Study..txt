    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to Section 4(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (P.L. 90-542), I am transmitting the Wild and Scenic River Study of the John Day River in Oregon. The study was prepared by the Department of the Interior.
The study finds that the entire 147 mile study segment of the river qualifies for addition to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System as a scenic river. The State of Oregon has already acted .to protect this river under its Scenic Waterways System. For this reason, the study recommends that the river be added to the national system as a State-administered component. The Secretary of the Interior has indicated his willingness to add the river to the national system as soon as the Governor of Oregon requests that it be added, pursuant to Section 2(a) (ii) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.
I support the recommendations of the study.
