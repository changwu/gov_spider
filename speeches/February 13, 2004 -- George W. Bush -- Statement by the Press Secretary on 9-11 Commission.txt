    9-11 Commission Chair Kean and Vice Chair Hamilton today requested a private meeting with the President to discuss information relevant to the Commission's work. The President has agreed to the request. While the Chair and Vice Chair have suggested the possibility of a public session at a later time, we believe the President can provide all the requested information in the private meeting, and there is no need for any additional testimony.
