    The devastation caused by Hurricane Maria will continue to affect our fellow citizens of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in many different ways, and the full recovery process will likely taking many months and even years. However, the resilience and determination of the people I met today will outlast any damage that was left behind. As I listened to the first responders who have helped so many people, and to the local residents who lost so much, I was heartened by the stories of neighbors helping neighbors, and a community coming together in tragedy. Just as with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, this Administration will continue to offer support and resources in the wake of this natural disaster. To the first responders and local officials who have worked tirelessly to provide aide, on behalf of a grateful Nation I say thank you. To our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, I continue to offer you daily thoughts and prayers. May God bless the people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and offer comfort in this time of loss.
