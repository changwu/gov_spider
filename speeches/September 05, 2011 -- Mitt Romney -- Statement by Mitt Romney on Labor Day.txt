    Mitt Romney today issued the following statement on Labor Day:
"As we celebrate this Labor Day, we should not forget the great many families facing economic hardship. Over 25 million Americans are unemployed, underemployed, or so discouraged that they have stopped even looking for a job. This week I will outline a comprehensive plan to put America back on the road to economic growth and job creation. We cannot continue on a course that has kept unemployment above 8 percent for the longest stretch since records have been kept. The potential of the American people has been demonstrated time and again. With leadership that understands how jobs are created, that potential can be unlocked â€“ that is why I am running for President of the United States."
