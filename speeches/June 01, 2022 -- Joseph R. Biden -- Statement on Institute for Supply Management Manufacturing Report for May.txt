    I have long said that making more in the United States is key to any serious strategy to prevent the kinds of supply disruptions that have led to price spikes for American families this year. When we make more here at home, we make our supply chains more resilient and help avoid the kinds of disruptions that have driven up prices in the wake of the pandemic. It is why my economic plan has prioritized American manufacturing and resilient supply chains, and has helped usher in an historic American manufacturing boom. Today we learned that American manufacturing continued to grow in May.
Since I took office, we've added 545,000 manufacturing jobs, and more manufacturing jobs were created in 2021 than in any year in nearly 30 years. This didn't happen by accident; this is a direct result of my economic plan to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out. Congress should take the next step by swiftly passing the bipartisan innovation act, which is going to help lower prices, and make sure that the next generation of innovation and advanced manufacturing happens right here in America, with American workers.
