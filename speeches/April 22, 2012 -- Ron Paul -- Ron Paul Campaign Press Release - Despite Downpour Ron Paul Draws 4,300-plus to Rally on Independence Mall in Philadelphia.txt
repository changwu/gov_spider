LAKE JACKSON, Texas - 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul drew a remarkable 4,300-plus voters to a major campaign rally he held on the Independence Mall in Philadelphia despite poor weather conditions that would have kept supporters of other candidates away.
Event organizers noted that, despite the inclement weather, supporters and undecided voters greeted the 12-term Congressman from Texas with the characteristic enthusiasm for which his crowds are known. It had rained all day and with chilly temperatures to boot, many attendees responded that they were cold, uncomfortable, and feeling poorly. And yet, the people persevered for Paul.
Also noteworthy is that the campaign event took place in the footsteps of America's modern founders, who conceptualized, advocated for, and created a modest federal government of the kind Ron Paul has been promoting for more than three decades.
Ron Paul's campaign rally took place on the lawn at the Independence Mall Visitors Center, located at 1 North Independence Mall West (b/t Market and Arch Streets), Philadelphia, PA 19106. The rally commenced at 1:00 p.m. ET, while Congressman Paul addressed the crowd at around 2:30 p.m. Dr. Paul discussed his platform of constitutionally-limited government, the restoration of our civil and economic liberties, and provisions of his path-breaking 'Plan to Restore America.' In addition to keynote speaker Ron Paul, featured speakers included Paul backers Pennsylvania State Senator Mike Folmer (R-Lebanon) and former CIA officer and Bin Laden Unit leader Michael Scheuer, both of whom have endorsed him for the presidency.
