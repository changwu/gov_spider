    Your Boardman Space Age Industrial Park, conceived and carried out under the leadership of Gov. Mark Hatfield with the cooperation of the national administration, is a truly great project and a bold and imaginative approach to achieving the best use of resources for the economic development of the area. This is an outstanding example of Federal-State cooperation and is a welcome contrast to the something-for-nothing attitude which is much too prevalent these days.
I have reviewed this project with some of the people in charge of our country's expanding space exploration and defense programs. They agree that the Boardman site has the characteristics desired by space technology and missile industries, and I strongly believe that it should be used for one of our major space or missile projects.
