    Lawton will serve as a Midwest Campaign Co-Chair
The Clinton Campaign today announced that Wisconsin Lieutenant Governor Barbara Lawton will serve as Co-Chair of the Midwest Region and a Co-Chair of the campaign's Wisconsin effort.
"Senator Clinton comes uniquely prepared to lead our nation in these complex times," Lawton said. "For the United States to compete successfully in a global knowledge economy, we need a president with a bold vision that draws us all into the equation for prosperity."
"Senator Clinton will restore our country's standing in the world and drive the American economy forward. This is more than an endorsement. This is a promise. I will work hard, alongside thousands of my fellow Wisconsinites to deliver Wisconsin, the battleground of battlegrounds, for Senator Clinton."
Lawton, Wisconsin's first woman elected Lt. Governor, took the lead on economic development and innovation in government initiatives during her first term. She received national and international recognition for her economic development initiative, Wisconsin Women = Prosperity, and serves as the only U.S. elected official on former President of Ireland Mary Robinson's Women Leaders Intercultural Forum.
Lawton provided leadership to establish incentives for development of a creative industries cluster and Film Wisconsin. She serves on the National Leadership Council for the American Association of Colleges and Universities' Liberal Education: America's Promise (LEAP) campaign, and heads its pilot campaign in Wisconsin. Her economic focus includes job creation through innovation in renewable energy technology.
The Madison Capital Times recently called her the "boldest and most active lieutenant governor in state history."
"Barbara Lawton's leadership has helped drive Wisconsin's economic growth and expanded opportunities for everyone," Clinton said. "I'm honored that she will help lead our efforts in Wisconsin and throughout the Midwest."
