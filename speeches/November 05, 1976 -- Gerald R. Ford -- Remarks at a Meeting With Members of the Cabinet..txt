    Good morning.
It wouldn't be honest if I didn't say that I appreciate the warm applause, and because of the voice, I'm not going to make a big speech. But I do want to thank each and every one of you for the quality of the job you've done, the high quality of the people who sit at this table, and the results that I think we've achieved. I strongly think that in this 2-year period, we have made very significant progress. And a great deal of that is the result of what all of you have done and the people associated with you.
So, we lost a close one, but we have no apologies. And I'm very grateful for the 48 or 49 percent that supported us. And until January 20, we're going to be working at the job.
I thank you all very, very much, and I'm proud that you all were working with me and doing a fine job. Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT. Mr. President, I would say that I think history is going to show that during the most difficult crisis this country faced, you rose to the highest office of the land as President. You took us out of a period of crisis, of disillusionment, of discouragement. Where the economy was going downhill, you turned it around. You restored faith in America, faith in the White House, respect. The economy is on the upswing, our position in the world is clear, and it is thanks to you. And as a citizen I'd like to say thank you.
