Then, she delivered remarks to soldiers, military families, and veterans thanking them for their honorable service to the defense of our Nation. She also highlighted the importance of mental health and suicide prevention awareness during National Suicide Prevention Month.
"Veterans are 1.5 times more likely to die by suicide than Americans who never served in the military," said Second Lady Karen Pence. "It is time to change the culture around suicide and mental health and erase the stigma. I was inspired by the work at Fort Stewart- Hunter to encourage service members to reach out and ask for help when needed."
The second half of the Second Lady's trip to Georgia consisted of visiting Emory Healthcare Veterans Program facility in Atlanta. Emory works to treat the invisible wounds of post-9/11 veterans and active duty service members through innovative clinical care, research, and education.

Following the tour, Mrs. Pence participated in a roundtable discussion with members of the Emory team and they provided an overview about their program for military service members and veterans, including information about their work to research and address suicidal ideology. Then, a veteran who participated in the program shared his story, and his wife and two adult children shared how they saw the veteran heal through the program.
"Emory's program provides valuable comprehensive treatment to veterans and service members seeking treatment for a variety of mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI)," said Second Lady Karen Pence.
