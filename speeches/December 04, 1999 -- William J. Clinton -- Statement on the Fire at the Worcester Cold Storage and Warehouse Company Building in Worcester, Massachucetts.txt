    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the tragedy that has struck the Worcester community. The six firefighters who are now missing and presumed dead valiantly put their lives on the line in the effort to save others and protect their city. Their courageous service reminds us all of the tremendous commitment and sacrifice made by the thousands of firefighters across America who risk their own lives every day to protect our communities. Our thoughts and prayers go out to these courageous firefighters, to their families, to the Worcester Fire Department, and the city of Worcester.
