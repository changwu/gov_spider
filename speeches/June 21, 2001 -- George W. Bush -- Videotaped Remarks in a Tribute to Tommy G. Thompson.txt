    Well, thank you all very much. I'm honored to join so many good friends. And I'm pleased to help pay tribute to a great Governor, a great Cabinet Secretary, and a good man, my friend Tommy Thompson.
Tonight we salute Tommy Thompson for his 14 years as Wisconsin's Governor. For almost a decade and a half, Tommy was a pioneer. From school choice to health care, Tommy was always on the cutting edge looking for new ideas, even while holding to timeless principles.
Perhaps his greatest legacies were in changing the way the government treats the poor and empowering thousands of people by replacing their welfare checks with paychecks. Not long ago, welfare reform was just a dream. Today, thanks in large part to Tommy Thompson, welfare reform is the law.
Tommy Thompson is one of the finest public servants in America. His commitment is matched by his courage, and his diligence is equaled by his devotion. These days, Tommy is bringing his commonsense leadership and results-oriented approach to the Department of Health and Human Services. He is leading the way as our administration works to promote the health and welfare of all Americans through greater research, new technologies, and sound science. I'm honored to have this good man as a part of my team.
So Tommy, thanks for who you are and what you do. You have made a difference in the lives of so many people in Wisconsin, just as you are now making a difference in the lives of so many Americans.
Thank you very much, and God bless.
