    I warmly welcome the signing today in Washington of a framework agreement establishing a federation in the areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina with majority Bosnian and Croat populations. This framework agreement also provides the outline of a preliminary agreement for a confederation with the Republic of Croatia. This is a major step in the search for peace in Bosnia. I am especially pleased with the tireless efforts of my Special Envoy, Charles Redman, and those of Croatian Foreign Minister Granic, Bosnian Prime Minister Silajdzic, and Mr. Kresimir Zubak, representing the Bosnian Croats.
I spoke this evening with President Alija Izetbegovic of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I congratulated him for his leadership and the critical role he has played in this achievement. All of us are heartened by the courage that he and the Bosnian people have shown in their struggle for peace.
I also spoke with President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia to convey my admiration for the statesmanship he has shown in forging this agreement. I underscored the support of the United States for the sovereignty and integrity of his country.
A great deal of work remains to be done to bring a full peace to Bosnia. The United States will continue to work closely with the parties throughout this process. I urge the parties to continue to demonstrate the flexibility and statesmanship that has brought them to this point. I urge them to persevere over the coming weeks to help ensure that today's accomplishments lead to the peace so long overdue.
