Today, Marco Rubio received the support of numerous Florida state leaders for his presidential campaign, bringing the total to over 80 endorsements.
They include current and former Cabinet officials who have been elected statewide, current and former speakers of the Florida House of Representatives, and over 70 legislators. The full list of supporters is included below.
Adam Hasner, Marco Rubio For President Statewide Co-Chair & Former House Majority Leader:
Marco's going to win the White House because he shares the American people's frustration with the disastrous eight years we've had under Obama, and he knows how to channel that feeling into innovative policy ideas, unite our country and lead us into the future. Our growing support in Florida is a strong sign that we'll have the team in place to turn out the early vote in the coming weeks and close the deal with a victory on March 15.
Congressman Tom Rooney, Marco Rubio For President Statewide Co-Chair: 
Marco has been the best candidate since day one ,and I'm glad to see so many in the Florida delegation supporting him. Marco is the only candidate that can unify our party and his growing support is proof of that. The coming weeks are going to be probably the most important of the whole campaign. Team Marco is only getting stronger and I'm confident that we are going to see results that can win him the nomination.
Carlos Lopez-Cantera, Lieutenant Governor:
I am proud to continue to support my friend Marco Rubio for President. I have always maintained that Marco is a once in a generation leader for conservative values who will take our message of opportunity and prosperity to those who have become disenfranchised with the failed promises of the liberal agenda.
Jeff Atwater, Chief Financial Officer:
During my time in public service, I have rarely seen someone with such potential as Marco Rubio. He has been blessed with a talent to effectively espouse our conservative principles to all walks of life. This ability gives him the opportunity to unite America behind his vision of a new American century. I am proud of his work to strengthen America's armed forces, families, workers, and taxpayers. Our time to come together is now and I wholeheartedly support his efforts to become the 45th President of the United States.
Adam Putnam, Agriculture Commissioner: 
After eight years of Barack Obama, our nation is in desperate need of strong conservative leadership. We need a president who will not point the finger when faced with a challenge, but instead propose solutions that will better our nation. We need a president who will not whittle away at the rights our forefathers embedded into the Constitution, but instead staunchly defend these freedoms we hold dear. We need a president who will not create barriers to growth and prosperity, but instead clear the path for any American to pursue the American Dream. That's why I'm proud to support Florida's own, Marco Rubio for President.
Steve Crisafulli, Speaker of the House: 
After eight years of the Obama presidency, our country finds itself buried in debt, bitterly divided, and weakened internationally. Our country needs a President who can unite us, inspire us, and lead us into the future. Marco Rubio was an outstanding Speaker of the Florida House and United States Senator. Marco is the only candidate who can reignite our economy, restore our leadership on the international stage after the failures of the feckless Clinton-Obama foreign policy, and revive the promise of the American Dream so our children inherit an America that is stronger and more prosperous than ever before. I am honored to endorse Marco Rubio for President of the United States, and I look forward to helping him defeat Hillary Clinton in November.
Richard Corcoran, Speaker-Designate of the House: 
Marco Rubio understands that we are a country of families, faith, and freedom.  He knows that we have to restore our nation's integrity at home and rebuild our reputation around the world. There is no better candidate to articulate the Republican Party's vision for America.
