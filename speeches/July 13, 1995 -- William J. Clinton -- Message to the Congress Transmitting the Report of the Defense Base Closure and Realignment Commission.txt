    To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith the report containing the recommendations of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC) pursuant to section 2903 of Public Law 101-510, 104 Stat. 1810, as amended.
I hereby certify that I approve all the recommendations contained in the Commission's report.
In a July 8, 1995, letter to Deputy Secretary of Defense White (attached), Chairman Dixon confirmed that the Commission's recommendations permit the Department of Defense to privatize the work loads of the McClellan and Kelly facilities in place or elsewhere in their respective communities. The ability of the Defense Department to do this mitigates the economic impact on those communities, while helping the Air Force avoid the disruption in readiness that would result from relocation, as well as preserve the important defense work forces there.
As I transmit this report to the Congress, I want to emphasize that the Commission's agreement that the Secretary enjoys full authority and discretion to transfer work load from these two installations to the private sector, in place, locally or otherwise, is an integral part of the report. Should the Congress approve this package but then subsequently take action in other legislation to restrict privatization options at McClellan or Kelly, I would regard that action as a breach of Public Law 101-510 in the same manner as if the Congress were to attempt to reverse by legislation any other material direction of this or any other BRAC.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
