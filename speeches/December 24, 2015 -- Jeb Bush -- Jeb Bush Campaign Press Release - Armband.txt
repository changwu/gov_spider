    As we gather with family this Christmas, we must remember our troops serving overseas and their loved ones here at home who aren't able to do the same.
Our men and women in uniform and our military families have sacrificed so much to defend our freedoms. There are those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice, including Jane Horton whose husband was killed in Afghanistan. Every day, I wear her husband's Killed in Action bracelet as a reminder that the job of Commander-in-Chief comes with profound responsibility — supporting our troops and keeping our country safe.
To our troops away from home this holiday season, our military families and the loved ones of the fallen — I wish you a Merry Christmas and I'm forever grateful for your service.
