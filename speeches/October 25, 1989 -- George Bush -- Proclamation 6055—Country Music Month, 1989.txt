  A Proclamation

With its origins in the folk songs of immigrants and workers, country music boasts a rich heritage as well as a wide audience. During Country Music Month, as we celebrate this uniquely American art form and salute the musicians and audiences who give it life, we recall a proud portion of our history and culture.
Over the years, country music has given eloquent expression to the American spirit. In its simple strains, we hear the voices of a people united by their faith, their love of freedom, and their appreciation for honesty and hard work. Yet, as varied as each of the men and women who compose it, country music also captures our Nation's ethnic and cultural diversity.
Today, country music is thriving not only in the United States, but around the world as well. Its popularity is a tribute to the generations of Americans who have graced it with their talent and vision.
The Congress, by House Joint Resolution 401, has designated October 1989 as "Country Music Month" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this month.
Now, Therefore, I, George Bush, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 1989 as Country Music Month. I call on all the people of the United States to observe the month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourteenth.

GEORGE BUSH
