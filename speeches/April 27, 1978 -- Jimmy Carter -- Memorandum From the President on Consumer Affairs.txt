    Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
Because decisions made by government have a direct and substantial impact on the American consumer, I have a firm commitment to consumer involvement in government. One of this Administration's principal goals is to ensure that each agency of the Federal Government adequately responds to consumer needs in its development of policy and provides adequate opportunities for consumer participation in its decisionmaking processes.
Therefore, I am immediately strengthening the White House Office of Consumer Affairs and increasing its responsibilities. I am asking my Special Assistant for Consumer Affairs, Esther Peterson, to fulfill the following responsibilities:
• To participate in the development of domestic policy decisions and to advise me concerning the potential impact on consumers of proposed or existing policies and programs, and pending legislation so that I may have the benefit of the consumer point of view when making decisions.
• To survey the consumer programs of the various Federal agencies in order to determine if there is a meaningful consumer presence in each agency and to make recommendations to me on how my Administration might further assure consumer involvement in agency decisionmaking.
• To undertake a complete review of Federal agency consumer programs and to advise me as to whether these programs are responsive to the needs of consumers consistent with the consumer policies and goals of my Administration. I am asking that this review be completed in time for our FY 1980 budget assessments and our 1979 legislative proposals.
• To coordinate the activities of Federal agency consumer programs in order to avoid duplication and to ensure that they are efficiently administered.
To assist my Special Assistant for Consumer Affairs in fulfilling these responsibilities, I direct all executive departments and agencies to cooperate with and provide information to my Special Assistant as needed. In implementing these responsibilities, my Special Assistant will, from time to time, consult and meet with the Secretary, or appropriate Assistant Secretary, of each Federal department and agency responsible for consumer programs, for the purpose of establishing a framework within which to evaluate and review the policies, budgets, activities, and structure of consumer-related programs in each agency.
I have also asked my Special Assistant for Consumer Affairs to meet with responsible representatives of business, labor, farm, and consumer groups in fulfilling the new responsibilities outlined in this memorandum.
I am confident that all will give their full support to my Special Assistant in the performance of new responsibilities and duties outlined here.
