    Haiti
Q. Mr. President, have you made a decision on Haiti? Are you going to send U.S. warships to intercept boats to enforce a U.N. embargo?
The President. I'll have a statement about it later this afternoon. When the Prime Minister and I conclude our talks and our public statement, then I'll make a statement about Haiti and take questions on it.
Q. Are you concerned at all about the safety of supporters for Mr. Aristide following the assassination?
The President. I'll talk about it later this afternoon.
