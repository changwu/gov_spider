    Mr. President, Madame Mobutu, the distinguished members of your party, and our guests:
Mr. President, it is a special privilege for me to welcome you today to the White House. You are a young leader of a young country. In fact, the Congo is the youngest country of all those that have been represented by state visits since I have been President of this country.
I have the privilege of knowing your country and of knowing your people, and I can tell the American people that while your country is young---only 10 years of age---that it has had a period of progress in that period which has been an example for nations throughout the world.
You have moved forward economically, you have established unity in your country, and you have a vitality which impresses every visitor when he comes to the Congo.
I have been looking forward to this visit so that the people of the United States could know you and, through you, know your people and your country. We know that you will be meeting with our Government leaders and also later with business leaders in New York, who may be interested in making an investment in the Congo.
My advice to them very simply would be this: The Congo is a good investment not only because of its natural wealth but because of a wealth even more important than its natural resources, a strong and vigorous and progressive people, and a stable leadership.
You come from the heart of Africa and I can assure you that the hearts of all Americans go to your country and to you as you go forward in a program of progress and peace for your people and for all the people of Africa.
