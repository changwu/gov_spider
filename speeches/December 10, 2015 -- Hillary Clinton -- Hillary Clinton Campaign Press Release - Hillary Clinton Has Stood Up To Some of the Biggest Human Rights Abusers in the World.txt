    
She doesn't back down.
Hillary has never backed down from a tough fight—even when that fight is with some of the worst human rights offenders in the world. Here are three important times Hillary wasn't afraid to speak out on behalf of fundamental rights and human dignity around the world.
1. When she stood up for women around the world:

You might be familiar with this rallying cry—Hillary's words, coming from the first lady of the United States, were heard around the world. But what made her speech so bold was the fact that she called out gender violence and human rights abuses by name, because she believed you don't shy away from confronting these issues head on.
2. When she declared LGBT rights are human rights:

As secretary of state, Hillary brought LGBT rights to the forefront of U.S. foreign policy. When she declared to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva that gay rights are human rights, her words were called "the strongest defense ever in terms of gay rights" at the time.
3. When she brought attention to human rights violations in Cuba—and applauded those working to stop them:

As a candidate for president, Hillary took an unprecedented position: calling for the end to the U.S. embargo of Cuba. And she named the human rights abuses that the Cuban government has perpetrated on its own citizens, including the courageous Damas de Blanco (Ladies in White), the wives of Cuban dissidents who have stood up to the regime for more than 10 years.
