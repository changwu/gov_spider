    Tax Payment for Domestic Help
Q. Mr. President, are you now going to ask all of your Cabinet Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries whether they have paid Social Security taxes and whether they ever had hired any illegal domestic help?
The President. I've handled that through the White House Legal Counsel. I think Mr. Stephanopoulos has already given a statement about it.
Q. Do you feel confident that everyone will now pay back taxes?
The President. I do. I think everybody will do what they're supposed to do.
Q. Sir, when are you going toâ€”
Bosnia
Q. Sir, when do you expect to have a statement on Bosnia?
The President. We're very close. I don't want to give you a specific time, but we're very close. As you know, we've done an awful lot of work on it. I spent a lot of time on it last week and a considerable amount of time today. So we're quite close.
Q. Do you think this week you might have a diplomatic initiative?
The President. I think we might be prepared to make a statement in the next few days, yes.
