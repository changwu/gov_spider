    Yesterday, Erika Moritsugu, Deputy Assistant to the President and Senior Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI) Liaison, the White House Office of Public Engagement, the White House Gender Policy Council, and the Office of the Vice President convened a meeting with AA and NHPI leaders on reproductive health and rights. Participants discussed the devastating consequences that overturning Roe v. Wade would have on AA and NHPI communities, who overwhelmingly support reproductive rights, which have been guaranteed under Roe v. Wade for nearly 50 years and are integral to equality, opportunity, and self-determination.
Advocates highlighted the importance of using an intersectional approach anchored on ensuring accessibility, language access, and cultural competency; all crucial in reproductive freedom.
Senior Administration officials highlighted the President and Vice President's commitment to supporting reproductive health and rights and the Administration's commitment to including the diverse AA and NHPI communities in conversations on this critical issue and other key priorities.
