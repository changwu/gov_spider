    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Hollings (D) and Thurmond (D) South Carolina)
The President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto S. 2662, if it is presented to him.
The bill would hurt consumers, provoke retaliation against U.S. exports, violate our international obligations, and undermine our efforts to obtain a more open trading system for U.S. exports.
