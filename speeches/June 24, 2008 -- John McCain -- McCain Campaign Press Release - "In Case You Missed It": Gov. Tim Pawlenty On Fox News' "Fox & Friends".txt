Governor Tim Pawlenty: "Well, to be fair, I think John McCain has spoken in the past about off-shore drilling if the states allow it and give permission, which is what he's proposed here now. You have a situation where John McCain's for reducing gas taxes for temporary relief. Barack Obama's against that. John McCain's for nuclear energy. Barack Obama's against that. John McCain is for drilling now to create more supply, and we need it -- look at these gas prices. Barack Obama's against that. John McCain is for not increasing taxes on energy. Barack Obama has been for increasing taxes. So there's big contrast here.
"John McCain sees the need to increase supply. Barack Obama has a sort-of a do nothing or minimalist approach, and that's not going to work. We have a big crisis in this country, and John McCain I think in terms of this offshore drilling issue has said in the past, he would look at it if states were involved, and that's what he's proposed."
