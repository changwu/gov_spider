    Under President Obama, more Americans have lost their jobs than under any president since the Great Depression. President Obama's policies have failed every American who expected their President to focus on the economy and make things better.
"President Obama continues his assault on the free enterprise system with attacks that one of his supporters, Newark Mayor Cory Booker, called 'nauseating' and a former adviser, Steven Rattner, called 'unfair.' Under President Obama, more Americans have lost their jobs than under any president since the Great Depression. President Obama's policies have failed every American who expected their President to focus on the economy and make things better. Americans expected a different kind of politics from Barack Obama but, sadly, this is just more of the same failed politics that dominates Washington. For a vision of a better America, view Mitt Romney's positive action plan for Day One." –Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson."

I would not have backed them out... private equity's not a bad thing. As a matter of fact, private equity is a good thing in many, many instances.'" (Tim Mak, "Ex-Rep.
