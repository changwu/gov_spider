    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee reaffirmed its commitment to winning the Iowa Caucuses by announcing today that former Iowa Secretary of State and former Cedar Rapids Mayor Paul Pate will serve as the campaign's Iowa State Chairman.
Pate will spearhead the campaign's efforts across the state by communicating with other political leaders, building upon the campaign's fundraising network, and increasing support at the grassroots level.
"Mayor Giuliani is honored to have a well-respected Iowan like Paul Pate leading his efforts in the state," said Giuliani's Campaign Manager Michael DuHaime. "Iowa is a critical part of our campaign's strategy and a great showing in the Iowa Caucuses is key to Rudy Giuliani winning the Republican nomination."
"Iowa caucus-goers are looking for a strong leader like Rudy Giuliani. They want a candidate they know can get results on the difficult issues facing our country," said Pate. "We will work hard to share Mayor Giuliani's strong vision for the future and his record of turning around New York City."
Paul Pate is the latest Republican leader in Iowa to endorse Mayor Giuliani, joining former Congressman Jim Nussle, Iowa Senate Minority Leader Mary Lundby, and Iowa State Senator Jeff Angelo.
