    A new television ad released in Iowa today features the story of a father who called on Senator Clinton for help when insurance companies refused to pay for life-saving medical treatment for his son.

The new 30-second spot, entitled "Joe Ward," features a New York constituent whose son desperately needed a bone marrow transplant. A call to Senator Clinton's office would change his son Joel's life. He was notified the day after he called that his son's expenses would be absorbed by his local hospital.
"Now, her opponents are saying that Hillary can't be trusted," said Ward in the ad. "I trusted this woman to save my son's life. And she did."
Following is the script for the ad:
"Joe Ward"
TV :30
WARD: Let me tell you a little story. My son Joel had a terrible illness. He needed a bone marrow transplant that our insurance wouldn't cover and we couldn't afford.
WARD: We called Senator Clinton and asked for help. Her office called the next day letting us know the hospital was going to absorb the cost of the transplant.
WARD: Now, her opponents are saying that Hillary can't be trusted. I trusted this woman to save my son's life. And she did.
CLINTON: I'm Hillary Clinton, and I approved this message.
