    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Goodling (R) PA and 2 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 3248. The Administration will, however, seek amendments in conference to ensure that the Federal consistency requirements of section 4 do not impose unnecessary burdens on other Federal agencies. These amendments will include specifying a definite time period for congressional review of certain Executive reports concerning Federal actions within the Gettysburg Battlefield Historic District.
