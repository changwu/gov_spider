    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 9/8/92)(House)(Collins (D) IL and 3 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 4706, but will work in the Senate to delete a provision providing litigating authority to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. This provision is inconsistent with the well- established policy and practice of centralizing litigating authority in the Attorney General.
Scoring for Purposes of Pay-As-You-Go
H.R. 4706 would decrease receipts. Therefore, the bill is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). The preliminary OMB estimate is that H.R. 4706 would result in a decrease of receipts of less than $100,000 annually. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If H.R. 4706 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published five days after enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effect of all enacted legislation on the pay-as-you-go requirement will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to Congress.
