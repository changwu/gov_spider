    Below is a readout from White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs:
The President last evening had a substantive and wide-ranging telephone discussion with Prime Minister Aso of Japan. The President expressed his deep commitment to the U.S.-Japan Alliance, which serves as the foundation for stability in the region. The President consulted with Prime Minister Aso on the global economic crisis and affirmed the need for close cooperation. The two leaders discussed regional issues, including North Korea, and agreed to work closely through the Six Party Talks process. President Obama said he looked forward to an early meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister.
