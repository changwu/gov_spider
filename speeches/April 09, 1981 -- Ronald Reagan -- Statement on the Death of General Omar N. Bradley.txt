    I join all Americans in mourning the death of General of the Army Omar N. Bradley. For 69 years he wore the colors of an American soldierâ€”with courage, integrity, professionalism, and, above all, honor. Even as he rose in rank, humility never left his side. He was the "GI's General" because he was, always, a GI.
In World War II his conspicuously brilliant leadership thrust him to the top of the U.S. military command. Whether at Normandy, North Africa, or Sicily, the Bradley command always meant good fortune for freedom's defenders.
General Bradley's memory will be revered by his countrymen. He left to us exemplary qualities that long will be the standard of every soldier who takes the solemn pledge to defend this Nation.
Nancy and I were honored to have Omar Bradley as our friend, and honored that one of his last public appearances was at my Inauguration. Both of us extend to General Bradley's family our deepest sympathies.
