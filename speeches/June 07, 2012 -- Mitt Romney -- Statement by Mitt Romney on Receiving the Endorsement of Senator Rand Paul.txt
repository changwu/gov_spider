    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on receiving the endorsement of Sen. Rand Paul:
"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of Rand Paul. Senator Paul has been a leading voice in the effort to scale back the size and reach of government and promote liberty. Over the past three and a half years, President Obama has made government more and more of a presence in our lives, and Americans can't afford four more years of the same failed policies. As President, I will reform the federal government and make it smaller, simpler, and smarter. I am grateful for Senator Paul's support and look forward to working with him to get America back on the right track."
