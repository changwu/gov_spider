    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Doolittle (R) CA)
The Administration opposes H.R. 1743 because the bill would authorize appropriations for the State Water Resources Research Institutes program. The Administration seeks to terminate Federal funding for grant programs, such as the Institutes program, that are not inherently Federal responsibilities. The Administration did not request FY 1996 appropriations for the program and does not support continued Federal subsidies for it.
