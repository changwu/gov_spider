Pool report #3 / POTUS arrival at Mt. Vernon 
Marine One touched down on a patch of land in front of Mt. Vernon at 5:44 p.m., kicking up plenty of dirt and leaves on this wintry night.
POTUS came down first, saluted and then turned to help FLOTUS climb down the stairs. They then boarded a golf cart and were led to the Ford Orientation Center by a golf cart motorcade.
The event is closed press.
The pool was too far away to hear - or ask - anything.

Pool report #5 / POTUS departure 
POTUS and FLOTUS boarded Marine One slightly ahead of schedule, at 6:59. They arrived at the helicopter by golf car motorcade, boarded and then departed promptly thereafter, at 7:03.
Night has fallen and the area from where we watched the departure was poorly lit. But from what I could see, the First Lady boarded Marine One first, followed by the President. They wore dark coats but it was far too dark to make out anything more specific.
Per the WH, the President’s remarks at the National Governors Association’s Black Tie Dinner began at 6:36 PM and ended at 6:50 PM.He did not eat dinner while at the event.

Pool report #6 - lid 
The White House called a travel/photo lid at 7:21.
The pool vans are still en route to the White House from Mt. Vernon, but, given the lid, that’s all from me.
Have a good night!

In-Town (Supplemental) WH Pool Report #1: Gathering
Hi everyone. I’ll be your supplemental pooler for the President and First Lady’s departure from and arrival back to the White House this evening. The in-town pool is on location in Mt. Vernon, while the supplemental pool is gathered on the plot of pavement outside the Palm Room doors ahead of Marine One’s scheduled 5:20 PM departure. At 6:00 PM, POTUS and FLOTUS are scheduled to attend the National Governors Association’s Black Tie Dinner, which is closed press. They are scheduled to arrive back at the WH at 7:35 PM.

In-Town (Supplemental) WH Pool Report #2: Marine One departure
POTUS and FLOTUS emerged, holding hands, from the Residence at 5:28 PM, their black tie garments peeking out from underneath their overcoats (including what appeared to be Dior sling-backs for FLOTUS — super cute, in your supplemental pooler’s opinion). POTUS gave subtle indications that he heard shouted questions about the Supreme Court and Donald Trump, but ultimately ignored any temptation to respond as he made his way across the South Lawn. Marine One took off at 5:33 PM.
Traveling on Marine One, per the WH:
Anthony Bernal, Assistant to the President & Advisor to the First LadyAnnie Tomasini, Assistant to the President & Director of Oval Office OperationsJeff Nussbaum, Special Assistant to the President & Senior Presidential SpeechwriterStephen Goepfert, Special Assistant to the President & Personal Aide to the President

WH Pool Report #4: POTUS-FLOTUS arrival / lid
Marine One’s cabin was illuminated as it hovered above the South Lawn in the dark, and passengers dressed in black tie could be seen through the windows. Touchdown was 7:15 PM. POTUS exited first, at 7:17 PM, holding his coat draped over his left arm. FLOTUS exited just behind him. As they crossed the South Lawn together, they waved several times in the direction of the assembled press, but did not stop for questions. They entered the Residence at 7:18 PM.
A lid was called at 7:21 PM.
That’s all, folks!
