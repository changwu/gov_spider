White House pool report #1 - Checking in/No News
Good morning from the White House.
President Trump has no public events on his schedule but pooler will inform you if anything changes.
Some color for your morning: It's quiet in downtown D.C. with streets around the White House complex closed off ahead of inauguration. Pooler saw extra fencing being unloaded at 17th and Pennsylvania as she headed into the complex this morning.
As for the West Wing, the framed photographs that were on the wall outside of upper press have been taken down, leaving just the hooks behind. There are moving crates in lower and upper press.
Just wanted to check in so you know who today's pooler is. Please reach out with any questions.
The pool was COVID tested this morning.

WH pool report #3 - My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell sighting
My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell was spotted outside the West Wing at 3 pm. He was on his cell phone at one point as he waited outside. The Marine let him inside at 3:05 pm.
Lindell declined to come sticks to answer questions when reporters asked him to come answer questions.
"I'm sure you'll write something nice," he said.
The Marine was not outside the West Wing when pooler went on a walkabout at 2:45 p.m. but was there at 3 p.m. when word of Lindell sighting spread among the press room and reporters rushed outside.
