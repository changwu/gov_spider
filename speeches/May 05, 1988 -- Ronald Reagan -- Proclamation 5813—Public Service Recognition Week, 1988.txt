  A Proclamation

Government employees, with their commitment to excellence and diversity of skills, contribute significantly to the leadership of the United States in the world. These dedicated men and women are a valuable national resource, serving in the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches at all levels of government, and dealing with nearly every aspect of national life.
Government employees provide such a broad range of services that few citizens remain unaffected by their work. They defend our Nation, enforce the laws, help protect the environment, maintain vital transportation systems, work to prevent the entry and abuse of illegal drugs, administer the Social Security system, conduct health research, help parents teach their children, and perform countless other vital tasks for society. These public servants have also helped develop innovative technologies to show the way in the critical fields of defense, health care, agriculture, and industry.
In recognition of the indispensable contributions made by government employees, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 242, has designated the period commencing May 2, 1988, and ending May 8, 1988, as "Public Service Recognition Week" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for observance of this week.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of May 2, 1988, through May 8, 1988, as Public Service Recognition Week. I urge the people of the United States and all levels of government to participate in appropriate ceremonies to recognize the vital role of government employees.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightyeight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twelfth.

RONALD REAGAN
