    TALLAHASSEE, FL -- The McCain-Palin presidential campaign today announced its Georgia Lawyers for McCain coalition.
Lawyers, as professionals and community leaders, will play a critical role in this presidential election. This coalition of successful and accomplished Georgia attorneys will be essential in a variety of areas, including conducting legal research in support of the McCain legal department and providing expertise on specific legal policy matters. Georgia Lawyers for McCain-Palin will also play a critical role in assisting with November election day operations.
"The next president will likely have an opportunity to nominate hundreds of federal court judges, and perhaps two Supreme Court Justices," said Doug Chalmers, Georgia Lawyers for McCain State Chair and Georgia Chairman of the Republican National Lawyers Association. "Of the two candidates for president, only John McCain can be counted on to nominate individuals who will faithfully interpret the Constitution, rather than legislating from the bench."
Chalmers added, "As evidenced by the list announced today, the McCain-Palin ticket has widespread and enthusiastic support in the Georgia legal community. We recognize true leadership and character when we see it, and we are proud to assist in this noble effort at a critical time in our country's history."
