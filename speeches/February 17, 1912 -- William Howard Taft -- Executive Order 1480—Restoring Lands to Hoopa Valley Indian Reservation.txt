    Under authority of the act of Congress of June 4, 1897 (30 Stat., 11 at 34 and 36), and upon recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture, it is hereby ordered that on and after March 1, 1912, the boundaries of the Trinity National Forest, Cal., as proclaimed March 2, 1909, and modified by subsequent proclamation of December 16, 1910, be further modified by excluding therefrom all that part of the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation included in the said Trinity National Forest by said proclamation of March 2, 1909.
The purpose of this exclusion is to restore the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation in all respects to the status existing prior to the said proclamation of March 2, 1909, as though the inclusion of the lands within the Trinity National Forest had not been ordered, and said Indian reservation is hereby fully recreated and restored to that status.
