    TUCSON, Ariz. â€“ With instability in the world putting a focus on foreign policy, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign on Saturday said his record shows that he has the judgement and experience to make foreign policy decisions in the best interests of the United States and our allies.
In a speech on the floor of the House of Representatives on Oct. 9, 2002, Sanders detailed why he vigorously opposed the American invasion of Iraq and the military action which destabilized the region and is now considered one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the history of the United States.
In his speech, Sanders highlighted five major reasons he opposed the war in Iraq.
First, he said it could lead to the loss of lives of large numbers of American military personnel and Iraqi civilians.
Second, he said a unilateral invasion of Iraq would set a terrible precedent in terms of undermining international law and allowing other governments to do the same.
Third, he worried that the war in Iraq would jeopardize the effectiveness of the war on al-Qaida and international terrorism.
Fourth, he worried that the war in Iraq would be extremely expensive.
Fifth and finally, he worried about the unintended consequences of the war and who would govern Iraq after Saddam Hussein was overthrown and what role the United States would play in the civil war that followed.
