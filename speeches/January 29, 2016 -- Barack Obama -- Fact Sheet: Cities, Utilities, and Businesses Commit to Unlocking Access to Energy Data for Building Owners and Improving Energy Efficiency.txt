    Local Government, private sector, and utility actions spur access to energy data and accelerate energy efficiency investment & innovation in buildings and homes
Making businesses and homes more energy efficient is a win for jobs and economic growth, operating costs and bottom lines, and the President's commitment to reduce carbon emissions and fight climate change. That is why, today, as part of the President's Better Buildings Program, the Administration is announcing:
•      18 utilities, serving more than 2.6 million commercial customers, will provide access to energy data building owners by 2017, the first step to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings;
•      30 cities and states and 21 organizations from across the country are committing to take new actions to make it easier to identify ways to cut energy waste by making energy data available to building owners,
•      24 cities, states, and businesses are committing to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings 20 percent by 2020; and
•      Seven cities and states from across the country are committing to install more efficient outdoor lighting.
The actions announced today build on commitments made by 285 organizations representing nearly 4 billion square feet since the Administration launched the President's Better Building program in 2011. The program's mission is to partner with the Energy Department to improve energy efficiency 20 percent by 2020, and share successful strategies that maximize efficiency deployment over the next decade. These new commitments from cities, school districts, and businesses like Nike and Wendy's will help cut waste in our buildings, saving energy and money and reducing pollution.
Today's commitments complement the Supreme Court's decision earlier this week on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's authority to enable consumers to get paid for cutting energy demand when prices are high. This decision allows us to continue realizing billions of dollars in annual savings from demand response measures that help ensure the reliability of our electricity system as we integrate more energy efficiency and renewable energy onto the power grid.
PROVIDING ENERGY DATA SOLUTIONS 
Unlocking Utility Energy Data: Through the Better Buildings Energy Data Accelerator (EDA), 18 utilities, serving more than 2.6 million commercial customers and working within their communities, are announcing they will provide whole-building energy data access to building owners by 2017 – significantly expanding building energy benchmarking, the first step many building owners take to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings.
"Better Buildings Accelerator partners demonstrate how powerful a public-private partnership dedicated to solving a specific problem can be," said U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz. "Bringing energy efficiency to scale is a national priority. We applaud the dedication of our partners to come up with innovative solutions that advance our nation's ability to reduce carbon emissions, and spur economic savings in our businesses and communities."
The city-utility partnerships have been successful in overcoming informational barriers to energy efficiency through the development of best-practice approaches that enable building owners to access whole-building energy data as part of the Energy Data Accelerator. The partners are:

As a cornerstone of the President's Climate Action Plan, the Better Buildings Initiative is aimed at achieving the goal of doubling American energy productivity by 2030 while motivating corporate and public-sector leaders across the country to save energy through voluntary commitments. This means saving hundreds of billions of dollars on energy bills, reducing GHG emissions, and creating thousands of jobs. Through Better Buildings, public and private sector organizations across the country are working together to share and replicate positive gains in energy efficiency.
