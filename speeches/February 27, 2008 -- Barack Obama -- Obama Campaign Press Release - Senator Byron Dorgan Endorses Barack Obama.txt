    Chicago, IL - Today, United States Senator Byron Dorgan endorsed Barack Obama, citing his longstanding commitment to American workers and to enforcing our trade agreements, his plan to invest in American jobs, and his ability to win in typically "red states" like North Dakota.
Senator Dorgan said, "Senator Obama has the ability to inspire and motivate the American people to move our country in a new direction. He can attract support in what have been traditional red states in Presidential elections, proven in part by his decisive win in the North Dakota Caucus with 62% of the vote.
"Senator Obama has also shown a strong commitment to reversing the disastrous trade policies of the past years and moving forward with a progressive agenda that puts American workers first. He has proven his commitment through a lifetime of fighting for for American families - from his time as a community organizer in Chicago to his work in the United States Senate.
"The strong, positive response to Senator Obama's campaign is an affirmation by the American people that this election must be about the future. He is calling on the best in all of us to work together to put America back on track toward a better and brighter future, and I'm happy to endorse him for president."
Senator Obama said, "Senator Dorgan has been a champion for the rights of American workers for decades in Congress, and I'm honored to have his support. I look forward to fighting by his side to increase the minimum wage, invest in American jobs, and make sure our trade deals serve workers' interests, not special interests. Together we will change our country and put American workers first."
