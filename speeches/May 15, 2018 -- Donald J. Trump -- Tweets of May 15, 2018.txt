Can you believe that with all of the made up unsourced stories I get from the Fake News Media together with the $10000000 Russian Witch Hunt (there is no Collusion) I now have my best Poll Numbers in a year. Much of the Media may be corrupt but the People truly get it!Retweets: 32019Favorites: 140443

Today is one of the most important and solemn occasions of the year ' the day we pay tribute to the Law Enforcement Heroes who gave their lives in the line of duty.
