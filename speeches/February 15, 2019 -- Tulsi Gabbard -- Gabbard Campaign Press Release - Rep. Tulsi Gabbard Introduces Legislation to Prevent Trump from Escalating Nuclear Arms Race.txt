    Washington, DC—Tulsi Gabbard held a press conference on Capitol Hill to urge support for the INF Treaty Compliance Act (H.R. 1249), which would prevent the United States from sparking an arms race between the United States and Russia, escalating the new Cold War. The legislation prohibits the use of any taxpayer dollars for weapons that violate the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty—despite President Trump's planned withdrawal.
The legislation is co-sponsored by Reps. McGovern, Omar, and Pocan, and is supported by Win Without War, Union of Concerned Scientists, Ploughshares Fund, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Nuclear Watch New Mexico, Beyond the Bomb, Global Zero, and NuclearWakeUpCall. 
In her statement, Tulsi Gabbard said, "The risk of nuclear catastrophe is greater than ever before, and Trump's decision to pull out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty heightens the danger of a nuclear holocaust. It will spark a new nuclear arms race, undermine our national security, and divert precious resources away from the domestic programs to serve our people and communities. 
"This INF Treaty Compliance Act (H.R. 1249) will ensure our country remains compliant with the INF Treaty and prevent a single taxpayer dollar from being used for weapons that would breach the treaty. This is one step Congress can and must take now toward national security and peace."
