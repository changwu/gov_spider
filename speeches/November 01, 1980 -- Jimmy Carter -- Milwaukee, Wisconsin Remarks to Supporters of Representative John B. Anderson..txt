    THE PRESIDENT. Let me say, first of all, how thankful I am to you for having come out here tonight on this meeting just a few hours before we have the election. I'm sure when John Anderson comes somewhere to speak, the Carter support. ers let him talk. Thank you very much. You support a good man. I'm sure he'd want me to speak.
First of all, let me say that we've only got a few hours now before the American people go to the polls to make a major decision. I'm going to be speaking inside to the crowd, and you can hear my voice. When I come back out, I'd like to have a chance to shake hands with a few of you that I could reach.
But the point is that I'll make all the decisions as President, in the Oval Office, with your help. Between now and November the 4th, next Tuesday, the decisions will be in your hands. And I'd like for you to think about the consequences to you and your family, to those that you love, if we wake up Wednesday morning and find that a Republican, Ronald Reagan, will be President for the next 4 years.
AUDIENCE. No!
THE PRESIDENT. And that could happen, because it is so close a contest throughout the Nation.
In 1948, as you know, just a few votes less would have meant that Harry Truman would never have been our President. And in 1960 if only 28,000 people in Texas and a few thousand in Illinois had voted differently, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson would never have led this country. And in 1968 if just a few more Democrats the last few hours had done their work, we would have had a great President named Hubert Humphrey, and Richard Nixon would never have served in the Oval Office. That's what a few voters can mean in this country.
So, I'll be speaking inside about some issues that are important to you. When I come out, if you're still here, I'd like to shake your hand and thank you for the help you're going to give me between now and next Tuesday.
Thank you. God bless you all.
