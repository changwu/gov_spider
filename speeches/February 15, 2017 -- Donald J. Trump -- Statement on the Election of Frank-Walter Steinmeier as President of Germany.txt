    The United States congratulates Frank-Walter Steinmeier on his February 12 election to serve as Germany's next Federal President. We wish him great success in his new capacity and thank him for his leadership in his prior service, including as Foreign Minister. Germany is one of our closest allies. We look forward to working with President-elect Steinmeier to further strengthen the cooperation between our two countries.
