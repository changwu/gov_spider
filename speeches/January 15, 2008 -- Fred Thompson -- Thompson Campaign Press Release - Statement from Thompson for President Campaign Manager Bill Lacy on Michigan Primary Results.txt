    McLean, VA - Thompson for President Campaign Manager Bill Lacy released the following statement on the results of the Michigan Primary:
"Tonight's results in Michigan make two things clear: First, the Republican campaign for President remains wide-open. Our party faithful are still looking for someone who meets all the qualifications they seek: A true consistent conservative with the experience to keep the country safe. Second, Mike Huckabee's campaign to be John McCain's Vice President has hit a snag. He has gone from the mid-thirties in Iowa to 11% in New Hampshire and now about 15% in Michigan.
"On higher taxes and looser immigration, Huckabee has been done his best these past few weeks to mimic McCain. But this is nothing new. In fact, while John McCai n was leading the Senate charge to grant amnesty for illegal immigrants, Mike Huckabee was one of the loudest cheerleaders. And at the same time McCain was voting against the Bush tax cuts, Huckabee was in Arkansas increasing taxes some 21 times.
"As for Mitt Romney, he has been all over the map on virtually every issue important to conservative voters.
"As the contest moves to South Carolina, look for Romney, McCain and Huckabee to face serious questions about their commitment to consistent conservative principles. Their records are in stark contrast to Fred Thompson, who remains the one true steadfast conservative in this race.
"The bottom line is that tonight is a whole new ball game and tomorrow morning begins a brand new campaign where Republicans are looking for the clear conservative choice."
