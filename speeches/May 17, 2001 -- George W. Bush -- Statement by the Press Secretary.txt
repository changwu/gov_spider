    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of South Dakota and ordered Federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe winter storms, flooding, and ice jams on March 1, 2001, through April 30, 2001.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to local governments in an 11 county area. The counties include Beadle, Brookings, Clark, Codington, Grant, Hamlin, Kingsbury, Mellette, Roberts, Sanborn, and Spink.
Federal funding is available to eligible local governments on a cost-sharing basis for the repair or replacement of public facilities damaged by the severe winter storms, flooding, and ice jams. Federal funding is also available on a cost share basis for hazard mitigation measures.
Joe M. Allbaugh, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), named Gracia Szczech as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The Agency said that damage surveys are continuing in other areas, and additional assistance and counties may be added after the assessments are completed.
