    The Rudy Giuliani Exploratory Committee today announced that former NHGOP Chairman Wayne Semprini will serve as Mayor Giuliani's New Hampshire Chair. Semprini is a life-long New Hampshire native who has been involved in Granite State politics since 1972. As New Hampshire Chair, Semprini will lead exploratory efforts on the ground and help build an organization.
"Mayor Giuliani is honored to have a Republican leader and hard-working entrepreneur like Wayne Semprini join our team," Giuliani Exploratory Committee Executive Director Mike DuHaime said. "He brings experience, institutional knowledge and a positive, hopeful vision for our Party's future that will be critical to Mayor Giuliani's exploratory efforts in New Hampshire."
Chairman Semprini stated, "Mayor Giuliani is the experienced leader the Republican Party and our country needs to move forward. His message of hope and optimism and record of results resonates with Republicans across New Hampshire."
Semprini is just the latest Granite Stater to sign on board Team Rudy. Recently longtime Republican activists David Tille and Chris Wood joined the Exploratory Committee to serve as Giuliani's New Hampshire political director and coalitions director, respectively.
