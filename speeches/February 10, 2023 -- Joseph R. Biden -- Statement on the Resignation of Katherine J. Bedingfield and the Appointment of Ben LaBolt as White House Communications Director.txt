    Since my time as Vice President, Kate has been a loyal and trusted adviser, through thick and thin. She was a critical strategic voice from the very first day of my Presidential campaign in 2019 and has been a key part of advancing my agenda in the White House. The country is better off as a result of her hard work, and I'm so grateful to her—and to her husband and two young children—for giving so much.
Ben has big shoes to fill. I look forward to welcoming him back as a first-rate communicator who's shown his commitment to public service again and again and who has a cutting-edge understanding of how Americans consume information. I saw him fight for Justice Jackson, and he put his all into helping us make history confirming our cabinet and subcabinet nominees. I'm proud to have him rejoin this team.
