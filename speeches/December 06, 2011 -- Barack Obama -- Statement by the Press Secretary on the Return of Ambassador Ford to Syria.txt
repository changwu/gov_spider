    Ambassador Robert Ford returns to Damascus today with our full confidence and support. His return demonstrates our continued solidarity with the Syrian people and the value we place on Ford's efforts to engage Syrians on their efforts to achieve a peaceful and democratic transition. We believe his presence in the country is among the most effective ways to send a message to the Syrian people that the United States stands in solidarity with them. We expect the Syrian government to uphold its obligations to protect diplomatic personnel and facilities under the Vienna Convention and allow our Foreign Service officers to conduct their work free of intimidation or obstacles.
