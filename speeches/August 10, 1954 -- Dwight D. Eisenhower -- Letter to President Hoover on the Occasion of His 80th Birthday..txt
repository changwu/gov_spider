Dear Mr. President:
As you celebrate your eightieth birthday this August tenth, I look anew, and with ever increasing admiration, upon your distinguished career. Few men in our country's history have been privileged to serve the nation in so many important capacities as have you, and certainly none has done so with greater brilliance and devotion.
To me it is also remarkable that after so many years given to the public service, you still cheerfully accept new assignments involving governmental responsibilities of the most burdensome character. To justify my own part in asking you to assume some of these additional duties, I merely point out that by virtue of your long experience, wise understanding and eminent position, you are qualified, as almost no other American, to discharge them successfully. Your Party and your country are proud of you; Americans know that you have ever used your great talents in the interests of all.
I wish I could be present to join in the ceremony to honor you, but I know that what I have just stated, and what all of us as Americans feel in our hearts, will be far more eloquently expressed by others present than I could hope to do. May you have many more years of happiness and health, and may we continue to have the benefit of your counsel and judgment.
With warm personal regard,
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
