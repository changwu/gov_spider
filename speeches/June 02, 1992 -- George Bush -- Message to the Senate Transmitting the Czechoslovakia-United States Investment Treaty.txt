    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment, with Protocol and three related exchanges of letters, signed at Washington on October 22, 1991. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to this treaty.
The treaty is an integral part of my initiative to strengthen economic relations with Central and East European countries. The treaty is designed to aid the growth of the private sector in the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic by protecting and thereby encouraging U.S. private investment. The treaty is fully consistent with U.S. policy toward international investment. A specific tenet, reflected in this treaty, is that U.S. investment abroad and foreign investment in the United States should receive fair, equitable, and nondiscriminatory treatment. Under this treaty, the Parties also agree to international law standards for expropriation and compensation; free transfers of funds associated with investments; and the option of the investor to resolve disputes with the host government through international arbitration.
I recommend that the Senate consider this treaty as soon as possible, and give its advice and consent to ratification of the treaty, with protocol and related exchanges of letters, at an early date.
