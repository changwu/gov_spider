In-town pool #12 — fuller quotes on Hurricanes 
"So you think we can have a slightly enhanced hurricane season? That's just what we want, that's just what we want," Mr. Trump said to FEMA officials.
"Are we ready?" Trump asked FEMA chief Pete Gaynor.
"FEMA is always, ready sir," Mr. Gaynor said.
Gaynor said his agency is already facing a "historic" disaster season between COVID-19, tornadoes and flooding
He says they typically start hurricane season with $40B in disaster-relief funding; today they have just shy of $80B
"That's the result of Congress appropriating nearly $40 billion for COVID-19, so we're in a really great place when it comes to funding, personnel and supplies," Mr. Gaynor said.

In-town pool #17 (last one should be #16) — Fuller quotes on EO 
as always, check against video or transcript:
>From Trump:
"We're here today to defend free speech from one of the greatest dangers it has faced in American history, frankly, and you know what's going on as well as anybody. It's not good," Trump said.
"A small handful of powerful social media monopolies controls a vast portion of all public and private communication in the United States and we know what they are, we don't have to name them, we're going to give you a complete listing."
"They've had unchecked power to censure, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences," Mr. Trump said.
"There's no precedent in American history for so small a number of corporations to control so large a sphere of human interaction."
"We can't let this continue to happen, it's very, very unfair and you look at the statistics and you look at what is going on and I think everybody would very much agree with that. Including Democrats, by the way. I saw quite a few Democrats are saying this is about time something is done, so let's see if they keep that decision after they hear that we agree with them."
Says Twitter is making "editorial decisions."
"They're editorial decisions. In those moments, Twitter ceases to be a neutral public platform, they become an editor with a viewpoint. I think we can say that about others also, whether you're looking at Google, whether you're looking at Facebook and perhaps others."
"Imagine if your phone company silenced or edited your conversations. Social media companies have vastly more power and more reach than any phone company in the United States."

In-town pool #18 — Text of EO coming "ASAP," more quotes on what EO does 
The White House Press Office says it will release the EO ASAP.
You can find full event here: https://www.c-span.org/video/?472574-1/president-trump-sisgn-social-medi...
(More quotes, and bullet points with quotes on what EO does)
"Currently, social media giants like Twitter receive an unprecedented liability shield based on the theory that they're a neutral platform, which they're not."
• "My executive order calls for new regulations under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to make it that social media companies that engage in censoring or any political conduct will not be able to keep their liability shield, that's a big deal.""They have a shield, they're not gonna have a shield."
• He says order instructs Federal Trade Commission to prohibit social media companies from engaging in "any deceptive acts or practices affected Commerce"
• Directing AG Barr to work "cooperatively with the states" to "enforce their own laws against such deceptive business practices"
"The states have broad and powerful authority to regulate in this arena and they'll be doing it also. We encourage them to do it if they see exactly as we've been seeing. What they're doing is tantamount to monopoly you could say, it's tantamount to taking over the airwaves. Can't let it happen, otherwise we're not going to have a democracy. We're not going to have anything to do with a republic."
• Directs administration to develop policies and procedures to ensure "taxpayer dollars are not going to any social media companies that suppress free speech""They're rich enough," he said.
Trump says many people wanted this for a long time:"And now we're doing it, and I'm sure they'll be doing a lawsuit and I'm also sure that we're going for legislation in addition to this. And the legislation will start immediately. I've been called by Democrats who want to do this."
On Twitter account, whether he would delete it:"If we had fair press in this country, I would do this in a heartbeat. There's nothing I'd rather do than get rid of my whole Twitter account. But I'm able to get to I guess 186 million people when you add up all the different accounts, and add Facebook and Instagram."

In-town pool #21 — Hurricane briefing readout 
>From WH:Today, President Donald J. Trump was briefed on proactive preparations taken by his Administration ahead of the 2020 hurricane season. Officials shared that an active season is expected in the Atlantic Ocean and a below average season in the Pacific Ocean. President Trump was updated on the Administration's strategy to safely, effectively, and expeditiously serve Americans this hurricane season through locally executed, State managed, and federally supported emergency response adapted to support the public health guidelines established to address the coronavirus pandemic.
Specifically, the United States Government continues to encourage unprecedented planning and outreach across all levels of government and the private sector to help prepare for and respond to a potentially difficult hurricane season while taking special precautions to address the threat posed by the coronavirus before, during, and in the aftermath of a storm. To confront this threat, the Administration has fully stocked distribution centers with more emergency supplies than in any other year in history and has increased urban search and rescue capabilities and staffing in 22 states. Additionally, FEMA has updated its approach to incident management by formalizing the prioritization of restoring community lifelines after disasters to ensure communities are reopened as quickly as possible.
President Trump was joined in the briefing by First Lady Melania Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Pete Gaynor, Acting National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Director Dr. Neil Jacobs, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, Deputy Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Resilience Dr. Julia Nesheiwat, and other senior staff.
