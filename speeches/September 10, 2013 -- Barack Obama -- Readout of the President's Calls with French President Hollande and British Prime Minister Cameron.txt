    This morning, the President spoke separately with French President Hollande and British Prime Minister Cameron. They agreed to work closely together, and in consultation with Russia and China, to explore seriously the viability of the Russian proposal to put all Syrian chemical weapons and related materials fully under international control in order to ensure their verifiable and enforceable destruction. These efforts will begin today at the United Nations, and will include a discussion on elements of a potential UN Security Council Resolution. The leaders discussed their preference for a diplomatic resolution but stressed the importance of continuing to develop a full range of responses by the international community to the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons near Damascus on August 21. France and the United Kingdom are valued allies of the United States, and the three countries will continue to consult closely in the coming days.
