    The President called King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud of Saudi Arabia today to discuss the political framework reached between the P5+1, the EU, and Iran on a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action regarding Iran's nuclear program. The President reiterated that the months ahead will be used to finalize the technical details for a lasting, comprehensive solution that effectively cuts off all of Iran's pathways to a bomb and verifiably ensures the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program. He emphasized that the nuclear understanding between the P5+1 and Iran will not in any way lessen U.S. concern about Iran's destabilizing activities in the region. The leaders agreed to increase consultations and remain vigilant in countering this threat. As part of this effort, the President invited the King and Gulf Cooperation Council leaders to Camp David this spring to continue consultations. The President and King Salman reaffirmed the enduring friendship between the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
