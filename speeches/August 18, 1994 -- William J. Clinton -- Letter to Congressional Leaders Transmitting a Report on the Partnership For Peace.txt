    Dear Mr. Chairman:
In accordance with section 514(a) of Public Law 103-236 (22 U.S.C. 1928 note), I am submitting to you this report on implementation of the Partnership for Peace initiative.
The adoption of the Partnership for Peace initiative at the NATO Summit last January marked an historic milestone in the relationship between NATO and the nations of Europe recently emerged from decades of communist domination. The reaction of the new democracies to NATO's opening to the East has been energetic. In the 6 months since the Summit, 22 countries, including Russia, have joined the Partnership. In their enthusiastic response to NATO's invitation, these countries have undertaken to respect existing borders and to settle disputes by peaceful means. Moreover, they will engage in practical cooperation with the armed forces of NATO countries and continue to absorb our culture of democracy, individual freedom, and the rule of law. As the attached report indicates, the Partnership established offices in Brussels and Mons, and a full program of military exercises this fall will serve to demonstrate NATO's commitment to immediate implementation of the Partnership initiative. The first Partnership exercises are scheduled for this September, with Poland the first former Warsaw Pact nation to host an exercise on its territory.
The end of the Cold War presented the United States and our allies with a tremendous opportunity to establish real security in Europe. Through the Partnership, the United States can work toward NATO's expansion to democracies in the East. The Partnership for Peace provides a dynamic instrument for transforming former adversaries into lasting partners and for consolidating, strengthening, and extending peace for generations to come.
Sincerely,
BILL CLINTON
