VP Pool Report #2
Education Secretary Miguel Cardona was sworn-in by Vice-president Kamala Harris in the ceremonial office at 6.12 pm.Mr Cardona was accompanied by his wife, Marissa, and his two children.
Following much laughter emanating from the holding area, the group entered the room and the VP administered the oath, while Secretary Cardona's wife held a family bible.
"Congratulations!" the VP said, leading applause. "Congratulations to your whole family... and to your parents..." she added, gesturing towards chief of staff Sheila Nix who was holding a cell-phone. Mr Cardona's parents were watching virtually. The Secretary smiled, waved and gave a thumbs-up gesture before all left the room.
