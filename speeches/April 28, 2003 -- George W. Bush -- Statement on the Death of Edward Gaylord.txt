    Edward Gaylord was a shining example of generosity, patriotism, and dedication to helping others. As a business leader with a distinguished career in journalism, he spent a lifetime in selfless service to his community and State. I was honored to have Ed as a partner in the Texas Rangers Baseball Club. He was an excellent partner and a fine man. Laura joins me in extending our heartfelt condolences to Ed's family and friends.
