    BURLINGTON, Vt. â€“ Four new television ads from the Sanders campaign will hit airwaves in Iowa and New Hampshire starting tomorrow. The spots focus on Sanders' plans to end policies that leave American families working longer hours for lower wages.
"What this campaign is about is to demand that we create an economy that works for all of us rather than a handful of billionaires," Sanders says in an ad titled "Working Families."
In a second spot, Sanders tells a crowd about his fight in the Senate to stop Social Security cuts. "We said it will be over our dead bodies if you cut Social Security. As president, I will do everything I can to extend the solvency of Social Security and expand benefits for people who desperately need them," Sanders promises in the ad titled "Social Security."
"Bernie Sanders understands how pharmaceutical companies and major medical companies are ripping us off," Mari Cordes, a registered nurse from Lincoln, Vermont, says in an ad on the cost of health care. "He's the only one who can bring real change."
"The 15 richest Americans acquired more wealth in two years than the bottom 100 million people combined," Sanders says into the camera before laying out his plan to make the wealthy pay their fair share and bring prosperity to working Americans in a fourth ad titled "Bottom 100 Million."
The new ads come on the heels of Sanders' two millionth contribution and a 12-point pickup in the latest CNN/ORC national poll, including growing support among what the pollster refers to as non-white voters. The latest The Economist/YouGov poll shows Sanders gaining significant ground. Sanders is currently campaigning in Nevada where more than 2,000 people turned out to see him speak just two days after Christmas.
