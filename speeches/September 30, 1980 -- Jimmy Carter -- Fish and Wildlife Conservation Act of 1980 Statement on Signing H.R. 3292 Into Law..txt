    I have signed H.R. 3292, the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1980.
For over 50 years, in what has been one of the most successful and harmonious relationships in our Federal system, Federal and State agencies have labored together to conserve the fish and wildlife resources of our Nation. However, as I stated in my 1977 environmental message to Congress, almost always our activities have been focused on species that are harvested by hunters and fishermen. Usually, it is only when a species is threatened with extinction that we take note of the nongame species of wildlifeâ€”and then it is often too late.
This legislation will benefit the vast majority of species which have too often been neglected, and, quite wisely, the legislation establishes a system within the existing framework of Federal-State relations. H.R. 3292 sets up a Federal-State planning process to inventory nongame wildlife species, identify their habitats, determine problems affecting their survival, and develop priorities for protecting them, if necessary. The Federal Government will assist them financially and technically to achieve this objective. This program will not diminish the support we give to game species, but it will encourage the comprehensive planning we need to conserve the full spectrum of our Nation's wildlife.
I wish to congratulate the Members of Congress, the conservation organizations, and the State fish and game agencies, who have worked for the passage of this bill. I salute their determination, and I am proud to be able to sign this bill into law.
