    WASHINGTON â€“ Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement today on the anniversary of the Montgomery Bus Boycott:
"By sitting down at the front of the bus, Rosa Parks inspired a whole nation to demand change. The Montgomery Bus Boycott led to the marches, sit-ins and protests which brought our nation closer to fulfilling the promise of equality. As we fight today for a fair justice system and opportunity for every family in America, let's remember the power we have when we stand together."
