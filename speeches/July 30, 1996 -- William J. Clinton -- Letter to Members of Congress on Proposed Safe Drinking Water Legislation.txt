    Dear __________:
I urge the Congress to pass strong legislation that protects our nation's drinking water. Although the conferees have made considerable progress, it is imperative that I sign this legislation into law by August 1. If the House and Senate fail to act, $725 million in federal funding will cease to be available for this important health and safety initiative.
All Americans have the right to know that their drinking water is safe. This legislation should solidify that right by strengthening health and safety standards in addition to protecting the public from significant threats to our drinking water. It is critical that the Congress approve legislation that provides both a reasonable framework to improve our nation's water supply in addition to the funding and flexibility necessary for communities to make these improvements a reality.
A compromise bill containing these priorities is clearly within reach. I hope that we seize this opportunity and pass this important piece of legislation.
Sincerely,
BILL
