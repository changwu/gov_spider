    I congratulate the Libyan people on the conclusion of the elections for a new Council of Representatives, a milestone in their courageous efforts to transition from four decades of dictatorship toward a full democracy. While yesterday's vote demonstrates the power of individual Libyans in determining their future, we recognize that elections are just one step in Libya's broader democratic transition. Libya's new Government must now focus on building consensus to address the challenges of establishing security, providing effective public services, and ensuring an inclusive political process. The United States calls on all parties to renounce violence and resolve differences through political dialogue and participation in the democratic process. The United States was proud to support the Libyan people in the darkest days of their revolution and through their efforts to end the Qadhafi regime, and we remain committed to supporting the Libyan people as they work to lay the foundations of a democratic society during this challenging yet historic time.
