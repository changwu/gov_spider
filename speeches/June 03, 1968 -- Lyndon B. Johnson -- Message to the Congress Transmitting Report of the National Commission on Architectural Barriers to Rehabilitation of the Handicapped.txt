    To the Congress of the United States:
To most Americans, a stairway poses no problem. A narrow doorway is little more than an inconvenience. But for more than 20 million of our citizens, these simple structures bar the living of a normal life.
One in every ten Americans suffers from some disability which keeps him from using buildings designed--not cruelly, but thoughtlessly--only for the physically fit. Problems in the design of our buildings pose the greatest single obstacle to employment of the handicapped.
If we are to give the millions of handicapped Americans the opportunity to live life to the fullest, we must not put unnecessary barriers in their path.
We want our schools, libraries, office buildings, theaters, museums, stadiums and transportation systems to be accessible to all.
In 1966, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare appointed a National Commission on Architectural Barriers to Rehabilitation of the Handicapped. I am pleased now to transmit to the Congress the report of that Commission entitled "Design for all Americans."
The report shows increased awareness of the problems by State and local governments, architects, and the general public. In the past year, the General Services Administration has substantially modified its design standards to give more consideration to the handicapped.
But the report also shows that a substantial task lies ahead.
--In many cases, State laws are sadly inadequate. Some cover only State-owned buildings; others do not spell out the needed standards.
--No school of architecture gives special or continuing attention to the problem of accessibility.
In the next thirty years, more buildings will be constructed in this country than have been built in the past two hundred years. And as we go about this tremendous task, we must make sure that the needs of the handicapped are not overlooked.
I commend this Report to your attention.
