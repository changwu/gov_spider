    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICYThis Statement Has Been Coordinated by OMB with the Appropriate Agencies
(House)(Hefley (R) CO)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of the substitute version of H.R. 2941 (dated August 30, 1996), but will work in the Senate to delete subsection 2 (k) (1) and to make technical amendments, including correction of an Appointments Clause problem in section 6 (aY
The Administration objects to subsection 2 (k) (1), which authorizes the sale of government housing units to National Park Service (NPS) employees. The provision would create new private land inholdings within national parks, raise potential conflicts of interest regarding the sale of housing units, and significantly complicate park management. Other provisions in the bill provide the NPS with flexibility in leasing Federal and non-Federal lands for housing construction. Although these authorities might be useful in addressing some government housing needs, they would be used only when more cost effective than direct Federal construction of housing.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2941 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is zero. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
