    Today, France and Great Britain deposited their instruments of ratification for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) with the Secretary-General of the United Nations in New York, thus becoming the first nuclear weapon states to ratify the CTBT.
I applaud this milestone in the global effort to reduce the nuclear threat and build a safer world. In particular, I want to thank Prime Minister Blair and President Chirac and the Parliaments of Great Britain and France for their leadership in paving the way towards early entry into force of this historic treaty.
The CTBT has now been signed by 149 states, including all 5 nuclear weapon states. In my State of the Union Address, I asked the Senate to give its advice and consent to the CTBT this year. The CTBT is in the best interests of the United States because its provisions will significantly further our nuclear nonproliferation and arms control objectives and strengthen international security.
