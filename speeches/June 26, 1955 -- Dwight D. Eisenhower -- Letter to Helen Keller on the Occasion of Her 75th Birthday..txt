Dear Miss Keller:
Please accept my warm congratulations on your forthcoming seventy-fifth birthday. The story of your accomplishments is not only a monument to your own great gifts of mind and heart. It is also an enduring inspiration--in many lands--to those who suffer physical handicaps and to those who seek to help the disabled toward richer lives. With all who honor you, I am glad to join in best wishes and in the hope that future years will bring you happiness.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
