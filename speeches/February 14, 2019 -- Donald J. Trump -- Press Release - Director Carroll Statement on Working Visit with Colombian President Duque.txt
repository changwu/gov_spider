    Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Director Jim Carroll released the following statement after participating in an official working visit with Colombian President Iv√°n Duque at the White House this week.
"It's critical that Colombia continues to aggressively increase counter-narcotics efforts, including beginning an aerial spray eradication program, to achieve our shared goal of significantly reducing coca cultivation and production. President Duque and the Colombian government are important partners of the United States, and the Trump Administration will continue working closely with them to meet our objectives and keep illegal drugs out of American communities. We are looking for demonstrable progress this year on our shared objectives," ONDCP Director Jim Carroll said.
