    On St. Patrick's Day, Rosalynn and I extend our warmest good wishes to all our fellow citizens of Irish ancestry and to the many others who join with us in becoming Irish in spirit on this traditionally festive day.
Irish wit and wisdom are as much a part of our national life as the millions of Irish Americans who have helped to build and preserve the greatness of our society.
This Day gives all of us the opportunity to honor and take pride in the very significant precious part of our American heritage that is rooted in the Emerald Isle.
