    Warmest greetings to all those celebrating Passover.
This sacred holiday commemorates the long and arduous exodus of the Jewish people to the promised land of Israel. Despite centuries of slavery and oppression, the Israelites, strengthened by the promise of salvation, refused to abandon their dreams of freedom. In their darkest moments of persecution, the hope of liberation and redemption burned bright in their hearts, lighting their way to a new land and a new life.
Passover holds special meaning for us this year as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of the modern state of Israel. It is a powerful reminder of the indomitable spirit of the Jewish people, of the quest for freedom and dignity that unites us all, of God's powerful presence in our history, and God's constant loving concern in our lives.
As the Jewish community across America and around the world commemorates this holy season, let us pray together for peace in the land of Israel, for the tranquility of its people, and for a bright and hopeful future for us all.
Hillary joins me in extending best wishes for a memorable Passover.
