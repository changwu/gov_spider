    I am pleased that the House of Representatives will have an opportunity in just a few weeks to vote on a strong, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights. This will, at long last, give Members of Congress an opportunity to put patients' interests ahead of the special interests.
A bipartisan majority of the House has already expressed support for the Norwood-Dingell proposal, a plan that would provide for an enforceable set of meaningful patient protections that would be extended to all Americans in all health plans. I am confident that the Norwood-Dingell Patients' Bill of Rights will be adopted, if the House leadership permits a fair process for debating and voting on this important issue.
