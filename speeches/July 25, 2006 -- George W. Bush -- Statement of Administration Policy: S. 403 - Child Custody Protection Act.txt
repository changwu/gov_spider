    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Sen. Ensign (R) NV and 43 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 403, which would protect the health and safety of minors by preventing valid and constitutional state parental involvement laws from being circumvented by transporting minors across state lines for abortions. This bill also would protect the rights of parents to be involved in the medical decisions of their minor daughters consistent with the widespread belief among authorities in the field that it is the parents of a pregnant minor who are best suited to provide her counsel, guidance, and support.
