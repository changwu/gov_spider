    Let me just read a few sentences in response to Saddam Hussein's speech.
The statement by Saddam Hussein this morning is disappointing. He repeats the same invective and disregard for the United Nations mandate that we have heard so often since August 2d. In vowing to continue the war, he once again demonstrates his determination to maintain the aggression against Kuwait and the absence of compassion for his people and his country.
For our part, the coalition forces remain on the course set by the 12 United Nations resolutions. Our forces remain on a steadfast course. The liberation of Kuwait continues.
