    Good evening. And again, welcome to the White House. We are so pleased to be hosting an evening of poetry, music, and spoken word. So you just want to clap -- (applause.)
Tonight's event is really just another way for us to open up the White House and once again make it the People's House -- to invite people from all different backgrounds to come and share their stories and speak their minds; for all of us to learn about different forms of communication and to be open to hearing other people's voices. For it is one thing for people to tell their stories in their own spaces, and quite another for those stories to be welcomed in this space.
Barack is President today because many people who thought their voices didn't matter or wouldn't be heard decided to show up on Election Day and vote anyway. And that's the beauty -- (applause) -- and that is the beauty of our democracy. And we have to remember that democracy is really, really big. It has room for lots of voices, which sometimes take us out of our comfort zones, but that's what makes it so meaningful.
And that's one of the reasons why I am so excited about tonight. Let me tell you, I have wanted to do this from day one -- the notion of standing in this room and hearing some poetry and spoken word. (Applause.) But it's important for us to remember that this White House is committed to maintaining this openness and making this place a place where all voices can be heard. And the President and I are so proud to welcome this group of talented performers and we're just excited to welcome this audience here tonight.
So please enjoy, have fun, be loose -- (laughter) -- and let's start the show. Thank you. (Applause.)
