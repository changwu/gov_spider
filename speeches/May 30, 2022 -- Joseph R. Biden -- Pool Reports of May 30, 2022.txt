5/30 In-Town Pool Report #3A
POTUS spoke to the press for about 5 minutes. More quotes to come.
Q: Do you feel more motivated to act on guns now?
POTUS: "I've been pretty motivated all along. The folks who were victimized, their families, they spent three hours and 40 minutes with me. They waited all that time. Some came two hours early. The pain is palpable. I think a lot of it is unnecessary. I'm going to continue to push."
Q: Is there anything different on how Republicans will approach the gun reform question now?
POTUS: "Since I haven't spoken to them, I don't know."

5/30 In-Town Pool Report #3C
Final quotes.
Q: Are you going to send long-range rocket systems to Ukraine?
POTUS: "We are not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that strike into Russia."
Q: Is there one element, is it age, is it red flag, is there some component that you think could be most successful now?POTUS:
"That's hard to say because I have not been negotiating with any of the Republicans yet."
"There's only one reason for something that can fire 100 shots."
Talked about hearings he held as a senator about "rational gun laws." Talked about a visit to trauma hospital in New York."They showed me an x-ray.""A 9 mm bullet blows the lung out of the body."
"There's simply no rational basis for it in terms of self protection, hunting.""The Constitution, the Second Amendment was never absolute. You couldn't buy a cannon when the Second Amendment was passed."
"I think things have gotten so bad that everybody is getting more rational about it."
Q: I know you want Congress to act. Do you believe as president you have a particular responsibility now?POTUS: "I can't dictate this stuff. I can do the things I've done and any executive action I can take, I'll continue to take. But I can't outlaw a weapon. I can't change a background check. I can't do that."
Q: McConnell directed Sen. Cornyn to search for a compromise. Do you really think there's something there?
POTUS: "I don't know."
"McConnell is a rational Republican. Cornyn is as well."
"I've got to go in, I've got the Gold Star families."
