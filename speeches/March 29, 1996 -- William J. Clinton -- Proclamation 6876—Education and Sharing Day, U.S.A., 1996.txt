  A Proclamation

In looking forward to the 21st century, we recognize that excellence in education is the key to our Nation's future. At a time when we face difficult choices about how best to strengthen that future, our commitment to meaningful education for our youth must remain absolutely firmâ€”we have a profound obligation to put children's needs first and to make the essential investments that will help them succeed.
Throughout his distinguished life, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson was an advocate for the high-quality education and strong values young people need to become productive and caring citizens. Drawing on a deep tradition of faith and a dedication to strengthening family and community ties, the Lubavitcher Rebbe sought to help our youth become responsible leaders and moral thinkers.
On this day and throughout the year, let us join parents, teachers, and concerned people everywhere who are following Rabbi Schneerson's example by empowering young people with essential skills and knowledge. By nurturing their minds and spirits together, we can help our children to embrace all of the exciting challenges ahead.
Now, Therefore, I, William J. Clinton, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 31, 1996, as Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A. I call upon educators, volunteers, and all the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twentieth.

WILLIAM J. CLINTON
