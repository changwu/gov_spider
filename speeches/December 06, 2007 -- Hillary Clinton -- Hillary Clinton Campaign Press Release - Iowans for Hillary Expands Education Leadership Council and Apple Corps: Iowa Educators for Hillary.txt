    DES MOINES, IA – Iowans for Hillary today unveiled an additional 183 Iowa education leaders who will join the campaign's Apple Corps initiative. The 349 Apple Corps members and Iowa Education Leadership Council members are conducting outreach to Iowa's educators on behalf of the campaign to increase their participation in the caucuses for Hillary Clinton.
"Hillary Clinton has always fought for our nation's children," said Anita Wendt, retired elementary school teacher of Sioux City. "From her early days at the Children's Defense Fund, to her days working to reform the Arkansas school system, to the battles she's won in the United States Senate, Hillary has been this nation's strongest advocate for education."
"Hillary has the strength and experience to reform our nation's educational system," said Fedelina Madrid, MBA, a university vice president from Independence. "She will reclaim the future for our children starting on day one."
"I am honored to have the support of these incredible Iowa educators as we work to improve our education system," said Senator Clinton. "American children deserve the opportunity to live up to their potential and a high-quality educational system is essential to achieving that goal."
For 35 years, Senator Clinton has advocated for children and families in America. In the Senate, Hillary Clinton has been an outspoken advocate for reforming No Child Left Behind and full funding for the program. As president, she will implement those changes and also work to attract more outstanding teachers and principals and will pay them like the professionals they are. She has a plan to make pre-kindergarten universal and make college more affordable for working families.
