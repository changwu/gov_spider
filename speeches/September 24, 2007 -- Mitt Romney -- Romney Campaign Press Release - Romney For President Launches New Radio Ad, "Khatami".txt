Boston, MA – Today, Romney for President launched its newest radio ad, "Khatami." The ad highlights Governor Romney's opposition to former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's 2006 visit to Harvard University. Calling the visit on the eve of the fifth anniversary of 9/11 a "disgrace," Governor Romney refused to provide Khatami with a State Police escort. Today, Governor Romney has called on the United Nations and Columbia University to take similar action and revoke any invitation for current Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to speak at their respective institutions.
The ad will begin airing as part of the campaign's rotation today in Iowa and South Carolina, and then Florida later in the week. Script and viewing links are below.
Script For "Khatami" (Radio:60):
ANNOUNCER: "On the eve of the fifth anniversary of 9/11, Harvard University invited former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami to Boston. The same Mohammad Khatami who has supported the terrorist group Hezbollah, advocates destruction of Israel and stood by while Jews and Christians were persecuted.
"The Iranian wanted VIP treatment at taxpayer expense. But Governor Mitt Romney said, 'No.' Governor Romney called the invitation a 'disgrace' and refused to grant Khatami a police escort.
"Now another Iranian President is visiting America, coming to New York, and Governor Mitt Romney is leading the opposition."
GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: "We should be tightening our sanctions against Iran, not welcoming him to the world stage and I've called on the Secretary-General of the United Nations to withdraw that invitation. What we should be doing is indicting Ahmadinejad under the Genocide Convention."
ANNOUNCER: "As Governor Mitt Romney did what was right, not what was politically correct. As President, he'll do the same. Mitt Romney."
GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: "I'm Mitt Romney and I approved this message."
ANNOUNCER: "Paid for by Romney for President."

- Former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's 2006 Speech At Harvard University Came On The Eve Of The Fifth Anniversary Of 9/11. "Former Iranian president Mohammad Khatami urged the United States and Iran to step back from the brink of confrontation yesterday in an appearance at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government that had been both heralded and condemned. ... Khatami's visit ends as Americans mark the fifth anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Iran has not been implicated in the attacks, but it has been called a major sponsor of terrorism, in part because of its support for anti-Israeli groups, Hamas and Hezbollah, which the United States considers terrorist organizations. The US government also accuses Iran of fomenting chaos in Iraq." (Farah Stockman, "Khatami Urges US, Iran To Use Restraint," The Boston Globe, 9/11/06)
- Khatami Compared Hezbollah To "A Shining Sun." "Even Iran's former president, Mohammad Khatami, who used his eight-year presidency to try to moderate Iran's foreign policy, likened Hezbollah to 'a shining sun that illuminates and warms the hearts of all Muslims and supporters of freedom in the world.'" (Elaine Sciolino, "An Embodiment Of Iran's Long Shadow," The New York Times, 7/19/06)
- As President, Khatami Said Israel Was "Not A Legitimate State." "Yet while in office Khatami was a harsh critic of Israel stating that 'historically as well as morally Israel is not a legitimate state' and calling Israel an undesirable entity in the Middle East." (Nathan Guttman, "Khatami Says Iran's Policy Has Never Been To Eliminate Israel," The Jerusalem Post, 9/8/06)
- While President, Khatami's Government Persecuted Religious Minorities. "The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, a federal agency, sent the National Cathedral a letter criticizing the visit. It said that in Iran, where Shiite Islam is the state religion, people were tortured and harassed and religious minorities were persecuted while Khatami was president from 1997 to 2005. The State Department said in a 2005 report that actions by Iran's government created 'a threatening atmosphere for some religious minorities, especially Baha'is, Jews and evangelical Christians.'"

"Governor Mitt Romney today ordered all Massachusetts state government agencies to decline support, if asked, for former Iranian President Mohammed Khatami's September 10 visit to the Boston area, where he is scheduled to speak at Harvard University. 'State taxpayers should not be providing special treatment to an individual who supports violent jihad and the destruction of Israel,' said Romney. Romney's action means that Khatami will be denied an official police escort and other VIP treatment when he is in town. The federal government provides security through the U.S. State Department."

(Office Of Governor Mitt Romney, "Romney Denounces Khatami Visit To Harvard," Press Release, 9/5/06)
- Governor Romney: "Well, what I say is that on that September 10th and September 11th, on the fifth anniversary of a extraordinary tragedy in America, you don't welcome a person to Harvard with open arms who has preached the destruction of Israel, who has developed nuclear technology, contrary to what he had said, who has jailed dissident students in his country, who has praised Hezbollah. This is a person whose words are worth nothing. And it creates a true farce for Harvard..." (Fox News' "The O'Reilly Factor," 9/6/06)

- The Washington Times Editorial: "Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has rightly expressed outrage at Mr. Ahmadinejad's presence in New York, pointing out in a letter to Mr. Ban that the despot is supporting Hezbollah's terrorist efforts, flouting the international community through his nuclear weapons program and supporting Shi'ite militia extremists in Iraq. Mr. Romney commendably called on the United States to reconsider its participation in the U.N. should the body continue to act as a toothless overseer when it comes to Iran." (Editorial, "Ahmadinejad At The U.N.," The Washington Times, 9/18/07)

I believe that Iran's leaders and ambitions represent the greatest threat to the world since the fall of the Soviet Union, and before that, Nazi Germany. ... A successful strategy on our part has to consider and encompass the people of Iran, as well as their leaders. That being said, let me just talk for a moment about a strategy which I think should be pursued. It includes five major dimensions."
