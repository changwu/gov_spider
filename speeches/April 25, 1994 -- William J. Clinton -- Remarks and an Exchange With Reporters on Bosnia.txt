    The President. Good morning. I'm on my way, as you know, to Fort Myer, to the service, so I can't stay and answer a lot of questions. But I did want to make a brief statement about the situation in Bosnia.
It appears that the pressure brought to bear by NATO and the U.N. has worked and that the cease-fire is holding, that the withdrawal is continuing. We will continue to monitor the situation very closely as the next day unfolds.
I do want to say it's now clearly time to get the diplomatic initiative going again while we maintain our vigilance. But I am pleased by the progress of the last 48 hours.
Q. Have things been worked out with the U.N., Mr. President?
The President. I think so. I think so.
Q. Does that mean no air strikes?
The President. No. Oh, no. I think he was just referring to the situation on Saturday. Yes, I think so.
