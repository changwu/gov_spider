    The United States and Japan have built a strategic partnership that encompasses a wide range of shared global priorities. Today the partnership is a fitting reflection of the common interests, capabilities and values of our two countries as we work together to address challenges around the world. The United States and Japan reaffirm their commitment to enhance their longstanding partnership as follows:
Expanding Bilateral Economic and People-to-People Ties
The United States and Japan are two of the world's largest economic powers – accounting for nearly 30 percent of global GDP – and our economies are deeply intertwined through trade and investment. This deep economic integration has been an extraordinarily positive force for job creation, wage growth, innovation, and enhanced prosperity for both countries. To further develop those bonds, the United States and Japan endeavor to:

• Further deepen our economic ties. In 2014, our two-way goods and services trade was $279 billion. The United States has accumulated foreign direct investment in Japan of $123 billion, while Japan is the second largest foreign investor in the United States, with investment stock of nearly $350 billion.
• Enhance cooperation and collaboration between SelectUSA and Invest Japan, noting the importance of our strong and growing bilateral investment relationship.
• Facilitate expedited travel by Japan's participation in the U.S. Global Entry Program and U.S. participation in Japan's Trusted Traveler Program.
• Expand cooperation in infrastructure development in our respective countries including high speed rail projects, recognizing the importance of developing high speed rail as an investment in the future growth of our economies.
• Continue to strengthen people-to-people ties, including efforts to increase student, research, and legislative exchanges. Welcome the "KAKEHASHI Initiative toward the Future" and the "TOMODACHI Initiative," and continued efforts by the U.S.-Japan Conference on Cultural and Educational Interchange, which inspired the "Team Up" campaign to promote university-to-university partnerships and programs by the Japan Foundation.
Harnessing Science, Technology, and Innovation for Our Future
Together, the United States and Japan are drawing upon the technical skills and resources of our two nations to:
Science, Technology, and Innovation

• Enhance our cooperation on vital research issues, such as biomedical research, robotics, materials research, and computer and information science and engineering, in close cooperation with academic institutions, government research and development institutions, industry, and through the U.S. – Japan Joint High Level Committee on science and technology, based on the U.S.-Japan Science and Technology Agreement, extended in 2014.
