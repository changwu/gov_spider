    Edwards Will Highlight His Bold Policies and Vision for America While Visiting 31 Communities and Thousands of Caucus Goers from August 13 to August 19
Des Moines, Iowa - Senator John Edwards and Elizabeth Edwards will kick off the 2007 "Fighting for One America" Iowa bus tour on August 13, 2007, with a supporter rally at campaign headquarters in Des Moines. The seven-day, 31-county bus tour will take the Edwards family from the Iowa State Fair to town hall meetings and community gatherings across the state, culminating in the Democratic Presidential Debate on August 19 at Drake University.
"Elizabeth and I are excited to bring our family back to Iowa and to talk to so many Iowans about our fight to build the One America we all believe in," Edwards said. "From Ida Grove to Iowa City, and everywhere in between, we are looking forward to sharing our vision for real change in America."
Edwards continues to drive the Democratic agenda by leading with bold ideas. While Washington continues to offer only rhetoric, empty talk and half-measures, Edwards is offering courage, conviction and real ideas. Each day of the tour will focus on a different critical issue facing America - ending the war in Iraq, restoring economic fairness to rural America, rewarding work, delivering true universal healthcare, creating a new energy economy, strengthening education and building a One America where every person has a chance to succeed.
