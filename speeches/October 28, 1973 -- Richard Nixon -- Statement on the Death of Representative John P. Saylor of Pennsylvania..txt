    JOHN P. SAYLOR was a Congressman of exceptional stature. During nearly a quarter of a century of service in the House of Representatives, he rose to stand among the top rank of his party in seniority and earned the high esteem of colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Long before the issues of conservation, natural resources, and environmental quality came to fashion, he was helping to shape wise national policy for these vital concerns. His Pennsylvania constituents came to trust him implicitly for faithful representation of their interest and needs, and we in Washington learned to count on him for unflagging legislative responsibility, independence, and integrity.
