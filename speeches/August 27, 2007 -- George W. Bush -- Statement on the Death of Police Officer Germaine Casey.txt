    Officer Germaine Casey of the Rio Rancho Police Department died today from injuries suffered while serving as a member of my security detail in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I am deeply saddened by his death and extraordinarily grateful for his protection. It is a high calling to choose to serve and protect your fellow citizens, and I will always be indebted to Officer Casey's service.
He leaves behind his wife Lisa and their two children. They are in my thoughts and prayers. May God comfort the Casey family and his fellow law enforcement officials.
