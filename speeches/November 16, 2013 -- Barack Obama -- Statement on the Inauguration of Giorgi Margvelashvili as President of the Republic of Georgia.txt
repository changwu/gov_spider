    On behalf of the American people, I congratulate the people of Georgia as they celebrate the Inauguration of a new President and mark the first time a Presidential transition has taken place as the result of a peaceful, democratic election. I extend my warm congratulations to President Giorgi Margvelashvili on his Inauguration day.
The path to this day was marked by the contributions of many distinguished political leaders over the past 20 years, including outgoing President Mikheil Saakashvili and Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, who have both played a vital role in strengthening Georgia''s democratic institutions, together with civil society and the people of Georgia. We appreciate what these two leaders have accomplished during their respective tenures and look forward to working with their successors to continue the strong and deep bonds that the United States and Georgia have enjoyed for over 20 years.
Georgia is making significant progress in consolidating democratic institutions, including through its commitments under the Open Government Partnership and its promotion of women''s participation in public life, and is moving forward on the path to fulfilling its Euro-Atlantic aspirations. As we mark this momentous political transition, I call on all of Georgia''s political leaders to work together and continue to work with civil society to build on this achievement.
