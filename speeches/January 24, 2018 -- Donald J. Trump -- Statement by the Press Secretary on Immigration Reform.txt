    Last fall, the White House sent Congress a list of the core reforms necessary to fix our immigration system.  These reforms were assembled in coordination with frontline law enforcement officers and career public servants who know what is necessary to keep America safe.  Since that time, President Donald J. Trump and his Administration have hosted dozens of meetings with Republican and Democrat leadership and rank-and-file members of the House and Senate to discuss these reforms and find a bipartisan path forward. Based on these negotiations, the White House will release a legislative framework on Monday that represents a compromise that members of both parties can support.  We encourage the Senate to bring it to the floor.  This framework will fulfill the four agreed-upon pillars: securing the border and closing legal loopholes; ending extended-family chain migration; cancelling the visa lottery, and providing a permanent solution on DACA.  After decades of inaction by Congress, it's time we work together to solve this issue once and for all. The American people deserve no less.
