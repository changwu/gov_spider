    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Tom Henderson, a member of my Advisory Council on HIV and AIDS and a senior staff person at the Environmental Protection Agency. Tom was a longtime friend to both of us and combined great intelligence with a sharp Texas wit. He was a strong and effective advocate for our efforts to combat AIDS, the disease that eventually took his life. We will miss Tom, as will members of the Council, his colleagues at the EPA and the White House, and the hundreds of people around the country who were blessed to know him as a friend. Our thoughts and prayers are with his partner Michael, his daughter Melissa, and all of those like us who grieve his loss.
