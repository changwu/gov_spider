.@jimmyfallon is now whimpering to all that he did the famous 'hair show' with me (where he seriously messed up my hair) & that he would have now done it differently because it is said to have 'humanized' me-he is taking heat. He called & said 'monster ratings.' Be a man Jimmy!Retweets: 19065Favorites: 92867

House Republicans could easily pass a Bill on Strong Border Security but remember it still has to pass in the Senate and for that we need 10 Democrat votes and all they do is RESIST. They want Open Borders and don't care about Crime! Need more Republicans to WIN in November!Retweets: 28412Favorites: 109425

Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey said that President Trump is probably correct that there was surveillance on Trump Tower. Actually far greater than would ever have been believed!Retweets: 17961Favorites: 72144

The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders. I always had a rule if a restaurant is dirty on the outside it is dirty on the inside!Retweets: 34364Favorites: 136352

I have tried to stay uninvolved with the Department of Justice and FBI (although I do not legally have to) because of the now totally discredited and very expensive Witch Hunt currently going on. But you do have to ask why the DOJ & FBI aren't giving over requested documents?Retweets: 29187Favorites: 113555

Such a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the Obama Administration and ours. Actually we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under Obama. Fake News is working overtime!Retweets: 25797Favorites: 103399

Hiring manythousands of judges and going through a long and complicated legal process is not the way to go - will always be disfunctional. People must simply be stopped at the Border and told they cannot come into the U.S. illegally. Children brought back to their country......Retweets: 21557Favorites: 90886

....If this is done illegal immigration will be stopped in it's tracks - and at very little by comparison cost. This is the only real answer - and we must continue to BUILD THE WALL!Retweets: 21536Favorites: 93131

Will be heading to one of my favorite places South Carolina to fight for one of my original 'fighters' Governor Henry McMaster. Speaking at 7:00 P.M.Retweets: 14456Favorites: 70944

Congresswoman Maxine Waters an extraordinarily low IQ person has become together with Nancy Pelosi the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters of which there are many of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!Retweets: 40092Favorites: 141932

Surprised that Harley-Davidson of all companies would be the first to wave the White Flag. I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the E.U. which has hurt us badly on trade down $151 Billion. Taxes just a Harley excuse - be patient! #MAGARetweets: 16881Favorites: 73870
