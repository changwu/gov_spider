LAKE JACKSON, Texas — The campaign of 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul raised $4.5 million in the month of January and is on track to exceed its Q4 fundraising of about $13.3 million.
The Paul campaign has $1.6 million in cash on hand. The amount raised in January excludes more than $1.7 million that the campaign has so far raised via its online fund-raising event, or 'money bomb.'
Taken together, the fundraising totals position Ron Paul as a candidate fully prepared for the expense and rigors of the next few Republican nominating contests, and indeed beyond.
"Naturally we're pleased that our growing support base continues to generously support Ron Paul, so in turn he can spread his message of constitutionally-limited government, sound money, and a foreign policy that keep America safe," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton. "Ron Paul is the only Republican candidate who can defeat Barack Obama. And, he is the only one prepared for an exhaustive 50-state campaign in terms of organization, ballot access, and fundraising stamina."
