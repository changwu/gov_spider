Ted Cruz voted 11 times against Sessions during the immigration debate.

The Facts:
Cruz voted opposite of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) "on 11 occasions during the Senate Judiciary Committee's consideration of the immigration bill."

Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) on Cruz amendment to increase H-1B visas 500%: "I think the number that Senator Cruz has raised is a bit high."
"'I think the number that Senator Cruz has raised is a bit high,' Sessions said with some alarm at the time. Cruz strongly defended his idea. 'High- skilled immigrants whether temporary or permanent are, I believe, the data demonstrates pro-growth,' Cruz said. 'They generate jobs. They generate economic productivity.'" (CNN, 1/6/16)
