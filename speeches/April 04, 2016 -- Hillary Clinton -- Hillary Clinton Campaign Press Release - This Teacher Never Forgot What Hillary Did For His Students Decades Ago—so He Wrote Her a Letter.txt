    "It's unlikely you'll remember this wonderful evening, but I assure you, we will never forget it."
As a middle school teacher in Burlington, Vermont, Larry O'Keefe didn't just want his students to read about American historyâ€”he wanted them to understand it, love it, and talk to the people who experienced it. So, with the help of a fellow teacher, he created a program to help 7th- and 8th-graders organize trips across the country, hosted in churches, schools, and homes along the way.
One of those homes was the Governor's Mansion in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1983.
After discussing that trip with a former student, Larry was inspired to write a letter to then-First Lady of Arkansas Hillary Clinton to share a memory that's stuck with him for decades.
