    In his "Mount Washington" speech, Jeb outlined a few specific plans to disrupt the overspending, overreaching, the arrogance, and the sheer incompetence in our nation's capital.
For starters, Jeb proposed two concrete solutions to confront and end the habitual practice of deficit spending â€” a balanced budget amendment and a constitutionally sound line-item veto. As he said, "Overspending is one of those problems where a president has to assert the national interest, even if no one else will."

Another proposal put forward would punish Members of Congress who seem to regard attendance and voting as optional. The message is simple: If you don't show up to votes and hearings, you simply don't get paid.

Finally, Jeb plans to tackle this problem head on by proposing a 6-year lobbying ban for former Members of Congress.

After all, it's the relentless expansion of government that made lobbying Washington's premier growth industry. Jeb's plan will restrain federal spending and bureaucratic meddling.
We can no longer tolerate a culture that has enriched lobbyists while leaving hardworking Americans behind.
