    The President has sent a message to Prime Minister Zia of Bangladesh expressing his condolences and those of the American people on the horrible devastation caused by the recent cyclone. Our hearts go out in particular to the families of the numerous victims of this terrible tragedy.
We also have assured the government of Bangladesh that the United States stands ready to assist in the tasks of relief and reconstruction. The U.S. Government already has provided $2.1 million in disaster assistance for medical supplies, water purification tablets, and funds to support the procurement and distribution of other high priority relief items by nongovernment agencies.
We are looking into other means to help Bangladesh obtain its highest priority needs for clean water, dry food, helicopter transport, clothing, and temporary shelter.
We will be providing additional U.S. Government assistance and we call upon individual Americans and indeed all members of the international community to be as generous in providing aid and comfort to the people of this disaster-stricken nation.
