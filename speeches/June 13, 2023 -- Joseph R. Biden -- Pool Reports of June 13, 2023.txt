Foreign Pool Report #1 - Background Ahead of POTUS Meeting with NATO Secretary General
Hi!
I will be your foreign pooler for the meeting between US President Joe Biden and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. The meeting is scheduled for 1.00 PM. Stoltenberg will make a stop at the stakeout after the meeting.
Meetings/calls: The meeting between POTUS and Stoltenberg, initially scheduled for yesterday at 3:15 PM, was rescheduled for today due to the President's need for a root canal.
This will be the fourth meeting between the two leaders at the White House since President Biden's inauguration in January 2021. The first meeting took place in June 2021, with the goal of preparing for the NATO Summit in Brussels. The second meeting occurred in October 2021, shortly after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in August and the announcement of the AUKUS partnership in September. The third meeting at the White House was held in June 2022, prior to the NATO Summit in Madrid.
In addition to their White House meetings, both leaders have also met in Brussels and have encountered each other at numerous NATO gatherings.
Schedule: Stoltenberg met today at 11:00 AM with Secretary Blinken at the State Department. He also has a meeting scheduled on the Hill today with the members of the Senate NATO Observer Group (SNOG). The Senate NATO Observer Group, which was re-established in 2018, is co-chaired by U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Thom Tillis (R-NC).
Priorities: At the forefront of the agenda will be preparations for the upcoming NATO Summit, scheduled to be held in Vilnius, Lithuania on July 11 and 12. Stoltenberg has previously stated that he expects allies to agree on multi-year package of assistance to help Ukrainians transition from Soviet-era to NATO standards. Another crucial objective for Stoltenberg during the summit is bolstering the Alliance's deterrence and defense capabilities with new defense plans, more troops at higher readiness, and stronger command and control structures.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been invited to attend the NATO Summit, as have the leaders of four Indo-Pacific NATO partners: Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea. Additionally, it is expected that EU leadership will participate in one of the sessions.
Stoltenberg has also expressed an interest in a renewed commitment from NATO members to increase defense spending with 2% of GDP as a minimum. Furthermore, the White House mentioned in a statement the president's interest in building upon the 2014 Wales Summit defense investment pledge, which aimed to ensure that countries spending less than 2% would "aim to move towards the 2% guideline within a decade."
Another issue that could arise (though it has not been mentioned by either the US or NATO side) is the succession of Stoltenberg, whose current mandate as NATO chief is set to end on September 30. When asked yesterday during the briefing if POTUS would ask Stoltenberg to stay on for another term, NSC Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby responded: "I'm not going to get ahead of the President's decision-making regarding the next Secretary General." Kirby said that the White House is "grateful" for Stoltenberg's leadership and considered that he has done a "superb job," leading the Alliance through a "very critical time" with the war in Ukraine.
Delegation (according to NATO):

First Deputy Director of the Private Office, Lorenz Meyer-Minnemann
Assistant Secretary General for Operations, Tom Goffus
Deputy Director of the Private Office, Jahn Jeffrey
NATO Deputy Spokesperson, Dylan White
Secretary General's Special Advisor on Strategic Communications, Sissel Kruse Larsen
Secretary General's Military Assistant, Brigadier General Gjermund Eide.

 Bio: Stoltenberg, 64, became NATO Secretary General in October 2014. His tenure has already been extended three times. His mandate was due to expire on September 30, 2022, but it was extended for an extra year due to the war in Ukraine. As a result, he had to postpone his appointment as the central bank chief in his native Norway.
He served as the Prime Minister of Norway from 2000 to 2001 and from 2005 to 2013. During his time in office, he led the country through the terrorist attacks that killed 77 people in Oslo and Ut√∏ya on July 22, 2011. In response, he urged for "more democracy, more openness, and more humanity, but never na√Øvet√©."
He was the leader of the Labour Party in Norway from 2002 to 2014. Additionally, he served as the Minister of Trade and Energy (1993‚Äì1996) and the Minister of Finance (1996‚Äì1997) under Prime Ministers Gro Harlem Brundtland and Thorbj√∏rn Jagland.
As a curiosity, Stoltenberg entered politics after working as a journalist. From 1979 to 1981, he wrote for the daily newspaper Arbeiderbladet.

Foreign Pool Report #2 - Quotes NATO Secretary General
When the pool entered, POTUS and Stoltenberg were seated next to each other.
Stoltenberg thanked POTUS for the new package of military aid to Ukraine announced today. He talked about the offensive launched by the Ukranians and said that they "are making progress." "The more land the Ukrainians are able to liberate, the stronger hand they will have at the negotiating table," he said.
Stoltenberg considered that the invasion launched by Russia is not only a war against Ukraine, but "against free people everywhere." If President Putin wins, he argued, then the world would be "more dangerous" because it will embolden other countries, "including China."
Neither leader answered questions from the pool.
Please check the quotes against the transcript. I will send fuller quotes momentarily.

Foreign Pool Report #3 - Fuller quotes NATO Secretary General
Please see fuller quotes from NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. As always, please check against the official transcript.
"Thank you for your leadership for your strong personal commitment to the transatlantic bond, to Europe and North America standing together. And let me also thank the US Congress and the people of America for their strong support to Ukraine."
On the new package of military aid to Ukraine and the offensive: "You just made a new announcement of additional US support, and that is something which is very much welcomed. European Allies and Canada are also doing their part, with tens of billions in military and economic support for Ukraine. And the support that we are providing together to Ukraine is now making a difference on the battlefield as we speak, because the offensive is launched and Ukrainians are making progress. It's still early days, but what we do know is that the more land Ukrainians are able to liberate, the stronger hand they will have at the negotiating table."
On the implications of the Russian invasion for the world and the effect it could have emboldening China: "We also have realized that Russia was brutal invasion of Ukraine was not only an attack on Ukraine, but also on our core values, and on free people everywhere. And therefore, President Putin must not win this war because that will not only be a tragedy for Ukrainians, but it will also make the world more dangerous. It will send a message to authoritarian leaders all over the world, also in China that when they use military force, they get what they want. And we will then become more vulnerable. It is always in our security interest to support Ukraine."
On the NATO summit next month in Vilnius, Stoltenberg said that the objective is "to sustain and step up" the Alliance's support of Ukraine. He mentioned a "new commitment to invest more in defense." "I expect others to agree that 2% of GDP for defense has to be a minimum of what allies have to invest in our shared security."
On Sweden: "We all look forward to welcoming Sweden as a full pledged member of the alliance as soon as possible. So once again, Mr. President, thank you for your leadership. Thank you for your strong commitment. And I look forward to welcoming you to the NATO Summit."

Foreign Pool Report #4- NATO secretary general at the stakeout location
The NATO Secretary General briefly spoke at the stakeout location, delivering remarks similar to those made at the Oval Office.
Stoltenberg mentioned his discussion with Biden regarding Ukraine. "The offensive is challenging," he stated, emphasizing the need for NATO's assistance.
Stoltenberg also discussed burden-sharing with Biden, reiterating his call for allies to commit to a minimum of 2% of GDP in defense spending.
As Stoltenberg explained, he also engaged in a conversation with Biden about Sweden. Stoltenberg expressed his desire for Sweden to become a member of the alliance "as soon as possible."

Foreign Pool Report #5- NATO Secretary did not take questions
Stoltenberg did not take questions.
So we did not have a chance to ask him if he would be willing to stay at NATO as secretary general or who may replace him later this year.
He only talked for 3 minutes.
