Q. Mr. President, are you confident that Dr. Elders has the answers to the questions she'll be asked tomorrow?
The President. I think she'll do very well.
Let me also say while Chairman Shushkevich is here that I am very honored to have him here in the White House. And I want to thank him publicly for the support his country has given to the nonproliferation regime and to START I. We're going to have a good partnership. I look forward to its development. And I very much appreciate the fact that he has come here off of a successful commitment by his nation to be nonnuclear. And it means a lot to the United States and to the world.

Q. Are you concerned about getting the flood money from the House, sir?
The President. No, not from what I heard about that. I think it's okay.
