    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, 1979, with Annex, signed on behalf of the United States on November 6, 1979. For the information of the Senate, I transmit also the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention and a copy of the Final Act of the International Conference on Maritime Search and Rescue, 1979, adopting the Convention.
The Convention provides for the first comprehensive approach to international search and rescue service for world shipping, by establishing a plan to coordinate international facilities for the rescue of persons in distress at sea. It does for the maritime services what the search and rescue provisions of Annex 12 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation do for the aviation services. The Convention will serve to promote cooperation among organizations around the 'world participating in search and rescue operations at sea.
For these reasons, I urge the Senate to give this Convention prompt consideration, and its advice and consent to ratification.
