    Today, President Donald J. Trump released the United States Strategy on Women, Peace, and Security, which focuses both on increasing women's participation in political, civic, and security endeavors to prevent and resolve conflicts and on creating conditions for long-term peace around the world. The Strategy aims to ensure women are no longer absent from, or overlooked at, the negotiating table, and it modernizes international programs to improve equality for, and the empowerment of, women.
President Trump was the first global leader to sign bipartisan legislation of this kind, making the United States the first country in the world with a standalone, comprehensive law on Women, Peace, and Security.
The Trump Administration has demonstrated its commitment to empowering women across the globe in economic and security fields, including through the White House Women's Global Development and Prosperity (W-GDP) Initiative, unveiled earlier this year. With today's release of our Strategy on Women, Peace, and Security, the United States reaffirms its strong and unwavering commitment to advancing women's equality, protecting the rights of women and girls, and promoting women's economic empowerment.
