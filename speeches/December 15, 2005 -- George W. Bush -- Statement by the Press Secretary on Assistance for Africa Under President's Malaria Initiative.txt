    Beginning this week, more than 500,000 Angolans will benefit from indoor spraying to prevent malaria and be the first beneficiaries to receive assistance under the President's Malaria Initiative. Large scale distribution of bednets begins later this month in Tanzania to protect at least 130,000 children and pregnant women from contracting the disease. Rapid implementation of the President's Initiative will reduce the terrible burden of malaria in the three target countries, Angola, Tanzania, and Uganda. The U.S. Government, under USAID's leadership, is also extending this approach to its existing malaria programs and will continue to work with the international community to prevent loss of life due to malaria in Africa.
