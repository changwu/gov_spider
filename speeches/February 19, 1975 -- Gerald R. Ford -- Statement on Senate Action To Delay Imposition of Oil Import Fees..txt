    THE ISSUE before the Senate was very simple--to vote for delay or to vote for doing something about our growing energy vulnerability.
I regret today's vote but do not regard it as final. I believe the Congress will ultimately respond to the will of the American people and serve national rather than narrow interests. I will continue to work with Congress to this end.
I intend to veto this legislation. I could not do otherwise and be faithful to my oath of office. I deeply believe a prompt solution to our energy problems is essential to the safety and progress of the United States. I cannot be a party to further delay.
