    "I wanted to have a conversation, an adult conversation, about why America can do for anyone what she's done for me." - Tim Scott

Sean Hannity: You're on the stage tonight. How did you feel?
Tim Scott: I felt really good. I felt like I wanted to have a conversation, an adult conversation, about why America can do for anyone what she's done for me. We need to focus on restoring hope, creating opportunities, and protecting America. We didn't spend enough time talking about the challenges we have at our southern border. We didn't talk long enough about the challenges that we have with China. It's not the strength of China, it's the weakness of Biden, that's the problem that we face as a nation. We need to dig into some of the most important, consequential issues facing the American people, and not have a food fight on the stage.
