    THE House Ways and Means Committee, led by Chairman Mills, has developed a General Revenue Sharing bill which essentially incorporated the fundamental principles I have advocated. Recent reports, however, suggest that a logjam on appropriation bills may develop during June and July. This prospect, together with the forecast of a short session, suggests that the Senate might not have time to act upon General Revenue Sharing during this Congress.
The serious fiscal crisis facing State and local governments requires action by this Congress. I am confident that the House will pass General Revenue Sharing by a large majority, and it is essential that this be done quickly. If we are to meet the pressing needs of our nation, I urge you and other members of the House leadership to call the Committee's bill to the Floor this month.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
