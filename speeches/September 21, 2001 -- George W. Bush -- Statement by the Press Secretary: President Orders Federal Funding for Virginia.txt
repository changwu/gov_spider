    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the Commonwealth of Virginia and ordered Federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the area struck by fires and explosions on September 11, 2001.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected individuals and local governments in Arlington County.
Assistance can include funds to help meet temporary housing needs, grants for medical, funeral and other serious disaster-related expenses, and low-interest loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration to cover residential and business losses not fully compensated by insurance or other agencies. Unemployment assistance and funding for crisis counseling services also will be available under the declaration.
Federal funding is available to eligible local governments for debris removal and emergency protective measures at 100% as a result of the fires and explosions. Federal funding is also available on a cost share basis for hazard mitigation measures.
Joe M. Allbaugh, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), named Thomas Davies as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The Agency said that other areas may be added for assistance at a later date.
Help with funeral expenses, medical costs, counseling, lost wages and loss of financial support, is available to victims of this crime and their family members through the Virginia Victims of Crime Compensation Commission. To access this assistance, Virginia residents and out-of-state residents should call 1-866-827-3543.
Residents of Virginia and surrounding states unemployed as a result of this crime may apply for these benefits through their state employment agencies.
