    Speaker Pelosi, Leader Hoyer, and I had a very productive discussion this afternoon about some of the major issues before Congress. The House of Representatives has a very busy legislative schedule ahead of them, and I am grateful for the leadership they are providing on our major priorities, including health care reform, energy reform, and restoring fiscal discipline.
