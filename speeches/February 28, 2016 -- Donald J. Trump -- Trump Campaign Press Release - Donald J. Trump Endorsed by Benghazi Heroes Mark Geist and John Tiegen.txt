    (New York, NY) February 28th, 2016 - Today Donald J. Trump received the endorsement of two true American heroes, who fought against all odds in a hostile foreign land, to save more than twenty-five American lives. Mark "OZ" Geist and John "TIG" Tiegen are two of the individuals responsible for the defense and rescue of dozens of Americans during the terror attacks on the U.S. consulate and at the CIA compound in Benghazi.
Mr. Trump stated, "I am truly honored to have the support of these American heroes, the best of their generation. The American people can know with certainty, I will always place their interest above all else. I am the most militaristic person and it is so important to me to strengthen our military and protect American families and freedoms."
Mark "OZ" Geist said, "We, perhaps more than any Americans, know the absolute and imperative reason that we elect Donald J. Trump as President of the United States. First and foremost, under a Trump administration, the request for additional security by an ambassador would have been heeded, and second, there is no question, when the attack came,he would have moved heaven and earth to provide the necessary forces to protect and reinforce our warriors. Mr. Trump is the bold, decisive leader America needs at this time". Oz added, "Under President Trump, many conflicts will be avoided because our enemies will fear the United States and our military."
John Tiegen added, "It is very clear to see the groundswell of support, never seen before in recent politics. Americans want a strong leader, one who cares more about the safety and freedom of the American people than he does winning elections, or what the press might think. In honor of those we have fought with, I am proud to endorse the next President of the United States, Donald J. Trump."
Mr. Trump was joined by Mark and John at a campaign rally in Madison, Alabama attended by thousands just days before the March 1st primary contest.
