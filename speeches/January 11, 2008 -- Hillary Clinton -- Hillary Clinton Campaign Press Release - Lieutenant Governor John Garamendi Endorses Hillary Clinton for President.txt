    Key Endorsement a Big Boost for Clinton California Campaign
LOS ANGELES, CA - In another show of momentum, Hillary Clinton today received the endorsement of California Lieutenant Governor John Garamendi.
"After seven disastrous years under the Bush Administration, our country faces unprecedented challenges and there is only one presidential candidate who possesses the experience to right those wrongs and deliver the change we desperately need: Hillary Clinton," said Lt. Governor John Garamendi. "I've had the privilege of working with her and witnessing up close her lifelong fight against special interests and the failed status quo. She is the president the working people of California need and I am proud to support her historic campaign."
For more than 30 years in public service, Lt. Gov. Garamendi had been a powerful advocate for the working families of California. During his 14 years as a State Senator and two years in the Assembly, he advocated and passed legislation that served to protect the environment and provide Californians better health care. In 1991, he became California's first elected Insurance Commissioner and in 1995, President Bill Clinton appointed Garamendi as Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior. He used both positions to fight on behalf of working people against entrenched interests. In 2002, he was again elected Insurance Commissioner. On January 8, 2007, John Garamendi became the 46th Lieutenant Governor of California.
"Lt. Governor Garamendi has spent his life in public service working on behalf of families who have for too long been invisible to the Bush administration. I am proud to have his support," said Senator Clinton. "This endorsement shows our historic campaign in California is rapidly gaining momentum as more and more Californians understand I have the experience to turn this county around and create the change they need."
