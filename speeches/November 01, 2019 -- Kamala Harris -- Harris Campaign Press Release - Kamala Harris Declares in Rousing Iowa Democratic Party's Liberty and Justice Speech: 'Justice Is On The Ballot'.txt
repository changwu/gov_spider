    At the Iowa Democratic Party's Liberty and Justice event tonight, Senator Kamala Harris delivered a commanding speech about what makes her unique in this primary field: her career-long commitment to justice. "Justice is on the ballot," she said, pointing to the need to not only hold a lawless president accountable but to pursue economic, health care, and reproductive justice.
Pointing to her career's record of confronting injustice, Harris argued that she is best qualified to take on Donald Trump directly and win on behalf of the people.
Key excerpts from her speech:
This is a moment where we need to fight for this country we love, for the rule of law, for our system of justice. And for our very democracy. So we are all here to fight. We're all here to fight. We are all here to fight to end that national nightmare called Donald Trump. It can't be about anything other than looking at the future. It can't be about looking at yesterday. We need to be focused on tomorrow.
To win, we are going to need a nominee on that stage, with Donald Trump, who has the ability to go toe to toe with Donald Trump -- and Iowa, you are looking at her.
I have spent my career as a prosecutor. I've only had one client in my entire life, and that has been the people. Unlike other people, unlike others, I have never represented a corporation. I have never represented a special interest. And I started my career fighting for the people. In fact the first I walked into a courtroom I spoke five words. 'Kamala Harris, for the people.' And those words, for the people, capture our system of justice.
Here's the bottom line, Iowa. I do believe that when we overcome these injustices, we will unlock the promise of America and the potential of the American people. And I do believe that this is what we want and need. That is the America I see. That is the America I believe in. That is the America I know us to be. And that is why I am running for president of the United States.
