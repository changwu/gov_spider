    At the invitation of President Lopez Portillo and the Government of Mexico, Vice President Mondale will pay an official visit to Mexico on January 20-21, 1978.
President Lopez Portillo was the first Chief of State to visit Washington in my administration. Mrs. Carter and Mrs. Lopez Portillo participated respectively in President Lopez Portillo's inauguration ceremonies and my own. Subsequently, Mrs. Lopez Portillo and Mrs. Carter met in Mexico this November.
The Vice President will be visiting Mexico as my personal representative to continue this important process of consultations on both bilateral and multilateral issues with our good friends and neighbors in Mexico. His visit will again underscore the very great importance and value I attach to our relations with Mexico.
