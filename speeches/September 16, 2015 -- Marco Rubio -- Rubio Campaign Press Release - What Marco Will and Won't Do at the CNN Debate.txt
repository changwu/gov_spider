Terry Sullivan, Campaign Manager
I'm writing you from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, where at 8 PM ET tonight Marco will join 10 other candidates for the Republican debate on CNN. In addition to watching it on TV, you can join our debate team online at marcorubio.com/debate for real-time analysis, fact-checks, and video clips during the debate.
At the first debate in Cleveland last month, millions of Americans got their first look at Marco — and they really liked what they saw. Marco talked about how his parents achieved the American Dream and declared, "If I am the nominee, the Republican Party will be the party of the future." Expect more of the same tonight.
While our campaign has had a great couple of weeks since the first debate, the same cannot be said of the other candidates. We expect some of them will attack each other in hopes of turning around their faltering campaigns. Marco doesn't need to do that. He isn't coming to the Reagan Library to attack other Republicans.
Marco is going to talk about how this election is about what kind of country we will be in the 21st Century. We're headed in the wrong direction — Washington is stuck in the past. What we need now is a leader like Marco who has new ideas for a New American Century. That's what tonight's debate is about.
