PAUL RYAN: "Here's the good news. We don't have to take this anymore. The good news is we don't have to settle for this. We can do better than this. We need leadership. We need Mitt Romney as our next President of the United States. This is a time for big ideas. This is a time for real reform for a real recovery. This is who Mitt Romney is. Look at this man's life. Achievement. Leadership. Look at what he's done in the private sector. He helped create tens of thousands of jobs. By the way, being successful in business, that's a good thing. We want that. We believe in success. We want more of it. This is a man who reached across the aisle, who didn't demonize and demagogue Democrats. He worked with them. He found common ground. He got things done. He balanced the budget without raising taxes. That's the kind of leadership we need."
