    Q. Does it make you angry?
The President. No, but let me show you something. Look at this. This is what people care about. Here's a child with a preexisting condition. He can't get health insurance. So I went out there, was shaking hands in the crowd, the mother gave me a picture of this child. That's where America is, with these people——
Q. Why do you think it's been so hard for you to get your message to——
The President. I haven't been out here with them.
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. You can draw your own conclusion about that, but you heard from a lot of wise people here today.
Q. Are you angry, Mr. President? You sounded awfully angry last night.
The President. I wasn't. I was happy. What I said last night, I was not angry, but I'm determined. That was a deliberate—I wanted to tell those people how I felt. And I'm very happy being here today. This is America; this is where they are.
Q. It sure looks like you started the '96 campaign——
The President. It's not about the '96 campaign; this is about what we're going to do in Congress for the American people in 1994. That's what this was about.
