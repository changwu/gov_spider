    At tonight's Univision Presidential Candidates Forum in Miami, Hillary reiterated her commitment to ending the war in Iraq and bringing our troops home safely as soon as possible. She made clear that the upcoming report from Gen. Petraeus will not change the fact there are no military solutions in Iraq - only political ones - and that we must redeploy our troops and stop asking them to referee a civil war.
Hillary also outlined her support for comprehensive immigration reform, pledging to secure our borders while providing an earned path to legal citizenship. And she would stand up against growing anti-immigrant sentiments and honor America's heritage and values as a nation of immigrants.
With 47 million Americans lacking health insurance, Hillary vowed to establish universal healthcare that includes quality, affordable coverage for every American.
Hillary left today's forum in a position of strength among Latino voters in key early states and nationwide, drawing 59% of the Latino vote in the latest USA Today/Gallup poll.
