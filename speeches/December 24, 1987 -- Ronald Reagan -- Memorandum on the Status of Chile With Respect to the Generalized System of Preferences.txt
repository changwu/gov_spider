    Memorandum for the United States Trade RepresentativeSubject: Action Concerning the Generalized System of Preferences
Pursuant to subsections 502(b)(7), 502(c)(7), and section 504 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the Act) (19 U.S.C. 2462(b)(7), 2462(c)(7) and 2464), I am hereby acting to modify the application of duty-free treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) currently being afforded to Chile.
Specifically, after considering various private sector requests for review concerning worker rights in Chile, and in accordance with section 502(b)(7) of the Act, I have determined that Chile, which was previously designated as a beneficiary country, is not taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights. Therefore, I intend to notify the Congress of the United States and the Government of Chile of my intention to suspend indefinitely the GSP eligibility of Chile.
This determination shall be published in the Federal Register.
