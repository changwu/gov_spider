    Prominent Progressive Representing Black Hawk County Announces New Role at Waterloo Event with Sen. Sanders
WATERLOO, Iowa â€“ Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign on Friday in Waterloo named Black Hawk County Supervisor Chris Schwartz as an Iowa campaign co-chair.
"Bernie knows that even great ideas can only go so far without a mass movement behind them," Schwartz said. "That's why I'm proud to co-chair his Iowa campaign. He is the candidate who can generate the enthusiastic coalition required to beat Donald Trump, and the energetic activism required to push real change through Congress."
"As the state director of American Democratic Action and of one of the first elected LGBTQ Iowans, Chris knows what it's like to pioneer change in his community and is unafraid to take on tough fights," Bernie 2020 Iowa State Director Misty Rebik said. "We are proud he will be putting in the hard work in living rooms and town hall meetings and rallies over the home stretch of the caucus, and helping us inspire and connect with the everyday Iowans who are ready to put a champion of the working class in the White House."
Schwartz is the first openly gay elected in Black Hawk County history. He is also currently the State Director of American Democratic Action, which traces its roots back to Eleanor Roosevelt and the promise of the New Deal.
