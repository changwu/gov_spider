    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Sensenbrenner (R) Wisconsin and 12 cosponsors)
The Administration supports passage of H.R. 1702 if it is amended to:


    Assure that America's national security, international obligations, and foreign policies receive proper consideration in issuing licenses for Land Remote Sensing;


    Promote continued educational, scientific, and governmental access to land remote sensing data; and

Delete provisions which preempt issues currently being resolved in rulemaking or create concerns regarding program administration.

The amendments necessary to accomplish these objectives have been provided to the House Science Committee by the Administration.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 1702 would affect direct spending and receipts; therefore it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. This Office's preliminary estimate is that the net impact of H.R. 1702 on the deficit would be less than $500,000 per year.
