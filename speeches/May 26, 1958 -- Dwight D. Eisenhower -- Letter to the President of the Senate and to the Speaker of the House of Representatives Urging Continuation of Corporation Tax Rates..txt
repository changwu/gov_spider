    Dear__________:
The Budget Message in January recommended a continuation, without change, of the corporation income tax and excise tax rates which in the absence of legislation would be reduced on July 1. This recommendation is now renewed.
This renewed recommendation is made after consultation by the Secretary of the Treasury with leaders of both political parties in the Congress. Consideration of fiscal measures will continue to be made in the light of the developing economic situation and with full regard to both the short and long-range effects of any proposal.
The Administration deeply appreciates the thoughtful and full cooperation with which the leadership of both parties in the Congress has worked with us in these matters.
With kind regard,
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
