    MRS. NIXON and I join with fellow citizens across the country in mourning the death of Arthur Summerfield, and in expressing our deepest sympathy to his family.
He was a loyal and good friend. He was an ardent and dedicated Republican. He was devoted to his country, and in his service to both party and country he earned the high admiration of men and women from both sides of the political aisle. He will be remembered by history as a great American whose career was symbolic of the finest aspects of our national character.
