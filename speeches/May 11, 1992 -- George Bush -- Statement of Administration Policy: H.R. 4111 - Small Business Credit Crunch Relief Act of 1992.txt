    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(La Falce (D) New York and 24 others)
The Administration has demonstrated its support for small business by seeking additional supplemental funding for FY 1992 to support the Small Business Administration's "7(a)" General Business Loan Program. Given budgetary constraints, the proposed authorization levels in H.R. 4111 may be difficult to achieve without jeopardizing other high priority programs. The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 4111, but will seek amendments consistent with reforms proposed in the President's FY 1993 Budget.
