To the editor:
The extreme and divisive language and actions of many Republican candidates will do nothing but stall the progress of conservative policy by creating gridlock between parties.
Unlike candidates who are only about theatrics, John Kasich has proved that he can win in a swing state and work with both sides to make real changes.
As the governor of Ohio, Kasich has turned around the budget from an $8 billion debt to a $2 billion surplus, and he can bring both his balancing strategy and his ability to reach across the aisle to get the much-needed support to take action instead of yelling about it.
