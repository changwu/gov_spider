    The President welcomes Prime Minister Rudd’s announcement of Australia’s decision to increase its already significant military, civilian, and financial commitment to Afghanistan. Enhanced commitments like Australia’s are critical if we are to meet our shared goal of disrupting, dismantling, and defeating al Qaeda and its extremist allies and preventing Afghanistan from again becoming a safe haven.
The President spoke with Prime Minister Rudd on Tuesday evening, April 28, and thanked him for this substantial contribution, which will help support the upcoming Presidential election, accelerate and enhance the training of Afghan security forces, and bolster efforts to build and strengthen civilian institutions and advance opportunity for the Afghan people.
