    President Biden's economic plan is working. New data out today from the NFIB shows that as President Biden gets the pandemic under control, more small business are in a position to fully reopen, rehire, raise wages, and rebuild.
In the months prior to taking office, small business optimism was falling and the economy was in crisis. Thanks to President Biden's leadership, a robust vaccination campaign, and a historic relief package, optimism has increased by nearly 8 percent since January and the economy is now creating more than 600,000 jobs on average each month.
