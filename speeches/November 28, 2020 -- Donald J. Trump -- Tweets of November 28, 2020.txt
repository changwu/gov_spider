The 1,126,940 votes were created out of thin air. I won Pennsylvania by a lot, perhaps more than anyone will ever know. The Pennsylvania votes were RIGGED. All other swing states also. The world is watching!  https://t.co/zmnk34Ny23 Retweets: 73949Favorites: 264054

.@FoxNews daytime is virtually unwatchable, especially during the weekends. Watch @OANN, @newsmax, or almost anything else. You won't have to suffer through endless interviews with Democrats, and even worse!Retweets: 47532Favorites: 239517

The Wisconsin recount is not about finding mistakes in the count, it is about finding people who have voted illegally, and that case will be brought after the recount is over, on Monday or Tuesday. We have found many illegal votes. Stay tuned!Retweets: 60749Favorites: 275956

Specific allegations were made, and we have massive proof, in the Pennsylvania case. Some people just don't want to see it. They want nothing to do with saving our Country. Sad!!!Retweets: 61150Favorites: 292532

The number of ballots that our Campaign is challenging in the Pennsylvania case is FAR LARGER than the 81,000 vote margin. It's not even close. Fraud and illegality ARE a big part of the case. Documents being completed. We will appeal!Retweets: 69239Favorites: 350717
