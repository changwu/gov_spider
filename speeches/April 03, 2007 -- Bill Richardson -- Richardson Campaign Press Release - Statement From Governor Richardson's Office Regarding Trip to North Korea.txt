    Governor Bill Richardson's Office has issued the following statement today in response to the White House announcement about Governor Richardson's upcoming trip to North Korea:
"Governor Richardson is pleased to jointly head, along with former Secretary of Veterans Affairs Anthony Principi, a bipartisan delegation of Americans to facilitate the release of remains of US serviceman. Hopefully this trip will advance the progress made by the Bush Administration during the six-party talks to dismantle nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula. Dr. K.A. Anthony Namkung, a senior adviser to Governor Richardson, will be a member of the U.S. Delegation," said Gilbert Gallegos, a spokesman for Governor Richardson.
