    Today, the President and Vice President released their annual public financial disclosure reports to the American people.
These public filings help to prevent financial conflicts of interest by providing transparency about the assets of government officials.
Information about these finances are reported through annual disclosures, which are reviewed and certified by the independent Office of Government Ethics. Neither the President nor the Vice President have any conflicts of interest.
The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 requires high-level federal officials to publicly disclose their personal financial interests on OGE Form 278 and the President and Vice President are pleased to do so.
