    Former Biden supporter and senior Democrat in the Nevada Senate endorses Hillary
In a wave of momentum following a triumphant win in New Hampshire, the Clinton campaign today announced the endorsement of State Senator Bob Coffin (D-Clark County).
"Hillary Clinton is ready to bring the change that everyone knows we need and everyone wants," said State Senator Bob Coffin. "I have been an insurance broker for 39 years, and a Nevada legislator for 25 years, and I know our health care system is broken. Hillary is the only candidate who has the guts to deliver universal health care for all Nevadans - and our country. Hillary has the strength and experience to enact change on day one in the Oval Office."
The senior Democrat in the Nevada Senate, Coffin has a long and distinguished political career. Senator Coffin is the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate Taxation Committee. Senator Coffin served two years in the Nevada Assembly before his 1987 election to represent Clark County in the Nevada Senate. During his 25 years in the Legislature, Coffin has held numerous leadership positions, including terms as Chair of the powerful Senate Committee on Taxation and the Host Committee for Council of State Governments-West.
Last year, Senator Coffin received the Charles Dick Medal of Merit, honoring his work with the National Guard Association of the United States. Among many other personal achievements, Coffin has been recognized as an Outstanding Alumnus by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and as an Outstanding Hispanic Citizen by the state's Latin Chamber of Commerce.
"Senator Coffin has been a leading champion on the issues that matter to all Nevadans," said Clinton Nevada Chair Rory Reid. "Senator Coffin is not afraid of a fight and has been the leader in standing up against budget cuts in Nevada. It is an honor to have Senator Coffin on our team."
