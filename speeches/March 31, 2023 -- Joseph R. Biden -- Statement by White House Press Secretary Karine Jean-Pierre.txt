    The President is glad to see the Department of Justice is appealing the judge's decision, which blocks a key provision of the Affordable Care Act that has ensured free access to preventive health care for 150 million Americans. This case is yet another attack on the Affordable Care Act â€“ which has been the law of the land for 13 years and survived three challenges before the Supreme Court.
Preventive care saves lives, saves families money, and protects and improves our health. Because of the ACA, millions of Americans have access to free cancer and heart disease screenings. This decision threatens to jeopardize critical care.
The Administration will continue to fight to improve health care and make it more affordable for hard-working families, even in the face of attacks from special interests.
