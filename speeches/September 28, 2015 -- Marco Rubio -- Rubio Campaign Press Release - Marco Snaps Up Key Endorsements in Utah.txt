Representative Chris Stewart, a record-setting Air Force pilot and now second-term congressman, had this to say:
I believe our nation is at a tipping point in history. We have to get this right. No more dithering. No more weakness. Our nation desperately needs Marco's courageous leadership in the 21st century and I intend to do everything I can to help him.

State House Speaker Greg Hughes, who's represented Draper, Utah, since 2003, said, "Marco's conservative and inspirational leadership is what our country needs in the 21st century and I am proud to be on his team."
Lockhart, of Provo, said, "As someone who has worked in technology for the past 25 years, Marco's vision for a new American economy is exactly what our country needs and I am proud to support him."
