    The Clinton campaign announced today that Hillary Clinton will participate in the first Democratic primary debate in South Carolina on April 26, 2007.
"I'm excited to be part of this debate so that I can share my views with South Carolinians on how to move this country in the right direction," Clinton said. "I want to thank Congressman Jim Clyburn and the South Carolina Democratic Party for putting together this important exchange."
The debate will be held at 7:00 p.m. on the campus of South Carolina State University in Orangeburg, and is sponsored by the South Carolina Democratic Party. MSNBC will broadcast the debate live and stream it over the Internet.
Details of Clinton's South Carolina trip will be announced later.
