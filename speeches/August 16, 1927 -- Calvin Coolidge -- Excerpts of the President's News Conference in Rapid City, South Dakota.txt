    I think I remarked the other day that undoubtedly I shall have plenty of opportunities to work, some real and a good many fanciful. My college has just chosen a President, a young man as college presidents go, very promising, and I doubt very much if they are contemplating making any change. I should presume that the United States Steel Corporation would need an executive head during the next year and a half, which would probably prevent their waiting for my services, even though they thought that was desirable.
