    Ames, Iowa â€” Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has issued the following statement in response to Governor Tim Pawlenty's decision to drop out of the race for the Republican nomination for president:
"This morning I spoke with Governor Pawlenty to express my respect and admiration for him, and to wish him and his family well. Running for the presidency requires enormous self-sacrifice.
