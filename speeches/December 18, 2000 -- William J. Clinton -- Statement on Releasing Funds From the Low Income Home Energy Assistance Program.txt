    Today I am directing my administration to release $156 million to help low-income households throughout the Nation cope with substantial increases in home heating fuel costs. The significant and sustained rise in energy costs has posed a special burden on low-income families, in many cases forcing them to choose between food and other essentials or a bare minimum of heat in these winter months. Releasing these heating funds today will ease the burden on the Nation's low-income families by helping cover their higher home heating costs in the cold weeks and months to come.
