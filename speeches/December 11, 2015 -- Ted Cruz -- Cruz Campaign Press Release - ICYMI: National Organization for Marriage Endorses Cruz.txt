    HOUSTON, Texas â€” The National Organization for Marriage, one of the most active groups defending traditional marriage in state legislatures, Congress, and the courts, has endorsed Ted Cruz for President. Cruz, a supporter of NOM's Presidential Marriage Pledge, has a strong and proven record of standing up for religious liberty and the right of states to decide the definition of marriage.
"Sen. Ted Cruz is a proven champion for marriage and religious freedom and someone we can absolutely count on to fight to restore marriage to our nation's laws and defend the religious liberty of the tens of millions of Americans who believe that marriage is the union of one man and one woman," said Brian Brown, NOM's president. "Sen. Cruz has not only signed NOM's presidential marriage pledge committing to take specific actions as president, but he has personally authored the pending federal marriage amendment to restore the right of states to define marriage as one man/one woman. Moreover, he has spoken out consistently and forcefully on the campaign trail as an advocate of true marriage. We are pleased to endorse him and will do everything in our power to support his election."
"I am thrilled to have the support of the National Organization for Marriage," said Cruz. "They are a staunch defender of traditional marriage and religious liberty, and a critical voice in protecting our rights. It is encouraging that conservatives are continuing to coalesce around my campaign: fiscal, national security, and social conservatives absolutely must unite if we are going to win this election and take back the country. I am proud to stand with NOM and look forward to their help in our campaign."
