    Supporters Can Sign Up For Exclusive Behind The Scenes Footage of the Clintons on the Campaign Trail in Iowa
The Clinton campaign is offering supporters an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the Clintons' 4th of July trip through Iowa next week, with a new addition to the campaign trail--The HillCam.
The HillCam will follow Hillary and Bill Clinton as they travel from Des Moines to Davenport, capturing their spontaneous moments. Taking supporters beyond the headlines, the HillCam will offer an unvarnished look at the Clintons' first joint-campaigning of the 2008 race.

The HillCam is Clinton's latest groundbreaking effort on the Internet. Hillary's web video send-up of the "Sopranos" finale announcing her campaign song drew several million views on the Internet. More than 200,000 votes were cast online and 25,000 wrote-in to suggest their own song choices.
Throughout the campaign, Clinton has engaged Americans in new and innovative ways. She launched her candidacy with an online announcement and held a series of live video web chats with voters across the country. Since then, she has launched a text messaging program to reach supporters on their mobile phones and posted HillCast web videos on a range of policy proposals. The campaign has also launched www.HillaryHub.com to serve as a central repository for news, blogs and videos about Hillary's candidacy.
