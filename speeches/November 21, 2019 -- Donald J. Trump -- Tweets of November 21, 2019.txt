Why do @ShannonBream & @FoxNews waste airtime on Democrat Rep. Eric Swalwell who recently left the Presidential Primaries having attained a grand number of ZERO in the polls. I don't even know how that is possible. Fox should stay with the people that got them there not losers!Retweets: 12543Favorites: 49794

.....President before. What they are doing is not legal. But I'm clean and when I release my financial statement (my decision) sometime prior to Election it will only show one thing - that I am much richer than people even thought - And that is a good thing.

I never in my wildest dreams thought my name would in any way be associated with the ugly word Impeachment! The calls (Transcripts) were PERFECT there was NOTHING said that was wrong. No pressure on Ukraine. Great corruption & dishonesty by Schiff on the other side!Retweets: 20568Favorites: 88939

'The new House Resolution gives Adam Schiff (the most dishonest man in politics) the power unilaterally to release edited transcripts. Rule 10 gives Chairman Schiff absolutely no jurisdiction.

I have been watching people making phone calls my entire life. My hearing is and has been great. Never have I been watching a person making a call which was not on speakerphone and been able to hear or understand a conversation. I've even tried but to no avail.
