Dear Mr. Vogel:
I have your letter of March 17th and have studied the reasons which led the TVA Board to locate its new steam plant at the Edgemoor site. The main one you cite-the capital saving of $30 million--would seem to provide a firm base for your decision.
I am of course anxious to utilize every weapon of government to attack the labor surplus problem in places like East Kentucky. The TVA is in the business of resource development and I want to feel that in your future thinking on the continuing problems of the valley region, you will be giving thought to the problems which go beyond the production and sale of power.
We need much creative thinking in this area and the TVA has stood in the past for original and bold thinking. This vigorous and imaginative momentum must be continued.
Sincerely yours,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
