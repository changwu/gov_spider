    BETTY and I would like to express our sorrow over the unexpected death of Richard J. Daley, mayor of the city of Chicago. Mayor Daley has been a dominant force in American politics for many years. His career of public service at the State and city level and his participation in national legislation and policies reflect his strong belief in and dedication to the vitality of the American cities.
Though controversial at times, he has been a towering figure in the American scene and will be long remembered by the people of Chicago, of Illinois, and of the Nation.
