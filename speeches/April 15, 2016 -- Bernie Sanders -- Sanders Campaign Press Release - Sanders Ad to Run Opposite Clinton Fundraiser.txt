The Sanders ad, called "$27," focuses on the average contribution to the senator's grassroots campaign. Clinton is asking donors to raise $353,400 to get a seat next to her at the head table during two California fundraisers.
"If you can't afford to attend tonight's event with Secretary Clinton, we invite you to join Bernie's fundraiser for the low price of turning on your television," said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager.
Sanders' spot, his first in the state, will run tonight in San Francisco and tomorrow in Los Angeles at approximately 8pm PST, just as Secretary Clinton's wealthy donors are sitting down for dinner.
