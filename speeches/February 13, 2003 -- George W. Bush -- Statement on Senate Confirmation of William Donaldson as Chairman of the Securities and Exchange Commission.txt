    I applaud the Senate for acting quickly to confirm William Donaldson to be the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In this new role, he will continue to crack down on corporate wrongdoing, work to protect investors, and restore confidence in our capital markets. I also thank Chairman Shelby, Senator Sarbanes, and the Senate leadership and commend them for their efforts.
