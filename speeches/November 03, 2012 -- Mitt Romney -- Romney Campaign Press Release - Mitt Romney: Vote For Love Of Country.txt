He told his supporters, voting for ‘revenge.' Vote for ‘revenge'? Let me tell you what I'd like to tell you: vote for love of country. It is time we lead America to a better place." — Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "Yesterday, the President said something you may have heard by now, that I think surprised a lot of people. Speaking to an audience, he said voting is the best revenge. He told his supporters, voting for ‘revenge.' Vote for ‘revenge'? Let me tell you what I'd like to tell you: vote for love of country. It is time we lead America to a better place. Now, if there's anybody there who's worried about the last four years and wondered if they're the best we can do, who fears that the American dream is fading away, if anyone wonders whether good jobs and better take-home pay are out there, I've got a clear and unequivocal message for you and that is that America is about to come roaring back. And you saw the differences, you saw the differences between Barack Obama and me in those debates. I like those debates, I've got to be honest. I mean, he says it has to be this way. I say it can't stay this way. He's offering excuses. I'm offering a plan. I can't wait to get started. He wants to convince you to settle, but Americans don't settle, we dream, we aspire, we reach for greater things and we will achieve greater things with new leadership."
