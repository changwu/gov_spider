My apologies for the mistake, as always check against the official transcript (first-time pooler)
"Some people would like to see New York quarantined because it's a hotspot — New York, New Jersey maybe one or two other places, certain parts of Connecticut quarantined. I'm thinking about that right now. We might not have to do it but there's a possibility that sometime today we'll do a quarantine — short term — two weeks for New York, probably New Jersey, certain parts of Connecticut." -- POTUS
