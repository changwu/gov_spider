    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Abercrombie (D) Hawaii and Rep. Kildee (D) Michigan)
The Administration supports H.R. 4904 as reported, which would affirm and acknowledge the political relationship between the United States and Native Hawaiians. By clarifying the political status of Native Hawaiians, this bill would acknowledge the right of Native Hawaiians to self-governance over their own internal affairs. The Administration is committed to working with the Native Hawaiian people and the Congress to implement the steps to Federal recognition, self-governance, and self-determination of the Native Hawaiian people outlined in this bill. In addition, the Administration plans to work with the Senate to address some remaining technical concerns.
