    Thank you very, very much, Tom and Mrs. Boardman. It is wonderful to stop by and see all these kings and queens and to see so many couples that are celebrating their 50th wedding anniversaries. Betty and I are hoping to enjoy our 28th on October 15, and we hope to celebrate our 50th in what--22 years thereafter. That is the new math that I learned. [Laughter]
But it's great to be here, and particularly at the invitation of Tom Boardman and the Cleveland Press that I understand has sponsored this fine occasion-for the 41st year, is it? I think that is tremendous, and I compliment the Cleveland Press. I've had the opportunity, as you all know, to travel around the country a good bit, and I meet lots of wonderful people. But the people that impress me the most are people like yourselves, who for 50 years have enjoyed the company of one another, who for 50 years have worked together to make a great contribution not only to your individual lives, but to the lives of your children, your neighbors, and your friends. This is, to me, something that is at the epitome, is at the height of the nice things that happen in this country.
So, I wish each and every one of you a good many more years together, because what you have contributed in the past, not only to yourself but to your community, to your friends, and everyone else, is just the best of this great country.
So, I wish you a good many years more of love, a good many more years of friendship, and a good many more years of the very best of health.
Thank you very, very much.
