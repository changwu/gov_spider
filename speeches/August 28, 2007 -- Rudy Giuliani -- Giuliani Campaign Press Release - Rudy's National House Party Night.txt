    Join Rudy on Wednesday, September 26th for his National House Party Night! We are asking supporters nationwide to host parties for Rudy and help raise money for the campaign.
Will you raise $1,000, $500, or even $250 for Rudy? It's easier than you think. If you have 10 friends give only $100, $50, or $25 each, you've reached your goal!
To show his appreciation for your hard work, every party will be able to access a live web cast with Mayor Giuliani.
In the coming days you'll be able to sign up and manage your party online, but until then, download this form to register your party and get started today!
