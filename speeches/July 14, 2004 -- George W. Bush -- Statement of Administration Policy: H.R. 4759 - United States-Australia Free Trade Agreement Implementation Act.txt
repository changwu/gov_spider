    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. DeLay (R) TX and Rep. Rangel (D) NY)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 4759, which will approve and implement the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement (FTA), as signed by the United States and Australia on May 18, 2004.
The U.S.-Australia FTA advances U.S. national economic interests and meets the negotiating principles and objectives set out by the Congress in the Trade Act of 2002. The Agreement enhances our close trade relationship with Australia and will further open Australia's market for U.S. manufactured goods, agricultural products, and services. As soon as the FTA enters into force, tariffs will be eliminated on nearly all manufactured goods traded with Australia. In addition, Australia will eliminate tariffs on all exports of U.S. agricultural products.
The U.S.-Australia FTA further solidifies our relationship with an important partner in the global economy and a strategic ally. It sets a strong example of the benefits of free trade and democracy. Opening markets is part of the President's six-point plan for continuing to strengthen America's economy and to create more opportunities for American workers and farmers.
