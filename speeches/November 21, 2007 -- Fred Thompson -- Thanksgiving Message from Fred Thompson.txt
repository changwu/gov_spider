    McLean, VA - Senator Thompson today released the following Thanksgiving message:
"Twenty-five years ago this week, in his Thanksgiving Proclamation, Ronald Reagan wrote that America was set apart from other nations in an uncommon way.
"He said that it was his belief that 'a divine plan placed this great continent here between the oceans to be found by people from every corner of the Earth, who had a special love of faith and freedom.'
"America's love of faith and freedom is as strong today as it was 25 years ago, or indeed 225 years ago.
"We are in a political season now, and sometimes it might feel that there is much that divides us. But as we give thanks this week, let us all remember that no matter your political views or affiliations, we are all Americans and we are united by our core beliefs.
"And let us also pause to give special thanks and praise to the men and women of our Armed Forces and their families, stationed across the globe. If you are home today with your friends and family, take time to pray for those in uniform, whose sacrifice for our nation is as boundless as our love of the freedoms they fight to protect.
"The Thompson family wishes you a safe and joyous Thanksgiving. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you."
