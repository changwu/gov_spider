    Little Rock, AR – Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee scored a major win in Kansas today, adding the Sunflower State's GOP Caucuses to his victory column.
"Earlier this morning, I said I didn't major in math, I majored in miracles. It looks like my victory in Kansas is one of them," said Huckabee.
"It was an important victory, especially after the pundits spent the past few days saying this campaign is over. Kansas said not so fast," agreed Campaign Manager Chip Saltsman.
Under Kansas' rules, Huckabee will get at least 24 out of 36 delegates up for grabs from the Sunshine State. Early reports indicate that the former Arkansas governor is winning a majority of the delegates and congressional districts.
"I'm delighted that the good people of Kansas honored me with their vote. They, like people in the other 26 states who were not a part of Super Tuesday, deserve to have their voice heard -- and I am grateful for their support," said Huckabee, who also received a key endorsement from the Kansas Right to Life chapter last week.
Huckabee said momentum is going his way – during the past 24 hours, he has raised a quarter million dollars – the most he has raised in that amount of time in the campaign
Yesterday, he conducted a whirlwind tour of Kansas, with cheering rallies and events in Kansas City, Wichita, Topeka, and Garden City. Those efforts paid off, he said.
"The voters of Kansas spoke today – they spoke with one voice: they said I am the authentic conservative in this race. Clearly, I am pleased by these results, but it is onward and upward to Virginia and Maryland as we head into the Potomac primaries on Tuesday," said Huckabee.
