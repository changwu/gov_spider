His official Twitter account linked to an online video that ominously references the deaths of Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan and depicts Iranian speedboats about to crash into a U.S. Navy vessel. Khamenei's video ended a week in which he told an audience in Tehran that Israel would not exist in twenty five years.
Yet, despite the vivid threats and the evidence of chaos as Iran sows instability throughout the Middle East, President Obama and his enablers in the U.S. Senate continue to claim that their deal will not benefit Iran's terrorism apparatus and that it is in our national interest.
Despite the willingness of Democrats to provide cover for the White House, we still have an opportunity to put the Senate on record. Instead of just giving up and conceding defeat, I've argued that we need to try everything in our power to prevent a flawed deal that will have devastating consequences for American security from taking effect.
