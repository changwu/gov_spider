    Scott Becomes 20th Congressional Black Caucus Member to Back Biden
After Joe Biden won the South Carolina primary, Virginia Congressman Bobby Scott announced he is endorsing Joe Biden for President of United States and released the following statement:
"Our nation is at a crossroads and we cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump's reckless leadership. Democrats must nominate a strong, steady leader who can unite our party and nation to defeat Donald Trump this November. Joe Biden is that leader who can fix the mess that Trump will leave behind. Joe has been tested time and time again, and has earned the support and trust of a broad coalition of voters. On all the most urgent issues of our time – health care, voting rights, criminal justice reform, student debt, national security – Joe has the vision to get the job done and move our country forward. He has been doing that his whole life, as a senator, statesman, and President Obama's vice president. Joe is the candidate who can deliver real, concrete progress. Joe Biden is the right choice to defeat Donald Trump and to deliver results for all Americans, from day one."
Congressman Scott joins former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe who also announced his endorsement tonight. Congressman Scott is the 20th Congressional Black Caucus member to back Biden and joins his colleagues Congressman Donald McEachin and Congresswoman Elaine Luria. Additionally, other Virginia leaders have endorsed Biden, including Senator Tim Kaine Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, Roanoke Mayor Sherman Lea, Virginia State Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw, and other state legislators and local leaders.
In total, Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,400 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
