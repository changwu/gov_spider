    On March 23 I signed Executive Order 12044, creating a program to reform the regulatory process. We have now passed the first milestone in this effort.
Each executive agency that issues regulations has just published new procedures in the FEDERAL REGISTER, as well as lists of existing regulations proposed for "sunset" reviews.
These new procedures require that future regulations be written in plain English and be signed by the officials who issue themâ€”and that they minimize the burden on the public.
Public comment on the new procedures and lists is due by late July, so that they can be revised in time to go into effect this fall.
I urge the public to give us its advice on whether the new procedures will do the job and whether we have selected the right targets for "sunset" review. We need public participation to make regulatory reform work.
