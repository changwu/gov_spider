    The President. Well, [it] was a pleasure to see you all again. Much has happened since we last met, and I'm looking forward to reviewing developments with all of you.
We have much to thank you for. The political and military pressure you've applied, I think, is showing results. The Sandinistas have now signed a peace agreement based on democracy in Nicaragua, and we'll be watching carefully to see if they really comply. Without the freedom fighters, they will have no incentives to implement the measures they've said that they will implement.
We have not yet decided on the format of our next funding request, but we intend to see that you have adequate funding until a cease-fire is in place and a verifiable process of democratization is underway.
Reporter. Mr. President, are you aware of the situation in the Philippines? There's apparently been a mutiny against President Aquino.
The President. I have just heard word of that and have no further details on it.
Q. Are you going to go for this escrow account idea for contra funding, sir?
The President. We're going to have a meeting here, and they will be holding a press conference later, and we'll be issuing a statement.
Q. But you're not going to let them die, are you? You're not going to let the movement die?
The President. No, no.
Q. How are your allergies, sir? Have you met with the doctor yet?
The President. You must be able to hear that I'm not my usual high tenor. [Laughter]
