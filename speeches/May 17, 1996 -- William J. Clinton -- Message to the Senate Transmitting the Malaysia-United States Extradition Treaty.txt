    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Malaysia, and a related exchange of notes signed at Kuala Lumpur on August 3, 1995.
I transmit also for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. As the report explains, the Treaty will not require further implementing legislation.
This Treaty will, upon entry into force, enhance cooperation between the law enforcement communities of both countries. It will thereby make a significant contribution to international law enforcement efforts.
The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content of extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States. Upon entry into force of this Treaty, the Extradition Treaty between the United States and Great Britain signed at London December 22, 1931, will cease to have effect, with certain exceptions, between the United States and Malaysia.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, May 17, 1996.
