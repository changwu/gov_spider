    Elections are won in the critical early stages of the campaign by laying the groundwork and building a national grassroots organization that reaches voters and turns out the vote. Any candidate legitimately seeking the presidency must be committed to building the grassroots infrastructure required to win in 2016. Over the past few months, our campaign has been building a top-notch, formidable operation that will propel us to victory.
Here are a few of the highlights:
Jeb's strong support from federal, state and local officials across the country is simply unmatched in this race and continues to grow day by day.
From tailgating at SEC football games to building grassroots teams on college campuses, Jeb's working hard to win every vote and engage the next generation of young leaders.
And we continue to invest in early state infrastructure with 37 paid staffers and 7 offices.
We're thankful for our thousands of supporters and hardworking volunteers who have made this all possible. Together, we've already reached over one million voters. We're just getting started.
Join the winning team now.
