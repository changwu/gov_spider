    America's children represent our greatest hope for the future. I commend the House for its bipartisan passing of the "Unborn Victims of Violence Act," which will make it a separate felony to harm an unborn child in the course of committing any one of 68 Federal offenses. This legislation affirms our commitment to a culture of life, which welcomes and protects children.
