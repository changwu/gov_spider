    Enough.
We are 48 days into the year and our Nation has already suffered at least 73 mass shootings. Thoughts and prayers aren't enough. Gun violence is an epidemic and Congress must act now.
Jill and I are mourning for the six killed in today's violence in Tate County, Mississippi, as we have for far too many Americans. We grieve with their families and with Americans nationwide as gun violence claims yet more lives. We are also praying for the recovery of those injured in this horrendous attack and for survivors who will carry both grief and trauma with them for the rest of their lives.
Federal law enforcement is in close touch with State and local authorities, and I've directed that all Federal support be made available.
We need—need—commonsense gun law reforms. That includes requiring background checks on all gun sales, banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, fully closing the "boyfriend loophole" to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, requiring safe storage of guns, and eliminating immunity for gun manufacturers who knowingly put weapons of war on our streets.
These are commonsense steps that Congress could take right now and save lives. We owe action to American communities being torn apart by gun violence.
