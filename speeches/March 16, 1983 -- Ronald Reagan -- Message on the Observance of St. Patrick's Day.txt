    It is with great pleasure and happiness that Nancy and I wish everyone a wonderful St. Patrick's Day.
On this special occasion, the "wearin' of the green" reminds the Reagan family of the adventurous souls of Erin who through the years have traveled to these shores. Their spirit and joy of life have not only benefitted generations that followed, but blessed this bountiful land with the qualities of wit and dedication we associate so affectionately with the Irish.
St. Patrick's faith and idealism kindled a fire that burns even today in the minds of Irish men and women. It is a flame of faith that, joined with the Irish love of liberty and laughter, song and scholarship, has left an unforgettable mark on Ireland, America, and the world.
This St. Patrick's Day is a time for all Americans to honor the innumerable contributions of Irish Americans to our nation. May they always cultivate their rich heritage and may Americans never forget their bonds with that green land of fair hills, soft rain, and kindly hearts across the sea.
