    Improving education for all of America's schoolchildren is one of my highest priorities, and an important part of this effort is improving education for students with disabilities. The "Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004" will help children learn better by promoting accountability for results, enhancing parental involvement, using proven practices and materials, providing more flexibility, and reducing paperwork burdens for teachers, States, and local school districts.
Like all students, children with disabilities have the best chance to pursue America's great promise with a good education. My administration will continue to work to provide this opportunity to all Americans, who expect and deserve an outstanding education system.
This legislation shows that we can accomplish a great deal when we work together, and I commend the Congress for this bipartisan achievement. I look forward to signing it into law.
