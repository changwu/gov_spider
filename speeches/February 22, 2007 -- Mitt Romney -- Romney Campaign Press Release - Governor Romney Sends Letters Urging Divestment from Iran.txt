Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney released a letter sent to New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli urging that he pursue "a policy of strategic disinvestment from companies linked to the Iranian regime." Letters urging support for this policy were also sent to New York Governor Eliot Spitzer and United States Senators Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer.
In his letter, Governor Romney wrote:
"With your new responsibilities overseeing one of America's largest pension funds, you have a unique opportunity to lead an effort to isolate Iran as it pursues nuclear armament. I request that you immediately launch a policy of strategic disinvestment from companies linked to the Iranian regime. Screening pension investments and divesting from companies providing financial support to the Iranian regime or linked to Iran's weapons programs and terrorist activities could have a powerful impact. New investments should be scrutinized as long as Iran's regime continues its current, dangerous course."
Governor Romney believes that for the United States, there are few more urgent priorities than standing up to the Iranian government's dangerous actions. Eliminating financial support for this regime is a critical first step and will support future efforts.
Today's letters build on the five-point strategy to prevent a nuclear Iran that Governor Romney laid out earlier this year at the annual Herzliya Conference in Israel. As part of that strategy, Governor Romney called for further economic isolation of Iran by pursuing, in part, pension fund divestment. In January 2007, Governor Romney also helped arrange a meeting between former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Massachusetts State Treasurer Timothy P. Cahill to discuss divestment of pension funds.
