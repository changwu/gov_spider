    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Gilman (R) NY and 47 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2909, as reported by the House Committee on International Relations. H.R. 2909 would implement the 1993 Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, an international agreement calling for a central authority in each country to supervise intercountry adoptions. The Administration supports designation of the Department of State as the United States central authority under the Convention, but believes that responsibility for oversight of accreditation of intercountry adoption service providers should be assigned to the Department of Health and Human Services. As the bill is currently drafted, the Department of State would have this responsibility.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 2909 would affect receipts; therefore, is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is that it would increase receipts by $1.3 million per year. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
