    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, I am transmitting the District of Columbia Government's fiscal year 1994 budget amendment request and fiscal year 1993 supplemental budget amendment request.
The District of Columbia Government has submitted a request to decrease its fiscal year 1994 general fund spending authority by $36.968 million with a reduction of 832 FTE positions. In addition, the District's fiscal year 1993 supplemental amendment request includes an increase of $7.367 million in general fund spending authority. The amendments are needed to address a projected operating deficit for fiscal year 1993 and fiscal year 1994 that was not addressed in the District's original budget submission pending congressional action.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, September 13, 1993.
