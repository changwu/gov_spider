    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Senator Conrad (D) ND and 11 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of S. J. Res. 4, a resolution to disapprove the rule submitted by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) with respect to establishing minimal risk regions and reopening the Canadian border for beef and cattle imports. USDA's rule is the product of a multi-year, deliberative, transparent, and science-based process to ensure that human and animal health are fully protected. S.J. Res. 4, which would prevent the reopening of our Canadian border, would cause continued serious economic disruption of the U.S. beef and cattle industry, undermine U.S. efforts to ensure that international trade standards are based on science, and impede ongoing U.S. efforts to reopen foreign markets now closed to U.S. beef exports. If S. J. Res. 4 were presented to the President, he would veto the bill.
