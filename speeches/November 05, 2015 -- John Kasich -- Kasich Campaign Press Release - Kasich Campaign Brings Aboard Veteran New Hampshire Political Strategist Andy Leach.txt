Leach experience includes work for the NH campaigns of Mitt Romney, John E. Sununu, Gordon Humphrey, Kelly Ayotte, Scott Brown, and Scott Walker
Today, the Kasich for America campaign announced that it has brought aboard veteran Republican political strategist Andy Leach as a senior advisor in New Hampshire.
For more than two decades, Leach has provided his strategic leadership to campaigns at all levels, including Presidential, Gubernatorial, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House races. His resume includes his work for the New Hampshire campaigns of Mitt Romney, Sen. John E. Sununu, Sen. Gordon Humphrey, Sen. Scott Brown, Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Gov. Scott Walker. In addition, Leach twice served as executive director of the New Hampshire Republican Party, and with Leach at the helm of the party in the 2010 elections, Republicans saw historic success and a record number of victories in New Hampshire.
Said Kasich for America campaign manager Beth Hansen, "With the addition of Andy Leach, the Kasich New Hampshire team – already the strongest in the state – just got stronger. For more than twenty years, Andy has been a significant factor in virtually every important Republican campaign in New Hampshire, and we are very happy to welcome him aboard."
