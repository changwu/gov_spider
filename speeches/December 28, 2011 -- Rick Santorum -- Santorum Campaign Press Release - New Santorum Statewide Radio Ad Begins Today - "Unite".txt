Seven candidates running for President, but only one consistent conservative - Rick Santorum. A father of seven, a homeschooler, and a devoted husband for 21 years - Rick Santorum has been a passionate pro-family conservative for decades. He wrote the law that ended partial-birth abortions; led the fight to reform the welfare system, ending abuse and moving millions from welfare to work; and Santorum wrote critical legislation that protects America from the threat of a nuclear Iran. Sarah Palin praised Santorum for protecting the sanctity of life. Mike Huckabee said he loves Santorum's conviction. And Rush Limbaugh said it would be "great" if Santorum became president. And Rick is endorsed by Iowa conservatives like Bob Vander Plaats and Sam Clovis. Now it's time for all conservatives to unite and support Rick Santorum for President. Visit RickSantorum.com.
