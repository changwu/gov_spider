    Today, Georgia Congressman Hank Johnson (GA-4) released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"I watched with amusement as the press tried to declare Joe's campaign dead. And I was not surprised when he proved all the doubters wrong. In Georgia's Fourth District, we know Joe. And we also know that no one has demonstrated the ability to excite voters, unite the country and win like Joe. The character, empathy, and grace that Joe has shown over the course of his life, and years in public office, make him the perfect person for the moment at hand and the task before us. The primary on March 24th is Georgia's opportunity to make its mark on this process. I'm proud to endorse Joe Biden. He's the best Democrat for the job."
Congressman Johnson joins scores of Members of Congress in endorsing Biden this week with more than 80 U.S. Representatives and 13 U.S. Senators, including the most endorsements from members of both the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Johnson's endorsement also adds to the growing momentum Joe Biden has established in Georgia and the South. He joins Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, Georgia Congressman Sanford Bishop, State Rep. Calvin Smyre, Georgia State Rep. Billy Mitchell, Georgia State Rep. Pedro Marin, Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin, Senator Doug Jones, Alabama Congresswoman Terri Sewell, and other community leaders. Congressman Johnson is also part of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.
Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,700 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
