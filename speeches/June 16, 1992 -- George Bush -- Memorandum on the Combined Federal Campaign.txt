    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
The Combined Federal Campaign is an avenue through which thousands of Federal employees voluntarily express their concern for others.
I am delighted to inform you that Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander and Administrator of the Small Business Administration Patricia F. Saiki have agreed to serve as co-chairs of the 1992 Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area. I ask that you support Administrator Saiki and Secretary Alexander by personally chairing the campaign in your agency and appointing a top official as your vice chairman.
Your commitment and visible support will help to guarantee a successful campaign this year. Together, we must do everything we can to encourage Federal employees everywhere to do their part in support of the 1992 Combined Federal Campaign.
George Bush
