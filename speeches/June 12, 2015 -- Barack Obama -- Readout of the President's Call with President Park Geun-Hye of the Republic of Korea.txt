    President Obama spoke by phone yesterday evening with President Park Geun-Hye of the Republic of Korea (ROK) to express his understanding of President Park's decision to postpone her planned June 16 visit to the White House. The President and President Park agreed that the visit would be rescheduled so that the two leaders can discuss important issues of mutual interest, including our joint efforts to counter the North Korean nuclear and missile threat and the crucial role the ROK plays in maintaining peace and stability in the region. President Obama also offered condolences to the Korean people and the families of those who have lost their lives during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak. He underscored that the United States stands ready to provide additional assistance as needed.
