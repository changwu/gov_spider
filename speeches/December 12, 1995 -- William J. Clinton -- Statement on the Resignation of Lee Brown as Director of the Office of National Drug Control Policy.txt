    It is with regret that I have accepted the decision of Dr. Lee Brown, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, to return to private life and a teaching position. As Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy and as a former police officer, Dr. Brown has devoted much of his life and the entirety of the past 2 1/2 years to fighting the scourge of drugs in America.
My administration is strongly committed to the battle against drugs, which will never be over until every child in America knows that drug use is dangerous, illegal, and wrong. We still have far to go, but under Dr. Brown's stewardship, we have made solid progress: cracking down on the international drug trade by breaking the powerful Cali drug cartel, calling for drug testing of high school athletes, toughening punishment of drug-related violence, and challenging the entertainment industry and sports figures to do their part to speak out about the dangers of drugs.
I am grateful for Dr. Brown's good service and for the groundwork that he has laid. My administration will not rest until every young American knows the difference between right and wrong when it comes to drug use.
