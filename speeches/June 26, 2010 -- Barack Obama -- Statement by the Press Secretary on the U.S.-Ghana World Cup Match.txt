    President Obama and President Mills are eagerly anticipating the World Cup match between the United States and Ghana this afternoon. They reaffirm the strong ties between the people of our two countries, including our shared passion on the soccer field, and have agreed that when they next meet they will exchange team jerseys in the spirit of camaraderie and sportsmanship that they look forward to seeing on the playing field later today.
