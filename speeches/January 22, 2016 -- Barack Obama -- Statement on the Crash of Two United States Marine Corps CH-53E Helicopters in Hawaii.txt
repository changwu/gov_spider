    On behalf of all Americans, Michelle and I extend our deepest sympathies to the families of the 12 Marines missing from an apparent helicopter accident along the Hawaiian coast. As we mourn this loss, we are reminded of the sacrifice men and women of our Armed Forces make each day for the freedom and security of their fellow Americans. The willingness of our troops to complete dangerous training to prepare for any mission our Nation asks of them will not be forgotten.
The spirit of our missing Marines was reflected in the actions of the many dozens of servicemembers and others in Hawaii who searched day and night for the downed helicopters. Communities from coast to coast are mourning these Marines, and our Nation is forever grateful for their patriotism, service, and sacrifice. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and loved ones at this difficult hour.
