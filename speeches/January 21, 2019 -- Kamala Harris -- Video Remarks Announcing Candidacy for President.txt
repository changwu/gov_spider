    Truth, Justice, Decency, Equality, Freedom, Democracy.
These aren't just words.
They're the values we as Americans cherish...
and they're all on the line now.
The future of our country depends on you and millions of others lifting our voices to fight for our American values.

That's why I'm running for president of the United States.
I'm running to lift those voices.
To bring our voices together.
So please join me in Oakland on Sunday, January 27th and go to KamalaHarris.org to join our campaign.
Let's do this together.
Let's claim our future.
For ourselves.
For our children.
And for our country.
I'll see you in Oakland.
