  A Proclamation

Diabetes is a serious and widespread public health problem, resulting from the inability of the body to convert nutrients into energy. This debilitating and often fatal disease affects about 10 million Americans and is occurring among all age and socioeconomic groups at an increasing rate. More than 35,000 people die from diabetes every year, and the disease contributes to deaths from heart attack, stroke, kidney failure and blood vessel disorders. It is the leading cause of new blindness. The cost of diabetes is measured in the billions of dollars, but by far the highest price is paid in the suffering and shortened life span of its victims.
Fortunately, there is hope. Through advances in medical research, we are learning more about diabetes, its cause, and improved methods for its control and management. Prospects for better prevention and treatment appear brighter than at any time since the discovery of insulin more than 50 years ago.
I am pleased that in cooperation with private, voluntary organizations, the Federal Government plays a valuable role in support of this research. It is my fervent hope that continued efforts will improve the quality of life for all our Nation's diabetics and eventually lead to the prevention and cure of this difficult and cruel disease.
Now, Therefore, L Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning October 4 through October 10, 1981, as National Diabetes Week, and I call upon the people of the United States to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.

RONALD REAGAN
