    I welcome today's release of Paul Rusesabagina by the Government of Rwanda. Paul's family is eager to welcome him back to the United States, and I share their joy at today's good news.
I thank the Rwandan Government for making this reunion possible, and I also thank the Government of Qatar for facilitating Paul's release and return to the United States. I add my gratitude to those across the U.S. Government who have worked with the Government of Rwanda to achieve today's happy outcome.
