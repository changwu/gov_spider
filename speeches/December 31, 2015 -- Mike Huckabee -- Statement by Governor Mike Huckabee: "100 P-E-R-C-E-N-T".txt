    I am preparing for a kickoff of our "Americans First" tour in Iowa on Saturday. As I get ready, I wanted to share some important stats with you about Iowa, so you can understand what we have been building for.
Since we began our campaign in May we have held 125 grassroots events in Iowa alone! Looking ahead to January we have scheduled over 150 events and we are still adding events every day!
Our Iowa grassroots team made over 20,000 volunteer calls in the month of December. 20,000! We have over 300 volunteer county leaders PLUS we will have 25 full time staff in Iowa in January and a growing number of part time staff PLUS we have dozens of volunteers coming in from all over the country.
So what does all of that mean?
We are 100% committed to winning Iowa .
