    Alexandria, VA â€” Today, Senator Lindsey Graham released the following statement in response to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's remarks on the Obama-Clinton Iran deal and her plan to deal with Iran beyond the agreement:
"Today, Secretary Clinton outlined a proposal that she believes would put the Iranian regime, with its leader just today referring to our nation as 'Satan' and claiming it has 'ousted' America, back in the box should they break-out. This nuclear deal gives the Iranians a knife and she is proposing a plan to stop them from using it. It is nothing short of absurd to give Iran the knife in the first place and as president, I would restore the type of strong American leadership we need to be able to get a better deal. The bottom line is that this Obama-Clinton Iranian nuclear deal puts an enormous amount of trust in a dangerous regime and those who support this deal are putting America, and our allies, at grave risk."
