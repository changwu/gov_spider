    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am writing concerning the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and Chile. The GSP program is authorized by the Trade Act of 1974, as amended ("the Act").
I intend to suspend indefinitely Chile's status as a GSP beneficiary for failure to comply with section 502(b)(7) (19 U.S.C. 2462(b)(7)) of the Act concerning internationally recognized worker rights. My decision will take effect at least 60 days from the date of this letter.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
