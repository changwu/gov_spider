    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that Susan Combs, the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, will serve as the campaign's Texas State Chair. In her role, Combs will lead the campaign's efforts in the state.
Prior to her successful election last fall, Combs served as the state's Agriculture Commissioner for two terms. As Commissioner, Combs built an impressive record of fiscal conservatism by lowering her agency's budget without reducing essential services, while providing better access to government services.
"Rudy's remarkable record as Mayor of New York City demonstrates his commitment to fiscal discipline, his belief in lower taxes and his ability to achieve real accomplishments," said Combs. "He is the best candidate to win next November, and Texans know his leadership and vision will serve our nation well."
"We're glad to have an accomplished public servant like Susan leading our Texas team," said Michael DuHaime, Giuliani's National Campaign Manager. "She will be a strong advocate for the Mayor's vision and help us as we continue growing our campaign in states all across America."
