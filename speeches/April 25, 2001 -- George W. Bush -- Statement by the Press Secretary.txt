    President George W. Bush announced today that Opening Day for his South Lawn tee ball initiative will be held on Sunday, May 6, at 3:00 p.m. The first game will be between the Capitol City League Rockies and the Satchell Paige League Memphis Red Sox. Both teams are from the Washington, DC area. The announcer for the game will be Bob Costas and the Famous San Diego Chicken will also attend the game.
Earlier this year, the President and First Lady announced that they will host a series of tee ball games for children on the South Lawn. The President hopes that this initiative will spur interest in baseball and will help promote America's national pastime to people of all ages.
