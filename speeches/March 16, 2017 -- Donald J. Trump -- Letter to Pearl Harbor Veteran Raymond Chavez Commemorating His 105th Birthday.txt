    Dear Mr. Chavez, 
It is an honor to join your friends and family in wishing you a happy 105th birthday!
I also join your many admirers in thanking you for your service to the United States of America. As the oldest living survivor of Pearl Harbor, your remarkable story is treasured by our Nation, and the sacrifices you made in service to our country should fill you with tremendous pride.
From your humble beginning in San Bernardino, California, to the front lines at Pearl Harbor, your undaunted courage, love of country, and unwavering commitment to freedom earned you the eternal respect and gratitude of the American people.
Our Nation owes the Greatest Generation—your generation—a tremendous debt of gratitude for an extraordinary legacy of liberty and freedom around the world. It is a debt that our country can never repay. The values for which you so nobly fought have ensured security and prosperity for millions of people.
Melania and I want to join your friends and loved ones in honoring and thanking you for your service to our great Nation.
Our very best wishes for health and happiness in the coming year.
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
