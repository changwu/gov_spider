    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to bring the war in Iraq to an end and reverse the potentially devastating effects of global warming," Kennedy said. "I watched proudly as Hillary won over New Yorkers across the state in her race for the Senate seat my father once held. Since then, she's been reelected in a landslide victory and proven that she is ready to lead this nation from her first day in office. Hillary will inspire the real change America needs."
"Bobby has worked tirelessly to protect our environment and raise awareness about the dangers of global warming and pollution," Clinton said. "I'm deeply honored to have his support and counsel."
Kennedy serves as Chief Prosecuting Attorney for the Hudson Riverkeeper and President of Waterkeeper Alliance. He is also a Clinical Professor and Supervising Attorney at Pace University School of Law's Environmental Litigation Clinic and is co-host of Ring of Fire on Air America Radio. Earlier in his career he served as Assistant District Attorney in New York City.
In recognition of his environmental efforts, Time Magazine named him one of its "Heroes for the Planet" for his success leading the fight to restore the Hudson River.
Kennedy is scheduled to campaign for Clinton at stops in eastern Iowa today.
