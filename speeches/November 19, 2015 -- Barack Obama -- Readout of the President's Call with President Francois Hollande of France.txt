    President Obama spoke by phone with President Hollande of France this evening from the Philippines to discuss the latest developments in the investigation into last week's terrorist attacks in Paris. President Obama once again expressed condolences on behalf of the American people to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives in these horrific attacks, to the wounded, and to the French nation. Both leaders reiterated their unwavering commitment to degrade and destroy ISIL. President Obama noted that he looks forward to welcoming President Hollande to the White House next week, when the two leaders will engage in discussions on the way forward to defeat ISIL, help to bring to an end the conflict in Syria, and to ensure we are doing all we can to safeguard our citizens from the threat of terrorism.
