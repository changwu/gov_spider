    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. King (R) New York and Rep. Maloney (D) New York)
The Administration supports H.R. 2510, which would extend the expiration date and authorization of appropriations for the Defense Production Act through FY 2004.
The expiration of the Defense Production Act could have a severe impact on the Nation's ability to respond to national security threats, both at home and abroad. Thus, passage of H.R. 2510 would ensure the President's continued ability to provide for the Nation's security by providing authority to: (1) establish, expand, or maintain essential domestic industrial capacity; (2) direct priority performance of contracts and orders to meet approved national security requirements; and (3) suspend or prohibit a foreign acquisition of a U.S. firm when that acquisition would present a threat to the Nation's security.
