    Abortion Clinic Shooting
Q. Mr. President, do you have any reaction to the shooting of Dr. Gunn in Pensacola?
The President. Yes. I was outraged by it. We have got to create a climate in this country where people do not think that is acceptable. And I think that's—how could someone have thought that they could take civil disobedience and carry it one extra step? Dr. Gunn was exercising his constitutional rights. And what happened was awful.
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia
Q. [Inaudible]—Yeltsin apparently had informed you that he plans to dissolve or may have to dissolve the Parliament. Have you gotten word of that, and what's your reaction to it?
The President. I have had no communication from him today, or if it has, it hasn't been communicated to—
Q. Thank you.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany
Q. How about Mr. Kohl? Has Mr. Kohl called you about a summit?
The President. If he has, no one on my staff has told me he's called me today.
