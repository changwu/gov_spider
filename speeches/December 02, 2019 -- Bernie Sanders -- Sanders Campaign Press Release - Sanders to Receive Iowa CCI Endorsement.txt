    Iowa's Largest Progressive Organization to Hold Endorsement Event and Direct Action on Thursday
DES MOINES â€“ Sen. Bernie Sanders will be endorsed by Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement (CCI), the largest progressive organization in the state, on Thursday, December 5.
"Some 2020 Presidential candidates have been embracing or acknowledging movement politics. But only one of them has been doing it for decades, just like Iowa CCI Action and our sister organization Iowa CCI," Iowa CCI Action Board President Cherie Mortice wrote in an email to members. "That's why Iowa CCI Action is endorsing Bernie Sanders. We're standing with Bernie because Bernie stands with us."
"Iowa CCI is not only the largest progressive organization in Iowa, they are the hardest working and know what it takes to win for working people," said Bernie 2020 Iowa State Director Misty Rebik. "The members of Iowa CCI made this endorsement because they know that when Bernie Sanders is in the White House, he will fight alongside us because he always has."
Iowa CCI members will formally announce the endorsement at a press conference on Thursday at 11:30 AM CT at Iowa CCI headquarters in Des Moines. Following the event, Iowa CCI members will board a bus to take a direct action against corporate interests fighting against Medicare for All.
The Iowa CCI endorsement process took 7 months as members met with multiple presidential candidates. Sen. Sanders toured factory farms in August and walked on picket lines and in workers' rights marches across the state with Iowa CCI members.
