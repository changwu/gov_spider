Flags from each country line the walls of the courtyard.

Travel pool report #14: Press conference concludes
Apologies for a delayed report. Pool report #13 got stuck in my outbox because there was no data service in the courtyard where the press conference was.
The press conference ended at 6:15 pm. Biden, Lopez Obrador and Trudeau stood for a photo afterwards. Additional questions were shouted at Biden on classified documents, but the president did not respond.
Some color from the press conference below.
Biden, Lopez Obrador and Trudeau came down a grand staircase together at 5:01 pm. Forming a triangular shape, Biden and Trudeau walked parallel to each other while AMLO trailed the US and Canadian leaders. A huge Diego Rivera mural is painted on the wall where the staircase was.
AMLO stood at the center podium, while Biden stood on the Mexican president's right side and Trudeau on the left side.
The remarks were livestreamed.
Prepared remarks for the leaders ended at 5:29 pm.
Q&A began at 5:30 pm.
Biden was asked about his classified documents, to which he said he was "surprised to learn" of the documents and that he is "cooperating fully."
We're now back at the vans and waiting for motorcade to roll.
