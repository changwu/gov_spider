    I commend the House Judiciary Committee for passing legislation that offers hope to tens of millions of people at risk, including 15 million children. I believe strongly that Government should support programs that work to save and change lives of those in need.
I look forward to action by the Ways and Means Committee and urge the House to pass this legislation as soon possible.
