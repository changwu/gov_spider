    Dear Mr. Ambassador:
I was delighted to learn of your safe release today. You and your family have been in my thoughts and prayers since your ordeal began 61 days ago. Your courage, resilience, and strength of spirit are a source of pride for all Americans. You have represented America with distinction and dedication.
Rosalynn and I join in sending you warmest greetings, and best wishes upon your return to freedom.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
