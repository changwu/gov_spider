    (New York, NY) March 7th, 2016 - Today Donald J. Trump unveiled the latest campaign ad attacking Florida's no-show Senator Marco Rubio, to begin airing in Rubio's home state of Florida, leading up to next week's winner-take-all primary. The latest polls show Mr. Trump with a significant lead in Florida, including the recently released Monmouth survey, showing Mr. Trump with 38% support.
Mr. Trump stated, "Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is a dishonest person. He has cheated with credit cards, and does favors for lobbyists. In my opinion, he is a total crook and I am doing the people of Florida a great favor by further exposing him. In addition to everything else, he is an absentee Senator with one of the worst voting records in the history of the United States Senate, instead preferring to spend his time begging for campaign contributions. He takes his orders from the Republican establishment and Super PACs who are spending millions of dollars to keep their puppet alive and well so he will continue to do what they say. Former Prosecutor and now Governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, exposed him on the debate stage for being what he is - a choke artist. We are now going a step further."
Marco Rubio has violated numerous campaign promises, including on amnesty, betraying every Florida voter. Rubio is well-known in Washington as nothing more than a "yes-man" for his corporate benefactors. A vote for Rubio is a vote to put Rubio's donors in charge of the country. A close investigation of Senator Rubio's friends and finances will reveal that he is one of the most corrupt politicians in Washington, D.C.
