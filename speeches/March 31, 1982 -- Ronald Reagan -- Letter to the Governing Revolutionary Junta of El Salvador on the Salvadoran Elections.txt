    Gentlemen:
On behalf of the people and Government of the United States of America, I congratulate the people and Government of El Salvador on your successful constituent assembly elections. The Salvadoran people have clearly repudiated violence and voiced their commitment to a democratic future.
Few nations have undertaken free elections under such difficult conditions. The people of the United States and their Government take this opportunity to express their support for the restoration of democracy in El Salvador, and to offer their admiration for this moving demonstration of the popular will.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
