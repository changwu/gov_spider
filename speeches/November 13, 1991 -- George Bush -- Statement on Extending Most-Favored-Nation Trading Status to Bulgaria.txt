    I am pleased to sign into law House Joint Resolution 282, which approves the extension of most-favored-nation (MFN) tariff treatment to products of Bulgaria pursuant to a bilateral trade agreement. This resolution is a milestone in our rapidly developing relations with Bulgaria. My signature on this resolution represents American support of the Bulgarian people's historic decision for democracy, a free market economy, and the rule of law.
We stand with the people of Bulgaria as they strive to reintegrate their country into the global economy, and we welcome Bulgaria as it joins the community of free nations.
