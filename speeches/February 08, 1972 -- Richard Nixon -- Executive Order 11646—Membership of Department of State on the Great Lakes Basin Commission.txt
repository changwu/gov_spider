    Planning for the conservation and use of the water and related land resources of the Great Lakes Basin requires coordination among the affected State and local governments, Federal agencies, other jurisdictions and agencies, and with the Government of Canada. To assure effective coordination in this regard, Executive Order No. 11345 of April 20, 1967, created the Great Lakes Basin Commission pursuant to the provisions of section 201 of the Water Resources Planning Act. I have now determined that the inclusion of a representative of the Department of State as a member of the Great Lakes Basin Commission would enhance the work of that Commission.
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 202 of the Water Resources Planning Act (79 Stat. 247; 42 U.S.C. 1962b-1) and as President of the United States, it is ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. Section 3(2) of Executive Order No. 11345 of April 20, 1967, as amended, is hereby further amended by inserting "Department of State," immediately before "Department of Agriculture".
SEC. 2. Section 5 of Executive Order No. 11345 is hereby amended to read as follows:
"SEC. 5. International Coordination. The Council and the Department of State shall consult as appropriate on matters under consideration by the Commission which relate to the areas of interest and jurisdiction of the International Joint Commission, United States and Canada, and the Great Lakes Fishery Commission."
