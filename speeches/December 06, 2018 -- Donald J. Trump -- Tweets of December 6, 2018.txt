Without the phony Russia Witch Hunt and with all that we have accomplished in the last almost two years (Tax & Regulation Cuts Judge's Military Vets etc.) my approval rating would be at 75% rather than the 50% just reported by Rasmussen.

My thoughts and prayers are with the @USMC crew members who were involved in a mid-air collision off the coast of Japan. Thank you to @USForcesJapan for their immediate response and rescue efforts. Whatever you need we are here for you. @IIIMEFRetweets: 15926Favorites: 77617
