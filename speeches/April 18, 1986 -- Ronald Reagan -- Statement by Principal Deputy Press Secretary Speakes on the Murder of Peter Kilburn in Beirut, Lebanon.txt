    The U.S. Embassy in Beirut this morning was contacted by officials of the American University in Beirut concerning the identity of the third victim of the brutal murders discovered on April 17 in Beirut. They told the Embassy that this victim had been identified as Peter Kilburn, the librarian at the American University, by three of his colleagues. We do not have positive forensic identification. Steps are being taken to obtain this information. We have been in touch with all the families of the American hostages and provided them with all the information we have. Mr. Kilburn was last seen on November 30, 1984, and was confirmed missing on December 3, 1984.
