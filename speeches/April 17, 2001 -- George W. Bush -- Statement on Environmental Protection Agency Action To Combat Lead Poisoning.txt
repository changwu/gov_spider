    I support Administrator Whitman's decision to implement a rule to significantly expand and disclose the information available to the public about the presence of lead and lead emissions in their communities.
Lead is a persistent and highly toxic substance that can cause a range of environmental and health problems. It has an especially harmful impact on the health of children and infants. And it is found too often in some of America's older, poorer communities. Under this new rule, workers, consumers, and communities will be provided crucial information about the presence of this toxic substance.
To assist in complying with this rule, I have asked Administrator Whitman to provide technical assistance to affected small businesses to help them prepare their first reports.
This is an important and responsible approach that will protect American families and our environment from unnecessary exposure to lead. My administration will continue to support and promote efforts based on sound science to clean our air, water, and land.
