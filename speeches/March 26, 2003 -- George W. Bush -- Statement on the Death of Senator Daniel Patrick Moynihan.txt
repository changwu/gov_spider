    Laura and I are saddened by the death of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Senator Moynihan was an intellectual pioneer and a trusted adviser to Presidents of both parties. I appreciated his service to my administration as Co-Chairman of my Commission to Strengthen Social Security. Representing the people of New York for 24 years, Senator Moynihan was a leader in the Senate and was recognized for his commitment to free trade, Social Security, freedom for people around the world, and equal opportunity for all Americans. He committed his life to service and will be sorely missed. We express our deepest sympathies to Senator Moynihan's family.
