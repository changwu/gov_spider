    Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine today announced his endorsement of Gov. Tim Pawlenty for president.
"Gov. Pawlenty is the right man to serve as president," DeWine said today. "As a two term governor, Pawlenty understands what it takes to be a leader, knows the importance of supporting state and local governments, and has shown time after time a dedication to protecting children and families."

"Throughout Gov. Pawlenty's career, he has a record of fighting for the conservatives ideals that he believes in without alienating those who disagree," said DeWine. "In a political environment where it is increasingly hard to get things accomplished, Gov. Pawlenty brings the right balance of experience, knowhow, and dedication to move America forward."
DeWine went on to say, "As Attorney General, I'm fighting to repeal Obama health care. Gov. Pawlenty understands how to reform health care without unconstitutional mandates."
