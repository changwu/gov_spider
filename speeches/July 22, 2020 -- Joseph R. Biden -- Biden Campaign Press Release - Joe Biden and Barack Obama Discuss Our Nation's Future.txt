    Vice President Joe Biden and President Barack Obama sat down for a wide-ranging conversation about the biggest challenges facing Americans across the country, including how Vice President Biden will get the COVID-19 pandemic under control and our economy back on track as president.
In a socially distant conversation, the former president and vice president drew a sharp contrast between how the Obama-Biden Administration confronted national crises and created millions of jobs to pull our country out of a recession, in contrast with Donald Trump's historic failure to respond to the public health and economic crisis impacting every single American family. Vice President Biden and President Obama also discussed how the nation is grappling with systemic racism â€” and the current opportunity to make lasting change rooting out these historic inequities.

"Can you imagine standing up when you were president and saying 'it's not my responsibility. I take no responsibility. Literally. Literally," Vice President Biden says in the teaser's open.
President Obama replies, "Those words didn't come out of our mouths when we were in office."
"No. I don't understand his inability to get a sense of what people are going through," says Vice President Biden. "He can't relate in any way."
"Well, and one of the things I have always known about you Joe, it's the reason I wanted you to be my vice president, and the reason why you were so effective...it all starts with being able to relate," says President Obama.
The full conversation between the 44th President of the United States and the 47th Vice President of the United States will air across both leaders' social media platforms on Thursday, July 23.
