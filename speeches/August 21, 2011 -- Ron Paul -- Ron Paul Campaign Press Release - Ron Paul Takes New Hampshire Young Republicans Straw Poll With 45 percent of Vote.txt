    Soundly defeats rivals in Granite State GOP contest
LAKE JACKSON, Texas — It's been a good week for Ron Paul: a statistical tie at the Ames Straw Poll in Iowa last Saturday, a thousand New Hampshire voters at the Concord, New Hampshire office opening Wednesday night, and today, a resounding victory in the New Hampshire Young Republicans Straw Poll in New Castle.
With 45% of the vote, Paul soundly beat his closest rivals at this traditional lobster bake, with Mitt Romney earning 10% of the vote, followed by Thaddeus McCotter and Rick Perry, tied at 8%.
"Ron Paul's message of traditional conservatism — fiscal restraint, limited government, and strong national defense — is clearly the future of the Republican Party," said NH Chairman and State Senator Jim Forsythe, who spoke on behalf of Congressman Paul at the Straw Poll. "The other candidates know that and sound more like him every day. But there are convenient copies, and there's the real thing.
"It takes more than a sound bite and a flip-flop to fool New Hampshire voters. That's why there's real momentum here for Ron Paul."
