    Newark, NJ â€” Cory 2020 announced today that the campaign has voluntarily recognized the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 238 as its workers' union representatives.
"I'm thrilled that the Teamsters have earned majority support to serve as our campaign workers' union representatives," said Cory 2020 Campaign Manager Addisu Demissie. "Cory Booker has a longstanding relationship with the Teamsters and organized labor and we share common goals, like rewarding hard work with a living wage and good benefits. We are proud to become a unionized campaign and celebrate this step forward together."
The unionization drive was aided by the fact that Cory 2020 entered into a neutrality agreement with the Teamsters and agreed to recognize the Teamsters as its workers union representative when a majority of state workers signed a union card.
In the coming weeks, the Teamsters and Cory 2020 will work to reach a collective bargaining agreement that strengthens our campaign, benefits our employees, and builds on Cory 2020's already comprehensive benefits package provided to all employees, which includes 100 percent employer-paid medical, dental, vision, and short-term disability insurance benefits; paid sick leave and paid time off; 3 months paid parental leave; and more.
