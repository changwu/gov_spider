South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, who hit the trail with Marco in Iowa this week, was on FOX & Friends this morning to discuss why Marco earned his vote.

With Marco's growing momentum, Rep. Gowdy said it was an "easy decision":
I also have been a great admirer of Senator Rubio's ability to express the message of conservatism in a hopeful, aspirational, persuasive way. I am not a terribly hopeful or optimistic person â€” I'm a former prosecutor, I'm actually cynical. So, I greatly admire the [South Carolina Senator] Tim Scott's of the world, and frankly Ronald Reagan and Marco Rubio who can communicate our message in an aspirational, hopeful way.
That to me is persuasive, so when you like someone personally, you agree with them on the issues, and you think they're a really persuasive messenger for our movement, for our party, it made it kind of an easy decision for me.

Rep. Gowdy joins a rapidly growing team of next generation conservative leaders backing Marco.
