    DOLE: Thank you. Thank you very much. I feel like I was just up here. I think I was. But I am just thrilled to be here today at what is probably the largest young voter program at any Republican national convention.
(APPLAUSE)
And I think when you took over the floor this morning you sent a resounding message to young Americans across this country. The message is this: young people vote, young Republicans vote, and your vote counts.
(APPLAUSE)
You know, my first experience in politics came long before I could vote myself. It started many years ago when I was five years old. And when I was five years old I campaigned for my father for the first time back in Kansas...
(APPLAUSE)
And in those days we had a lot of fun out there on the campaign trail. It's changed a little bit. I wore a little red skirt with a big elephant on the front and a banner at the bottom that read, "I'm for my daddy, are you?"
(APPLAUSE)
Thank goodness my taste in clothing has changed a little bit since those poodle skirt days. But I've made thousands of campaign swings since then, but you know what I truly believe is that no election will be more important to America's future -- and that means your future -- than this one.
(APPLAUSE)
You know, I also have been doing a lot -- I've been remembering an awful lot since I've been here. I remember my first convention. It was in 1972. I was about 17 years old, and I was a page, and I worked in the offices...
(APPLAUSE)
And I also worked in the Republican National Committee offices, and my dad was chairman of the Republican National Committee at that time. And I thought that was the most exciting convention I had ever been to, but I was wrong. There were more to come for me, and this one clearly has been the most exciting convention that I have ever attended in my life.
(APPLAUSE)
I also remember the first time that I got to cast a vote. And I know you won't believe this, I know it'll be very hard for you to believe, but I was in the very first group of 18 year olds who voted after they changed the law to allow 18 year olds to vote, so I remember that very, very, very distinctly.
(APPLAUSE)
And for the last 23 years, I have proudly cast my vote for my dad.
DOLE: And that has been a great pleasure for me. But I can tell you, I will never be as proud as the day I cast my vote for Bob Dole for president of the United States of America.
(APPLAUSE)
AUDIENCE: Bob Dole! Bob Dole! Bob Dole! Bob Dole!
DOLE: And I think everybody last night figured out just how proud I am of my father. I am so proud of his service to our country. I am proud of the obstacles he overcame after World War II and the many obstacles he overcame during his 35 years of public service, his 35 years in the Congress, and I am proud of what he has done for the Republican Party.
(APPLAUSE)
I'm also very proud of all of you. Your participation in the young voter program demonstrates your commitment to carry out the highest honor, the most important act and the most intelligent decision, not to mention your willingness to encourage your peers all across this great nation to do the same.
Now, what I'm talking about is your commitment to vote and your commitment to vote for Bob Dole.
(APPLAUSE)
Your decision to support my dad is, in my view, a very sound investment in your future. Bob Dole's vision is inspired by the first three words of the constitution, "We, the People."
(APPLAUSE)
He believes in shifting power out of Washington and returning it to our states, our cities, our neighborhoods and our people.
(APPLAUSE)
And Bob Dole is going to balance the budget when he becomes president of the United States.
(APPLAUSE)
And Bob Dole is going to cut your taxes when he becomes president.
(APPLAUSE)
And as part of his economic plan, he is going to help small business grow and prosper so that they can create jobs which will also help all of you in this room and young Americans all over this country.
(APPLAUSE)
My father will restore the American dream for you and for young Americans everywhere. And there's one thing I can promise and I can tell you -- I know this from my life that I have spent with Dad -- he will keep his word, he will keep the promises he makes to you because his word is his bond.
(APPLAUSE)
And he will prove that our party has the ability to unify its roots and offer the needed leadership to include young people as participants in the democratic process, not just as observers.
(APPLAUSE)
Now, back in Washington, I volunteer as a mental health therapist for troubled teenagers.
DOLE: And I see, first hand, the challenges each of you face in today's world. Crime, drugs, violence, teen pregnancy, low self esteem, high drop out rates. There doesn't seem to be much of a dream in those words. And as a matter of fact, some of the kids I work with I see more nightmares than dreams. But, as I work with each one of these teens, I also see something else that's very important to me and that is a glimmer of hope in their eyes when they know that they are special and someone cares about them.
And I'm here to tell you that you are special and I know better than anyone that my dad cares about the young people in this country.
(APPLAUSE)
And it will be the youth of America that will help cast the deciding vote on the future direction of our country. It will be the young people of America who will help to maintain the strength of the Republican Party and put a man in the White House who cares about you and cares about your future.
(APPLAUSE)
And I think you know who that man is. That man is my dad and your friend, Bob Dole.
(APPLAUSE)
