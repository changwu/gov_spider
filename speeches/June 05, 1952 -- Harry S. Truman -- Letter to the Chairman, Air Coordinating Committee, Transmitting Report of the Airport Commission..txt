    Dear Mr. Nyrop:
I send you herewith the Report of the Airport Commission which was submitted by General Doolittle and his associates on May 16th.
This is a most important document. It sets the pattern for future airport development, taking into consideration the welfare of people who now live near airports, and the continuing well-being of our essential air services, both military and commercial.
The recommendations of the Commission appear to be sound, and I am anxious that a prompt analysis of the report be made, in order that implementation may be undertaken. It seems to me that the Air Coordinating Committee is the appropriate agency to assume this responsibility.
I would appreciate it if your Committee would make an immediate and intensive study of this report and advise me at an early date as to the action that should be taken to put the recommendations of the Commission into effect.
Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Mr. Donald W. Nyrop, Chairman, Air Coordinating Committee, Washington 25, D.C.]
