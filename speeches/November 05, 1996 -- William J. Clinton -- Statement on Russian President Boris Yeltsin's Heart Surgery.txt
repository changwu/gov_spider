    President Yeltsin underwent heart bypass surgery today in Moscow. On behalf of the American people, I want to convey our very best wishes for his full and speedy recovery. Our thoughts are also with Mrs. Yeltsin and the Yeltsin family.
We are pleased to see the reports that the surgery was a success. I have spoken with Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, who confirmed that the operation went well, and who expressed gratitude for the assistance provided to the Russian doctors by Dr. DeBakey and his team.
Over the last 4 years, the United States and Russia have taken important steps to build a safer, more peaceful world. We look forward to continuing the close work between our two countries as we lay the foundation for a bright new century.
