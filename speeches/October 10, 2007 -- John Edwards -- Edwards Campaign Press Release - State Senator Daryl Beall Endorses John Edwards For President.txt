    Endorsement comes days after State Representative Nathan Reichert endorses Edwards
Des Moines, Iowa – Today, the John Edwards for President campaign announced that State Senator Daryl Beall (D-Fort Dodge) is endorsing Senator John Edwards as the best Democrat to take back the White House and change our country. Edwards' campaign continues to gain momentum and support across the state. Beall's endorsement comes just days after State Representative Nathan Reichert endorsed Edwards for president.
"Daryl Beall is a true Iowa leader and I am proud to have his support," said Edwards. "Throughout his career, Daryl has worked hard to build a better life for the people of Iowa. He has been a strong advocate for those who are often forgotten by Washington – our veterans, our children and the less fortunate. His leadership and experience will be valuable assets to my Iowa campaign and I look forward to working with him to change our country."
"We need John Edwards in the White House," said Beall. "He will work every day to build an America we can be proud of – an America that is respected around the world and an America where hard work is valued once again. John Edwards has the right combination of proven experience, passion and vision to be a great president. He also has the ability to reach out to and attract support from independents and even cross-over Republicans to be the president of all Americans. I am proud to be a part of John Edwards' campaign and look forward to working to make him our next president."
Beall represents Iowa's 25th district in the State Senate. He is chair of the Veterans Affairs Committee and the International Relations Committee, vice-chair of the Local Government Committee, and a member of the Economic Growth, Education, and Transportation Committees.
