    National Girls and Women in Sports Day is a time for us all to commemorate the participation of women and girls in sports and athletics and celebrate their achievements. Women compete at all levels today, in large part due to the foundation laid by title IX, which has done much to advance the number of women taking part in collegiate athletic programs and has increased access to the classroom. Today, as we celebrate, we must also recognize that more needs to be done, and we should recommit ourselves to achieving true equality for all.
