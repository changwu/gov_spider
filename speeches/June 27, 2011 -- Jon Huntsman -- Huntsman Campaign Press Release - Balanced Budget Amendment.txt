Let there be no equivocation: Governor Huntsman supports a federal balanced budget amendment.
"We're going to have to fight for a balanced budget amendment," Jon recently said. "It keeps everybody honest. It's the best safeguard imaginable."
Yet Jon's record is stronger than any words spoken or pledges signed. As governor, he balanced the budget every year - including during turbulent times. When the economic crisis struck, he did not raise taxes or rely on accounting gimmicks. Instead, Jon and the legislators cut hundreds of millions of dollars to address the shortfall.

Gov. Huntsman also signed into law the largest tax cut in state history. He implemented a flat tax on income. And he did all this while nearly tripling the size of the state's Rainy Day Fund.
Jon's not running on rhetoric. He's running on his record - a record that delivered results for Utah, and that will deliver results for America, as well.
