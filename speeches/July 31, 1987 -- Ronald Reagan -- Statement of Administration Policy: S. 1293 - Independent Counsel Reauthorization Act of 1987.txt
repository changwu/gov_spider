    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Levin (D) Michigan and Cohen (R) Maine)
The administration opposes enactment of S. 1293. The bill does not comport with constitutional requirements and is otherwise objectionable for the reasons stated by the Department of Justice in its letter of June 15, 1987, to the Governmental Affairs Committee. The President's senior advisers would recommend disapproval of S. 1293 if it were presented to the President in its current form.
