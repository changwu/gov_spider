In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report 22 deferrals of fiscal year 1981 funds totalling $619.1 million. The deferrals are primarily routine in nature and do not, in most cases, affect program levels.
The details of each deferral are contained in the attached reports.
