    KEN KEATING was an outstanding public servant and an old and valued friend. He was my colleague in the Congress from New York State for 9 years, and then went on to serve with distinction in the United States Senate.
With the conclusion of his Congressional years, Ken began another distinguished career, this time as a diplomat, ably representing America as Ambassador to both India and Israel. His integrity, dedication, and devotion to duty made him a most valued public servant.
As United States representative in Tel Aviv for the past 2 years, Ambassador Keating has played a critical role in the formulation and execution of our policies in the Middle East. He was known by both Americans and Israelis for his statesmanship, his gentle grace, and his commitment to peace.
Seldom has one man led a more versatile or useful public life. Mrs. Ford joins with me in condolences to his family.
