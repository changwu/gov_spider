    Janet and I were deeply saddened by the news of Senator Bumpers' death. I first knew him as a political opponent and I must confess he beat me like a drum. Later, when I became Governor and he was the Senior Senator we worked very well together. Senator Bumpers was extremely helpful to the state and to me personally. His distinguished service to his country in the Marine Corps, to his state as a Governor and Senator is a legacy of which his family can be justly proud. Our political differences aside, he was a dedicated public servant who always reminded his audiences that 'public service is a noble calling.' His wife Betty is also a proud public servant who was a strong ally of Janet's efforts to promote childhood immunizations and renovate the Governor's mansion. Betty and the family are in our prayers.
