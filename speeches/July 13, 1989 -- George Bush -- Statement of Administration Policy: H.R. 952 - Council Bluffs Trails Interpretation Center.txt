    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Lightfoot (R) Iowa)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 952. The site for the proposed trails interpretation center in Council Bluffs, Iowa, is not historically significant. Although construction of a trails interpretation center may be a worthwhile effort, funding by State, municipal, and private interests would be more appropriate. Non-Federal interests are currently developing a similar trails center in Independence, Missouri. The Federal role in construction of such facilities should be limited to providing technical assistance, which can be done under existing law.
