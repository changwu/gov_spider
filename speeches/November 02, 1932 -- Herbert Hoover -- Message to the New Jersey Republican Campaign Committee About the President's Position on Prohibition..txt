    I AM IN RECEIPT of your telegram stating that representations are being made that since my Acceptance Speech I have changed my position upon Prohibition. I would be glad if you would reply to any such misrepresentations that my position is unaltered. In that address I set forth my conclusions clearly and unmistakably. That statement is a matter of public record. It is inconceivable that it should be misunderstood.
