    The United States strongly condemns ISIL's recent attacks on Assyrian Christian villages in northeastern Syria, including the burning of homes and churches, the displacement of thousands, and the abduction of a large number of Syrian Christian civilians, among them women, children, and the elderly.
This is but the latest round of atrocities perpetrated by ISIL against the innocent people of the region. Along with the targeting of minority and religious groups, in recent days ISIL reportedly took captive over 100 Iraqi Sunni tribespeople, including children, near the city of Tikrit. ISIL has also caged and paraded Kurdish Iraqi prisoners, displaying its trademark brutality and disregard for human dignity.
The international community stands united and undeterred in its resolve to bring an end to ISIL's depravity. ISIL seeks to control people through fear and oppression, but ultimately ISIL and all that it represents will fail due to the collective strength, determination, and unity of all those who stand against it. Along with our coalition partners, and on behalf of all those persecuted by this terrorist organization, the United States will continue to lead the fight to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL.
