    Clinton Campaign Manager Maggie Williams issued the following statement in response to the Wyoming caucuses and our estimated pick-up of five delegates:
"We are thrilled with this near split in delegates and are grateful to the people of Wyoming for their support. Although the Obama campaign predicted victory in Wyoming weeks ago, we worked hard to present Senator Clinton's vision to the caucus-goers and we thank them for turning out today."
