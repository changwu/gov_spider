    Frank Reynolds was one of America's foremost broadcast journalists, trusted and respected by millions of his fellow citizens, Nancy and I among them. To us he was also a warm, considerate friend who will be missed for his outstanding human qualities as well as for his many contributions as a newsman. Our prayers and sympathy are with Frank's family in their bereavement.
