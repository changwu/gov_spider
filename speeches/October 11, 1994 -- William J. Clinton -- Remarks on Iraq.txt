    Good morning. Our deployments in the Gulf region are continuing today. There has been no change in the pattern of Iraqi activity from yesterday, so we will continue our deployments.
We received strong support from the international community for this approach. I talked with several world leaders yesterday. The British are already sending more troops, planes, and ships. So I'm quite encouraged about the direction of the events. We will just simply stay on course and judge what we should do as events unfold. But today I can tell you that we are continuing with our deployment and that there has been no change in the pattern of Iraqi activity to date.
Thank you.
