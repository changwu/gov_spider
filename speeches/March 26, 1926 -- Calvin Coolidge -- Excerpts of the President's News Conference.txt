    I hadn't thought anything about what would be done with the farm at Plymouth. I suppose I shall keep it. That isn't the place where my grandfather's grandfather, Captain John Coolidge, settled when he went to Plymouth, but it is one of the five farms he owned when he died and it is my understanding that he died there. It has always been in the family, ever since. I expect it will remain in my possession. I am undertaking to provide for it to be carried on as a farm for the next year.
