 In-town pool report #5 
President Trump took the stage at 2:06 p.m. and started his remarks at the podium, thanking members of the audience and from his administration.
Trump said if authorized, tens of millions of doses of vaccine would be available this month. Decisions about who would get the vaccine first will be up to governors. Trump urged seniors and first responders, health care workers should be first.
Trump said the executive order he was about to sign would prioritize the vaccine for Americans before it is shipped abroad.
Trump was reading his speech and appeared to keep close to scriptâ€”he stayed on the topic of the pandemic and the vaccine.
At 2:22 p.m. Trump sat at the small desk and signed the order, then handed the first pen to Pence and Azar who were standing behind him.
At 2:23 p.m. Trump went back to the podium and asked for questions. Pooler believes Steve Holland asked about his message to Americans now, over the holidays. Trump touted the U.S.'s testing program and new tests coming.
AP reporter Zeke Miller asked about White House Christmas parties, and Trump said attendees wear masks.
Trump also said we'd have to see what the next administration is, and hopefully it would be the Trump administration. Trump said he hoped either legislators or judges would find election fraud.
The event ended at 2:28 p.m. and Trump waved and walked off stage.
