    The Group Cites Hillary's Extensive Experience and History Working in Texas
The Clinton campaign announced today the endorsement of Tejano Democrats of Texas.
"We have known Hillary Clinton for 35 years. Hillary knows Texas, and has worked with our community in our state," said former State Senator and current Chairman of Tejano Democrats of Texas Gonzalo Barrientos. "She is sensitive to the concerns of the Latino community and is the candidate that will get the job done from day one in the White House. As Tejanos, we are proud to support Hillary Clinton for President."
The Tejano Democrats, a statewide organization that includes chapters throughout the state, met this weekend in Austin and made the key endorsement. Meeting at their Screening & Endorsement Convention, the Tejano membership voted overwhelmingly to endorse Hillary Clinton for President. Citing Clinton's extensive experience and history working in Texas, Tejanos expressed strong support for her campaign. Hillary's ties with Texas date back thirty-five years, when she helped organize voters for Presidential candidate George McGovern in Texas.
