    Dear Mr. Chairman:
Pursuant to section 3(2)(E)(ii) of the Resolution of Ratification to the Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic adopted on April 30, 1998, I am pleased to submit the enclosed report.
In doing so, I reiterate with appreciation the bipartisan support that the Congress has shown for NATO's next round of enlargement.
As provided in the Resolution, for each of the two current NATO invitees (Albania and Croatia) as well as for Macedonia (in the event an invitation is issued by the Alliance before the signing of accession protocols), the enclosed report includes:
(I)updated information contained in the report required under clause (i) with respect to that country; and
(II)an analysis of that country's ability to meet the full range of the financial burdens of NATO membership, and the likely impact upon the military effectiveness of NATO of the country invited for accession talks, if the country were to be admitted to NATO.
This report is in both classified and unclassified forms, as provided in the Resolution.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
