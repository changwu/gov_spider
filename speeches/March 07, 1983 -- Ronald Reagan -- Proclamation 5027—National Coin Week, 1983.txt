  A Proclamation

Since the beginning of history, coins have played an important role in the story of civilization. They reflect the economic development of their country of origin, as well as the scientific advancement and artistic values of the people who produce and use teem. Today, millions of Americans collect coins for both pleasure and profit.
To help foster the public's interest in coin collecting, the United States Mint annually offers proof sets of the current year's coinage. In 1982, the United States Mint struck a commemorative silver half-dollar marking the 250th anniversary of the birth of George Washington. In 1983-1984, the first commemorative Olympic coinage ever issued by our country will be introduced in gold and silver.
Recognizing that coin collecting has educational and cultural value, promotes greater understanding of our history and heritage, and is enjoyed by millions of Americans, the Congress, pursuant to House Joint Resolution 516 (Public Law 97-239), has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the week beginning April 17, 1983, as "National Coin Week."
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning April 17, 1983, as "National Coin Week" and call upon the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 7th day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred trod eighty three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.

RONALD REAGAN
