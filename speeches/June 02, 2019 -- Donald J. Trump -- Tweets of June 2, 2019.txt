People have been saying for years that we should talk to Mexico. The problem is that Mexico is an 'abuser' of the United States taking but never giving. It has been this way for decades. Either they stop the invasion of our Country by Drug Dealers Cartels Human Traffickers....Retweets: 24632Favorites: 116369

Mexico is sending a big delegation to talk about the Border. Problem is they've been 'talking' for 25 years. We want action not talk. They could solve the Border Crisis in one day if they so desired. Otherwise our companies and jobs are coming back to the USA!Retweets: 27977Favorites: 111171
