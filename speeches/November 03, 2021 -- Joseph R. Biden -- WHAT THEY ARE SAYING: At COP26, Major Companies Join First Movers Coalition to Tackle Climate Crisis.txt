    Yesterday, President Biden announced bold steps to push the United States' clean energy economy forward and create good-paying jobs. In addition to the U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan, the President also announced that the U.S. is collaborating with other countries to drive innovation and de-carbonization, including through the First Movers Coalition (FMC), which has received strong industry support.
Launched at COP26, FMC is a platform with more than 25 founding members for building private-sector demand to drive innovation and create clean energy manufacturing jobs.
