    Laura and I are saddened by Jack Valenti's death. Jack Valenti was a great American and a great Texan. He bravely flew combat missions during World War II and ably served in the White House. From protecting families by creating the movie rating system to advocating for intellectual property rights, Jack Valenti helped transform the motion picture industry. He leaves a powerful legacy in Washington, in Hollywood, and across our Nation.
Our thoughts and prayers are with Jack's wife Mary Margaret, his children, and his friends and colleagues.
