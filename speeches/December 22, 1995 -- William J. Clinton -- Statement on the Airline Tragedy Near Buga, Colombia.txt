    Hillary and I offer our profound condolences to the many families whose loved ones perished in the crash December 20 of American Airlines flight 965 near Buga, Colombia. Coming on the eve of the holiday season, this tragic event takes on even greater poignancy. I have dispatched an interagency team to the site which, working alongside Colombian authorities, will pursue the goals of searching for survivors, identifying victims, and determining the cause of the crash.
Our hopes and prayers, along with those of all Americans, are with those whose lives have been so affected by this tragedy.
