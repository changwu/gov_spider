    Congressman Bob Stump lived a distinguished life of service as a World War II veteran, an Arizona State legislator, and a United States Congressman. He was a gifted leader who remained true to his principles and made an indelible mark on those who were fortunate enough to know him. As one of the few Members of Congress who served as chairman of both the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and the Armed Services Committee, he was admired for his tireless efforts on behalf of the men and women in uniform. Laura joins me in sending our thoughts and prayers to Nancy and the entire Stump family during this difficult time.
