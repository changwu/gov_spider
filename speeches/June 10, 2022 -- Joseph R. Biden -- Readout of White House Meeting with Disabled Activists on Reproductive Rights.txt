    Yesterday, the White House Gender Policy Council and the White House Office of Public Engagement convened a meeting with Disabled leaders. Participants discussed how access to reproductive health care, including abortion, is shaped by disability status and underscored the importance of bodily autonomy, self-determination and health equity, including culturally competent care. Participants discussed the disproportionate effect that Americans with disabilities will face if Roe v Wade is overturned, and highlighted numerous barriers such as the lack of accessible facilities and transportation.
During the conversation, participants also raised that the right to parent is also a disability rights issue and that Disabled people have the right to access services that will ensure they are able to parent in their fullest capability.
Advocates stressed the importance of mobilizing the Disabled community in support of reproductive freedom. White House officials affirmed that participants were essential partners in the effort to protect reproductive rights and invited advocates into continued dialogue.
