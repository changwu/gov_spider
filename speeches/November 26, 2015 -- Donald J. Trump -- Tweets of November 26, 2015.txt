The dopes at the @nytimes bought the Boston Globe for $1.3 billion and sold it for $1.00. Their great old headquarters-gave it away! So dumbRetweets: 1270Favorites: 3333

So, since the people at the @nytimes have made all bad decisions over the last decade, why do people care what they write. Incompetent!Retweets: 1512Favorites: 4532

The numbers at the @nytimes are so dismal, especially advertising revenue, that big help will be needed fast. A once great institution-SAD!Retweets: 1149Favorites: 3114
