Today, Kansas Treasurer Ron Estes endorsed Marco Rubio for President. Estes is joining a prominent group of conservative leaders endorsing Marco, including Kansas Governor Sam Brownback, Senator Pat Roberts, and Congressman Mike Pompeo.
Here's why Estes chose Marco:
After multiple debates and town hall meetings, one candidate has emerged as the best choice to move America forward in a responsible manner. That candidate is Marco Rubio and I'm proud to endorse him for President of the United States of America. I trust Marco to bring runaway government spending under control; spending cannot continue to outpace revenue and growth.
As Kansas State Treasurer, part of my job is to administer the state's 529 higher education savings program. Rapidly rising costs associated with higher education has become a chief concern of mine. These costs continue to outpace a student's ability to pay for higher education, and as a result Americans are graduating with burdensome student loan debt now totaling over $1.2 trillion. This is a serious problem that demands action.
We must move beyond the idea of throwing more federal money at the problem and encourage a national conversation about the appropriate career education at the appropriate cost. More than any other candidate, Marco Rubio has shown a passion for reining in the rising cost of higher education. Marco continuously demonstrates a desire to modernize an education system that has left far too many students unable to start their adult lives on solid financial footing.
Americans are crying out for a leader who understands the real challenges we face. Marco Rubio gets it; he offers workable solutions that will make  a difference. Please join me in casting your vote for Marco Rubio at theMarch 5th caucus.

Welcome to Team Marco!
