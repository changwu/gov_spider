    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 7/31/92)(House)(Tauzin (D) Louisiana and 2 others)
The Administration would support enactment of legislation which effectively addresses the problem of abandoned barges. However, the Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5397 because it:

— Overlaps, and is inconsistent with,, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Clean Water Act; and the Oil Pollution Act. H.R. 5397 would therefore generate confusion regarding removal standards, penalties, and jurisdiction where abandoned barges contain substances covered by these statutes.
— Fails to protect the Maritime Administration's interest as a mortgagee when abandoned barges purchased with loans it guarantees are sold. 
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 5397 would increase receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990.
OMB's preliminary scoring estimates of this bill are presented below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If H.R. 5397 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within five days of enactment, as required by-OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to the Congress.
