    Former Democratic Candidate for Governor of Connecticut Shows Hillary's Strong Support Across the State
Building on Hillary's momentum coming off her victory in New Hampshire, the Clinton campaign won the endorsement of Stamford Mayor Dannel P. Malloy, surrounded by a large group of over 100 enthusiastic campaign supporters.
"As Connecticut moves closer to the February 5th primary, people across the state are asking themselves who will make the best President and the answer is Hillary Clinton," said Stamford Mayor Dannel Malloy. "Hillary has 35 years of experience making change happen and she is ready to lead on day one."
Mayor Malloy, currently in his 13th year in office, is the city of Stamford's longest serving Mayor. In 2006, Malloy was a Democratic candidate for Governor. He is a dedicated advocate for finding solutions for Connecticut's future and brings a wide knowledge of the state to Clinton's campaign.
"I am grateful to have such strong support in Connecticut," said Senator Hillary Clinton. "Mayor Malloy is a dedicated public servant, and a proud representative of the people of Connecticut. I look forward to campaigning aggressively throughout the February 5th states and winning the Connecticut primary."
Malloy's endorsement comes on the heels of the announcement of the Clinton campaign's sixty member strong state steering committee, the endorsement of Bridgeport Mayor Bill Finch and growing grassroots support throughout the state.
Clinton volunteers from Connecticut recently traveled to New Hampshire to help be part of Hillary's victory there and will carry that enthusiasm forward to help Hillary win the February 5th primary in Connecticut. The campaign has already set up several phone banks throughout the state manned by volunteers.
