    The President. As I think you know, we had good news from the home front today: Economic growth in the third quarter was at 3.4 percent and inflation a very low 1.6 percent. This sustained economic expansion is producing jobsâ€”this year, more high-wage jobs than not, more high-wage jobs this year than in the previous 5 years combined.
This is the result of a remarkable partnership between the private sector and our policies: the efforts of all of our companies and people to be competitive in the global economy, coupled with our determination to lower the deficit, increase investment in critical areas, expand trade, and aggressively promote United States economic interests all around the world.
I'm very, very encouraged by this. We have growth, better jobs, low inflation. That's the right path to be on. That's the path we need to continue.
U.S. Troops in the Persian Gulf
Q. Mr. President, when do you think you'll make a decision on bringing the troops home by Christmas, and how many?
The President. Well, I will make a decision on that essentially based on the facts as they exist. If our military people tell me that their judgment is that we can handle that, then I expect that decision will flow in a prompt fashion. But we're going to wait a little while longer to make sure we have all the evidence, we know exactly where we are, we know what the range of risks are. And we'll make a decision pretty soon.
Q. Sir, are you feeling a little unplugged from your domestic matters here?
The President. No. No. I haven't been gone long enough to be unplugged.
