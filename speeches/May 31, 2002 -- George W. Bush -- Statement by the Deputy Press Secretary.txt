    Today the President designated the third annual set of determinations of drug traffickers who will be subject to the sanctions provided in the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act ("Kingpin Act").
The Kingpin Act, which became law in December 1999, targets, on a worldwide basis, significant foreign narcotics traffickers, their organizations, and operatives. Its fundamental objective is to deny these foreign persons and entities access to the U.S. financial system and all trade and transactions involving U.S. companies and individuals. The Kingpin Act does not target the countries in which these foreign persons and entities are operating nor the governments of such countries.
The additional foreign persons whom the President designated as appropriate for sanctions under the Kingpin Act are:

  Ismael Zambada Garcia
  Eduardo Gonzalez Quirarte
  Mario Ernesto Villanueva Madrid
  Luis Fernando da Costa
  Oded Tuito
  Haji Ibrahim
  Samuel Knowles

This action underscores our determination to do everything possible to fight drug traffickers, undermine their operations, and end the suffering that trade in illicit drugs inflicts on Americans and people around the world.
