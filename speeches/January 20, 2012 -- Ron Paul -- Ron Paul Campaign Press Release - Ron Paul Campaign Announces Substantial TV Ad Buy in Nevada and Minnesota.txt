LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign will begin running its celebrated television ad 'Big Dog' in the key early voting states of Nevada and Minnesota.
The ad buy is substantial in size, and it is part of the campaign's delegate strategy to secure the Republican nomination for the presidency. The campaign will air the ads on broadcast and cable television in both states.
This is the fourth time the campaign has purchased ads in Nevada, and the first time it has done so in Minnesota. With respect to Nevada, the campaign announced ad buys for 'Secure,' 'Life,' and the combined 'Plan' and 'Consistent' buy on October 7th, 14th, and 20th, respectively.
The 30-second spot 'Big Dog' contrasts establishment Republican candidates unwilling to make difficult choices on spending cuts and debt reduction with the sole candidate whose bite on such matters equals his bark: Ron Paul. The ad informs viewers about major provisions of Ron Paul's "Plan to Restore America" including his proposals to cut $1 trillion from the federal budget in year one, balance the federal budget in year three, and eliminate the Departments of Commerce, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, and Interior.
"Running ads in the key early voting states of Nevada and Minnesota is part of our delegate strategy to secure the Republican nomination. Both states present opportunities for a strong top-three showing in their upcoming caucuses," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton, referring to the February 4th nominating contest in Nevada and the February 7th one in Minnesota.
"Ours is the only campaign with the resources, organization, and stamina to defeat establishment candidate Mitt Romney in a 50-state race," said Mr. Benton.
