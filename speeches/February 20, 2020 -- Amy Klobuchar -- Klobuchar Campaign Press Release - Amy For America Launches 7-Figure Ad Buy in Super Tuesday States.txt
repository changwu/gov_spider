'I Know You' Transcript:
KLOBUCHAR: There is a complete lack of empathy in this guy in the White House right now, and I will bring that to you. If you have trouble stretching your paycheck to pay for that rent, I know you and I will fight for you. If you have trouble deciding if you're going to pay for your childcare or for your long term care, I know you and I will fight for you. I would love your vote and I would love the vote of America. Thank you. I'm Amy Klobuchar and I approve this message.
'Decency' Transcript:
KLOBUCHAR: We have a President who thinks everything is about him. His tweets, his golf courses, his ego. But I think the job is about you. Your health care, your schools, your security, your families, and your future. I'm Amy Klobuchar, I'll be a President and a Commander In Chief who restores decency to the White House and gets things done for you. That's why I approve this message.
'Home' Transcript:
KLOBUCHAR: If you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense, you've got a home with me. I am someone that tells the truth, I don't make promises that I can't keep, I have people's back, and I believe that to win you bring people with you and that is how you govern as well. Because I don't want to be the President for half of America, I want to be the President for all of America. I'm Amy Klobuchar and I approve this message.
