    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of former Indiana Governor Joe Kernan and First Lady Maggie Kernan.
"The stakes in this election are high, and it will take a leader with Hillary Clinton's strength and experience to tackle the challenges we face," Joe Kernan said. "Not only is she the best qualified candidate, Hillary will win in November, take back the White House, and deliver real results for America."
Kernan served as Lieutenant Governor from 1997 to 2003, and before that was Mayor of South Bend from 1988 to 1996.
"Hillary has spent 35 years fighting for children and families and making a difference in people's lives," said Maggie Kernan. "On a personal note, I have always been grateful for the wonderful kindness she showed my mother while visiting South Bend."
"I'm honored to have Joe and Maggie's support and counsel," Clinton said. "With their help, we will bring our message of change to Indiana and across the country."
