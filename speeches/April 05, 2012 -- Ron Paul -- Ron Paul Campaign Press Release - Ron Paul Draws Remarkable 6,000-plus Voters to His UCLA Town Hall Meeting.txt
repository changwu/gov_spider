LAKE JACKSON, Texas — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul continued his pattern of attracting thousands of attendees to his town hall meetings, this time drawing 6,000-plus voters to his UCLA campus event.
Tonight's UCLA town hall meeting took place at 8:30 p.m. PST at the Los Angeles Tennis Center (LATC)'s Straus Stadium, located at 420 Charles E. Young Drive West, Los Angeles, CA 90095. Dr. Paul spoke to the UCLA and general community about the need for constitutionally-limited government, the bonds that tie economic and civil liberties, and elements of his 'Plan to Restore America,' an economic blueprint that cuts Washington spending, reduces debt, and curtails the rapid growth of the federal government.
Event organizers noted that in addition to the capacity crowd of more than 5,800 seated guests, more than 300 attendees were denied entrance due to the local fire marshal's concern for overcrowding. Just last night, the 12-term Congressman from Texas broke his earlier record attracting more than 6,200 voters to a similar town hall meeting held at Cal State — Chico.
