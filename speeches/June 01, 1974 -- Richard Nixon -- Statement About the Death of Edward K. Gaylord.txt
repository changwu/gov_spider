    E. K. GAYLORD was a rugged, enduring pioneer whose memory will live in the annals of American journalism. His news career began in 1901 and ended only with his death, at the age of 101. Typically, he was active and working to the end.
Over the years, as editor and publisher, Mr. Gaylord built the Daily Oklahoman into one of the leading newspapers of the American Southwest. His clear, forthright, and reasoned editorials reflected not only his keen judgment of men and events but his deep love of country.
Mrs. Nixon and I extend our sympathy to Mr. Gaylord's family and friends on the sad occasion of his passing.
