    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that former U.S. Congresswoman Patricia Saiki will serve as the campaign's Hawaii Chair. Saiki will be joined by Councilman Charles Djou and former State Representative Sam Aiona, who will serve as State Vice-Chairs.
"Rudy is a true leader that has proven he has the executive experience to be President," said Saiki, the only Republican to serve Hawaii as a U.S. Representative in Congress. "The people of Hawaii want a strong leader they can trust, and he is the one candidate that we know we can trust to run the country."
"The Mayor is generating support from all over the United States, and he is the only Republican that can harness that support into a victory in the general election," said Giuliani's National Deputy Political Director Rick Wiley. "We are honored to have such distinguished Republican leaders in Hawaii supporting Rudy."
