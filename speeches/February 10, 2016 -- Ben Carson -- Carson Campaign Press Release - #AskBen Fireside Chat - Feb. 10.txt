    Good evening, Friends. It's time for yet another evening chat. Keep texting in your thoughts and questions at 275-236 (ASKBEN).
I get a lot of questions about the the environment, and specifically the Obama Administration's many executive orders and overreaching rules. Yesterday we finally saw the Supreme Court stand up to the President on one such rule. While they stopped short of ruling on the Clean Power Plan's emissions restrictions on power plants, the Supreme Court did issue a stay preventing the rule's enforcement for now. This latest attempt by the EPA to control and reinvent our energy sector by executive action is shameful. Despite the complete lack of regulatory authority, the EPA director and climate alarmists remain committed to imposing their agenda regardless of the law or even the will of the people.
This is the most alarming part of this court case. It has shown just how little regard the administration has for We the People. Democrats are willing to use any means at their disposal to radically change our country, and the Constitution, along with Constitutional principles such as the separation of powers and federalism, have repeatedly been the victims of their assault. Our next president must be a vigilant defender of the Constitution, and if elected I promise to always abide by our founding principals; and to appoint justices who will do likewise. We cannot afford another President who will erode our liberty or our laws.
As for encouraging cleaner, cheaper and more reliable energy sources, federal mandates are the wrong course of action. We should encourage free market investment to innovate new technologies and methods. Artificial restrictions on energy sources only hurt consumers by raising prices. If we want a vibrant, affordable and cleaner energy sector, we need to let companies compete. That's the only way to ensure that the American people will continue to have access to the affordable and reliable energy they need.
