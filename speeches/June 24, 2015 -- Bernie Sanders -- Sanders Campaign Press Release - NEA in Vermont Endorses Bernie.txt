    BURLINGTON, Vt. â€“ Vermont NEA on Wednesday endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders' bid for the Democratic nomination for president.
"School teachers and educators are real American heroes. I am honored to have their backing," said Sanders.
Martha Allen, a K-12 librarian from Canaan, Vermont, and the state NEA president, announced the endorsement. "We want to let the whole country in on what we in Vermont have long known," she said. "Bernie's core values are in line with ours: he is pro-family, pro-worker, pro-education and pro-labor and we believe the time has come for his vision to become a national reality."
The union is a long-time backer of the senator. "In Vermont, we're very fortunate to have a senator who represents the middle class over the titans of Wall Street," Allen said. "We believe that with Bernie in the White House, America's working families will be able to flourish and grow. His ideas around banking reform, student debt, and public education are refreshing and exciting."
Vermont-NEA is the state's largest union with 12,000 members.
