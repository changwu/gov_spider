    Miller to Host CNN Town Hall Watch Party in Las Vegas
Today, Chris Miller, former Chair of the Clark County, Nevada, Democratic Party, is endorsing Kamala Harris for President. Miller will host a watch party during the Senator's CNN Town Hall tonight, April 22, where he will lay out why he's supporting Harris for president.
"I support Senator Kamala Harris for President because she has a deep understanding of America's strengths and our challenges," Miller said. "Through her support for America's middle class, fighting for civil rights, equality, criminal justice reform and holding those in power accountable, Senator Harris is the fighter America needs to move our country in a new direction."
In 2011, Miller made history as the first openly gay Chairman elected to a full, 2-year term of the Clark County Democratic Party. During his three terms in office, Miller and his team were successful in growing the Democratic Party in Southern Nevada - increasing voter registration numbers, reelecting President Obama in 2012 and working towards Nevada's sweeping Democratic Party victories in 2016.
"I'm extremely proud to have Chris's endorsement in this race," Harris said. "I am committed to building a coalition that reflects the diversity of this nation and working together on policies that move our country forward. As I make my way around the Silver State, I look forward to talking to Nevadans about our fight for higher teacher pay, common sense gun safety reform and access to affordable health care."
Tonight, Miller will host a watch party with supporters for Harris' CNN Town Hall at 9328 Peace Pipe Ct, Las Vegas, NV, at 6:30PM. The watch party is open to the public.
Miller joins Nevada State Senator Pat Spearman in endorsing Harris in the Democratic presidential primary. Nevada will hold their caucus contests on Tuesday, February 23, the third state in the 2020 primary schedule.
