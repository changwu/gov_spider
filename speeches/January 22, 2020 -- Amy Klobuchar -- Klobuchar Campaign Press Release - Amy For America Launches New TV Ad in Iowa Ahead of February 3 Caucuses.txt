    "Buckle Up" Will Begin Airing Across Iowa Today
DES MOINES, IA â€” Amy For America today unveiled a new television ad to air statewide in Iowa. The six-figure ad buy comes less than two weeks before the Iowa Caucuses on February 3.
"Buckle Up" highlights Senator Amy Klobuchar's plan of more than 100 executive actions she will take in the first 100 days of her presidency, including re-entering the Paris international climate agreement, taking steps to lower the cost of prescription drugs and closing the "boyfriend loophole" to prevent domestic abusers from obtaining firearms.
Klobuchar is the only candidate to propose a comprehensive plan for the first 100 days of her presidency of actions a President can legally take without Congressional approval.
Klobuchar is the only candidate to qualify for the February debate who has visited all of Iowa's 99 counties. This week, she earned endorsements from three additional sitting Iowa legislators, bringing her total to 16 -- more than any other candidate in the field.
