    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)
(Rep. Weldon (R) FL and 125 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports enactment of H.R. 534, which will ensure protection of human life as the frontiers of science expand. The Administration unequivocally is opposed to the cloning of human beings either for reproduction or for research. The moral and ethical issues posed by human cloning are profound and cannot be ignored in the quest for scientific discovery. Accordingly, the Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 534, a comprehensive ban against all human cloning.
The Administration is strongly opposed to any legislation that would prohibit human cloning for reproductive purposes but permit the creation of cloned embryos or development of human embryo farms for research, which would require the destruction of nascent human life. Thus, the Administration would strongly oppose any substitute amendment that would permit human embryos to be created, developed, and destroyed solely for research purposes.
At the same time, the Administration strongly supports the development of cell and tissue-based therapies based on research involving the use of nuclear transfer or other cloning techniques to produce molecules, DNA, cells other than human embryos, tissues, organs, plants, or animals other than humans.
To date, these scientific methods have enabled researchers to develop innovative drugs to treat diseases, such as breast cancer, and aid in treatment techniques for injury, such as cloning skin cells for skin grafts.
