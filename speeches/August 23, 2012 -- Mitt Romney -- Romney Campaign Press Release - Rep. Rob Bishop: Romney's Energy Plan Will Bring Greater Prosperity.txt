    Utah Congressman and senior member of the House Natural Resources Committee Rob Bishop made the following statement on Mitt Romney's vision for America as an energy superpower:
"Governor Romney's plan for North American energy independence clearly outlines a path toward greater prosperity for our country, for states, and for businesses and families. The plan is in stark contrast to the energy agenda set by President Obama, whose lack of knowledge about economic policies led to onerous regulations and mandates that reversed previous advancements toward energy independence and in the process, destroyed thousands of long-term and well-paying jobs. President Obama's misguided efforts to pick winners and losers within the renewable energy industry cost taxpayers billions, manipulated the free market, and left thousands without work. Governor Romney's plan takes our country in the right direction. By growing domestic energy, prices will be more affordable, millions of jobs will be created, and our country will be more secure."
