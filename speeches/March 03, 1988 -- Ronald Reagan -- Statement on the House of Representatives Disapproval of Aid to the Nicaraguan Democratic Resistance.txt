    The House has once again failed to approve an aid package for the Nicaraguan democratic resistance. I call on the House and Senate to act urgently to develop an aid package which is effectively deliverable and of sufficient quantity to sustain the Nicaraguan freedom fighters. If not, the prospects for peace and democracy inside Nicaragua will diminish quickly.
