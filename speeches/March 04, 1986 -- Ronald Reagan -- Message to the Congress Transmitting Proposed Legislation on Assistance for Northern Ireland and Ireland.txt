    To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith for the consideration of the Congress proposed legislation, entitled the "Northern Ireland and Ireland Assistance Act of 1986," to provide support of the United States to the Anglo-Irish Agreement on Northern Ireland.
This legislative proposal calls for a five-year program of $250,000,000 that would be taken from a number of existing economic programs including Housing Guarantees and the Private Sector Revolving Fund, which are administered by the Agency for International Development, the investment insurance program of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the Trade and Development Program.
In addition, the authorization of $20 million for the Economic Support Fund for 1987 is proposed, which will be within the total amount for that fund currently requested in the 1987 Budget. This would provide a cash contribution to an international economic development fund for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland under the auspices of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council. A supplemental appropriation request for 1986 for an initial contribution to this Anglo-Irish fund is concurrently being transmitted to the Congress.
I urge the Congress to act without delay on this important legislation. I am confident our efforts, together with those of the Governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland, will help to promote economic and social development in Ireland, thereby constructing a durable framework that would provide a promise of peace for the people of Northern Ireland.
