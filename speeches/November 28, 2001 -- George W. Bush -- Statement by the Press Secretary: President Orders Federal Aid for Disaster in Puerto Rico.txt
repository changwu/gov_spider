    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and ordered Federal aid to supplement Commonwealth and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms, flooding, mudslides and landslides on November 7, 2001 and continuing.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to local governments in the municipalities of Barranquitas, Bayamn, Ciales, Corozal, Jayuya, Juncos, Morovis, Naranjito, San Lorenzo, and Utuado.
Federal funding is available to eligible local governments on a cost-sharing basis for the repair or replacement of public facilities damaged by the severe storms, flooding, mudslides and landslides. Federal funding is also available on a cost share basis for hazard mitigation measures.
Joe M. Allbaugh, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), named Justo Hernndez as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The Agency said that damage surveys are continuing in other areas, and additional assistance and municipalities may be added after the assessments are completed.
