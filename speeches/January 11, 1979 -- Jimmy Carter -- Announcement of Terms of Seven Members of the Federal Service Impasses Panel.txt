    The President has signed commissions which set the terms of seven members of the Federal Service Impasses Panel whom he appointed on February 21, 1978. This action is necessary under the law implementing civil service reorganization, which requires that members of the Panel be appointed for set terms, with the initial terms staggered.
The commissions provide for 5-year terms for Howard G. Gamser (also appointed Chairman of the Panel), Charles J. Morris, and Beverly K. Schaffer; 3-year terms for James E. Jones, Jr., and Arthur Stark; and 1-year terms for Irving Bernstein and Jean T. McKelvey.
