    Warm greetings to everyone participating in "Take Our Daughters to Work Day." We dedicate this special day each year to empowering girls with the encouragement and practical work experiences that will enable them to become leaders in the workplace of the future.
Young girls must never believe that there are limitations on what they can do or become in this country. That's why all of us have a responsibility to renew our commitment to gender equality not only at work, but also in our homes, schools, and communities. It is time to treat our children the same, to embrace their unique gifts, and to allow them to utilize their Godgiven talents as they choose.
As parents, family members, mentors, and teachers, we also have an obligation to introduce our children to new experiences and to extend their education beyond the boundaries of the classroom. If we are to fulfill the exciting promise of the twenty-first century, we must instill in our girls and boys a deep appreciation for lifelong learning and the confidence and selfesteem to live out their dreams.
I commend the thousands of families, businesses, schools, and communities participating in "Take Our Daughters to Work Day" for showing America's young women that we believe in them and in their ability to lead us in the years to come. You are making a lasting investment in America's future.
Hillary joins me in extending best wishes for a memorable observance.
