Shifty Schiff now seems to think they don't need the Whistleblower who started the whole Scam. The reason is that the Whistleblower has lost all credibility because the story is so far from the facts on the Transcrpt. Also the second Whistleblower is no longer even mentioned!Retweets: 2015Favorites: 6069

A big scandal at @ABC News. They got caught using really gruesome FAKE footage of the Turks bombing in Syria. A real disgrace. Tomorrow they will ask softball questions to Sleepy Joe Biden's son Hunter like why did Ukraine & China pay you millions when you knew nothing? Payoff?Retweets: 35933Favorites: 117048

Democrats are allowing no transparency at the Witch Hunt hearings. If Republicans ever did this they would be excoriated by the Fake News. Let the facts come out from the charade of people most of whom I do not know they are interviewing for 9 hours each not selective leaks.Retweets: 23799Favorites: 86986
