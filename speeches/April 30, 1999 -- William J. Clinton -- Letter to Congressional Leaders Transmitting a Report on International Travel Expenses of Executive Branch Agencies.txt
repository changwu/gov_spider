    Dear __________:
I am transmitting the following information on international travel in accordance with provisions of section 2505(g) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, FYs 1998 and 1999, as included in Public Law 105-277, the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999.
The estimated total obligations for international travel by executive branch agencies in FY 1998 were $311,261,371. This number excludes obligations for civilian/military relocation expenses due to a permanent change of work station and the deployment of military units. Of that amount, the Department of State accounted for $112,000,000 or 36 percent. Additionally, the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Health and Human Services, Justice, and the Treasury, as well as the U.S. Information Agency and the Agency for International Development all reported obligations close to or in excess of $10,000,000. In total, these eight agencies account for 51 percent of obligations for international travel during FY 1998. The estimated total number of individuals who traveled was 57,142.
The details of this report are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
