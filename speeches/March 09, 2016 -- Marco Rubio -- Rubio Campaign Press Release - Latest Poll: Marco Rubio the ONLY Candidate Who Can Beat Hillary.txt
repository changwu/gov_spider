    
Poll after poll over the last couple years have found a reliable trend: 
Marco beats Hillary Clinton in a general election matchup, and other Republicans — Ted Cruz, and especially Donald Trump — do not.
It's as simple as that.
The latest poll from NBC from NBC finds the same thing.
Donald Trump loses to Hillary by historically large margins, an absolute landslide: 

Meanwhile, Ted Cruz loses to Hillary by 2 points, but Marco ties her.
The most recent Real Clear Politics averages reflect that Marco alone can do better than that: He can win. Trump loses to Hillary by an average of 5 points, while Marco beats her by an average of 5!

So if Florida Republicans want a candidate who can take back the White House this fall, there's one clear choice next Tuesday: Marco.
