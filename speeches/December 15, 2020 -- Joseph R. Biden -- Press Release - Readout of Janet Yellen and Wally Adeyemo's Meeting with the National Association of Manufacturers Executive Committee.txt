    Treasury Secretary-designee and Deputy Treasury Secretary-designee, Janet Yellen and Wally Adeyemo joined members of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) Board Leadership and Executive Committee for a virtual roundtable Tuesday afternoon.
Dr. Yellen opened the discussion by discussing the urgent need for relief for the millions of Americans who need help now, expressing her hope that Congress will pass a robust relief package as we head into a difficult period with the pandemic. The need to secure additional relief through a robust jobs package that would include funding for vaccine distribution was also highlighted as a major focus of Dr. Yellen and Mr. Adeyemo. Dr. Yellen detailed the President-elect's Build Back Better plan and his focus on investments and policies to address the immediate crisis, as well as chronic, long-term structural problems facing the economy, including job loss, wage stagnation, the deterioration of critical infrastructure, and the need to invest in skills and jobs training to get Americans back to work.
They discussed their joint commitment to addressing the opportunity gap, supporting sustainable manufacturing practices and the need to invest in R&D, clean energy, infrastructure and skills training to maintain a robust American manufacturing sector, build a stronger economy and create more, good-paying jobs for American workers.
Dr. Yellen thanked NAM's leadership for a productive discussion and expressed the incoming administration's interest in maintaining an open dialogue and close working relationship given the critical role manufacturing will continue to play in the recovery, including the production of PPE and consumer goods, maintaining the food supply, and supporting vaccination efforts.
