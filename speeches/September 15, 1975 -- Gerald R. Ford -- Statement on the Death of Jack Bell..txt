    I WAS saddened to learn of Jack Bell's death. A Washington political writer and author for more than three decades, he was also one of the best reporters I have ever known. Jack was a thorough, untiring newsman, always seeking more detail, more substance, more facts. He knew as much about national politics as many of us directly involved in it--and perhaps a bit more. He had the great ability to put complex issues in concrete, easy-to-understand terms.
American journalism has lost one of its giants and American readers one of their most respected bylines. Mrs. Ford joins me in sending our condolences to Mrs. Bell and her family.
