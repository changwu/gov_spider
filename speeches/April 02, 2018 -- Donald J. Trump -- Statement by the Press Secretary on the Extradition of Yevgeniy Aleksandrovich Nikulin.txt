    The United States is grateful to the Czech Republic for the extradition of Yevgeniy Aleksandrovich Nikulin, who allegedly hacked computers belonging to LinkedIn, Dropbox, and Formspring. Nikulin, a Russian citizen, was arrested by Czech law enforcement and has been in Czech custody since October 2016. Bringing criminals to justice is an important aspect of maintaining the reliability of the internet and defending our core values. We applaud the Czech Republic for upholding the principles of accountability and justice in this matter.
