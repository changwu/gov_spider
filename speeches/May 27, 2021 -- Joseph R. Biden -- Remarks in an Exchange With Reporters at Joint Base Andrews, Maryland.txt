The President. I beg your pardon.
Q. Six trillion dollar budget, can you confirm the topline number?
The President. Well, we'll confirm that—that will all be distributed. And one of the things I want to tell you is that I haven't had a chance yet to go over the details of the counteroffer made by Capito. I'll be—we're going to meet sometime next week, and we'll see if we can move that. And I'll have more to say about that at the time.

Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation 
Q. Sir, what do you think of the proposal? Is the proposal too small for you from the Republicans? What is your thought on it?
The President. I had a good conversation—very brief, but a good conversation—with Capito, the Senator. And I told her we would—she's going to contact me next week. I told her we have to finish this really soon. And there's another Republican group that also wants to talk.
And—but we're going to have to close this down soon.
Q. What—how——
