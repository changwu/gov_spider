    THE American people have the deepest concern and sympathy for the people of Pakistan as they battle terrible floods, the most serious of this century, under the leadership of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Whole areas of Pakistan are being ravaged. Initial reports indicate that the number of people dead or missing is tragically large, that millions of people are homeless, and that the extent of property damage is mounting into hundreds of millions of dollars. The previously bright prospects for Pakistan's development have been temporarily dimmed.
In an immediate response to this situation, U.S. helicopters and boats with their crews are already engaged in helping with immediate rescue work and with the movement of vital relief supplies. Medical and other urgent needs are being met. Pakistan needs help, and I know its friends in the international community will respond generously.
In response to longer-term needs, I have directed that 100,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat be made available to the people of Pakistan to provide some immediate relief before their next harvest.
Further, I am directing that the United States begin now in helping with the rehabilitation and recovery of Pakistan to assure prompt and effective action for immediate relief and for our contribution to an early recovery. I have asked AID Deputy Administrator Maurice J. Williams, my special relief coordinator for major disasters abroad, to go to Pakistan to review with the Pakistan Government immediate relief and longer-range reconstruction needs. He will report to me. and after appropriate consultation with the Congress, we will continue to assure that the Government of the United States, in cooperation with other countries, will do all that it can to help our Pakistani friends recover from this terrible devastation.
