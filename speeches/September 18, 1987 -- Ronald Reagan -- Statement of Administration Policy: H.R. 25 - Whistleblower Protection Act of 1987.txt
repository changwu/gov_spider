    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Schroeder (D) Colorado and 84 others)
The administration opposes H.R. 25. Under the guise of protecting whistleblowers, H.R. 25 would radically disrupt the entire Federal employee disciplinary process and would have a serious detrimental effect on agency operations and on the Federal judicial system.
In the past four months, the administration has been working with the Post Office and Civil Service Committee to try to reach agreement on an acceptable version of the bill. Notwithstanding the administration's willingness to arrive at a constructive compromise, the bill has not been amended to remove its most seriously objectionable provisions. Accordingly, the President's senior advisers would find it necessary to recommend that he veto the bill if it should be presented to him in its present form.
