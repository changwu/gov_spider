    The President. I'd like to make a brief statement about the jury verdict in Arkansas today. First of all, the jury has completed its work, and they obviously worked for quite a long time and debated this thoroughly and tried to make a good decision. So I think we should all accept that.
Obviously, on a personal level, I'm very sorry for Governor Tucker and Jim and Susan McDougal. But the jury has decided. I was asked to give testimony; I did that. And for me, it's time to go back to work. That's what I intend to do.
Q. Do you think Governor Tucker should resign?
The President. I don't want to comment on that. I think those questions have to be resolved by the people involved and in terms of what their other options are. I don't want to comment on that.
I just think that this is a day for saying that these jurors worked a long time; they were out for an extended period of time; they reached their verdict. And as I said, for me it's more of a personal thing today. I'm very sorry for them personally. But I did what I was asked to do, and now I've got to go back to work. That's what I intend to do.
Q. Sir, do you think this is a repudiation of your statements?
Q. Did the jurors not believe you, sir? Did the jurors not believe you?
The President. You ought to ask them that. I doubt that; I doubt that that's what was going on. But you ought to ask them. I don't know.
