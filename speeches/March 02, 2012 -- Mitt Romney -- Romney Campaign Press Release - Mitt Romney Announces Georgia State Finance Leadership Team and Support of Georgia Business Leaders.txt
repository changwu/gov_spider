    Mitt Romney today announced the leadership of his Georgia State Finance Team.
"I am proud to announce the leadership of my Georgia Finance Team and the support of so many prominent Georgia business leaders," said Mitt Romney. "Their help will be essential in securing the resources necessary to defeat President Obama this fall. Georgia has been hit hard by President Obama's failed economic policies. Voters are looking for someone who will create jobs, rein in government spending and work to grow the economy. Their help will be essential to spreading this message so we can turn around our struggling economy."
"I am pleased to join with Mitt Romney to help get our country back on track," said Georgia State Finance Chair Eric Tanenblatt. "America has had enough of the broken promises and failed record of the Obama administration. We need a president who has bold conservative solutions to restore America's promise. That man is Mitt Romney. We need his proven leadership in Washington and I will do all I can to get him there."
