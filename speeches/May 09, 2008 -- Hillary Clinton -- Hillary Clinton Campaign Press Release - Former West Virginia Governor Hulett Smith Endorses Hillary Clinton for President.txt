    (Charleston, WV) â€“ Former West Virginia Governor Hulett Smith announced his endorsement of Hillary Clinton for President today, citing the Senator's commitment to fiscal responsibility, veterans, and the economy.
"Hillary Clinton is a proven and tested leader who is ready to lead on day one. We need a president with the strength and experience to create good paying jobs here at home, and make small town economies a priority again. Hillary's understanding of the challenges facing working families makes her the right choice for West Virginia," said Governor Smith.
A U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander in WWII, Smith served as Governor from 1965 to 1969. During his tenure, Smith signed into law measures to improve air and water quality, made government more transparent, and streamlined the budget process.
