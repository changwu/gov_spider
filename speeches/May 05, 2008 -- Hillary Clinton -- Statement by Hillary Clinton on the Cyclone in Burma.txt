    The cyclone that hit Burma over the weekend is one of the worst natural disasters since the Asian tsunami of 2004. It appears that many thousands have been killed and countless others are missing or otherwise hurt by the cyclone. My heart goes out to the victims of this horrible natural disaster and I hope the United States and the international community will respond to the needs of the Burmese people, who have suffered so much over the years.
Presidents Clinton and George H.W. Bush led the drive in the aftermath of the Tsunami in neighboring countries to mobilize and coordinate the efforts of the international community to help those who were hit the hardest. We must now mount an international effort to help the victims of this terrible event. I call on the Burmese regime to put aside politics and allow the international community to aid the people of Burma. This must be a transparent process in terms of who has been harmed, what kind and how much assistance is needed, and how those in trouble can be reached.
This disaster is a tremendous human tragedy and humanitarian challenge, but it also presents an opportunity for Burma to engage with the rest of the world and come together to save lives.
