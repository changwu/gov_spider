    NASHUA, N.H. â€” U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign spokesman Michael Briggs issued the following statement Thursday after an aide to Sec. Hillary Clinton said she gave a speech to "shake some sense" into Iowans:
"This is a strange way to appeal to Iowans who already have lots of common sense. That's why they picked Barack Obama in 2008 and that's why we are confident they will caucus for Bernie on February 1."
