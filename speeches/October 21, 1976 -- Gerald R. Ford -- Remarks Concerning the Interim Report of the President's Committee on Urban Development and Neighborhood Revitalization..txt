    Secretary Hills:
I am pleased to announce today that I have received from Secretary Hills the interim report of the President's Committee on Urban Development and Neighborhood Revitalization. The report deals forthrightly with the problems of our cities and the strengths of their neighborhoods.
It is a direct result of a White House meeting held last May, which included city officials and neighborhood and community leaders who have been concerned with the revitalization of our cities and their neighborhoods. Secretary Hills and her colleagues recommend positive steps toward consolidating and improving Federal programs and involving citizens in local decisionmaking.
The people of many of our Nation's urban neighborhoods and their elected officials have taken the initiative in solving the problems of neighborhood revitalization. Our best course of action--certainly our best course of action in the future--is to provide as much support as possible for responsible community and neighborhood leaders to preserve and to improve the quality of life in our Nation's neighborhoods.
I want to compliment and congratulate Secretary Hills for being Chairman of this group and congratulate her on the fine job that she and her associates have done in this report.
I'd like Secretary Hills now, if she would, to please brief you on the report. Secretary Hills.
SECRETARY HILLS. Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you very much, Carla.
