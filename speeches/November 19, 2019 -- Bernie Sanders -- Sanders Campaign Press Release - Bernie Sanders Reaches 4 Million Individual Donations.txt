    Milestone Follows Huge Endorsements
WASHINGTON â€“ Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign on Tuesday announced it has now received more than 4 million individual donations from people across the country, making Sanders the fastest candidate in history to reach the milestone.
"Working class Americans across the country are chipping in $3, $18, $27, or whatever they can to help elect Bernie Sanders because they know he is the only candidate who will fight for them and take on corporate greed and corruption," Campaign Manager Faiz Shakir said. "This is what momentum looks like."
In 2016, the Sanders campaign did not reach 4 million individual donations until after the New Hampshire Primary.
The announcement comes as the campaign continues to build momentum ahead of next year's early contests.
Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez two weeks ago held the largest rally of any 2020 Democratic presidential candidate to date in Iowa.
Last week, the campaign announced that since launching in February it has made over 7.75 million calls and sent over 63 million texts to voters with the majority of these going into early primary and Super Tuesday states.
Additionally, the campaign this weekend received the coveted endorsements from National Nurses United, United Teachers Los Angeles, Rights & Democracy, and the California Young Democrats.
