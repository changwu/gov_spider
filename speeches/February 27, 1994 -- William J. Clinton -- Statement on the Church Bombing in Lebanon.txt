    The killing of people at prayer is an outrage against faith and humanity. On behalf of the American people, I condemn in the strongest possible terms this latest incident in which innocent Lebanese at communion on Sunday morning were killed by bombs planted in a church. I extend my deepest sympathy to the bereaved.
Just as Friday's massacre in a Hebron mosque was aimed at the peace process, this bomb attack seems clearly aimed at Lebanon's reconciliation process. The extremists have a common purpose, to promote division, strife, and war. They must and will not be allowed to succeed.
I call on men and women of all faiths to unite in opposition to the forces of dark hatred. The people of the Middle East deserve a peaceful future. They deserve the right to pray in peace, as we join them in praying for it.
