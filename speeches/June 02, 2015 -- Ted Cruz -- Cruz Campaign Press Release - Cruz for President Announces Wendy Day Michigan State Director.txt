    HOUSTON, Texas â€“ Continuing to build a robust national and Michigan organization, Cruz for President today named Wendy Day, the current Vice Chair of the Michigan Republican Party and Liberty movement leader, as the Michigan State Director for the Cruz for President Campaign.
"Wendy is a great fit because she is no stranger to grassroots politics at every level," said Ted Cruz. "Her influence in the Great Lake State and commitment to freedom make her a valued member of our team."
Wendy is one of the most respected, hardworking grassroots leaders Michigan has seen, said Cruz State Chairman Saul Anuzis. "No one will out work her, no one knows both the Republican Party and Tea Party movement better than Wendy".
Wendy Day gained influence and notoriety in Michigan when she founded Common Sense in Government, a group that highlighted elected officials' misdeeds and educated voters on how to hold those officials accountable. Currently she serves as the Michigan Republican Party Grassroots Outreach Vice-Chair.
"Ted Cruz articulates a consistent message of optimism that has fired up people from the U.P. to Detroit," said Day. "It's clear that his courage, intelligence, wit, and love of country will unite voters from across the spectrum who rightfully demand that America's future be built on Freedom. Michiganders are telling me that this is the first time they've seen someone who reminds them of Ronald Reagan."
Day is responsible for organizing the 2010 "snowman protest", where her volunteers built over 60 snowmen in front of the Michigan Capitol to protest taxes. The result was a humorous and eye-catching display that attracted news media from all around the world.
Wendy Day is a military wife and mother. She has been married to Kevin Day for 19 years and they have four children, including David, 18, Craig, 17, Allison 11, and Brady, 7.
The Michigan Presidential primary is slated for March 8, 2016. In the general election, Michigan holds 16 electoral college votes.
