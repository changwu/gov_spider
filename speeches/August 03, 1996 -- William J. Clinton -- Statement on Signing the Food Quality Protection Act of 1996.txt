    Today I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 1627, the "Food Quality Protection Act of 1996," which brings much needed reform to laws governing pesticides and food safety.
Americans have every right to expect that the world's most bountiful food supply will also be the world's safest. Early in my Administration I set out to strengthen our pesticide and food safety laws. This Act achieves that goal with commonsense regulatory reform based on the best available science.
The Act will replace conflicting and outdated pesticide residue standards with a single, rigorous health-based standard for all food. All pesticides will be required to meet the new standard. Incentives are also provided for swift approval of safe, new pesticide alternatives for farmers.
Most importantly, H.R. 1627 contains special new provisions to protect America's infants and children from pesticide risks. These protections will guarantee that every family in America has the safest food possible on their dinner table.
This Act demonstrates how the Congress and the Administration can work together to help both farmers and consumers, and I am pleased to sign it into law.
