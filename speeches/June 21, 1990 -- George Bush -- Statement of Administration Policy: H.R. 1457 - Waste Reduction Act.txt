    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Wolpe (D) Michigan and 204 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 1457, but will work in the Senate to reduce the bill's appropriation authorizations. The Administration will also seek to reduce the bill's burdensome reporting requirements which could result in the disclosure of confidential business practices.
