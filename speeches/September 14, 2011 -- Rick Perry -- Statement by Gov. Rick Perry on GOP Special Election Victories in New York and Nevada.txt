    AUSTIN â€” Texas Gov. Rick Perry today issued the following statement on the special election GOP victories in New York's 9th District and Nevada's 2nd District U.S. House race:
I congratulate New York's Bob Turner and Nevada's Mark Amodei in their decisive victories yesterday evening, which clearly signal America's growing frustration with President Obama's failure to create jobs, cut the debt and deliver the hope he promised. America needs jobs, and voters know that this President doesn't have a clue how to get America working. As President, I will follow the principles of lower taxes, less spending and less government red tape that have helped make Texas the nation's top economy.
