    The President welcomes today's unanimous vote by the United Nations Security Council to renew the mandate for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI). This vote sends an important signal of the United Nations' commitment to support stability and security in Iraq. The UNAMI mandate renewal also reinforces the broader international framework for Iraq, which includes the International Compact with Iraq, and the Neighbors Process, which began in May, in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The United States is fully committed to this framework and looks forward to working with the United Nations and international partners to support the Iraqi Government and promote political dialog in Iraq.
