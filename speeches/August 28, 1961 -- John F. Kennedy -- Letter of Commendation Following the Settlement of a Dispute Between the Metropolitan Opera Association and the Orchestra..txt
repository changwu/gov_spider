    Gentlemen:
I am extremely pleased that a settlement has been reached in the dispute between the Metropolitan Opera Association and the orchestra, thus assuring a 1961-62 season.
You are to be highly commended for your statesmanship in submitting the issues you have been unable to resolve between yourselves to voluntary and binding arbitration by Secretary of Labor Arthur J. Goldberg, who will serve at your and my request.
By reaching agreement the parties to this dispute have insured that a great cultural resource of the United States will be continued for this season as it has since 1892. The Metropolitan Opera, as a standard of excellence and as a measure of creative vigor in the performing arts for over half a century, has become, through its travels about the United States and Canada, and through its recordings and broadcasts, a truly international institution, without losing its unique identity with the cultural life of New York City.
The Metropolitan Opera is important to the Nation. I am glad we have all found a way for it to continue.
Sincerely,.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
