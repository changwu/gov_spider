    Earlier today, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood called Governors Jerry Brown of California and Rick Snyder of Michigan to congratulate them on the selection of their states to receive part of $2 billion in funding announced today for high-speed intercity passenger rail projects across the country. They discussed California's plan to expand on efforts to build the nation's first 220-mph high-speed rail system between Los Angeles and San Francisco, and Michigan's plans for improvement of rail service between Detroit and Chicago by bringing trains up to speeds of 110-mph between Kalamazoo and Dearborn.
