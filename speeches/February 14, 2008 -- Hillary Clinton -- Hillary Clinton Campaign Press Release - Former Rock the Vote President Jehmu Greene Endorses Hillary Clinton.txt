    Austin, TX â€“ Former Rock the Vote President and Austinite Jehmu Greene announced her endorsement of Hillary Clinton for President today.
"I have met young people all over the country who are following in Senator Clinton's footsteps, speaking out against injustice at home and abroad, courageously fighting for what they believe in not because it's popular, but because it is right," Greene said. "And they are raising their voices against the noise, to ask the hard questions and vote for Senator Clinton because their hearts and minds tell them that she is the right choice."
"Jehmu Greene has broken barriers while encouraging our youth to be active in the community and I am proud to have her support," Hillary Clinton said. "The youth in our country are hungry for change and I look forward to having her support and guidance in spreading our message."
Jehmu Greene was the first African American president of Rock the Vote. She will serve as a youth outreach adviser for the campaign and will be a member of the Hillblazers Steering Committee.
Under Greene's leadership, Rock the Vote's membership grew from 1,500 to 1 million and registered over 1.4 million new voters. Greene has an extensive background in public service and issue advocacy and is a leading expert on voting, activism and pop culture.
