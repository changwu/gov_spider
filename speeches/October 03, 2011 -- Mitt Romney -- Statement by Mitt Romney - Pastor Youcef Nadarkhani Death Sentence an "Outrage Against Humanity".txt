    Mitt Romney today issued the following statement on the death sentence of Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani in Iran:
"I strongly condemn the Iranian regime for the conviction and death sentence of Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani. The freedom of religious belief is the most personal of rights, and Iran's effort to bring the power of the state to bear upon Pastor Nadarkhani's Christian faith is not only a violation of Iran's international obligations, but an unacceptable outrage against human dignity. I call on the Iranian authorities to rescind the conviction and death sentence, release Pastor Nadarkhani, and abandon all measures that deny the Iranian people basic human rights."
