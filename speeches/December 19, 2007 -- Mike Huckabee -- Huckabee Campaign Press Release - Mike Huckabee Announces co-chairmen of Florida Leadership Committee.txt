    LITTLE ROCK, AR â€“ Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential candidate Mike Huckabee has named Florida Senate Majority Leader Daniel Webster and Speaker of the House Marco Rubio co-chairmen of his Florida campaign organization. "Senator Webster and Speaker Rubio are incredible assets to my Florida campaign," Huckabee said. "Both are esteemed legislators and have been exceptional leaders for the people of Florida ."
Webster is a former state House speaker who has become a nationally respected conservative politician during his 28 years in the legislature.
Rubio was elected Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives in November 2006. His book, 100 Innovative Ideas for Florida's Future, was compiled after Rubio traveled around Florida to gather ideas from citizens. This was done through what Rubio calls "Idearaisers."
Both these prominent legislators recently announced they were endorsing Governor Huckabee.
"Mike Huckabee is our best chance to have a Reagan Republican as our nominee," Rubio said. "For those of us who want the Republican Party to continue to be the party of life, of traditional family values and of limited government, Mike Huckabee is the best choice."
The announcement comes on the heels of the latest Rasmussen Florida poll on December 14, which had Huckabee in first place with 27 percent of the vote compared to Mitt Romney's 23 percent and Rudy Giuliani's 19 percent.
"I am honored to serve as co-chairman for Governor Huckabee's Florida Presidential campaign," Webster said. "Governor Huckabee is a principled, conservative leader who has proven he has the leadership qualities to be the next president of the United States . I intend to work diligently in the days and months ahead to ensure Governor Huckabee is elected as our nation's next president." The Florida presidential primary election is January 29.
