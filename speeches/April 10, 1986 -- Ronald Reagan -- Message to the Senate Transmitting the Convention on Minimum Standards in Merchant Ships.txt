    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification of the Convention (No. 147) Concerning Minimum Standards in Merchant Ships, adopted by the 62nd session of the International Labor Conference, at Geneva, on October 13, 1976, I transmit herewith a certified copy of that Convention. I transmit also for the Senate's information a certified copy of the recommendation (No. 155) concerning the improvement of standards in merchant ships, adopted by the International Labor Conference at the same time as the Convention. No action is called for on the recommendation.
The report of the Department of State, with a letter from the Secretary of Labor, concerning the Convention is enclosed. The Department's report also contains the texts of five proposed understandings. It is proposed that these understandings be included in the United States instrument of ratification, should the Senate give its advice and consent.
Adoption of the Convention and the recommendation was the culmination of a long negotiating process in which the United States participated actively and vigorously supported the drafting of a comprehensive and effective instrument to achieve minimum standards in merchant ships. I believe that the United States ratification of this Convention is in the national interest and in the interest of the world community as a whole, and I, therefore, recommend that the Senate give its advice and consent to ratification, subject to the understandings mentioned above.
