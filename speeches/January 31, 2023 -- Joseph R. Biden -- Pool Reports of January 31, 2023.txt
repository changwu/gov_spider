Travel pool report #1 — Biden arrival at JBA
Good morning, I will be your travel pooler on this blustery and rainy January day in DC. The weather is supposed to be a little bit drier at the trip's destination, in New York City.
Marine One touched down at Joint Base Andrews at 10:24. It taxi'd for a minute before arriving near the front of AF1.

President Biden disembarked from AF1 at 11:24, amid a light flurry of snow here at JFK. He waved briefly to the press before making the short walk to Marine1. He ignored shouted questions from the press
Pool was soon escorted to waiting ospreys located on another end of the airfield from Marine1. Pool was unable to see the president board Marine1 or watch it lift off.

Travel report #6 arrival at Hudson Tunnel
Motorcade arrived 12:06.
Uneventful ride, with only intermittent small groups of people gathered to watch the president go by. With traffic stoped on 12th avenue running parallel to the Westside Highway one minivan had its door slid open to let the kids inside see the motorcade.



January 31, 202312:18

Travel pool report #7 pre-Biden program underway
Pool was escorted from the motorcade through a series of underground tunnels to the West Side Rail Yard in the Hudson Tunnel, where the announcement is taking place. Secretary of Transportation was addressing the assembled dignitaries when the pool walked in.

whitehouse.gov

 







Biden was preceded as a speaker by Buttigieg, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, Sens. Gillibrand and Booker, Sen. Bob Menendez, and, finally, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Aides adorned the presidential seal to the lectern before Biden spoke.
One note: Booker said Biden's first two years in office presided over the most "successful" in "50, 75 years." He later took a picture of the assembled audience, admonishing Sen. Menendez to put down his phone and "smile."
Some notes on the scenery: one of the train cars serving as a backdrop for the president's speech has two presidential emblems in its windows. Thirteen railway workers are also standing above him.



January 31, 202313:17

Travel Pool Report #9 Biden speech ends
The POTUS' speech ended at 12:58.
Biden shook hands with lawmakers and other officials for a few minutes. He stopped to talk briefly with another group of railway workers before leaving but was out of earshot for the assembled reporters.
Again, apologies if the event's reports have been on a delay — the pool had very limited internet connectivity during the event.
Pool is now rushing back to the motorcade for departure to the DNC reception.



January 31, 202313:28

Democratic donor and former hedge fund exec Jeffrey Weber will introduce Biden, per the White House. Sen. Schumer is also in attendance.



January 31, 202314:56

Travel pool report #14 Biden remarks first cut
After being introduced by Weber, Biden spoke to a packed room of a little more than two dozen people attendees, many of them seated on a pair of couches in the middle of the room. Biden spoke near the front of the room with a microphone.
Biden said he ran in 2020 to restore the soul of the country, rebuild the middle class, and unite the country.
"The third is turning out to be the hardest thing to do, but we're getting there."
Biden chided Republicans for, in his view, trying to cut Social Security and Medicare. He then talked about the threat of climate change.
"It is the single most existential threat to humanity we have ever faced, including nuclear weapons."
He said succeeding Trump was a "pretty low bar to climb" but said there was nonetheless a lot of work to do.
He criticized House Speaker Kevin McCarthy for making "off-the-wall" promises to GOP leaders to secure his position and criticized the policies of his predecessor in the White House.
Pool was then escorted out of the room.
Much more to come



January 31, 202315:03

January 31, 202315:27

travel pool report #17 more Biden remarks on McCarthy
Biden called McCarthy a "decent man" but said he has to cater to cave to an extremist wing of his party to become speaker.
"He had to do to get commitments that are just absolutely off the wall for speaker of the House to make in terms of the being able to come in. I can't imagine, Chuck, you making one of those commitments."
Schumer, seated just feet from Biden, retorted: "It took us one vote, and it was unanimous."
Biden reiterated criticism that the GOP had changed.
"Look, this is not your father's Republican Party. No, I mean it, this is a different breed of cat."
He said under his predecessor, the deficit increased by 25% in just four years. His administration, meanwhile, had reduced it by $1.7 trillion.
"We paid for everything and grew the economy at the same time."
Biden talked about what Democrats need to do sicceed in future elections.
"But there's two things that I think we have to run on: what we stand for, what we did, and what we need to do more of."
Biden highlighted education as one issue he and his administration needed to make more progress on.
