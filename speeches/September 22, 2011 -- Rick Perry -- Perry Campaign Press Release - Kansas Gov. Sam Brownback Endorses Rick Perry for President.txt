    AUSTIN - Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback endorsed Texas Gov. Rick Perry for president today, saying his record on jobs, taxes and spending proves he is the best candidate to lead America.
"I have known and worked with Rick Perry for over twenty years. He is the right leader for this moment in history," said Gov. Brownback. "Now more than ever, America needs a President who knows how to create jobs and stop Washington's runaway spending. Rick Perry balanced budgets in tough economic times, signed the largest tax cut in state history and helped Texas become the national leader in job creation. On the most important issues of our time, his record of leadership serves as a blueprint for America's renewal."
As Governor, Rick Perry has helped build the nation's top economy. Since June 2009, Texas is responsible for nearly 40 percent of the net new jobs in America. Since he became governor,Texas has gained more than one million jobs â€” a stark contrast the 2.4 million jobs lost on President Obama's watch.
"Governor Brownback is one of the most respected voices for conservatism in the country, and it's great to have his support," said Gov. Perry. "As a former senator and congressman who consistently fought for lower taxes and a balanced federal budget, he knows the challenges we face in rehabilitating Washington. I'm glad that he trusts me to get the job done as the next president."
