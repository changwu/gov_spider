    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Danforth (R) Missouri and 3 others)
The Administration does not object to Senate passage of S. 990, which authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1986 and 1987 for NOAA program support and certain ocean and coastal activities. The Administration strongly urges, however, the adoption of an amendment to permit an increase in user fees for NOAA aeronautical and nautical maps and charts, as proposed in legislation transmitted to Congress by the Department of Commerce on February 25, 1985.
