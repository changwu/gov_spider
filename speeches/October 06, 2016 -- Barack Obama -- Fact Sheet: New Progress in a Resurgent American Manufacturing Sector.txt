    "Each year, hundreds of thousands of people observe this day by attending open houses, public tours, and career workshops. As we mark 5 years since the first Manufacturing Day, we must inspire the next generation of workers and innovators to seek careers in manufacturing. Let us continue working to strengthen and expand the manufacturing jobs of tomorrow and ensure that opportunity for all is something we can keep making in America for generations to come." - President Obama, October 6, 2016
U.S. manufacturing is making a comeback, with more than 800,000 new jobs added since the sector turned the corner after the Great Recession in 2010. For the last four years in a row, global CEOs have named the United States the best place to make and invest, and new capital investment is flowing in to a broad range of manufacturing technologies.
Tomorrow, on the fifth-annual Manufacturing Day, we mark an Administration-long focus on the technologies and skills that are the foundation of the most dynamic manufacturing sector in the world. The President is proclaiming October 7 as  National Manufacturing Day to celebrate Made in America and renew his commitment to this vibrant sector.
The Administration is announcing important progress in support of American manufacturing, including:
•      Announcements by 5 Federal Agencies, including grants to strengthen manufacturing supply chains by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, challenges to catalyze next-generation technologies by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and initiatives to support more American Veterans pursuing technical training in advanced manufacturing by the Department of Veterans Affairs.
•      Commitments by more than 110 organizations, including the first manufacturing-oriented massive open online course of its kind by MIT, 18 expanded and inaugural  Grand Challenge Scholars Programs by colleges and universities across the country, and 30 new manufacturing apprenticeships by the Manufacturing Association of Central New York.
•      A new report by the National Economic Council, highlighting an Administration-long focus to strengthen the competitiveness of American manufacturing.
Background 
Too often, young people do not envision themselves in the manufacturing careers that proudly produce iconic Made in USA goods, like world-class aircraft engines, life-saving biopharmaceuticals, and cutting-edge automobiles. That's why President Obama has proclaimed October 7, 2016 as National Manufacturing Day to celebrate the strength of American manufacturing and to motivate the next generation of manufacturers.
In support of Manufacturing Day, thousands of U.S. manufacturers are expected to host factory tours, hackathons, and career exploration panels, providing hands-on demonstrations of what 21st Century manufacturing looks like In addition to the more than 500,000 students and local organizations expected to participate, Administration officials will be celebrating the 5th annual Manufacturing Day, including:
•      In Portland, OR, Department of Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker is moderating a panel of recent graduates with careers in manufacturing and touring demonstrations of 3D printers and robots at the Center for Advanced Learning. Secretary Pritzker is also joining local high school students for a facilities tour at Lam Research, an equipment manufacturer for advanced semiconductors.
•      In Warren, MI, Department of Education Secretary John B. King, Jr. saw first-hand how production molds are designed and manufactured for the plastics industry at Proper Tooling, followed by a roundtable with students, employees of Macomb Community College, and employees of Proper Tooling to discuss the foundational role of STEM education in advanced manufacturing.
•      In Wilmington, DE, Department of Labor Secretary Thomas Perez participated in roundtables at RC Fabricators, a steel manufacturer, and Zip Code Wilmington, a nonprofit coding school, focused on the crucial role that apprenticeships play in equipping works with the skills they need to compete in today's labor market.
•      In National Harbor, MD, U.S. Chief Technology Officer Megan Smith is co-creating the vehicles of tomorrow with students from the Arlington Career Center, Georgetown University, the George Washington University, Oxon Hill Middle School, Thurgood Marshall College Fund, the University of the District of Columbia, and the University of Maryland at the Local Motors demonstration facility.
An Administration-Long Focus on American Manufacturing
Entering office in 2009 in the midst of grim economic and financial conditions in the United States and around the world, President Obama took immediate steps to restore balance to the U.S. economy. The Administration recognized that economic stability is rooted in a strong manufacturing sector, and so prioritized manufacturing as a cornerstone of the economic policy agenda. In the fall of 2009, the Administration released the  Framework for Revitalizing American Manufacturing, a policy blueprint to revitalize the manufacturing sector.
Over the last 8 years, the Administration has made substantial progress in four core areas: spurring innovation through next-generation technologies; making the U.S. more cost-competitive for production; strengthening skills, communities, and supply chains to attract investment; and capturing our fair share by leveling the playing field, opening access to markets, and promoting U.S. investment.
Four years ago, in response to a  recommendation by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, the Administration created a National Network for Manufacturing Innovation, connecting people, ideas, and technology to solve industry-relevant advanced manufacturing challenges. Now known as Manufacturing USA, the program has grown to nine connected institutes with nearly 1,300 member companies, universities, and non-profits. The Federal government's commitment of over $600 million to the nine awarded institutes has been matched by over $1.3 billion in non-Federal resources from across industry, academia, and state government. More institutes, representing more than $800 million in additional Federal and non-Federal resources, are on the way and will keep the Administration on track to meet the President's goal of launching 15 Manufacturing USA institutes before the end of the Administration.
New Steps Being Announced by the Administration Today
Federal announcements in support of Manufacturing Day being made today are:
•      The National Economic Council is releasing a  new report on the state of the manufacturing sector, including new findings that illustrate the rise in advanced technology skills among manufacturing workers and the increasingly technology-driven nature of this sector, and highlights the Administration's efforts over the last 8 years to strengthen the competitiveness of American manufacturing. The report finds that a strong manufacturing sector is vital to a growing innovative economy, and notes:
o      Workers employed in manufacturing earn 20 percent higher than the median income and, even when holding all other factors equal, it is clear that workers in the manufacturing sector earn a pay premium.
o      The manufacturing sector houses a great deal of innovative activity, with 75 percent of private sector research and development, 60 percent of all U.S. R&D employees, and the vast majority of patents issued, despite representing only 12 percent of the GDP.
o      Manufacturing activity generates positive spillover benefits, because the know-how and capabilities gained in making things is a key ingredient in continued leadership in design, product development, and innovation.
o      Since the Great Recession, manufacturing has grown at nearly twice the pace of the economy overall, marking the longest period where manufacturing has outpaced U.S. economic output in 50 years.
o      Analysis by the President's Council of Economic Advisers suggests that cyclical factors do not fully explain manufacturing's job gains, as the job gains between 2010 and early 2014 are about 500,000 above and beyond what would be associated with the historical cyclical pattern.
•      The interagency Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office is building on the Secretary of Commerce's announcement of Manufacturing USA, the new public name for the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation, by launching ManufacturingUSA.com.
