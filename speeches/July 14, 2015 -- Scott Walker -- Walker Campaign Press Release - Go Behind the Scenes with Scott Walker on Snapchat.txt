    Scott Walker officially launched his snapchat a few weeks back. Since then, followers have had a chance to see Scott grilling brats on the barbeque, watching fireworks, singing karaoke and stopping into the McDonalds in Delavan, WI where he flipped burgers in high school.

  I'm now on @Snapchat and what better weekend to launch than the #FourthofJuly. Please add my username "govscottwalker." -SKW â€” Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) July 3, 2015

Today, Governor Walker is kicking off his announcement tour in Las Vegas, NV, then he's heading to New Hampshire, South Carolina, Georgia and Iowa. You're invited to come along and experience each stop of the journey through Snapchat as he shares his vision for restoring conservative leadership to the White House.
