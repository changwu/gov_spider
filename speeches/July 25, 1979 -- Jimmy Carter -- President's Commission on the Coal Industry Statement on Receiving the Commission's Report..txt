    Increased coal production is a crucial element of the energy program I outlined to the Nation on July 16. The bold and constructive recommendations of the Coal Commission played an important part in the design of that program, and I deeply appreciate the work that the Commission has done. Today's discussion with the Commission and with representatives of the Congressional Coal Caucus was helpful in underlining the importance of a more active immediate effort to convert our Nation to reliance on our bountiful supplies of coal.
I agree with the Commission's view that we can convert to coal without sacrificing our environment or the health and safety of coal workers.
At a time when thousands of coal miners have been thrown out of work, we must redouble our efforts to insist that the energy needs of our Nation are supplied as much as possible by coal.
