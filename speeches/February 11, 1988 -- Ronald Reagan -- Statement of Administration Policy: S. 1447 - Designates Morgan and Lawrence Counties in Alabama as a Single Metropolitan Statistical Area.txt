    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Shelby (D) Alabama and Heflin (D) Alabama)
The Administration opposes enactment of S. 1447, because it would undermine the usefulness of both government and private-sector statistics on metropolitan areas that are collected and published according to standard definitions of "metropolitan statistical areas (MSA)." An MSA designation should be made in accordance with statistical standards established by the Office of Management and Budget, as mandated by Congress in the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, and not by legislative exception.
