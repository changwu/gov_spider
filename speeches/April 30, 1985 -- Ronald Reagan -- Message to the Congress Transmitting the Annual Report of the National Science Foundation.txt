    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to send to you the annual report of the National Science Foundation for Fiscal Year 1984. This report describes research supported by the Foundation in the mathematical, physical, biological, social, behavioral, and information sciences; in engineering; and in education in those fields.
Achievements such as the ones described in this report are the basis for much of our Nation's strengthâ€”its economic growth, military security, and the overall well-being of our people.
We face challenges in science, engineering, and technology, but I am confident about our ability to meet those challenges. The National Science Foundation has been and will remain a key part of the national effort to keep vital our great capabilities in research and productivity and to stay ahead of world competition through innovation and new discoveries.
