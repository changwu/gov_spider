    ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, Command Sergeant Major Craig Layton, USA (Ret.) -- who served as the Command Sergeant Major at Landstuhl -- issued the following statement on Barack Obama's cancelled visit to Ramstein and Landstuhl:
"Having spent two years as the Command Sergeant Major at Landstuhl Hospital, I am always grateful for the attention that facility receives from members of Congress. There is no more important work done by the United States Army than to care for those who have been wounded in the service our country. While Americans troops remain engaged in two hot wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, there is a steady stream of casualties to the hospital, and a steady stream of visitors who wish to meet with those troops and thank them for their service.
"Senator Obama has explained his decision to cancel a scheduled visit there by blaming the military, which would not allow one of his political advisers to join him in a tour of the facility. Why Senator Obama felt he needed an adviser with him to visit U.S. troops is unclear, but if Senator Obama isn't comfortable meeting wounded American troops without his entourage, perhaps he does not have the experience necessary to serve as commander in chief."
Command Sergeant Major Craig Layton, USA (Ret.) was the Command Sergeant Major (senior enlisted soldier) at Landstuhl from 2003-2005 and has 31 years of active duty service. He was also the Task Force CSM twice in Kosovo while assigned in Germany from 1999-2005. He also served at the Brooke Army Medical Center and the Great Plains Regional Medical Command from 2005-2007.
