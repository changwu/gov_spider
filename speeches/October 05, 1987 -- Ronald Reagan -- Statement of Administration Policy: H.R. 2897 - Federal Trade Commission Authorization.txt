    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(REVISED)(Luken (D) Ohio and 16 others)
The administration opposes the enactment of H.R. 2897 unless it is amended to deal in a satisfactory manner with the objectionable provisions listed below; the Director of the Office of Management and Budget would recommend that the President veto H.R. 2897 unless it is so amended:

— Section 107, which would unnecessarily and inappropriately restrict the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) ability to intervene in Federal agency and State and local government proceedings.
— Title II, which would inappropriately fragment regulation of air carriers' advertising and consumer protection practices between the Department of Transportation and the FTC.
— Section 105, which would prohibit the FTC from conducting any study or investigation of agricultural marketing orders or from conducting any study, investigation, or prosecution of agricultural cooperative activities which are currently exempt from antitrust law.
— The reporting requirements found in subsections (2), (3), (4), and (9) of section 111 (b) and subsections (2), (3), (4), and (9) of section 112(b) because they could require the disclosure of internal agency deliberations involving the performance of law enforcement functions; and
— Sections 110 (advertising study), 114 (lifecare home study), 115 (Native American arts and crafts) which, by requiring specific studies or monitoring activities, would limit the flexibility of the FTC to utilize appropriated funds in the most cost effective manner.
