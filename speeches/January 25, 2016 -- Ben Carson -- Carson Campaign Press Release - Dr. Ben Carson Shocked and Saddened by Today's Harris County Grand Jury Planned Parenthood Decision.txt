    Alexandria, Va. - January 25, 2016 - "Dr. Carson is saddened by today's Harris County Grand Jury decision to absolve Planned Parenthood from any misconduct," said A. Larry Ross, Communications Director for the Ben Carson for President 2016 campaign. "He is equally shocked that they instead decided to indict the individuals that exposed Planned Parenthood's heinous and illegal activities. As President, he will use the full weight of his office to not only cut off all federal funding for this organization, but also prosecute them for crimes against the unborn."
