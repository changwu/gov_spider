    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today officially opened its third campaign office in South Carolina. The Spartanburg office will be the hub for the day-to-day operations of the Upstate campaign staff and serve as the base of operations for volunteer activities in that region.
National Campaign Manager Michael DuHaime and South Carolina State Chairman Barry Wynn joined supporters for the grand opening.
"The opening of this office demonstrates Mayor Giuliani's strong commitment to winning South Carolina," DuHaime said. "Rudy is the only candidate with the public executive leadership experience and record of real conservative results that it will take to win in the primary and general elections."
