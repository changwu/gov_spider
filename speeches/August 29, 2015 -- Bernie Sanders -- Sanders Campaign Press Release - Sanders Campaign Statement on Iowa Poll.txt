    BURLINGTON, Vt. â€“ The communications director for Democratic Party presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Saturday issued the following statement after The Des Moines Register and Bloomberg News published a new survey of Iowans' presidential preferences:
"What this new poll shows is that the more Iowans get to know Bernie the better they like him and what he stands for. We've seen the same thing in New Hampshire and across the country," Michael Briggs said.
"At a time when the middle class continues to disappear and almost all new wealth and income is going to the top 1 percent, the American people want leadership that is prepared to fight for working families and take on the greed of a billionaire class that has enormous control over our economy, our political life and the media," Sanders' spokesman added.
