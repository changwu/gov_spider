    I AM deeply disappointed by the refusal of the House of Representatives to partially lift the embargo on the shipment of arms to Turkey. It is my strong conviction that this negative vote can only do the most serious and irreparable damage to the vital national security interests of the United States, including our normally excellent relations with the Government of Turkey, U.S. security interests in the Atlantic Alliance and the Eastern Mediterranean, and U.S. efforts to assist the governments of Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus to reach a just and equitable Cyprus settlement. It will also seriously affect important interests elsewhere.
I and members of my Administration worked hard to persuade Members of the House of Representatives that vital, national defense interests are at stake in this issue. I am very proud of those 206 Members of Congress of both parties, as well as the Members of the Senate who supported a similar measure, for casting their votes in the national interest. I deeply appreciate the efforts of the bipartisan leadership of the Congress and the members of the House and Senate Committees on International Relations and Foreign Affairs who supported the legislation. I will continue to make every effort to assist in achieving an equitable settlement of the Cyprus dispute. I will work to reassure our allies, Turkey and Greece, of our continuing desire to maintain strong and effective relationships with them despite this setback. I hope the House of Representatives will reconsider its failure to act affirmatively.
