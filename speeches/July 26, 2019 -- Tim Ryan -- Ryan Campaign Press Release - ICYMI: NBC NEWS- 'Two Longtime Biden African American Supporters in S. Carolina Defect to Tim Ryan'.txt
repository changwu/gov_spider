    Youngstown, OH - In case you missed it, NBC News just reported that 'Two Longtime Biden African American supporters in S. Carolina Defect to TimRyan.'
From the article:
"Two past Joe Biden black supporters in South Carolina are switching their allegiance to Rep. Tim Ryan, suggesting the former vice president has not consolidated his support in a state central to his 2020 plans."Fletcher Smith and Brandon Brown, who played senior roles in Biden's last presidential campaign in 2008, attended a meeting Biden held last month with a small group of African-American leaders in Columbia and both told NBC News that he's neglected some relationships in the state.
...
"...both are set to this weekend to endorse Ryan at events in South Carolina, where the far less-well-known Ohio moderate has been quietly working to chip away support from rivals like Biden, who currently holds a large lead in the Palmetto State, according to poll."
...
Said Brown:
"Congressman Ryan reached out to me and said, 'Hey I want to meet with you,' and actually spent time with me. We developed a friendship, and I introduced him to some people and you could immediately see he resonated," he said. "We see that Tim Ryan represents those traditional values that in SouthCarolina still hold true. He is not a socialist — that resonates in SouthCarolina."
