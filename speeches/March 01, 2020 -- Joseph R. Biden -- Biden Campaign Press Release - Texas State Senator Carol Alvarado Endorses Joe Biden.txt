    Today, Texas State Senator and Chair of the Senate Democratic Caucus Carol Alvarado released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for the President of the United States:
"This current moment requires a leader with the character, experience, and tenacity to put our country back on track. I believe that person is Joe Biden. Joe will bring our country together so that we can begin to heal â€” and he will work across the aisle to get things done for hardworking families in Texas and across the country. With his broad and diverse coalition, I know that Joe can defeat Donald Trump in November. Today, I am proud to endorse Joe Biden for President of the United States."
State Senator Alvarado represents Senate District 6, which includes southeast Houston, Houston's East End and Northside, Aldine, Channelview, a portion of the historic Houston Heights and the cities of Baytown, Galena Park, Jacinto City, Pasadena and South Houston. Her endorsement adds to the growing momentum and enthusiasm that Joe Biden has established in Texas, a critical Super Tuesday state. Biden has now received over 50 Texas endorsements, including Congressional Black Caucus members Eddie Bernice Johnson, Marc Veasey, and Colin Allred; Congressional Hispanic Caucus members Sylvia Garcia, Filemon Vela, and Vicente Gonzalez; and State House Democratic Caucus Chair Chris Turner.
Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,400 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
