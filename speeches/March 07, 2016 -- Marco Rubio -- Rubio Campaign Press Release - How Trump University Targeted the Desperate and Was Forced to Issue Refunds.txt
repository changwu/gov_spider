Donald Trump continues to try to defend his sham "university", but court documents show just how manipulative the phony school's tactics were:
In other court documents, former events manager Corinne Sommer wrote that in her experience, "the focus of Trump University was on making sales rather than on providing educational services."
"Some consumers had showed up who were homeless and could not afford the seminars," she wrote. "Yet I overheard Trump University representatives telling them, 'It's ok; just max out your credit card.'"
One of the big three lawsuits against Trump University was just allowed to go forward, and, while Trump claims the fake school received a good grade from the Better Business Bureau, it really got a D-.
Trump also claims that 98% of students were satisfied, but nearly 40% of Trump University students were given refunds:
In a tweet yesterday defending the school, Trump pointed to a 98 percent satisfaction rate, but court documents show that nearly 40 percent of the students who signed up for the three-day seminar or more received a refund.
Trump University was a con job, and we cannot allow a con artist to become the Republican nominee for President of the United States.
