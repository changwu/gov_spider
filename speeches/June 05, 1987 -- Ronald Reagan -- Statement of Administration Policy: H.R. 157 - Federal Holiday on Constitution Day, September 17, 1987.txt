    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
Revision(House)(Crane (R) IL; Boggs (D) LA; Foglietta (D) PA)
While fully supporting appropriate activities to celebrate the Bicentennial of the Constitution, in this time of massive Federal deficits, the Administration cannot support H.R. 157 because it establishes another paid Federal holiday. A Day of Recognition would be more appropriate, with ceremonies that would give special significance to Constitution Day without incurring the added $332 million cost of a holiday for Federal employees.
Accordingly, the Administration would support an amendment to make Consitution Day a Day of Recognition. If the Day of Recognition were celebrated on a weekend, for example, it could fully support all appropriate activities and allow for a more family oriented weekend of recognition.
A rough estimate is that for each 10 percent of the nonfarm private sector workforce that is given the day off and does not make up the time lost, the cost is over a billion dollars, although it is not possible to estimate precisely the total cost to the Nation of a holiday that could also affect State, local, and private sector employees.
