    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced the endorsement of former Illinois Lieutenant Governor Corinne Wood. Wood's endorsement came as Mayor Giuliani made his eighth campaign visit to the state today.
"Rudy is a tested and proven leader who cut taxes, reduced crime and changed the mentality of how a large city can be managed by using conservative principles," said Wood. "I am honored to support Mayor Giuliani. I know he is the Republican Party's best candidate to lead us to victory against the Democrats next November."
"As we get closer to the February 5th primary, it is becoming more apparent that Rudy is the only Republican who is committed to winning Illinois," said State Representative Tom Cross, Giuliani's Illinois State Chairman. "The Mayor continues to regularly campaign in Illinois, building on his momentum and strong grassroots support."
Wood joins a strong Illinois team that also includes Congresswoman Judy Biggert, former Governors Jim Edgar and Jim Thompson and former Attorney General Jim Ryan.
