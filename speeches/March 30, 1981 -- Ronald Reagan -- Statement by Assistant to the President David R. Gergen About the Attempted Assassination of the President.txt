    Good afternoon. This is to confirm the statements made at George Washington Hospital that the President was shot once in the left side, this afternoon, as he left the hotel. His condition is stable.
A decision is now being made whether or not to operate to remove the bullet. The White House and the Vice President are in communication, and the Vice President is now en route to Washington. He is expected to arrive in the city this afternoon.
Mrs. Reagan is currently with the President at the hospital.
I'd like to add two notes. We have been informed by [Chief of Staff and Assistant to the President] Jim Baker that the President walked into the hospital.
I would also like to inform you that in the building [the White House] as of the moment are the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, and the Attorney General, as well as other Assistants to the President.
