    The Clinton campaign today announced the endorsement of Nevada Assembly Majority Leader John Oceguera.
"Hillary Clinton is clearly the most qualified candidate, with the experience and commitment to bring the change we need to move our country forward," said Oceguera. "She is talented, intelligent and tough, and ready to lead from her very first day in office. It is truly a special moment for our country when we have the opportunity not only to elect the first woman president, but also a candidate who has spent her entire career fighting for those without a voice. I'm excited to endorse Hillary Clinton and ready to work hard to ensure she has Nevada in her column."
A lifelong Nevadan, Oceguera was first elected in 2001. He has served the residents of Assembly District 16 in southeast Las Vegas through four legislative sessions and five special sessions. He has served as chair of both the Assembly Committee on Commerce and Labor and the Assembly Committee on Transportation.
Oceguera has dedicated his career to public service and safety, rising through the ranks of the North Las Vegas Fire Department to the level of battalion chief.
"John is a homegrown Nevadan who is a dedicated public servant in every aspect of his life," said Clinton Nevada Chair Rory Reid. "He has risen through the ranks as both a firefighter and a legislator due to his strong leadership and commitment to improving Nevada's communities. His energy, state knowledge and deep community ties throughout the state will be great assets to our campaign."
