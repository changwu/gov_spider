    Earlier today, Governor Scott Walker was in Brooklyn Center, MN, to roll out his plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare. Scott Walker is the first GOP candidate this year to lay out in detail his plan to replace the failing law that's already caused health premiums for Minnesota millennials to jump 19%.
Governor Walker is going to be holding rallies, meet-and-greets, speeches and events all across America, and hopefully he'll be stopping in a city near you. But in the meantime, we put together these twelve photos that will make you feel like you were in the room today when he introduced the Day One Patient Freedom Plan.
