    Nancy and I were deeply saddened to learn of Hal Wallis' death. He was a gifted and dedicated artist, who gave the world some of our greatest films.
His talent, professionalism, and instinct for excellence were an inspiration to all of us who had the privilege to work with Hal. Hal Wallis was a special friend who we will miss. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family.
