Next week, Marco Rubio will be spending three days, December 28 — 30, traveling around Iowa on his campaign bus and attending town hall meetings. The tour's theme is "Out With The Old, In With The New," and Marco will outline why our country can't go back to leaders and ideas of the past, but instead we must embrace a New American Century.
