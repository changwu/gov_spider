    "Joe Biden took the $4 trillion in new taxes he promised to raise on the American people and just inexplicably, proudly announced he is going to double it. It's bad enough that for nearly five decades, Joe Biden's liberal policies crushed the American worker, closed 60,000 manufacturing plants, and sent 3.2 million American jobs straight to China, now, he's unapologetically promising something even worse by admitting he wants to remake America with socialist policies. President Trump has always and will always put America First – which has resulted in historic economic growth and created countless new opportunities for families across this country to achieve the American Dream. Joe Biden's misguided pro-China agenda threatened the American way of life once – we cannot allow his new socialist agenda and radial left puppet-masters to kill it."
- Hogan Gidley, Trump 2020 national press secretary
