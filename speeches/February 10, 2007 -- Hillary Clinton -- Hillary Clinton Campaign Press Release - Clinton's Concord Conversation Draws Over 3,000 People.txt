    Clinton Pledges to Earn Every Vote, Campaign the New Hampshire way. Clinton's First Stop Today Drew Record Crowd in New Hampshire's North Country.
Concord, NH - Hillary Clinton made her second stop of the day this afternoon at an event in Concord that drew over 3,000 people. The campaign had expected 1,000 people to come to the Concord event.
Pledging that she'd work to earn every vote and to campaign the New Hampshire way, Clinton met with voters and spoke about Iraq, the economy, health care, energy and other issues before taking questions from the crowd. Clinton drew cheers and applause when she spoke about her efforts to bring about an end to the War in Iraq.
Earlier today in Berlin (pronounced BURR-lin), 500 people came out to meet Clinton. Three hundred people packed Berlin's City Hall and 200 people filled an overflow room across the street to capacity. It's the first time in recent memory that a presidential candidate has kicked off a campaign in the North Country and has drawn a crowd this size there.
Clinton's decision to kick off her New Hampshire campaign in Berlin reflects her commitment to running a strong campaign in the Granite State. It's also a metaphor for the kind of national campaign she'd run as the Democratic nominee in 2008: Just as she will visit every corner of New Hampshire, she'll campaign in communities throughout the country.
Overall, more than 3,500 people came out to see Clinton on her campaign's first day in the Granite State.
