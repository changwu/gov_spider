    Dear Mr. Chairman:
In response to Section 3132 of the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1988 (Public Law 100-180), I commissioned a study of the United States nuclear weapons complex for the purpose of determining the overall size and production capacity necessary to support national security objectives. A report has been prepared which summarizes the study, and a plan has been formulated to modernize the nuclear weapons complex in order to achieve the necessary size and capacity as determined by the study.
Pursuant to the requirements of the statute, I am enclosing both classified and unclassified versions of the Nuclear Weapons Complex Modernization Study. This report will enable the Administration and the Congress to adopt a long-term approach to modernization rather than a piecemeal response to the problems within the nuclear weapons complex. I am pleased to forward it for consideration by the Congress.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
