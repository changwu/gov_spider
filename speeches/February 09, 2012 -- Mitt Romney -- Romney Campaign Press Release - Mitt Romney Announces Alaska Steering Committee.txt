    Mitt Romney today announced his Alaska Steering Committee.
"Alaska voters have felt the effects of President Obama's policies in Washington," said Mitt Romney. "This president's overreaching regulations and lack of a practical energy policy have hampered Alaska's development of its natural resources. Working with these leaders, I will ensure that Alaska is able to develop its resources, strengthen its economy, and help lead an economic recovery across the country."
Announcing the formation of Mitt Romney's Alaska Steering Committee, Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell said, "Mitt Romney has such widespread support in Alaska because he is the only conservative candidate with the record and vision to defeat President Obama.
