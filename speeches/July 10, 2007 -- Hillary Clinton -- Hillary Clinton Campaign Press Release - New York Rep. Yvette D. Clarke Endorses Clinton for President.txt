    Clinton Boasts Support of Entire New York Democratic Congressional Delegation
The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of New York Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke.
"After careful deliberations and discussions with the diverse base of my constituency, I am convinced that Senator Clinton is best able to win and bring much needed change to the White House," Rep. Clarke said. "I support Hillary because she is a leader who has been a forceful and tireless advocate on behalf of New York's families, especially concerning the needs of those most affected after 9/11. The depth of Hillary's experience will allow her to hit the ground running on her first day in office."
Rep. Clarke (Brooklyn, NY 11th CD) is in her first term in Congress after serving five years on the New York City Council representing Brooklyn. She was also the Chair of the Contracts Committee during her tenure in the Council. In Congress, Rep. Clarke serves on the Homeland Security, Education and Labor, and Small Business House Committees. Rep. Clark is dedicated to providing responsible governance for immigration reform, education, employment and economic development.
"Yvette is a dynamic and thoughtful legislator committed to lifting up the people of her district and continuing the legacy of Shirley Chisholm," Clinton said. "I'm honored to have her support and I look forward to working together with her to bring our message of change across New York and the nation."
