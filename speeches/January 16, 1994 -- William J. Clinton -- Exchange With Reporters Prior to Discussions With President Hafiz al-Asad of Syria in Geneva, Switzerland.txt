    Q. President Clinton, are you going to talk about terrorist issues at this meeting today?
President Clinton. We'll have a statement later when we finish. We just met. We haven't started the meeting yet.
Q. Are you happy to be here, and can you tell us what you expect from the meeting, sir?
President Asad. I'm delighted to be meeting with President Clinton and his assistants. We are at the table not to think about expectations but to do the work.
