    "I salute the many Americans who have worked so hard in support of a comprehensive immigration reform that honors our history as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. As President, I am committed to working with Congress to introduce a comprehensive immigration reform bill within my first 100 days in office. I am also committed to continue working to end the demagoguery and divisiveness that has too often marked the immigration debate so that we can bring the American people together to achieve the reform we so badly need.
"I am proud to have been one of only two co-sponsors of Senator Kennedy's original comprehensive reform legislation back in 2004. I believe that reform must include -- as essential ingredients-- a strengthening of our border security, greater cross-cooperation with our neighbors, strict but fair enforcement of our laws, federal assistance to our state and local governments, strict penalties for those who exploit undocumented workers, and a path to earned legal status for those who are here, working hard, paying taxes, respecting the law, and willing to meet a high bar.
"Along with these changes, I believe we must repair those broken portions of our immigration system that irrevocably damage families and force citizens and lawful immigrants to live apart from their spouses and children overseas.
"Today's marches add to the urgency of passing comprehensive immigration reform that finally solves the problems of our broken system."
