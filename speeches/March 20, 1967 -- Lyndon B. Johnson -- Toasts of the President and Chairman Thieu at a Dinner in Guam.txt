    In 1873, when Vietnam was disputing the right of France to extend control over the whole country, a scholar named Bui Vien was sent by the Emperor to enlist the help of the United States. He was received by President Grant.
On his way home he was informed of President Grant's decision that because of unforeseen circumstances--the United States would be unable to assist Vietnam.
He stopped in Japan to see an old friend, the American consul in Yokohama. As people did in those days in Asia, the two men exchanged poems. Here is what Bui Vien wrote:
"We pour out wine into glasses at Yokohama in the ninth month--in autumn.
Turning my head towards the clouds of Vietnam, I am anxious about my country.
Sea and land--memory and emotion--remind me of my former journey.
Enjoying myself with you, I regret all the more that we must part.
Spiritual companion, in what year will we be together in the same sampan?"
Today we know the answer. We are together. And we know our destination. We established it years ago, and affirmed it at Honolulu and Manila. The brave sons of both our nations reaffirm it anew with every day that passes.
The trip is not yet over. The waters ahead may be rough. But together, with courage and unflagging devotion to the duty we share, we will make it.
Gentlemen, to the free peoples of Vietnam and the United States, who love their liberty and fight to preserve it.
