    President Trump. We're having a great meeting. We're discussing military expenditure. We're talking about trade. We have a very, very good relationship with the Chancellor. We have a tremendous relationship with Germany. They've made tremendous—you've had tremendous success, and I congratulate you. Tremendous success. And I believe that our trade will increase, and lots of other things will increase. But we'll see what happens over the next period of a few months. Yes.
Chancellor Merkel. Well, let me say that I am very pleased, indeed, to have this opportunity here for this exchange of views. And indeed, we had an opportunity to have an exchange about economic developments, on issues such as migration, and also the future of our trade relations.
We also briefly touched upon the upcoming trips of the President. And let me say that I'm very much looking forward to further extending our exchanges in the future and enhancing them. I think that it's very important to have those exchanges together, because after all, we are partners, we are good partners, and we wish to continue to cooperate in the future.
President Trump. Okay, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.
