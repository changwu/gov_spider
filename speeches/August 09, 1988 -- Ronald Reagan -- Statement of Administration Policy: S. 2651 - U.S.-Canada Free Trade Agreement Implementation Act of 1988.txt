    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Byrd (D) West Virginia and Dole (R) Kansas)
The Administration strongly supports enactment of S. 2651.
The Free Trade Agreement will strengthen the economies of both the United States and Canada by substantially increasing trade and investment opportunites. As President Reagan has said, it is a "win-win" situation for both countries.
