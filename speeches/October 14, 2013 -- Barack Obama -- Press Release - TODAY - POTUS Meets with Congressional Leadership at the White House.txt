    FROM A WH OFFICIAL: Today, the President and the Vice President will meet with the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Leadership (Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader McConnell, Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi) at the White House at 3:00 pm. With only a few days until the government runs out of borrowing authority, the President will make clear the need for Congress to act to pay our bills, and reopen the government. The President will also reiterate our principles to the leaders: we will not pay a ransom for Congress reopening the government and raising the debt limit. The President continues to urge Congress to pass a bill that raises the debt ceiling and lends the certainty our businesses and the economy needs.
