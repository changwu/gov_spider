    Ahead of Donald Trump's press conference today, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield released the following statement:
"Here's what the last four years can tell us about what to expect from Donald Trump at the podium today: instead of honoring the backbone of our country – the essential workers keeping our economy going, the service members and veterans who have kept us safe, the working families struggling to get by because of the White House's mismanagement of COVID-19 – Donald Trump is going to remain focused on his top concern, himself.
"Donald Trump's shown us over and over whose side he's truly on: every chance he has, he picks corporate executives and Wall Street over workers. He has waged a war on workers' rights to unionize and collectively bargain – for example, appointing anti-labor leaders to the National Labor Relations Board – because he knows unions give workers the power to fight for the pay and benefits they deserve. At a time when so many working Americans are feeling a painful financial squeeze, Donald Trump is trying to cut funding for Social Security, and he's still trying to overturn the Affordable Care Act and jeopardize health care for millions of Americans in the middle of a pandemic.
"Enough is enough. The American people deserve a President like Joe Biden who will always stand on the side of workers in this country, who will always honor those who have risked and given their lives to protect our freedom."
