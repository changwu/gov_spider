    "Once again Senator Obama is saying one thing but doing another. Sen. Obama talks hope on the stump but he tells a different story in Ohio's mailboxes. By continuing to make discredited attacks against Sen. Clinton, Senator Obama undermines his credibility. If his speeches are more than 'Ëœjust words,' he will immediately stop and begin running a campaign that reflects his rhetoric." - Clinton spokesman Phil Singer.

Obama Campaign Distributes Two Dishonest Mailers In Ohio
The Obama campaign is distributing two dishonest mailers in Ohio. The first mailer falsely claims that Hillary said NAFTA was a "boon" to the economy. Hillary never said that. The Obama campaign is basing the quote on a 2006 Newsday article that characterized her views this way without any substantiation. In fact, Newsday recently said that the Obama campaign's use of their article was "misleading." The Politico called the Obama campaign's use of the quote "bogus."
The second mailer from the Obama campaign mimics Harry and Louise ads that the health care industry used to scare people into opposing universal health care. The ad claims "Hillary's health care plan forces everyone to buy insurance, even if you can't afford it."
Here are the facts:
Sen. Obama fails to mention Hillary's plan cuts costs just as aggressively as Sen. Obama, if not more so.
Hillary's plan contains more generous subsidies than the Obama plan. Noted health expert Ken Thorpe of Emory University concluded that under the Hillary plan, everyone will be able to afford coverage.
The Obama plan leaves 15 million people out, which drives up costs because everyone else ends up subsidizing their emergency care.
Paul Krugman called the mailer "ugly" and "destructive."
