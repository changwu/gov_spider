    Dear ________:
In response to the requirement of section 1116 of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009 (Public Law 111-32), and in order to keep the Congress fully informed, I provide the attached report related to Afghanistan and Pakistan.
My Administration completed a thorough policy review last November, and I announced a new approach at West Point on December 1. We are now in the early weeks of implementing this policy and therefore do not believe further adjustments are required at this time.
I assure you of my Administration's commitment to the successful implementation of this policy.
Sincerely,
BARACK OBAMA
