    (Stockbridge, GA)- Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has chosen not to sign the FAMiLY Leader pledge, and instead, has issued the following statement:
"I stand firmly with the FAMiLY Leader and share their vision and commitment to supporting traditional values in American society.
I am, and will continue to be, an ardent defender of traditional marriage and will work to preserve and protect the sanctity of human life, which I believe begins at conception.
While I commend their intent regarding the pledge, I believe my stated position encompasses their values without the need to sign the pledge."
