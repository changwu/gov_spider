    Mr. Mayor:
I want to say that it is a very great privilege for me to visit, on my trip to Ireland, and come first to Limerick. This is the first city in Ireland I am visiting.
Having heard of Limerick all my life, and recalling in the 18th century when the famous Irish Brigade was fighting all over the world, the song was "Will You Come Up To Limerick?" and here I am. I am glad to be here, and I am glad I came.
Thank you very much.
