We hosted a great town hall style meeting tonight with Governor Huckabee at the Country Kitchen Restaurant in Ottumwa. We packed it out and then some running out of room and chairs. Thanks to Larry Zimmerman, the manager-- for his hospitality. The 121 sardines jammed in there was "the best turnout he had ever seen."
The Governor's remarks were fabulous as usual and led to some thoughtful questions covering a whole array of topics. That led to some stellar answers by the Governor---some of the best I've ever heard. Virtually everyone there tonight agreed to vote for the Governor at the Caucus. Below are some of the photos I took at the event, including Gov. Huckabee's photo with my daughter Wendy. She got her hug from the Governor and he called her the "Mayor of Ottumwa."
It's a long hard road but I am feeling good tonight about the weeks aheadâ€¦
You can feel the change happening on the ground.
Sincerely,
Randy Davis
P.S. Someone told me a great comment tonight that I had to share too: "As President, Governor Huckabee would know exactly what needs to be "done and undone."
