    The July jobs report proves that the Great American Comeback is here
Key Takeaways:

The economy added back a blockbuster 1.8 million jobs in July, the third highest one-month gain in U.S. history after the gains in June and May

In total, the economy has added back an incredible 9.3 million jobs back over the last three months


July saw the fourth largest one-month drop in the unemployment rate in U.S. history, falling by nearly a full percentage point

The women's, Hispanic, Black, Asian American, and veteran's unemployment rates all fell in July


July's jobs report shows the Great American Comeback is continuing, and President Trump is the man to lead it

Joe Biden would be the worst possible person to put in charge of the economy, having presided over the worst recovery since the Great Depression as Vice President
The 1.8 million jobs added back in July is more than three times the number of jobs added in the best month of the Joe Biden-led "recovery"
In the last three months, the economy has added back 42 percent of the jobs lost due to the coronavirus outbreak – it took two years to gain back the same percentage of jobs during the Biden "recovery"


President Trump's efforts to protect American workers and businesses during the coronavirus epidemic have clearly worked

The Paycheck Protection Program has provided more than $521 billion in forgivable loans to over 5 million U.S. businesses, protecting more than 51 million U.S. jobs
158 million Americans have received a total of $265 billion in coronavirus relief payments, helping those Americans who are out of work or struggling
