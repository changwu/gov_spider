    The President today nominated four recognized leaders in the housing field to work with Secretary Henry Cisneros as top officials at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The nominees for Deputy Secretary and three Assistant Secretary positions are recognized and experienced leaders in the housing field.
As Deputy Secretary, the President nominated Terry Duvernay, executive director of the Georgia Housing and Finance Authority, and HUD Chief of Staff under Secretary Moon Landrieu. Also nominated were Andrew Cuomo, the founder and president of an innovative and successful New York area housing organization, to be Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development; San Francisco Board of Supervisors member Roberta Achtenberg, to be Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity; and Jean Nolan, formerly director of communications for The Enterprise Foundation, a national foundation that works to provide housing for low-income people, to be Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs.
"I am committed," said the President, "as is Secretary Cisneros, to turning the Department of Housing and Urban Development into a center for action and a home for innovation. Terry Duvernay, Andrew Cuomo, Roberta Achtenberg, and Jean Nolan have a big task ahead of them-rebuilding housing opportunity for all Americans and repairing the torn fabric of our nation's urban communities. These four outstanding individuals have the experience, the knowledge, and the ability to make that happen. They will be an essential part of my team."
