The President. Thank you all. I want you all to know——
Audience member. Can't hear you.
The President. I can't go any louder. [Laughter]
I want you all to know that America today—America today is on bended knee in prayer for the people whose lives were lost here, for the workers who work here, for the families who mourn. This Nation stands with the good people of New York City and New Jersey and Connecticut as we mourn the loss of thousands of our citizens.
Audience member. I can't hear you.
The President. I can hear you. I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.
Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
The President. The Nation sends its love and compassion to everybody who is here. Thank you for your hard work. Thank you for making the Nation proud. And may God bless America.
