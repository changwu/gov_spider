    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Stallings (D) Idaho and six others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3694, because the bill is technically deficient. The Island Park Dam would have to be opened during the winter in order to meet the December 1992 deadline imposed by the bill. This requirement is impractical because of problems encountered with concrete setting in cold, freezing weather.
The bill also raises questions about project cost allocations and charges for power, thus bringing existing arrangements into question.
Finally, the bill would set an undesirable precedent by having the Federal Government pay for wildlife mitigation costs, which properly belong to project sponsors.
