VPOTUS Pool report no. 3. Quotes.
VPOTUS was seated at a table in the Roosevelt room, flanked by Reps. Thompson and Hinojosa. She started speaking at approximately 11:18 and concluded at 11:25. VPOTUS did not answer shouted questions.
Please check quotes against official transcript.
Harris started by "saying thank you to all of you You are courageous leaders, and you are American patriots."
"All citizens have the right to vote, Constitutionally. What we are seeing are examples of an attempt to marginalize and take from people, a right that has already been given. We are not asking for the bestowal of a right. We are talking about the preservation. That is the right of citizenship. And It's that fundamental."
She alluded to the Shelby v Holder case, which she called "an opening of a door" for making it difficult for people to vote.
"We know we have a great challenge in front of us and therefore a fight, which is to fight for every American's right."
