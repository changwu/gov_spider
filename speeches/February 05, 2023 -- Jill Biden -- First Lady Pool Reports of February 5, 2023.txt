FLOTUS pool report #4 - Grammy Award presentations
Dr. Biden walked on stage at 8:02 pm wearing a long sparkling gown. She received a standing ovation.
Host Trevor Noah, who introduced her, described her as "the only person in the world who knows which of tonight's songs the President's sings in the shower."
She presented two awards - the Song of the Year and the new award "Best Song for Social Change."
Iranian singer Shervin Hajipour won the new social change award. His song Baraye has been described as the anthem of the Mahsa Amini protests in Iran.
Biden described the song as a "powerful and poetic call for freedom and women's rights."
He was arrested on September 29, 2022 - two days after his song was released on social media - and was released two days later. He is not allowed to leave Iran.
Biden then presented Song of the Year to Just Like That by Bonnie Raitt. She kissed Raitt on the cheek.
