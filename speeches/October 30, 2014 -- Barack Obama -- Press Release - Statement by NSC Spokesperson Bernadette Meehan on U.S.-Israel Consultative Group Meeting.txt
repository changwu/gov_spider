    National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice hosted Israeli National Security Advisor Yossi Cohen and senior Israeli and U.S. officials today at the White House for the semi-annual meeting of the U.S.-Israel Consultative Group. These ongoing constructive and intensive meetings cover a range of bilateral and regional security issues.
The delegations discussed pressing issues, including ongoing efforts by the United States and coalition partners to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.
On Iran, the U.S. delegation reaffirmed our commitment to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The two sides discussed the ongoing diplomatic efforts of the P5+1 and EU to reach a comprehensive solution that peacefully and verifiably resolves the international community's concerns with Iran's program. The delegations pledged to continue the unprecedented coordination between the United States and Israel as negotiations continue.
The U.S. delegation included CIA Director John Brennan, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral James Winnefeld, Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, Under Secretary of the Treasury David Cohen, Under Secretary of Defense Christine Wormuth, Special Assistant to the President and White House Coordinator for the Middle East Phil Gordon and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro.
National Security Advisors Rice and Cohen agreed that the U.S.-Israel Consultative Group continues to be an effective forum for strategic interagency security consultations between the U.S. and Israeli Governments and will continue to meet regularly in Washington and Jerusalem.
