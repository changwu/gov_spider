    In an interview with Greta Van Susteren last night, Newt directly answers Greta's pointed questions regarding his consulting for Freddie Mac.
The Gingrich Group from 1999 to 2007 provided strategic advise for Freddie Mac. Newt has never lobbied. Newt clearly demonstrates how earning consulting wages as a private citizen, having no direct power or responsibility, is quite different from holding the public trust while in public office.
Newt also discusses his campaign building momentum, adding staff, and his leading in the polls.
Greta asks what President Gingrich would do with the Occupy Wall Street movement. He answers.
