    PRESIDENT EISENHOWER this morning received the final report of the President's Committee for Hungarian Refugee Relief.
The President approved the Committee's request, following a meeting with Committee members, that the Committee be discharged on the basis that it had completed the work for which it had been appointed. The President thanked the members for their work, and the people of the United States for "the wonderful spirit of America in accepting and caring for these refugees."
The President also expressed his admiration and deep appreciation for the dedicated work of the many religious and other voluntary agencies which conducted the job of resettlement at such an unprecedented rate and in so many other ways helped the refugees. He likewise praised the accomplishments of the Government departments and agencies which performed vital functions in the program.
The President emphasized his agreement with the Committee's statement that it was not dissolving because America's work for the Hungarians--here and abroad--is over. The policy of this country is to continue to meet its full share of the free world's responsibility and unique opportunity to help these people and to assist Austria, which with such great sacrifice cared for so many of them, the President pointed out.
The President approved and released the Committee's report, a copy of which is annexed.
NOTE.: The report, dated May 14, 1957, was entitled "Report to the President by the President's Committee for Hungarian refugee Relief" (Government Printing Office, 1957).
