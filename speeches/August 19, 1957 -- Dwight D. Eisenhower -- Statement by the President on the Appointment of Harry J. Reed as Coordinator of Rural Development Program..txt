    LAST OCTOBER, in Minnesota, I described the Rural Development Program as a bold, long-range program for bringing more prosperity to the lowest-income people in rural areas. It is being accomplished by improving their education, skills, farms, credit facilities, employment and earning opportunities.
A necessary part of the plan was to bring an outstanding man into government to help speed and perfect the program. I am convinced that in the Rural Development Program there are wonderful opportunities for good.
The Secretary of Agriculture is announcing today the appointment of Harry J. Reed as Coordinator of Rural Development Program. While Mr. Reed will be employed by the Secretary he will, of course, serve all the agencies of government concerned in the Rural Development Program--the Departments of Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, and Health, Education and Welfare, the Small Business Administration and the Council of Economic Advisers. The administrative responsibility for the Rural Development Program will continue to be lodged with the Under Secretary of Agriculture, who is Chairman of the Interdepartmental Committee.
Mr. Reed, who has recently retired after 18 years as Dean of Agriculture at Purdue University in Indiana, has had a long, varied and distinguished career, serving the cause of farmers both here and abroad.
There remains much to be done in the field of rural development. Mr. Reed will be working with private, state and local agencies concerned with this program. There will be over 30 states active in the Program this year. He will be available to counsel with members of the Congress.
I have confidence in his energy and ability.
I have confidence in the program.
We will move strongly forward in assisting our lowest-income rural families, to gain a greater share of our unprecedented national peacetime prosperity.
