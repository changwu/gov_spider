    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Gorton (R) Washington and 9 others)
The Administration would not object to Senate passage of S. 2180 if it is amended to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1987 of $9,041,000 as requested in the 1987 Budget, instead of $18,300,000.
The Administration supports passage of floor amendment No. 1793, which would provide for the commencement of daylight savings time on the first, rather than the last, Sunday of April.
