ST. LOUIS, Missouri — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul drew another huge crowd to a town hall meeting in Missouri, attracting 2,300-plus supporters and voters to a nighttime Greene County event just hours after over 2,500 people attended his St. Charles County gathering.
The 12-term Congressman from Texas' Greene County Town Hall Meeting took place at 7:30 p.m. CST in the Gymnasium of Hillcrest High School, located at 3319 N. Grant Avenue, Springfield, MO 65803. Dr. Paul spoke about how growth in government occurs at the expense of the nation's increasingly-fragile economy, and how wrongheaded policies coming out of establishment wings of both political parties prolong the hardship of those not fortunate to receive bailouts sourced from hard-earned tax dollars. In addition, Dr. Paul touted his 'Plan to Restore America,' a proposal experts praise as an ambitious, sound economic blueprint for the nation's recovery.
