    This afternoon, while traveling in Italy, President Obama convened a conference call with health care navigators and volunteers helping with enrollment efforts and announced that more than 6 million Americans have signed up for private health insurance plans through the federal and state Marketplaces since October 1. The President was joined on the call by several thousand grassroots volunteers, navigators and in-person assistors who are leading the effort to enroll millions of Americans in quality, affordable health insurance plans.
During the call, the President thanked the group for all their hard work to date and discussed the importance of building on this progress over the last four days of open enrollment. With consumers' interest in signing up for health insurance surging — yesterday there were over 1.5 million visits to HealthCare.gov and over 430,000 calls to the call centers — the President encouraged the navigators and volunteers to redouble their efforts over the next four days and leave no stone unturned in trying to bring affordable health coverage to as many Americans as possible by the March 31 deadline. Nationwide, there more than 27,000 trained assistors in all fifty states who are helping consumers sign up in their communities. Consumers can find out how to get local in person help at this link on HealthCare.gov or through their state marketplaces.
