    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
The Administration supports the purposes of H.R. 4329 which would provide assistance for reconstruction and economic development 1n Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The bill is similar to that introduced by the Administration but contains some elements that were not 1n the Administration's proposal. While the Administration does not object to passage of H.R. 4329 in the House, it will work 1n the Senate and in conference to delete these additional provisions.
