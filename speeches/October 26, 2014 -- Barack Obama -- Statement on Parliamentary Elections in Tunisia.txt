    On behalf of all Americans, I congratulate the people of Tunisia on the democratic election of a new Parliament, an important milestone in Tunisia's historic political transition. In casting their ballots today, Tunisians continued to inspire people across their region and around the world, as they did during Tunisia's 2011 revolution and with the adoption of a new Constitution earlier this year. Tunisia's example reminds us all that dialogue, consensus-building, political pluralism, and peaceful assembly help form the bedrock of democracy. The United States reaffirms its commitment to supporting democracy in Tunisia, to our continued friendship with the people of Tunisia, and to partnering with the next Government as it works to promote economic opportunity, protect freedom, and ensure security for all Tunisians.
