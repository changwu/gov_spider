    DeSantis Surpasses What Trump Campaign Raised During Its First Two Fundraising Quarters in Race Combined
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. â€” The DeSantis for President campaign today announced that it raised $20 million in its first six weeks, reflecting the growing enthusiasm for Governor DeSantis' forward-looking vision for the Great American Comeback. The campaign's haul is the largest first-quarter filing from any non-incumbent Republican candidate in more than a decade. It bests the $18.3 million former president and quasi-incumbent Donald Trump's campaign raised during its first two fundraising quarters as a candidate ($3.8 in Q4 2022 and $14.5 in Q1 2023).
"Joe Biden's leftist policies are destroying the country, and Republicans are excited to invest in a winner ready to lead America's revival," said campaign manager Generra Peck. "We are grateful for the investment so many Americans have made to get this country back on track. The fight to save it will be long and challenging, but we have built an operation to share the governor's message and mobilize the millions of people who support it. We are ready to win."
The strong Q2 haul comes after DeSantis recently eclipsed 250 endorsements from state legislators across the nation and unveiled his plan to stop the invasion and secure the border. The policy rollout was the first of many the campaign has planned in the weeks and months ahead.
