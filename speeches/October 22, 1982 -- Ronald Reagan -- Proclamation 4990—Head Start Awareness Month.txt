  A Proclamation

Since its establishment in 1965, the National Head Start Program has helped over eight million low-income pre-school children and their families. In so doing, it has earned recognition and support for its success in early childhood education and development.
Equally important, the health and nutrition aspects of the program have improved the prevention, detection, and treatment of children's medical, dental, and nutritional problems, thereby removing barriers to growth and learning.
Perhaps the most significant factor in the success of Head Start has been the involvement of parents, volunteers, and the community. Their commitment and the services provided by dedicated Head Start staff have been instrumental in creating a quality program that truly provides young children with a "head start" in life.
For these reasons, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 588, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim the month of October 1982 as Head Start Awareness Month.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the month of October as Head Start Awareness Month. I call on Head Start centers and other educational and community groups to call attention to Head Start activities with appropriate ceremonies and celebrations.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 22nd day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.

RONALD REAGAN
