    Dear Jean:
I have your letter of August 18, tendering your resignation as General Counsel of the Department of the Treasury, and I accept your resignation effective on the confirmation of your successor.
Secretary Bentsen tells me that you have performed your duties with great skill and devotion. You have my thanks for your valuable service to the nation, and my best wishes for your future legal career.

Dear Mr. President:
I am resigning today as General Counsel of the Treasury. My former law partners have asked me to rejoin them in the private practice of law in New York and I believe this is the right time to accept their offer, upon the effectiveness of my resignation. I understand that, with your concurrence, my resignation will take effect upon the confirmation of my successor.
I was honored to be nominated by you and grateful for the opportunity to serve in your Administration. You have repeatedly demonstrated your willingness to tackle the difficult issues of our time and I admire your vital leadership. I consider myself fortunate to have been able to work with, and for, Secretary Bentsen and Roger Altman.
While the decision to leave government is not an easy one, I look forward to returning to New York to resume my personal and professional relationships there. I wish you well in your continued efforts and want you to know that my support for your policies and programs remains strong and resolute.
With every best wish.
Sincerely,
JEAN E. HANSON
