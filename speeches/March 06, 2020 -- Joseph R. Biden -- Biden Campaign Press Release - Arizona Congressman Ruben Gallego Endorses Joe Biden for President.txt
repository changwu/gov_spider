    Today, Arizona Congressman Ruben Gallego released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for the President of the United States:
"This election will be one of the most consequential in our lifetime. With the Arizona Primary less than two weeks away, I'm proud to endorse Joe Biden for President. As a combat veteran I can think of no better leader to serve as our Commander in Chief. On day one Joe will immediately be able to get to work getting our country back on track and delivering for American families. Representing a growing, vibrant, and diverse region in Congress, Donald Trump's reckless attacks on immigrants, health care, and our environment are deeply personal. I know Joe Biden has the wisdom, experience, compassion, and empathy to beat Donald Trump and get our government working again."
Gallego was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2014 and represents Arizona's 7th Congressional District. Prior to that Gallego served in the Arizona House of Representatives from 2011 to 2014. Gallego served in the United States Marine Corp from 2000 to 2006.
Gallego's endorsement builds on the wide support for Joe Biden in Arizona, which includes prominent leaders like Senator Kyrsten Sinema, candidate for the U.S. Senate Captain Mark Kelly, Congressman Greg Stanton, former United States Senator Dennis DeConcini, Arizona Corporation Commission Member Sandra Kennedy, Former Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon and numerous other Arizona leaders.
Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
