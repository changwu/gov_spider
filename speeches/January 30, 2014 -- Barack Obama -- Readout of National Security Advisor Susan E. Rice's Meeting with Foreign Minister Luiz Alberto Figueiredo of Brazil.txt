    Today, National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice met with Foreign Minister Luiz Alberto Figueiredo of Brazil at the White House. The United States and Brazil are strategic partners that share deep commercial and cultural ties, and the two countries consult regularly on a wide array of bilateral, regional, and global issues. During their meeting, Ambassador Rice outlined the results of the review of U.S. signals intelligence activities, and the reforms to be implemented as described by President Obama in his January 17th speech. Ambassador Rice and Foreign Minister Figueiredo also discussed ways to strengthen our productive bilateral agenda with Brazil and exchanged views on global and regional issues of mutual interest.
