    I send my warmest wishes to all those that will celebrate the anniversary of the 1848 Hungarian Revolution tomorrow. That event was a defining moment in Hungary's struggle for freedom and continues to serve as inspiration for all those that advocate for freedom's cause. Our two nations are bound by our shared values and our solemn obligations to each other through the NATO Article 5 commitment to one another's security. On this occasion, I also wish to pay tribute to those many Americans that can trace their roots to Hungary. They continue to make important contributions to our society, enriching the character and culture of the United States.
