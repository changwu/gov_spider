    "We're going to have to consider strategic lockdowns," said a Biden advisor yesterday.
In August, Joe Biden told Americans that he would "shut down" the economy again if his advisors said to.
Now, as Europe heads into a new round of draconian, economy-killing lockdowns, Biden advisors say America should do the same. 
Biden wants to surrender to the virus and lock everyone in their basement. His economic lockdowns would lead to more deaths of despair and children falling further behind in school. Only President Trump will defeat the coronavirus, reopen the schools, and make our economy great again.
American families can't afford the Biden lockdown plan. Don't let that happen.
