    Today I have signed into law H.R. 497, the "National Gambling Impact Study Commission Act." This legislation will establish a Commission to conduct a comprehensive study of the social and economic impacts of gambling in the United States.
The Commission will help draw attention to the growth of the gambling industry and its consequences. Too often, public officials view gambling as a quick and easy way to raise revenues, without focusing on gambling's hidden social, economic, and political costs. The Commission will report on all of the effects of gambling to the President and the Congress.
The Commission's study will address various types of betting, whether conducted in a casino, on a riverboat, on the Internet, on an Indian reservation, or anywhere else in the United States. In addition, the study will address gambling sponsored by governmental, commercial, philanthropic, or charitable entities. Such a balanced study will be invaluable to public officials as they make policy decisions concerning this important issue.
The legislation grants the Commission limited subpoena authority to get the information it needs to carry out its purpose, while protecting the privacy of individuals and businesses. The bill also authorizes the Commission to request information from any Federal agency, which may use its discretion and judgment in withholding privileged and sensitive information.
My Administration supported the establishment of this Commission, and I am pleased to sign this bill into law.
