  A Proclamation

1. By Proclamation 4334 of November 16, 1974, the President modified Subpart A, Part 10, Schedule 1 of the Tariff Schedules of die United States (19 U.S.G. 1202, hereinafter referred to as the "TSUS") to establish, effective January 1, 1975, following expiration of the Sugar Act of 1948, a rate of duty and quota applicable to sugars, syrups, and molasses described in items 155.20 and 155.30 of the TSUS.
2. The President took the action described in recital 1 pursuant to the authority vested in him by the Constitution and statutes of the United States, including Section 201(a) (2) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1821(a) (2) ) and in conformity with Headnote 2 of Subpart A of Part 10 of Schedule 1 of the TSUS, which was added to the TSUS by Proclamation No. 3822 of December 16, 1967 (82 Stat. 1455), to carry out a trade agreement concluded pursuant to Section 201(a) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1821(x)) consisting of the 1967 Geneva Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariff's and Trade, including annexed thereto "Schedule XX", a schedule of United State trade concessions, together with the Final Act Authenticating the Results of the 1964-67 Trade Conference Held under the Auspices of the Contracting Parties to the General Agreement.
3. Headnote 2, Subpart A, Part 10 of Schedule 1 of the TSUS, which is based upon said trade agreement, provides in relevant part as follows:
"(i) That, if the President finds that a particular rate not lower than such January 1, 1968, rate, limited by a particular quota, may be established for any articles provided for in item 155.20 or 155.30, which will give due consideration to the interests in the United States sugar market of domestic producers and materially affected contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, he shall proclaim such particular rate and such quota limitation, …
"(ii) That any rate and quota limitation to established shall be modified if the President finds and proclaims that such modification is required or appropriate to give effect to the above considerations; …
4. Section 201(a)(2) of the Trade Expansion Act authorizes the President to proclaim the modification or continuance of any existing duty or other import restriction or such additional import restrictions as he determines to be required or appropriate to carry out any trade agreement entered into under the authority of that Act.
5. I find that the modifications hereinafter proclaimed of the rates of duty applicable to items 155.20 and 155.30 of the TSUS, as established by Proclamation 4334, are appropriate to carry out the portion of a trade agreement referred to in recitals 2 and 3, and give due consideration to the interests in the United States sugar market of domestic producers and materially affected contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes, including Section 201(a) (2) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and in conformity with Headnote 2, Subpart A of Part 10 of Schedule 1 of the TSUS, do hereby proclaim until otherwise superseded by law:
A. That part of Proclamation 4334 of November 16, 1974, which establishes a rate of duty inconsistent with that provided for in paragraph B. below is hereby terminated."
B. The rates of duty in rate column numbered 1 for items 155.20 and 155.30 of Subpart A, Part 10, Schedule 1 of the TSUS, are modified, and the following rates are established:
155.20----------------------------1.9875¢ per lb. less 0.028125¢ per lb. for each degree under 100 degrees (and fractions of a degree in proportion) but not less than 1.284375¢ per lb.
155.30----------------------------Dutiable on total sugars at the rate per lb. applicable under Item 155.20 to sugar testing 100 degrees.
C. The provisions of this proclamation shall become effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on and after the date, of this Proclamation and shall remain in effect until the President otherwise proclaims or until otherwise superseded by law.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-six and of the Independence of the United States of America, the two hundred and first.

GERALD R. FORD
