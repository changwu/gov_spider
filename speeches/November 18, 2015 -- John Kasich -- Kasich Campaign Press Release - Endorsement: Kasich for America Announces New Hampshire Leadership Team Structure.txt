    Kasich for America today announced the structure of its New Hampshire state leadership team, chaired by former U.S. Senator John Sununu. Eleven elected officials and party leaders serve as state co-chairs and twenty-seven as steering committee members.
Said Sununu, "Our team knows New Hampshire politics, campaigns, and grassroots organization like no other. They understand that John Kasich has the experience, vision, and resolve to revive our economy and restore America's strength â€” and will contribute to his success in the First in the Nation primary."
"We have a remarkable team that is running at full speed in New Hampshire," said Kasich. "Under Senator Sununu's leadership, we have the strongest, most experienced organization in the state. He has done a fantastic job of rallying people behind our message of balanced budgets, opportunity for more Americans, and strong global leadership, and I am confident that the team's hard work will pay off in the Granite State in February."
