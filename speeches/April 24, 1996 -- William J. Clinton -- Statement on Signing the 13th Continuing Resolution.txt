    Today I have signed into law H.J. Res. 175, the Thirteenth Continuing Resolution for fiscal year 1996.
House Joint Resolution 175 provides for a temporary extension of appropriations—through April 25—for activities covered by the five fiscal year 1996 appropriations bills that have not been enacted into law.
It is my hope that this very brief extension will enable the Congress to complete acceptable legislation to fund these activities for the remainder of the fiscal year.
When the fiscal 1996 process is complete, we should resume our efforts to achieve a balanced budget. A balanced budget that is consistent with our Nation's values should be our ultimate goal. I am determined to continue working toward that goal.
