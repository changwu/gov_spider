    Our hearts are heavy for the loss of life in Greensburg, Kansas. A tornado devastated that community. It just basically wiped it out.
I spoke to the Governor and Senator Pat Roberts about the extent of the devastation. They said to me: "It's hard to describe how bad this community was hit."
I have declared a major disaster for that community, and I hope that helps. It's going to take a long time for the community to recover. And so we'll help in any way we can. There's a certain spirit in the Midwest of our country, a pioneer spirit that still exists, and I'm confident this community will be rebuilt. To the extent that we can help, we will. The most important thing now, though, is for our citizens to ask for the good Lord to comfort those who hurt.
Thank you very much.
