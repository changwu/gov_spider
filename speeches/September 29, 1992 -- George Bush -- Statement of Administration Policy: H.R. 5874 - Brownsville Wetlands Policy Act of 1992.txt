    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Ortiz (D) Texas)
The Administration opposes the enactment of H.R. 5874, which would authorize the appropriation of Federal funds for the establishment and operation of a non-Federal wetlands center.
The Administration has initiated many wetlands protection projects around the country. However, these projects are competitively funded on a priority basis. It would be inappropriate to allocate limited funds for a special project without regard for national or regional priorities. By earmarking funds for a particular center, H.R. 5874 would unnecessarily and counterproductively upset the existing, effective priority systems.
The Administration also opposes a requirement that the Comptroller General of the United States and the Fish and Wildlife Service Director jointly prepare annual reports and concurrently submit them to the Congress and the President. This provision is inconsistent with the principle of separation of powers.
