    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Section 7 of the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act of 1976 provides that my decision regarding an Alaska natural gas transportation system be transmitted to the House of Representatives and the Senate by September 1, 1977. The Act also provides that the decision may be delayed by as much as 90 days upon a determination that additional time is necessary to reach a sound decision. Although I intend to submit my decision to the Congress in the near future, it appears prudent to take some additional time prior to transmittal of that decision.
A decision on an Alaska natural gas transportation system is dependent upon a full and complete assessment of all options. Information and data concerning the proposal for building a pipeline across Alaska and then shipping Alaska gas to the lower-48 states via LNG tankers is complete and well understood.
Discussions with officials of the Canadian government to determine the route and conditions associated with any joint overland pipeline have been underway for some time. The general outline of the Canadian option is becoming increasingly clear, although several final details must still be resolved. While I expect these matters to be resolved in the course of the next several days, I have determined they will not be settled in time for a September 1, 1977, decision.
As soon as these discussions are completed, a final comparative assessment of all project options will be made and a decision regarding an Alaska natural gas transportation system reached.
I intend to transmit that decision to the Congress in the very near future so that action on this critical matter can be taken during this session of the Congress.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
