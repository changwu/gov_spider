Manchester, NH - Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson answered voter questions on spending and abortion rights Wednesday during a taping of "Conversation with the Candidate."
The Republican said he believes the GOP needs to move on from former President Donald Trump, making the case that a new conservative nominee can get the results without alienating certain voters.
"Passion is a conviction for your beliefs and a willingness to stand for them," Hutchinson said. "I've been in the courtroom. I've fought for justice. I know how to fight. I know how to fight against the establishment. You can be a person of conviction and leadership and still have a smile on your face."
Hutchinson said he wants to cut spending and reduce the number of federal employees.
"I came up with a great slogan for our campaign, and it's called 'Debt-free in '33.' Isn't that a great slogan?" he said. "And all the economists say it's impossible to meet that goal. So that's my heart. I'd love to address that debt, and the key is starting to address it."
On abortion, Hutchinson said he's open to a limited ban but believes the issue will be the purview of the states for now.
"I certainly support reasonable restrictions on abortion but also reasonable exceptions: life of the mother and the cases of rape and incest, as well," he said.
Town hall participants said they're interested to see what Hutchinson can do in the first-in-the-nation primary.
"I always like governors," Ben Bolger, of Hanover, said. "Governors have executive experience. You can see what they did in their own state. You can see if they transformed it for the better or worse."
The complete "Conversation with the Candidate" can be seen at 7 p.m. Friday on WMUR. An extra half-hour will be available on the WMUR.com website and mobile app.
