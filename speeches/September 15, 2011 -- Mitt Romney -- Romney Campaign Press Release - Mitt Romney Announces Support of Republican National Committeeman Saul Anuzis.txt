    Mitt Romney today welcomed the support of former Michigan Republican Party chairman and current Michigan Republican National Committeeman, Saul Anuzis.
"Saul Anuzis is a widely respected leader of the conservative grassroots movement, not only in Michigan, but across the country," said Mitt Romney. "I am thrilled to have him on board our leadership team in a critical state like Michigan."
"I am proud to endorse Mitt Romney for President," said Anuzis, "His singular focus on fixing our economy combined with his Michigan roots and ability to relate to the hopes and dreams of Michigan voters make him the one candidate that can and will beat Barack Obama."
"The most pressing issue facing Michigan and America is jobs and our economy," said Anuzis. "You can look at Mitt's experience in turning around the Olympics, putting Massachusetts on a strong economic footing while cutting taxes 19 times and his career as a conservative businessman and see that he has the skills and experience needed to be President."
