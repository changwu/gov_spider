    President Bush will welcome President Arroyo of the Philippines to Washington on November 20. The United States and the Philippines are treaty allies and share a long history of close friendship and cooperation.
The President is particularly pleased to host President Arroyo this year, which marks the 50th anniversary of the mutual defense treaty between the United States and the Philippines. Though born of the Cold War, the alliance is as important today as ever, as the United States and the Philippines work together to combat the threats of the 21st century, especially international terrorism.
The September 11 attacks on the United States have reinforced the strength and vitality of this partnership, as demonstrated by President Arroyo's strong leadership in support of U.S.-led anti-terrorist efforts. President Bush looks forward to discussing developments in the campaign against terror, regional security matters, and ways to further strengthen cooperation between the United States and the Philippines.
