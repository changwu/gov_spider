    We believe that one of the individuals captured by Pakistani authorities in recent raids is Abu Zubaydah, who is a key terrorist recruiter, an operational planner, and a member of Usama bin Laden's inner circle.
Pakistani officials led a series of raids into suspect extremist hideouts in the early morning hours of March 28th. This individual was captured in one of the raids in the town of Faisalabad, along with dozens of Arab and Pakistani militants.
US officers supported this operation, but the raids were both led and carried out by Pakistani authorities.
The individual we believe to be Abu Zubaydah was found at one of the locations originally targeted in the Pakistani raids. He was shot several times as he attempted to escape the raided compound.
He is currently receiving medical attention. For security reasons, we are not going to discuss his location. He will be interrogated about his knowledge of ongoing plans to conduct terrorist activities.
This represents a very significant blow to Al-Qaida.
