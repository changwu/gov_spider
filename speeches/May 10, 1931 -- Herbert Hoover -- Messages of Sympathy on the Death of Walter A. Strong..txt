    I AM DEEPLY shocked to learn of the passing of Mr. Strong. He was so fine an American, so staunch in every righteous course that his loss is a loss to all our people. Mrs. Hoover joins me in expression of our greatest sympathy and our prayers that strength may come to you.

MR. WALTER STRONG was an outstanding publisher of a great journal. Courageous, independent, wise, staunch in every course that led to betterment of the city and the nation. His passing is a national loss. It is a deep personal loss to his myriad of friends.
