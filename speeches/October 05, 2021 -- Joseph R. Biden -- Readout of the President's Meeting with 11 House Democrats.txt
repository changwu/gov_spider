    Following yesterday's virtual meeting with progressive members of the House, this morning the President met virtually with 11 additional House members about the pathway forward for the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act as well as his Build Back Better agenda. They had a productive discussion about how each of these economic growth packages, both physical and human infrastructure, are central to how we ensure our economy delivers for the middle class and secure our competitiveness in the world. The group renewed their commitment to getting each bill passed so that we can make investing in families the heart of our economic growth strategy. They also discussed how much it resonated with the American people that Build Back Better's investments in our economic growth are paid for by undoing tax breaks for the rich and big corporations that are holding us back from making the investments we need to compete in the world, with a price tag of zero. They agreed to stay in touch about the way forward on both bills.
