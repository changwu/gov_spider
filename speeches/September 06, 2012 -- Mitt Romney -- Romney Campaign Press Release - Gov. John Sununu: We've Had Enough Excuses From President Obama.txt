    Former New Hampshire Governor John Sununu made the following statement on President Obama's remarks to the Democratic National Convention:Â 
"President Obama tonight offered a predictable litany of excuses for his failure to restart the economy. But with unemployment over 8 percent for the last 42 months, and with 47 million Americans living on food stamps, we've had enough excuses. It's time for a change of course. It's time to move away from the path of more regulations, more taxes, more spending, and more borrowing. It's time to put our trust in the energy and ingenuity of the American people. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have a comprehensive plan to unleash our small businesses and innovators and return America to a path of economic growth and job creation."
