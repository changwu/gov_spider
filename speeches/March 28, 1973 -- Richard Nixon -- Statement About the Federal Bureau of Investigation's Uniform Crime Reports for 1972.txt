    THE CRIME figures released today by the Department of Justice are very heartening.
The FBI's Uniform Crime Reports indicate that for the first time in 17 years, America has experienced an absolute decrease in serious crime.
In 1972, serious crime decreased by 3 percent over 1971. In the last quarter of 1972, there was a full 8 percent decrease.
Reflected in these figures is a pattern of steady progress over the past 4 years. In 1968, serious crime increased by 17 percent, the largest rate of increase in the last quarter century. Gradually that rate of increase has been reduced, coming down to 11 percent in 1970, 6 percent in 1971, and finally to this complete reversal in 1972.
These results are a tribute to the men and women in the front lines of the war against crime---our law enforcement officers. Public opinion is untying their hands, and they are once again being given the public support they deserve in their efforts to insure that we match public support with all the financial, legislative, and judicial support our police need. We can turn the tide of crime in America. These statistics demonstrate that we are well on our way. Now we must have the tools we need to finish the job. I call upon the Congress to act quickly on this Administration's proposals for law enforcement legislation so that we can advance the work of providing the safe and secure country our citizens want and deserve so much.
