The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately only a small number of players decided to come and we canceled the event. Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!Retweets: 25932Favorites: 118218

The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues all because Jeff Sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himself...I would have quickly picked someone else.
