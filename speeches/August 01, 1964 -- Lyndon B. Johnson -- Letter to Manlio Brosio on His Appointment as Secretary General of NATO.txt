    Dear Mr. Secretary General:
I extend my warm congratulations on the occasion of your assumption of duties as Secretary General of NATO. I have long admired the dedication and wisdom of your predecessors and am confident that with your appointment, the North Atlantic Organization is assured of continued wise and imaginative leadership.
Since the North Atlantic Treaty was signed some 15 years ago, NATO not only has proved to be a defensive military Alliance sufficiently strong to deter aggression but it has also provided a most effective forum for political discussion and consultation between the member governments. Indeed it has encouraged all of us to think in terms of mutual assistance and interdependence. And I assure you that in your efforts to strengthen the Alliance you will always be able to depend upon the fullest support and cooperation by the United States.
Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[His Excellency Manlio Brosio, Secretary General, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Paris, France]
