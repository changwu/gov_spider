Pool Report #3 -- Spray with French President Emmanuel Macron
After holding, press was brought to small room just before 5p local time for a pool spray with French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron was a featured speaker earlier today at MSC.
The room had two chairs, a small table, a couple bookshelves. The French and US flags were in the background.
VP Harris arrived to the room at 5:08 p.m. She waited for three minutes as President Macron was slightly delayed. During this time, she asked the press how they were enjoying Munich and requested the heat to be turned down.
Macron arrived at 5:11 p.m. The two exchanged pleasantries and Harris stated that this meeting was another step in the long history of allyship between the two countries.
"A testament to our friendship and partnership over many generations," Harris said. "It's good to see you again."
Macron then thanked Harris and the US for its "commitment to the security of this continent."
Some of what he said was inaudible for your print pooler -- who was near the back of the room.
The interaction lasted about 1 - 2 min total before press was asked to leave.
While walking out -- Macron acknowledged one of the shouted questions by reporters. Harris did not acknowledge any.
Asked about the Inflation Reduction Act, which included subsidies that the French president has previously criticized, Macron said:
"We'll be discussing that. We are working hard."
Press was escorted out shortly after. Later today, VP Harris will attend a reception for the US Congressional delegation. That event is closed press. The spray w/ Macron was VP Harris last open press event of the day.
