    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Domenici (R) New Mexico and 2 others)
The Administration supports House passage of S. 286, but will seek amendments in the Senate to reduce the Federal cost of establishing the Petroglyph National Monument from $58 million to $30 million.
The protection of ancient Pueblo Indian and Spanish rock art warrants the establishment of a new unit of the National Park System. There are, however, several ways to reduce the estimated $58 million Federal cost of this new National Monument. For example, the size of the Monument could be reduced, and the amount of State and local land acquisition could be increased. Also, the Secretary of the Interior could be authorized to acquire scenic easements in lieu of fee title to private land within the Monument. Existing authority is adequate to study and protect rock art within the National Park System. Expanding the Federal role in managing and protecting rock art to include privately owned sites is not warranted. Finally, the provisions concerning a new Rock Art Research Center could be deleted.
