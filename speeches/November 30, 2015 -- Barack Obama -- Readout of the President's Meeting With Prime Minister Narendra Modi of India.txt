    President Obama met today with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India to discuss their efforts to put in place a lasting framework to address global climate change. The two leaders discussed the urgent threat posed by climate change and reaffirmed their commitment to a successful agreement in Paris. The leaders agreed that the Paris agreement must drive serious and ambitious action by all nations to curb carbon pollution, while at the same time protecting the ability of countries such as India to pursue their priorities of development, growth, and poverty eradication. The President and Prime Minister committed their teams to work closely to achieve these objectives. Additionally, the President welcomed Prime Minister Modi's initiatives to increase renewable energy deployment in India, his leadership to form a solar alliance, and our partnership to launch Mission Innovation, a ground-breaking new initiative that will accelerate the pace at which we can develop and deploy affordable clean energy technology to populations around the world. In addition to the climate agenda, the two leaders discussed additional steps to deepen their countries' strategic partnership on bilateral, regional, and global issues.
