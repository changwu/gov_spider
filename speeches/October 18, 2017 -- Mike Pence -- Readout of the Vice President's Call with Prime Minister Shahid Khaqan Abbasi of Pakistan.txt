    Vice President Mike Pence spoke with Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi by phone today. The Vice President thanked Abbasi for his government's assistance in recovering U.S. and Canadian hostages that were being held captive by the Haqqani Taliban Network in the tribal areas of Pakistan. Vice President Pence noted this effort as an important development in Pakistan's support to the U.S. strategy against terrorism in the region, but highlighted that cooperation against militant groups must be continued and sustained. Just as he did during the meeting the two had in New York last month, the Vice President again discussed ways that Pakistan could work with the United States and others to bolster stability and security for all in South Asia.
