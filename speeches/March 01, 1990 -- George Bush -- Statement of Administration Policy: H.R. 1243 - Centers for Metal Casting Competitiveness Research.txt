    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Erdreich (D) Alabama and Harris (D) Alabama)
Although the Administration does not oppose House passage of H.R. 1243, it will seek amendments in the Senate to:

—  increase private industry participation in the establishment and operation of the metal casting centers to make them self-sustaining within a reasonable period of time; and
—  delete the bill's Buy America provisions which would (1)  impose burdensome administrative requirements, (2)  likely reduce competition, and (3) be contrary to ongoing efforts to increase U.S. exports.
