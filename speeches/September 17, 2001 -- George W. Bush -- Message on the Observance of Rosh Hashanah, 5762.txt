    I am pleased to send warm greetings to Jews in the United States, Israel, and other nations around the world as you observe Rosh Hashanah. This year's observance comes in the wake of great tragedy and at a time of national mourning and recovery.
Rosh Hashanah marks the beginning of a New Year within the Jewish community, and it is a time for personal reflection. As you prepare for Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, may this solemn period bring forth a deeper devotion to your faith's noble ideals. During this time of renewal and recovery, may countless others join in praying for peace and for the growth of religious tolerance around the world.
Rosh Hashanah celebrates Judaism's remarkable heritage, and it is a reaffirmation of God's mercy, glory, and love. As you look ahead to the coming year, I join with other Americans of diverse backgrounds and beliefs in receiving inspiration from your faith, your holy acts of repentance, and your loving kindness. May this year's celebration bless all who participate as we heal from the wounds inflicted by the recent terrorist attacks.
Laura joins me in sending best wishes for a blessed Rosh Hashanah.
