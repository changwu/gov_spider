    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Sen. Peters, D-MI, and three co-sponsors)
The Administration supports passage of S. 3905, the Preventing Organizational Conflicts of Interest in Federal Acquisition Act.
By requiring updates to the Federal Acquisition Regulation to clarify definitions, update existing coverage, and provide illustrative examples regarding organizational conflicts of interest, this bipartisan legislation would help ensure that the services and advice provided by contractors funded with taxpayer dollars are free from bias and undue influence from outside sources. These benefits will also be furthered through the bill's requirements for the development of standard contract language that can be used by agencies, or adjusted to address mission-specific concerns, and the requirement for agencies to update their own relevant policies on an ongoing basis.
The Administration urges the House to pass the Preventing Organizational Conflicts of Interest in Federal Acquisition Act.
