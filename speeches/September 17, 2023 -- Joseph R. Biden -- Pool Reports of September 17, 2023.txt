Travel Pool Report No. 2 - armed protester
A solo protester - wearing a neon yellow and orange safety vest, khaki cargo shorts, tan boots and socks - was spotted walking down the road toward the Biden home.
He appeared to have a gun in his holster.
One side of his sign read: "Bidens are criminals, 20 shell companies?! Where's the laptop? 10% for the big guy."
The other side: "Joe has aliases?! Robert L. Peters, Robin Ware, JRN Ware."
Pool spotted a Secret Service vehicle following him down the road.
Your pooler has reached out to the Secret Service's press contact for an official response.
