    "On this deeply tragic anniversary, my thoughts are with the families and friends mourning the absence of loved ones who lost their lives in the devastating shooting that took place one year ago at Virginia Tech. As we mark this milestone, let us keep in our prayers the victims and their families, and let us work to build a nation in which all of our children are safe and loved."
