    Campaign Names Indiana State Director and Field Director; Mook and Marshall Led Clinton Victories in Ohio, Nevada
The Clinton Campaign today announced that Hillary Clinton will visit Indiana on Thursday, making stops in multiple cities across the state. More details of the trip will be announced in the coming days. The Campaign also announced that Robby Mook will serve as Indiana State Director and Marlon Marshall will serve as Indiana Field Director.
Mook and Marshall led the Clinton Campaign to victories in the critical battleground states of Ohio and Nevada earlier this year. In 2006, the pair oversaw the Democratic Party's coordinated campaign efforts in Maryland which led to the election of a Democratic governor and senator.
"We are going to run an aggressive, grassroots campaign that reaches voters in every corner of Indiana," Mook said.
"Hillary Clinton understands the challenges facing Indiana, and is the best candidate to turn around our economy and rebuild the middle class," said National Campaign Co-Chair Senator Evan Bayh. "She is ready to lead this nation as commander in chief from her first day in the White House."
While Senator Obama starts with a considerable advantage from representing a neighboring state with shared media markets, Hillary has drawn strong support from throughout Indiana.
Among Clinton's supporters are Senator Evan Bayh, House Speaker Patrick Bauer, former Governor Joe Kernan and his wife Maggie, former First Lady Judy O'Bannon, Democratic Party Chairman Dan Parker, State Senator Vi Simpson, Business Leader and Philanthropist Bren Simon, Former Lt. Governor Kathy Davis, Former House Speaker John Gregg, Marion County Sheriff Frank Anderson, former Secretary of State Joseph Hogsett, former Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew and many others.
