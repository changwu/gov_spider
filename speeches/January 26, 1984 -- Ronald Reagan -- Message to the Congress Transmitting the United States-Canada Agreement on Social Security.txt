    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 433(e)(1)), I transmit herewith the Agreement between the United States of America and the Government of Canada which consists of five separate instruments negotiated and signed over a period of several years.
The U.S.-Canada agreements are similar in objective to the social security agreements already in force with Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Switzerland and to proposed agreements with Belgium and Norway which were recently submitted to Congress for review. Such bilateral agreements, generally known as totalization agreements, provide for limited coordination between the United States and foreign social security systems to overcome the problems of gaps in protection, and of dual coverage and taxation for workers who move from one country to the other.
I also transmit a comprehensive report prepared by the Department of Health and Human Services. This report explains the provisions of the Agreements and provides data on the number of persons affected by the Agreements and the effect on social security financing as required by the same provision of the Social Security Act.
The Department of State and the Department of Health and Human Services join with me in commending the U.S.-Canada Social Security Agreement and related documents.
