In town pool report 2 -- arrival and lid 
The president responded to one question as he returned to the White House. His voice was muffled by his mask. Asked if he had spoken with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear today, he responded, "No, I haven't, but I'm going to soon." He then walked into the South entrance.
Timeline:
Marine One set down on the lawn at 1:01.
President stepped off Marine One 1:03
Entered the White House 1:04
Lid declared 1:05.
First Lady Jill Biden waved to the pool as her husband was responding to the shouted question.

Intown pool report 3 -- clarification 
After listening several times to the network audio, it appears that the president's quote was a little different from what was in the last pool report.
Asked if he had talked to Gov. Beshear, he responded, "No, I haven't, but I'm going to see him." So it seems it was "see him" rather than "soon" from Pool Report 2.
