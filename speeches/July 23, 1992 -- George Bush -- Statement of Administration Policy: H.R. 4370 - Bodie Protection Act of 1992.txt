    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 7/24/92)(House)(Lehman (D) and Miller (D) California)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4370, because the bill would unnecessarily preclude environmentally sound mineral resource development in and around the Bodie Bowl area in California.
Under existing statute, the Department of the Interior has developed a Resource Management Plan for the Bodie area. This plan would provide for modern-day extraction of the potentially valuable mineral resources while protecting and preserving the mining town's historic values and environmental integrity.
In addition, the bill contains a provision that would deny the award of mining patents to specified claimants who may have valid existing rights to such patents. This provision may pose a likelihood of financial exposure for the United States based on a compensable taking of private property.
