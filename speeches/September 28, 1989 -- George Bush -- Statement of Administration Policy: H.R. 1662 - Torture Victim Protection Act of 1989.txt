    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Yatron (D) Pennsylvania and 11 others)
The Administration strongly supports Senate ratification of the U.N. Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. This Convention establishes a multilateral framework for dealing with the problem of torture.
The Administration, however, opposes enactment of H.R. 1662 because it:

represents a unilateral extension of civil jurisdiction that is questionable under the Constitution;
may pose significant problems of reciprocity and retaliation by foreign countries; and
would direct the Judicial branch to exercise jurisdiction in a manner potentially detrimental to the Executive branch's role in the conduct of foreign relations.

H.R. 1662 conflicts with the Convention's approach to combatting torture and is premature given that Senate ratification of the Convention is pending.
