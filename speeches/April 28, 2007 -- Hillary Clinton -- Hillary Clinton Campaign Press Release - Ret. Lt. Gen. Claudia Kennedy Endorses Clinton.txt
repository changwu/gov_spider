    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Claudia Kennedy.
"Hillary Clinton is a strong leader who can protect our nation while rebuilding our relationships abroad," General Kennedy said. "Her lifelong commitment to health care and better lives for children make her uniquely suited to be our next President."
General Kennedy is the first woman to be named a three-star general in the U.S. Army, and served as Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence from 1997 until her retirement in 2000. After graduating from college, she entered the Women's Army Corps as a second lieutenant and later was commissioned into the regular army, serving 31 years.
During her career, General Kennedy received several awards, including the Legion of Merit, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Meritorious Medal and the Army Commendation Medal.
She currently serves on the board of advisers of Opportunity International, a non-profit organization devoted to helping people in developing countries rise out of poverty through microfinance lending programs.
"General Kennedy is an inspiration to every woman who has attempted to break barriers," Clinton said. "She served our country with great distinction, and I'm honored to have her support."
