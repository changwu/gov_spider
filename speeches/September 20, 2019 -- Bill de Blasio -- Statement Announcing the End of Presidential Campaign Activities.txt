    I'm writing this to you on my last morning as a candidate for president. After several months of campaigning, I have reached a point where I feel I have contributed all I can to this primary. Today, I'm ending my campaign.
Chirlane and I to thank you for your support from the bottom of our hearts. We got into this race to make sure that working people came first on the Democratic Party's agenda again, and we wouldn't have been able to do it without your help. When you made a phone call for us or just chipped in a few dollars, you helped push the kitchen table issues affecting everyday Americans to the front of the national conversation.
This campaign has been a profound experience for me. I saw America in full – not as it appears on twitter and cable news, where we're constantly shown a country hamstrung by our differences and unable to tackle the problems we face. We have more in common than we realize – and more and more of us across the country are overcoming our divisions and standing up for working people.
I visited with family farmers in Greene County, Iowa, standing up against giant agribusinesses; activists in Londonderry, New Hampshire who worked for years and years until they elected their first Democratic State Representative since the Civil War; Dreamers in Nevada, challenging long-held orthodoxies on immigration. Americans are changing our party and our country for the better.
I've worked alongside them and gotten to lift up their voices on this campaign. Soon, I'm confident they will transform this country into a place which finally delivers the rights and privileges that working people deserve. I'll continue standing shoulder-to-shoulder with them in this fight. I hope you'll stand with us, too.
Thank you for your support,Bill de BlasioNew York City Mayor
