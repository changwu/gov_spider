    Today's agreement between the Department of the Interior and seven Colorado River Basin States on a consensus-based approach marks an important step forward in our efforts to protect the stability of the Colorado River system in the face of climate change and historic drought conditions. Thanks to my "Investing in America" agenda, we are deploying record resources to support water conservation and improve the Colorado River's long-term sustainability. This approach will benefit the 40 million people who rely on the Colorado River Basin for agriculture, drinking water, and power and is a critical step to building a sustainable, resilient future for States, Tribes, and communities throughout the West.
