MITT ROMNEY: "3 million jobs come back to this country by taking advantage of something we have right underneath our feet. That's oil, and gas, and coal. We're going to make it happen. We're going to create those jobs. Let me tell you what else it does. It adds $500 billion to the size of our economy. That is more good wages. That's an opportunity for more Americans to have a bright and prosperous future. It also means, by the way, tens of billions, potentially hundreds of billions of dollars, of tax revenues going into states and the federal government which can make sure we have a military second to none and schools that lead the world and care for our seniors, better roads and bridges. Accomplishing what I've described right there also means lower energy prices for American families and by the way, for American businesses, so that as businesses are thinking about where to build a factory and they look at the cost of production, let's say, of a particular product, and they look at the energy cost, they see that here in North America, we have ample energy and it is low cost. And that will bring businesses back here. So you are going to see more manufacturing come back to the United States as a result of doing what is so clearly in our best interest."
