    AUSTIN â€” Gov. Rick Perry today released the following statement regarding anti-boycott, divestment and sanctions legislation signed by President Obama:
"The State Department's comments on anti-BDS legislation signed into law by President Obama this week inject doubt into the United States' commitments both to stopping the BDS movement and to negotiating a sustainable peace between Israel and Palestine. The BDS movement singles out Israel and it is common sense that supporting boycotts against Israeli exports does not bring Israel and Palestine one step closer to peace. If the Administration is serious about achieving that sustainable peace, it should not vacillate in its objection to BDS.
The US position should uncompromisingly oppose all forms of BDS because that is the only way to stop the movement. The new TPA legislation is helpful in this regard, but it must be used as a tool by the administration. If they are reluctant, it will be next to useless. The signals that the Administration sends to the Europeans are critical here, and this time the State Department's signal was ambiguous at best. Only with robust diplomacy and tough enforcement, will the message be received."
