President Trump. Thank you, folks. Do you know who this is? Does everybody know? He's going to be a fantastic Prime Minister, I can tell you. And we're having very, very good meetings. So far, so good.
Prime Minister Johnson. We're having terrific meetings. And we're going to do a fantastic deal once we clear up some of the obstacles in our path.
President Trump. And that's a fantastic—many deals. We're talking about many different deals, but we're having a good time. As far as U.K. and the United States, we're working on a very big trade deal, and I think it's going to work out very well.
