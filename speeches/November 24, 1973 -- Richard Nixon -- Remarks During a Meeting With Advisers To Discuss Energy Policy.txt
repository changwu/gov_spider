    It is an uncommonly warm day as far as the weather is concerned. The weather has been on our side up to this point, but not enough to avoid some pretty tough and strong actions that we are going to have to take on Monday.
JOHN A. LOVE [Director of the Energy Policy Office]. It is difficult, of course, to get that distribution thing equitably spread.
THE PRESIDENT. I will make an announcement with regard to the steps that we are taking with regard to the energy problem on Monday (Sunday) night at 7 o'clock. That will be done live. It will not be a long presentation, but Governor Love, prior to that time, will brief the press on all of the details. I will just make approximately a very brief announcement with regard to the steps that we are taking so the Nation will be aware, and everybody will be aware, of how everybody, through cooperation, can avoid, as I said, any suffering. But everybody is going to have to do some sacrificing in order to handle the energy crisis.
We have been going over it, yesterday, and again today, and there is general agreement within the Administration as to what steps will be taken. We will still work on it over the weekend, and the decisions will be announced on Monday (Sunday) night for the first time publicly, because Governor Love's briefing will be in the afternoon at probably 3 or 4 o'clock, hold for release a.m.'s and 7 o'clock.
HELEN THOMAS [United Press International]. Will it be on television?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes. We will make the announcement on television from here, and UPI can cover if they like.
