    Today, a single, unelected, district judge in the Central District of California issued a legally groundless and sweeping injunction that—if not immediately lifted—will guarantee the release of innumerable criminal illegal aliens into our communities putting citizens at dire risk. This ruling undermines the pillars of immigration enforcement and blocks traditional and vital law enforcement cooperation that has occurred for decades. This injunction puts the health and lives of innocent Americans in direct jeopardy. Our neighborhoods are less safe today as a result of this dangerous district court ruling.
