    Hillary Clinton released the following statement after the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America endorsed her campaign for President. The Carpenters and Joiners follow the United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers and Allied Workers, the American Federation of Teachers, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers, and the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry in backing Clinton.
"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America.
"Unions like the UBC built the mighty American middle class by creating good-paying jobs and careers across the country. And the Carpenters are doing their part to ensure that the jobs of the 21st century create as much opportunity as the jobs of the past. Earlier this year, I visited the UBC's training center in Las Vegas, where men and women of all ages come together to learn new skills and crafts—an impressive example of the kinds of investments we need to build the economy of the future.
"As President, I will support unions like the Carpenters by expanding opportunities for apprenticeships and fighting every day to get wages rising again for working Americans. I have always stood and will always stand with unions like UBC against employer efforts to misclassify workers and steal wages, and against Republican assaults on collective bargaining and the right to organize. When unions are strong, families are strong—and when families are strong, America is strong."
