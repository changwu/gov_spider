    Today, the President called Yitzhak Rabin to congratulate him on his victory and the formation of his government. The President told him how much he looked forward to working with him to deepen the U.S.-Israeli partnership and to promote the peace with security that the Israelis have rightly yearned for for so long.
The Prime Minister told the President about his desire to give the peace process new momentum, and they agreed that it would be good for Secretary Baker to visit Israel and its neighbors next week to get the ball rolling again. In addition, the President invited the Prime Minister to visit him in Kennebunkport early in August.
