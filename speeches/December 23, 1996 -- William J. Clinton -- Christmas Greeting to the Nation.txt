    The President. Hillary and I wish all of you the peace and joy of the holiday season, a time for us to rejoice in each other's company and in the spirit of the season, a spirit of sharing and giving and making peace.
I want to send a special greeting to all the peacemakers among us, especially to our brave men and women in uniform who are away from home. You're on a mission of peace. I join with all Americans to thank you for your service and to pray for your safe return.
The First Lady. Christmas is an opportunity for all of us to give thanks for the blessings we share as families, friends, and Americans. But most important, it is a time for children, and I hope that during this holiday season we will remember our Nation's neediest children and extend the spirit of giving to them with our love, our prayers, and our generosity.
The President. May the spirit of Christmas and the magic of the wonderful season be with you and your loved ones throughout the holidays and in the new year to come. Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and God bless you all.
