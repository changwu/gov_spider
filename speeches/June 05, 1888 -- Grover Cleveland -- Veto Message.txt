    To the House of Representatives:
I return herewith without approval House bill No. 4467, entitled an act for the erection of a public building at Bar Harbor, in Maine."
The entire town within which Bar Harbor is situated contained in 1880 1,639 inhabitants, as appears by the census of that year.
There is no pretense that there is any need of a public building there except to accommodate the post-office.
This is a third-class office, and the Government does not pay the rent for offices of that class. The gross receipts of the office for the year ended June 30, 1887, are reported by the Postmaster-General at $5,337. The postmaster reports that he employs five clerks in the summer and three in the winter. The fact that Bar Harbor is a place of very extensive summer resort makes its population exceedingly variable, and during a part of the year it is quite likely that the influx of pleasure seekers may make a more commodious post-office desirable, though there does not seem to be much complaint of present inconvenience.
The postmaster pays a rent of $500 per annum for his present quarters. The amount appropriated by the bill is quite moderate, being only $25,000, but the postmaster expresses the opinion that a proper site alone would cost from twenty to thirty thousand dollars.
I am decidedly of the opinion that if a public building is to be erected at this place, of which at present there appears to be no necessity, it should be done under a system which will not give the post-office and the postmaster there an advantage over others of their class.
