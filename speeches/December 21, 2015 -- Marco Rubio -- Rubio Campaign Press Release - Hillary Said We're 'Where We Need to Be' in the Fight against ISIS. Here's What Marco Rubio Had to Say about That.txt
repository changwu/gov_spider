Here's what Marco had to say about that:
It's one more example of how government, Washington, and particularly the Democratic party completely out of touch with reality and out of touch with the American people.
The vast majority of Americans understand that this threat is not under control; in fact, it continues to grow in both scope and sophistication.
She's talking about how we have a plan — how is that plan any different from the plan we had in place a month ago, or two months ago, when the president was claiming that ISIS was contained, and then a few days later they attacked Paris, and less than a month later . . . they had this terrorist attack in San Bernardino.
So it's just another example of how out of touch they are, and how clueless they are, and quite frankly how dangerous their foreign policy has become for the national security of this country.
