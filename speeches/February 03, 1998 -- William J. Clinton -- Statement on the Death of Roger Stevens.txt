    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of our dear friend Roger Stevens. He will long be remembered as a defining force in America's cultural life.
As founding chairman of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Roger can be credited with spotlighting our Nation's Capital as a haven for the performing arts. The Kennedy Center, one of America's finest cultural showcases, might never have been built if it weren't for Roger's dedication and energy. His love of the arts led him to produce more than 200 plays, including "West Side Story," "Bus Stop," and "Deathtrap." Roger served as the first Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, and won numerous awards for his dedication to highlighting the performing arts, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1988), the National Medal of Arts (1988), the Kennedy Center Honors (1988), and the National Artists' Medal (1983).
Our Nation is mourning the loss of this important cultural figure. Our thoughts and prayers are with his friends and family in this sad time.
