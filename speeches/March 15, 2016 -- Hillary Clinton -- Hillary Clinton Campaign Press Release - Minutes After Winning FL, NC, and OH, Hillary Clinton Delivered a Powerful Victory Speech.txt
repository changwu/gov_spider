    "This may be the most consequential campaign of our lifetimes."
On a night of incredible primary victories, Hillary Clinton delivered a powerful victory speech in West Palm Beach, Florida. Here were six of the moments that had the crowd on their feet:
When she summed up this election in one sentence.
" Tonight it's clearer than ever that this may be the most consequential campaign of our lifetimes."
When she thanked everyone who made a phone call, knocked on a door, voted, or pitched in to support this campaign.
" Because of you, our campaign has earned more votes than any other candidate, Democrat or Republican."
When she reminded everybody what—and who—we're fighting for.
" We're going to stand up for American workers and make sure no one takes advantage of us—not China, not Wall Street, not over-paid corporate executives."
When she took on Donald Trump—just like she'll continue to do for the rest of this campaign.
" When we hear a candidate for president call for rounding up 12 million immigrants, banning all Muslims from entering the United States, when he embraces torture—that doesn't make him strong, it makes him wrong."
When she pledged to break down all the barriers holding Americans back.
" Together we have to defend all of our rights—civil rights and voting rights, workers' rights and women's rights, LGBT rights and rights for people with disabilities."
And when she nailed what really makes America great.
" Nobody works harder than Americans. Nobody innovates better. Nobody dreams bigger. And if we work together, we can out-compete anyone in the world."
