    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of New York's CSEA, Local 1000 AFSCME.
"CSEA members, like other Americans, want a president who will restore respect for America in the world while working to address the growing inequality for working Americans," said CSEA President Danny Donohue. "We know that Hillary Clinton will provide that leadership."
CSEA represents more than 265,000 members working in the public and private sectors across New York state.
"I am honored to receive the support of the men and women of the CSEA," Clinton said. "When I'm President, America's working families will again have an advocate in the White House."
The CSEA announced its endorsement after polling its members and leadership to determine their preferred candidate.
"Hillary Clinton has the overwhelming support of the vast majority of CSEA members and we are proud to join with her in her historic campaign," Donohue said. "CSEA and its 265,000 members will work hard to help elect her and it will be a better day for the American people."
