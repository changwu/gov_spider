    Kate Smith was a patriot in every sense of the word. She thrilled us all with her stirring rendition of "God Bless America" and sang with a passion which left few eyes dry. For many years, Kate Smith touched our hearts and souls and made us all swell with the special pride of being Americans.
No one who heard her sing will ever forget the verve she brought to her music in a way which made her a special part of the American fabric. All America loved her, and she loved America. America was indeed God-blessed to have Kate Smith as one of her daughters. Nancy and I will miss her and extend our deepest sympathy to her family.
