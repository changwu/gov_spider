    "Rejoice!"
MATTHEW 28:9
Laura and I send greetings to all those celebrating the glorious Easter holiday.
The Resurrection of Jesus Christ is the most important event of the Christian faith. Easter morning holds wonder and promise, and it is a chance for people everywhere to gather with family and friends to celebrate the power of love conquering death. In this season of renewal, we can rejoice in Christ's rising, draw strength and inspiration from His example, and remember that in the end, even death itself will be defeated.
This Easter we pray for all our men and women in uniform and for the military families whose loved ones are deployed on important missions in distant lands. We remember especially those who have given their lives in freedom's cause.
On this powerful day, let us join together and give thanks to the Almighty for the glory of His grace.
Happy Easter, and may God bless you.
GEORGE W. BUSH
