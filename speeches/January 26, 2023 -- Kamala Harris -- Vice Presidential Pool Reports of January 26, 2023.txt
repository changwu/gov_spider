VP TRAVEL POOL #10
After an uneventful flight, AF2 touched down at JBA at 7:39pm EST.
The VP exited AF2 at 7:49pm. She donned a jacket to come down the stairs, as it is a much colder 39 degrees here at JBA than it was in LA.
She waved to the pool but did not stop to chat.
She entered Marine 2 at 7:50pm, wheels up at 7:56pm.
That's it from me, have a good night!
