    The President has directed Jack Watson, Assistant to the President and Chairman of the Interagency Coordinating Council, to organize an interagency effort to assist Knoxville, Tenn., with its proposed International Energy Exposition.
In announcing the interagency effort, the President said, "It has become apparent that the planning process for Expo 82 has reached the stage that high-level Federal coordination is appropriate. In line with my commitment to the success of this international project and my strong support for interagency cooperation on programs which have national as well as local import, I am urging the Interagency Coordinating Council to begin work immediately on a joint effort with the city of Knoxville, the State of Tennessee, and the private sector to make available appropriate Federal resources in a coordinated fashion. Expo 82 will seek to dramatize the national and international importance of our energy problems and possible solutions to those problems."
Jack Watson will make this the first specific project of the Council, and the lead agencies involved will be Commerce (including the United States Travel Service), HUD, State, and Energy.
