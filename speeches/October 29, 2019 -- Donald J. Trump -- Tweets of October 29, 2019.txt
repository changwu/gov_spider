'Americans know by now that the Impeachment inquiry is just another hoax and silent coup to remove the President from office.' J.J. Crovatto Don't worry J.J.

'There is no underlying crime in that transcript.' @IngrahamAngle 100% correct and the Whistleblower disappeared after I released the transcript of the call. Where is the Whistleblower? That is why this is now called the Impeachment Hoax! The Do Nothing Dems are Doing Nothing!Retweets: 17167Favorites: 68565

The only crimes in the Impeachment Hoax were committed by Shifty Adam Schiff when he totally made up my phone conversation with the Ukrainian President and read it to Congress together with numerous others on Shifty's side. Schiff should be Impeached and worse!Retweets: 22194Favorites: 96221
