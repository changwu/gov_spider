    "Democrats are still hiding Joe Biden, but they can no longer hide their radical socialist agenda. Tonight we finally got to hear from Biden's running mate, Kamala Harris, the most liberal member of the U.S. Senate, with a voting record even further to the left than Bernie Sanders. The radical leftists have taken over the Democrat party and now they want to take over this country, pledging to remake America in the image of socialism. This cannot happen. Their agenda includes raising taxes by $4 trillion, forcing a government takeover of your healthcare, cutting police funding, and granting amnesty to 11 million illegal aliens, while also giving them taxpayer-funded healthcare and work permits so they can compete against Americans for jobs. The radical leftists have exposed their extreme agenda, but the American people will not buy what the Democrats are selling."
- Hogan Gidley, Trump 2020 national press secretary
