    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(REVISED PER LA 3/15/88)
(Senate)(Byrd (D) West Virginia)
The Administration believes the concept of reviewing and revising our legal immigration system is a sound one, and is therefore considering alternatives to S. 2104. We are also evaluating the potential budgetary impact of certain provisions of S. 2104.
