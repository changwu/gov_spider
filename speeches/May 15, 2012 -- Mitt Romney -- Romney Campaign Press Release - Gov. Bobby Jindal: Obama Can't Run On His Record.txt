But it also goes to a second point. President Obama simply cannot run on his record. The reality is 23 million Americans unemployed, underemployed, simply have left the work force. President Obama cannot ask the American people are you better off than you were four years ago?" â€“ Gov. Bobby Jindal

BILL HEMMER, FOX NEWS: "What do you think of the short clip we just played there with what appears to be the Romney team and their response to the hits on Bain Capital?"
GOV. JINDAL: "Well, two things. One, I think it goes to two themes of this campaign. One, it contrasts the fact that President Obama hasn't run anything before he was elected President of the United States; never ran a state, never ran a business, never ran a lemonade stand. This job is too important for on-the-job training. In contrast, Mitt Romney has been a successful governor, a successful businessman, he's got the executive experience. But it also goes to a second point. President Obama simply cannot run on his record. The reality is 23 million Americans unemployed, underemployed, simply have left the work force. President Obama cannot ask the American people are you better off than you were four years ago? He is going to have to savagely attack Mitt Romney. We've seen the start of that this week and now you're seeing Mitt Romney respond which I think is a very good thing."
