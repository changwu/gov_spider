    For more than 5 years, a group of 12 countries have negotiated a forward-looking trade deal that sets new, high standards for trade and investment in one of the world's fastest growing and most important regions. Today these countries signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a new type of trade deal that puts American workers first.
Right now the rules of global trade too often undermine our values and put our workers and businesses at a disadvantage. TPP will change that. It eliminates more than 18,000 taxes that various countries put on "Made in America" products. It promotes a free and open Internet and prevents unfair laws that restrict the free flow of data and information. It includes the strongest labor standards and environmental commitments in history, and unlike in past agreements, these standards are fully enforceable. TPP allows America—and not countries like China—to write the rules of the road in the 21st century, which is especially important in a region as dynamic as the Asia-Pacific.
Put simply, TPP will bolster our leadership abroad and support good jobs here at home. That's why I released the full text of the agreement 3 months ago for all to see, and it's why I'll continue working with Democrats and Republicans in Congress to enact it into law as soon as possible so our economy can immediately start benefiting from the tens of billions of dollars in new export opportunities. We should get TPP done this year and give more American workers the shot at success they deserve and help more American businesses compete and win around the world.
