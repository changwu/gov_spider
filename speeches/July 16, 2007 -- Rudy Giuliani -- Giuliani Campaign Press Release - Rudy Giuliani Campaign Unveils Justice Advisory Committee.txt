    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today unveiled the members of Rudy Giuliani's Justice Advisory Committee. Former Solicitor General of the United States Ted Olson will serve as Chairman.
The Committee is comprised of some of America's leading conservative scholars and practicing attorneys, many of whom Rudy Giuliani has known since his time serving as Associate Attorney General in Ronald Reagan's Justice Department. Members include former Assistant to the Solicitor General Miguel Estrada, Co-founder of the Federalist Society Steven Calabresi and former Deputy Attorney General of the United States Larry Thompson.
"Rudy Giuliani believes in limited government, individual liberty and interpreting the Constitution the way its framers intended," said Ted Olson, former Solicitor General of the United States and Chairman of the Justice Advisory Committee. "He understands that we need judges who interpret the Constitution, not legislate from the bench. Rudy Giuliani will appoint strict constructionist judges who share that philosophy."
"Unelected judges legislating from the bench threaten the Federalist philosophy that is the foundation of our Constitutional system," said Federalist Society co-founder Steven Calabresi. "Judges are meant to judge â€” not make laws. Under Rudy Giuliani, it will stay that way."
Members will advise Rudy Giuliani on a wide range of legal and policy issues including judicial appointments, tort reform and reducing frivolous lawsuits in our country.
