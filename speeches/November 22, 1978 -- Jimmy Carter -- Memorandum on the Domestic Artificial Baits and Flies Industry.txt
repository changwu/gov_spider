    Memorandum for the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations
Subject: Determination Under Section 202(b) of the Trade Act; Artificial Baits and Flies
Pursuant to Section 202 (b) (1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-618, 88 Stat. 1978), I have determined the action I will take with respect to the report of the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) dated September 21, 1978, on the results of its investigation concerning artificial baits and flies provided for in Item 731.60 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States.
After considering all relevant aspects of the case, including those set forth in Section 202(c) of the Trade Act of 1974, I have determined that import relief would not be in the national economic interest. the measure proposed by the USITC (removal of these products from the GSP program thereby raising the tariff on imports from countries eligible for GSP benefits to 12.5%) would not provide relief in view of the large price differences between imports and the domestically produced items and furthermore it would contribute to inflation. In addition, imports have shown little significant increase during the five years examined, while import prices were reduced 30 percent and domestic prices nearly doubled.
This determination is to be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER.
