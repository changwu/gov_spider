Senator Rubio was honored by the kind words and quickly we put together a video with assets that we were remiss in getting approval from the respective parties. We have reached out to Glenn and the Blaze team to apologize for utilizing their Intellectual Property without prior approval. Fortunately, Mr. Beck and his respective teams know that we share much in common in how we view the world and they have graciously accepted our apologies. Mr. Beck did ask us to reiterate that what were said in the videos were true and accurate reflections of the individuals positions. Mr. Beck does in fact believe that if Senator Rubio is to be the Republican nominee, he does believe that the Senator will prevail against Mrs. Clinton. This statement however was not meant as an endorsement of Senator Rubio, but rather, after spending time with the Senator both in studio and at a rally his perspective on what would happen in a theoretical match-up.
