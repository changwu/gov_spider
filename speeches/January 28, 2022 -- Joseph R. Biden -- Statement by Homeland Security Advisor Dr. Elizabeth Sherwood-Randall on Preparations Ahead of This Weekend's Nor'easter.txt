    The Nor'easter that will move up through the mid-Atlantic States to the Northeast this weekend will bring extreme cold and hazardous conditions to many communities. Be sure to pay close attention to the information and guidance that is provided by your State and local leaders and homeland security and emergency preparedness officials. We will be actively monitoring the storm's projected impacts and working closely with FEMA to ensure that we are prepared to support any needs for Federal assistance that may arise in your community.
