    Goodyear employs thousands of American workers, including in Ohio where it is headquartered. To President Trump, those workers and their jobs aren't a source of pride, just collateral damage in yet another one of his political attacks.
President Trump doesn't have a clue about the dignity and worth that comes with good-paying union jobs at places like Goodyear â€” jobs that can support a family and sustain a community. And even after 170,000 have died due to his mismanaged response to this pandemic, President Trump still keeps taking his eyes off the ball, getting distracted by petty political grievances instead of doing his job and stopping the virus.
Here's the deal: when I'm President, we're going to make made-in-America real again. We're going to stand up to unfair competition, just like we did with Chinese tires in the Obama-Biden Administration, and we're going to make major investments in American manufacturing and innovation so our factories and our workers can outcompete the world for generations to come.
