    More than 300 Nevadans came out on Saturday morning for the final stop of Jeb's Announcement Tour.
The town hall in Henderson included laughs, hugs and a commitment from Jeb that Nevada would see him a lot over the next 16 months.

We also learned what happens when you tell Jeb you became a Republican after 50 years as a Democratâ€¦

You deserve a hug.
Thanks for the love, Henderson. See you soon.
