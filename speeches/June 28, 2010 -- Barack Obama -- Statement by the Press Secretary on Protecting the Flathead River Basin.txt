    On the margins of the Summit meetings in Canada this weekend, President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Stephen Harper noted the historic February 2010 memorandum of understanding between Premier Gordon Campbell of British Columbia and Governor Brian Schweitzer of Montana protecting the transboundary Flathead River Basin.
They discussed how relevant U.S. and Canadian agencies, including the U.S. Department of the Interior and Environment Canada, working with representatives of the Province of British Columbia and the State of Montana, could support this understanding and could help ensure the sustained protection of the Flathead River Basin.
