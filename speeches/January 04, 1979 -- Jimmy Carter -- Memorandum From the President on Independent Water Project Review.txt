    Memorandum for the Chairman and Members of the Water Resources Council
In my Water Resources Policy Reform Message of June 6, 1978, I stated that an independent project review unit would be created in the Water Resources Council to ensure water projects have been planned in accordance with the Principles and Standards and other planning requirements. Today I have signed an Executive Order which establishes this independent water project review function in the Water Resources Council.
I look forward to your speedy organization of the independent review unit. As described in my Water Policy Message, I expect the review function will be performed by a professional staff of about 30 and will be operational in time for the 1981 budget cycle. Rules, regulations and procedures necessary to implement the independent review function should be published in proposed form in the FEDERAL REGISTER within six weeks and in final form within the following six months.
