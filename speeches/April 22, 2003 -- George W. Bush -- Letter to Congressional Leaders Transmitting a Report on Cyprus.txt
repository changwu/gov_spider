    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with section 620C(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, I am providing a report prepared by my Administration on progress toward a negotiated solution of the Cyprus question covering the period February 1, 2003, through March 31, 2003. The previous submission covered events from December 1, 2002, through January 31, 2003.
As in the past, U.S. officials including Secretary of State Colin Powell, Under Secretary of State Marc Grossman, Special Cyprus Coordinator Thomas G. Weston, and Ambassador to Cyprus Michael Klosson joined me in providing intensive diplomatic support to the efforts of United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to foster a settlement to the longstanding division of the island. We hoped that the Secretary General's meetings with the two Cypriot leaders in The Hague on March 10-11, 2003, would lead to a breakthrough on the basis of the Secretary General's fair and balanced settlement plan. Unfortunately, that meeting did not result in an agreement. Despite this setback, the United States remains committed to finding a just and lasting settlement for Cyprus.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
