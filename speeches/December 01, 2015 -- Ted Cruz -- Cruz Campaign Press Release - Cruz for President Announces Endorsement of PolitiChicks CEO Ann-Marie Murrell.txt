    HOUSTON, Texas â€“ Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today announced the endorsement of Ann-Marie Murrell, the CEO and Editor-in-Chief of the conservative blog, PolitiChicks.com.
"Ann-Marie has been instrumental in igniting a conservative revolution in the media and blog sphere," said Cruz. "She is a woman of great courage who speaks the truth and empowers others to do the same. Her leadership has provided a platform for thousands of women to voice their views and shape the political and cultural dialog. Ann-Marie is capturing the momentum of millions of Americans who are standing up to the Washington Cartel and making their voices heard. I am grateful for her support and I am honored to have her endorsement."
"Our nation will be stronger and safer with a Cruz White House," Ann-Marie said. "We cannot withstand another two, four, or eight years of 'leading from behind.' We need a Commander-in-Chief who puts Americans' safety above all else, who is not afraid to call Islamic terrorism by its name, and who will protect citizens through a position of strength. Ted Cruz will stand with our allies, especially Israel, and will make America a home that is once again safe and free for our kids and grandkids."
Today, Ann-Marie penned an op-ed in support of Ted Cruz for President. Read the full op-ed here.
