    I have signed into law S. 1227, the Niagara Falls National Heritage Area Study Act. The Act requires the Secretary of the Interior to study the suitability and feasibility of establishing the Niagara Falls National Heritage Area in the State of New York, along and in the vicinity of the Niagara River.
Section 3(d) purports to require the Secretary of the Interior to submit to the Congress recommendations related to legislation. The executive branch shall construe this provision in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to submit for consideration to the Congress legislative proposals as the President judges are necessary and expedient.
