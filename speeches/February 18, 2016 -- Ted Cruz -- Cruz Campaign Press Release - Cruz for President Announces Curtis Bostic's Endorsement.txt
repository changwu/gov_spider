    HOUSTON, Texas — Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today announced the endorsement of Curtis Bostic. In 2000 Bostic was elected to the Charleston County Council where he served two terms. During his time he ensured Charleston did not experience a single tax increase and Charleston County had a balanced budget every year. He is a retired United States Marine who has deployed to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, where he won a Meritorious Mast for his conduct during the ground campaign of Operation Desert Storm. Bostic is an attorney and has represented individuals and businesses in court for almost 20 years, fighting for justice against some of the largest companies in the world.
"Senator Cruz is a man of disciplined fortitude and action; demonstrated as he repeatedly took stands for conservatism even when unpopular by establishment Republicans," said Bostic. "Of critical importance to our times, Senator Cruz has a command understanding of the Constitution derived from the unique experience of defending our constitutional rights before the Unites States Supreme Court. His commitment to the Constitution and his faith are the strong moorings of his conservative principles."
"I am thrilled to have Curtis' support for our campaign," said Cruz. "During his time serving on the Charleston County Council he worked to reign in out of control government spending and supported small businesses in order to grow the economy. Curtis has been a consistent and passionate fighter in the state of South Carolina, working to protect the liberties of his constituents. I am glad to have his help in continuing to work to bring conservatives together behind this campaign."
