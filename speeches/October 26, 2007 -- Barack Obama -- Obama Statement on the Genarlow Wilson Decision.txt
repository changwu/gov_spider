    "The cause of justice was served in Georgia today when its Supreme Court found the outrageous sentence of Genarlow Wilson unconstitutional. Today is a day to celebrate a young man's freedom, but also to rededicate ourselves to the task of correcting the glaring inequities in our criminal justice system that led to his ordeal. This is a task I will commit my Department of Justice to when I am President of the United States."
