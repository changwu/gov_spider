Trace Gallagher: What's the strategy going forward, Senator, for you to get more speaking time for you to get your name out there more often?
Sen Scott: Substance will drive my debate performance. I'll provide the American people with an adult in the room. What we cannot abide by is a food fight where the two biggest winners are Joe Biden's campaign and national media that loves to see Republicans fighting with Republicans. The road to socialism runs right through a divided Republican party. I'll increase my time by allowing the contrast between the candidates on the stage to manifest and then keep talking about why I know America can do for anyone what she's done for me. We have to restore hope, create opportunities, and protect America. That starts with backing the blue and closing our southern border.
