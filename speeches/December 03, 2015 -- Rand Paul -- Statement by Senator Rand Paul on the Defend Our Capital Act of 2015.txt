    WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator and Republican Presidential candidate Rand Paul introduced legislation that would remove existing restrictive firearm ownership laws in the District of Columbia, and require the District of Columbia to issue and grant reciprocity for concealed weapons permits for both residents and non-residents.
The Defend Our Capital Act of 2015 was offered as an amendment to H.R.3761, Restoring American's Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015. Following the introduction of this legislation, Sen. Paul issued the statement below:
"For too long the Americans who live in and visit their nation's capital have been prevented from defending themselves and their loved ones. No longer should our citizens have to choose between safety or visiting Washington, D.C."
