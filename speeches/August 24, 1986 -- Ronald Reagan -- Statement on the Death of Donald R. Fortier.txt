    Don Fortier's death is a great loss to my administration and the United States. Don had worked tirelessly and brilliantly in developing our national security policy. His creativity in the search for lasting peace throughout the world contributed significantly to our progress toward that goal. Nancy and I extend our heartfelt condolences to Don's wife, Alison, and his son, Graham. May God bless them.
