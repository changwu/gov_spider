    I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 12240, the Intelligence and Intelligence-Related Activities Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1979. This is the first specific annual authorization for appropriations for intelligence functions of the Federal Government.
This act symbolizes the recent achievements of the Congress that broaden and intensify oversight of intelligence activities through a cooperative effort with the executive agencies. I would like to express particular commendation to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House, the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate, and the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. The process has, I believe, enhanced congressional participation in oversight while minimizing the risks of disclosure of national intelligence information.
The classified annex provides helpful guidance. It differs, however, in some important respects from the views of the Executive, and in light of some recent developments of mutual concern, I feel compelled to seek some modifications in the appropriations process. In any event, I pledge that the executive agencies will continue their cooperation with the intelligence oversight committees of Congress, and I congratulate the House and Senate for supporting these committees in this difficult task.
