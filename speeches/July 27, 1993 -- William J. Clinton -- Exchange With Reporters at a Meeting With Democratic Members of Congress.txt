    Flood Relief Legislation
Q. Mr. President, the flood aid bill, sir? Your response to the Houseâ€”overwhelmingly passed the flood aid bill?
The President. I'm elated. I'm elated. I think it's a wonderful thing. We had, as you know, the Governors from the flooded States, and they're real grateful. And we just have to see quick action from the Senate. There are still a lot of problems out there, a lot of things that could still go wrong. And the front needs to break up so the South and East can get some rain, or we're going to have some agricultural disasters there.
Q. Would it help with the chances in the Senate that Kansas has had some pretty severe flooding at this point?
The President. I don't think that has anything to do with it. I think the Senate will support it on a bipartisan basis and without regard to where they're from.
