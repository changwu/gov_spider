    Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with the provisions of section 1512 of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Public Law 105-261), I hereby certify that the export to the People's Republic of China of two jet mills for fine grinding of friable or crystalline materials to be used in the manufacture of spandex fiber and semiconductor compounds and one spare beam centerline that will be exported for repair/replacement for the continuous operation of a cargo inspection system is not detrimental to the U.S. space launch industry, and that the material and equipment, including any indirect technical benefit that could be derived from such exports, will not measurably improve the missile or space launch capabilities of the People's Republic of China.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
