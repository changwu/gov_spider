    Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following statement in response to this morning's disappointing jobs report.
Senator Santorum said, "This morning's jobs report is another sad sign that President Obama's economic policies would need to improve dramatically to even be described as incompetent. For three years, in speech after speech, the President has claimed to be focused on the American worker, but month after month and report after report shows the opposite. So either, the President's economic policies are killing this economy or his lack of leadership - either way, President Obama is to blame. Employers need certainty and freedom to expand and that what my jobs plan would do."
In July, Senator Santorum released his jobs plan focusing on putting America back to work, with a focus on the "great middle of America," the manufacturing sector. Senator Santorum's plan would:


Eliminate the corporate tax for all domestic manufacturers (take it from 35% to 0%);


Repatriate taxes on profits secured overseas at a 5% rate rather than the current 35% tax rate;


Reduce regulatory burdens on manufacturers; and


Expand domestic energy exploration to lower energy costs for manufacturers.
