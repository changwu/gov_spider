    Today, Senator Graham released the following statement responding to remarks made by a Trump supporter at a recent event stating that Muslims were "a problem in this country":
"If I had had the opportunity to respond to this gentleman, I would have told him that he was absolutely wrong in his sentiment and he doesn't know a thing about the war against radical Islam. After more than 35 trips to Iraq and Afghanistan, I have learned that the overwhelming majority of the people in the faith are not buying what ISIL and other terrorist organizations are selling. To win this war, we need to build strong relationships with people of all faiths, including Muslims who reject the perversion of their faith that ISIL represents. Together, and with the right American leadership, we will win the fight against our common enemy: radical Islam.
"I can only assume, based on Mr. Trump's deafening silence yesterday, that he too does not understand this war, much less how to defeat radical Islam. As I discussed at Wednesday's debate, I'm the only candidate with the experience, will, and uncompromising determination to win the war against terrorism."
