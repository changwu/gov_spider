    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Oregon and ordered Federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the area struck by a severe winter storm with high winds on February 7-8, 2002.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected local governments in Coos, Curry, Douglas, Lane and Linn Counties.
Federal funding is available to eligible local governments on a cost-sharing basis for the repair or replacement of public facilities damaged by the severe winter storm with high winds. Federal funding is also available on a cost share basis for hazard mitigation measures.
Joe M. Allbaugh, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), named Thomas Davies as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The Agency said that damage surveys are continuing in other areas, and additional assistance and counties may be added after the assessments are completed.
