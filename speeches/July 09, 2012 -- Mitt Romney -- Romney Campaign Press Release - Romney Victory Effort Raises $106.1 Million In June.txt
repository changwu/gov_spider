    Today, Romney for President, Romney Victory, and the Republican National Committee announced fundraising totals of $106.1 million in June. The campaign and RNC have approximately $160 million cash on hand.
Announcing the numbers, Romney Victory National Finance Chairman Spencer Zwick said, "This month's fundraising is a statement from voters that they want a change of direction in Washington. Voters of all stripes — Republicans, Independents, and Democrats — have made it clear that President Obama has not lived up to the promises of his last campaign. Mitt Romney's message of restoring economic security and rebuilding our middle class is clearly resonating across the country. In the months to come, these resources will be crucial to highlighting the difference between President Obama's broken promises and Mitt Romney's plan to get America on the right track again."
"Our June fundraising is a sign that voters are fed up with President Obama's failure to fix our economy and want a change of direction," said Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. "While President Obama thinks that the private sector is 'doing fine,' millions of Americans are struggling to find work, pay their bills and stay in their homes. President Obama is clearly in over his head and Americans deserve better. Mitt Romney will fix our economy, repeal Obamacare, and get spending under control — that is why he is receiving such strong support from voters across the country."
