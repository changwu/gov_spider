VP supplemental pool #3- event over
The event started around 11:50.
Harris walked out and stood on the left of the stage from my view with Sec. Raimondo on the right of the podium. Sec Haaland was on the screen closest to Harris virtually.
There was about a dozen members of staff in the audience.
Introduced by:The introducer will be Shannon Holsey, President of the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians in Wisconsinand Treasurer of the National Congress of American Indians.
Biggest news: Harris announced $1 billion in grants now available for broadband in Tribal lands.
To a shouted question about whether she's practicing her Spanish for her trip to Guatemala, Harris said she regrets she being fluent in Spanish so "I will have my conversations in English so as not to embarrass myself" as she laughed.
The event ended at 12:20.
