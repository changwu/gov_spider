In town pool #8: Biden remarks 
Remarks clocked in at a little under 2 minutes. Here are highlights. Check against tape please!
"Today's jobs report shows that the American Rescue plan is urgently needed."
Says we have 9.5 million fewer jobs than we had this time last year. "At that rate it would take 2 years to get us back on track."
Also says we have 1 million fewer educators and 400,000 small businesses. "All those empty storefronts are not just shattered dreams, they are warning lights going off in state and local budgets."
Says that any improvements in the job report was likely due to the December relief package but without a rescue plan "these gains are going to slow." "We can't go one step forward and two steps backward"
"The rescue plan is absolutely essential to turning this around, getting kids back to school safely, giving a lifeline to small businesses and getting the upper hand in COVID 19"
We were then ushered out. No response to shouted q's.
