    "Mitt Romney's got a very different view that features the private sector and entrepreneurial activity. The President's comments the other day were stunning, they were jarring, saying that businesses didn't contribute or didn't do it themselves or words to that effect. Let's debate those two competing visions for the future of this great nation and quit messing around with these collateral issues." — Tim Pawlenty

Click Here To Listen To Tim Pawlenty Discuss President Obama's Comments About Business
TIM PAWLENTY: "He is really just stomping on the American Dream for entrepreneurs by that statement. And it just shows how disconnected or naïve he is about the private sector and frankly I just don't think he understands it, he doesn't have any background or experience in it. And your point about having two very significant different visions for the future of the country is exactly right. Let's debate that. That's the real issue. The future of the country based on a direction and a philosophy. President Obama's got a very liberal view of that and, in my view, a dangerous view of it. Mitt Romney's got a very different view that features the private sector and entrepreneurial activity. The President's comments the other day were stunning, they were jarring, saying that businesses didn't contribute or didn't do it themselves or words to that effect. Let's debate those two competing visions for the future of this great nation and quit messing around with these collateral issues. And frankly, I think the President and his media friends are just dangling these shiny objects to distract from that bigger issue because President Obama's got a terrible record when it comes to that."
