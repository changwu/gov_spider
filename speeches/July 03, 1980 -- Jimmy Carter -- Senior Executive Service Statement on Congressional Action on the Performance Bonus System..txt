    Within the last several days, there have been serious efforts in the Congress to put severe limitations on the performance bonus system for the Senior Executive Service.
While the Congress has not approved the full implementation of the Senior Executive Service bonus system, I am pleased that we were able to develop a reasonable compromise under which up to 25 percent of Senior Executive Service members may receive full awards this year. The action of the Congress is especially important, because it reaffirms a central principle of civil service reform-that pay should be linked to performance.
The Senior Executive Service is one of the keys to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Government. Because that effort depends in large measure on the motivation and leadership of top Federal managers, I am very appreciative of the support and assistance Senior Executive Service members have provided in making civil service reform a reality.
