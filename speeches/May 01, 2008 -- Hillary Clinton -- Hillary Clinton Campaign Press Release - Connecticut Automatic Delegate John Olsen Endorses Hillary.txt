    Connecticut automatic delegate John Olsen announced his support for Hillary Clinton today.
"Hillary Clinton is the champion working families need," Olsen said. "She is a fighter and a doer who will stand up for the middle class and deliver quality, affordable health care for every American. She is the strongest candidate to beat John McCain in the general election and win back the White House."
A DNC member since 1996, Olsen is President of the Connecticut AFL-CIO and former Democratic State Party Chair.
