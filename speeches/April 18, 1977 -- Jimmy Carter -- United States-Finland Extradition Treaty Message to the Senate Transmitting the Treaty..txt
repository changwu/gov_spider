    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty on Extradition between the United States of America and Finland, signed at Helsinki on June 11, 1976.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.
The Treaty is one of a modern series of extradition treaties being negotiated by the United States. It adds to the list of extraditable offenses the offenses of aircraft hijacking, narcotics, and conspiracy to commit listed offenses and, upon entry into force, will terminate and supersede the existing extradition treaty relationship between the United States and Finland.
This Treaty will make a significant contribution to the international effort to control narcotics traffic. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
