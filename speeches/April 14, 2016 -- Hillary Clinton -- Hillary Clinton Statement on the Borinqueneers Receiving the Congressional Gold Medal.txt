    Hillary Clinton released the following statement on the Borinqueneers of the U.S. Army's 65th Infantry Regiment receiving the Congressional Gold Media, which was awarded at the U.S. Capitol yesterday:
I applaud and congratulate the Borinqueneers of the U.S. Army's 65th Infantry Regiment on their Congressional Gold Medal. This is the highest civilian award bestowed by Congress, and these brave Americans deserve it. They fought with courage and valor in World War I, World War II and the Korean War, overcoming punishing conditions and incredible odds.
The Borinqueneers are part of a long tradition of Puerto Ricans serving with honor in the U.S. armed forces. These proud Americans continue to serve with distinction and patriotism in all branches of our military today. Their contributions are vital to our strength, our security and our freedom. We all owe them a debt of thanks.
