COLUMBIA, SC - Four South Carolina leaders previously having backed Senator Joe Biden or Senator Chris Dodd's presidential campaigns today announced their support of Hillary Clinton, calling her the best candidate of the contenders to make change real for the country.

"Of all the candidates left, Hillary's who I trust most to make the changes we need in our country. She's got the experience to fix this mess our country is internationally and she can go to work on it from day one," Bales, a retired educator who represents part of Richland County in the House, said.
"This isn't a question of whether the candidate is black or white, man or woman. It's a question of who can best do the job we need done and hit the ground running," Brown, former chair of the South Carolina Legislative Black Caucus, said.
The endorsements are part of a growing momentum in South Carolina seen by the Clinton campaign.
"We have a strong campaign in South Carolina and it's ratcheting up as the election draws closer," Hillary Campaign State Director Kelly Adams said. "People are hungry for change and someone who can back that change up with experience; that's Hillary."
