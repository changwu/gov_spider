 MITT ROMNEY: "We have to have a strong economy. Right now, Russia's economy is growing at about 4 percent per year. That's their GDP growth. Ours was just revised last quarter down to 1.3 percent per year—about a quarter or a fifth the rate of Russia's. This is a real challenge for us. And this is not just one quarter. This has been going on now for years. China's growing much faster than we. Russia's growing faster than we. Our economy needs to be reinvigorated. And the President has laid out his plan. It's a continuation of the old plan. We can't afford four more years of the last four years, all right?"
