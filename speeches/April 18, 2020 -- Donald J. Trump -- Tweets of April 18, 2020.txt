No matter what you do for the Do Nothing Democrats, no matter how GREAT a job you are doing, they will only respond to their Fake partners in the Lamestream Media in the negative, even in a time of crisis. I thought it would be different, but it's not. In fact, it's even worse...Retweets: 37540Favorites: 167719

....Example! V.P. Mike Pence held a conference call yesterday with all Democrat Senators. He gave them everything that they would have wanted to hear in terms of gaining ground on the CoronaVirus, but nothing that anyone could have said, including "it's over", could have made....Retweets: 15966Favorites: 68949

....them happy, or even a little bit satisfied. They were RUDE and NASTY. This is their political playbook, and they will use it right up to the election on November 3rd. They will not change because they feel that this is the only way they can win. America will not be fooled!!!Retweets: 19913Favorites: 84902

The most often used phrase in the Lamestream Media, by far, is "sources say", or "officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity", or anything similar which allows Fake News to make up a phony quote from a person who doesn't even exist. The American people should demand NAMES!Retweets: 41810Favorites: 178274
