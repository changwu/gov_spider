    Today, Nevada Congresswoman Susie Lee announced her endorsement of Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"We know that elections have consequences, and we're feeling the effects right now as we work to tackle this global pandemic and protect American lives. November is our only chance to right this ship. We have the power to elect a leader who will unify our country and do the work every single day to put people first. Joe Biden is the leader, and I'm proud to be supporting him for President. He brings people to the table to fix problems. Joe Biden is a 'no excuse, roll up your sleeves and do the work' type of leader. He has worked with Republicans and Democrats alike to get things done. That is just what we need right now. We need Joe Biden in the White House, someone who understands the struggles of all working families and I am so honored to endorse him for President. I hope you'll join me."
Lee was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018.
Lee's endorsement builds on the wide support for Joe Biden in Nevada. Biden for President has previously announced more than 3,000 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
