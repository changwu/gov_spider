    The country, the people of Texas, and the Congress have been well served by Congressman Dick Armey. As a fellow Texan, I know his effective leadership firsthand.
When he was a sophomore lawmaker, and a member of the then minority party, Dick Armey proved his mettle by authoring and passing a major base closure initiative that was signed into law. As majority leader, he has skillfully guided legislation through Congress; his dedication to reforming Government, lowering taxes, and simplifying the tax system has deeply influenced public policy.
I know Dick's dedication to public service will remain strong, even during his retirement. His sense of humor, candor, and leadership will be sorely missed in Congress.
Laura and I extend our thanks to Dick, his wife, Susan, and their family, and we wish each of them the best in the future.
