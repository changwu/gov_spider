    Tomorrow, Saturday, December 3, Romney for President will hold "Earn It With Mitt" in New Hampshire. Mitt Romney and Governor Tim Pawlenty will rally supporters in Manchester at 9:30 a.m. Following the rally, 500 volunteers from around the region will go door-to-door meeting New Hampshire voters and making calls to voters across the state. The volunteers will knock on 5,000 doors, make 12,000 phone calls, and put together 10,000 yard signs and distribute 5,000 to New Hampshire residents. "Governor Romney takes New Hampshire's First in the Nation Primary very seriously," said Romney for President New Hampshire State Director Jason McBride. "We have focused on running a traditional grassroots New Hampshire campaign, and during this time, Mitt Romney has come to know the voters through our numerous town hall meetings and other visits throughout the Granite State. He shares their devotion to 'Simpler, Smaller, and Smarter' government and the need for Washington to be more accountable to the taxpayers. Mitt Romney will continue to visit New Hampshire and reach out to voters as he seeks to fix our economy and restore our country's fiscal health. 'Earn It With Mitt' is one of the many steps that Mitt Romney, the campaign, and its volunteers and supporters will take to earn the support of voters in the run up to the New Hampshire primary."
