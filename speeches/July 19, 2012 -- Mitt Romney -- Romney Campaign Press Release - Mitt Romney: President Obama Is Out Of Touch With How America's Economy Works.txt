    "I think the President is extraordinarily out of touch with how America's economy works and with how individuals pursuing their dreams in this country have built America. The President thinks that it's government that should take responsibility for all the successful businesses in this country. And the truth is, it is not government. Government has a role to play but the people who deserve the credit for starting a business and growing it and hiring people are the entrepreneur who started it and the many people that work at that business." â€” Mitt Romney

Listen To Mitt Romney Discuss President Obama's Economic Philosophy

DAN MADURI: "When you look President Obama's recent comments in quotes saying 'if you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen' what are you thinking personally?"
MITT ROMNEY: "I think the President is extraordinarily out of touch with how America's economy works and with how individuals pursuing their dreams in this country have built America. The President thinks that it's government that should take responsibility for all the successful businesses in this country. And the truth is, it is not government. Government has a role to play but the people who deserve the credit for starting a business and growing it and hiring people are the entrepreneur who started it and the many people who work at that business. Government is not playing the role this president thinks it is. He is completely misguided. It is a foreign concept to think that government is the center of America's economy. It is free people pursuing their dreams."
