    "Mayor Giuliani successfully worked to get guns out of the hands of criminals in order to transform a city out of control. By being tough on crime and enforcing the laws on the books, New York City's murder rate was cut by 66 percent. The bottom line: the best way to deal with gun-related crime is to prosecute the criminals and enforce the laws already on the books."
– Maria Comella, Deputy Communications Director

AS PRESIDENT, GIULIANI WILL PROSECUTE CRIMINALS WHO USE GUNS TO COMMIT CRIMES
Rudy Giuliani Believes That We Need To Enforce Laws That Exist, As Opposed To Passing New Laws That Infringe On Individual Rights.
As President, Giuliani Will Have Zero Tolerance For Criminals Who Use Guns To Commit Crimes. Criminals who commit crimes with a gun must go to prison for the mandatory sentence. They must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law – 5-year sentences for violent or drug trafficking crimes committed with guns, and a mandatory additional 25 year sentence for each subsequent violent or drug trafficking crime committed with a gun.
Giuliani Believes We Should Strengthen Project Safe Neighborhood To Provide Federal Funding To State Prosecutors So They Can Screen Gun Cases And Refer The Serious Ones To Federal Court.
As President, Giuliani Will Strengthen Mandatory Minimum Sentences For Armed Career Criminals.
Giuliani Supports The Parker Decision and The Castle Doctrine. Mayor Giuliani Supports the Parker Decision and hopes that it will be reaffirmed on appeal firmly establishing that the Second Amendment applies to individuals. He believes that Parker will strengthen the Castle Doctrine, underscoring the right of a person to protect themselves in their own home.
