You have seen the average median household income go down by $4,000. That's not good news for American families. And American families have not thrived under this president." â€“Gov. Mary Fallin

GOV. MARY FALLIN: "I think they're not talking about the issues that are very important to mothers, to women in general. You know, I and my husband have six children between the two of us. We're concerned about will our children be able to find a job when they get out of college? Will our children be left with mountains of debt from college loans? Will they be left with mountains of debt from Obamacare which is going to be a huge drag upon our national economy? $16 trillion of debt in our economy of 23 million Americans that are unemployed. You know, the fact of the matter is, women are actually suffering under this president. You've seen the number of women that are on food stamps go up to record high. You have seen the average median household income go down by $4,000. That's not good news for American families. And American families have not thrived under this president."
