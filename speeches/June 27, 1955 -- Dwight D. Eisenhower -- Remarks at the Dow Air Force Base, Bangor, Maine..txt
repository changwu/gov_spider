    Governor Muskie, members of the Maine delegation in Congress, the Secretary of State, Mr. Dulles, other distinguished visitors-and my fellow Americans:
I have been on a fine two-day visit in your State, and I am delighted that someone arranged so that as my last act in this State on this trip I could say goodbye and thank you to so many of you.
I have made a lot of new friends and had a lot of fun. I have met people old and young, men and women, all of them warmly hospitable to me. I have met a lot of your trout and one or two of your salmon. I have met midges that are the only things, so far as I know, that completely whipped me. Of course, I just call them black flies, but the guides call them "midges."
I have learned a lot. I have learned a lot about the beauty of your State, about your warmheartedness. I wish that I could have stopped and spoken to every single individual that did me the great honor of coming out on the street and waiting for my cavalcade to pass, or who has--like you here--come out to a locality, to a grandstand or a fairground or to an airfield, and allowed me to say "It's so good to see you--another American."
It has been a bit of a vacation. Now I go back to work. The Secretary of State--to insure that my vacation is at an end as I get into the air--is going to give me a lecture on the way down to Washington.
I think I had better be about it, without more ado. Let me again say to each of you that all of this work is for one thing: peace on this earth, for which we all aspire.
Goodbye--good luck--it has been an inspiration to be among you. I hope that some day I can come back when, as a speaker said today, when I have another job and am not in such a hurry.
Thank you. Goodnight.
