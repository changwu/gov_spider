    30-second television spot to air statewide
The Clinton Campaign launched a new ad in Oregon today, emphasizing that while the pundits in Washington focus on who's up and who's down, Hillary Clinton will focus on what's right for Oregon families.
The 30-second spot, entitled "What's Right," details Hillary's commitment to end the No Child Left Behind Act and provide quality, affordable health care for every American. And it emphasizes Hillary's opposition to the Bush Administration energy bill, which removed local control over the siting of liquefied natural gas terminals on Oregon's coast. [Watch the ad] here
Following is the script for the ad.
Hillary for President
"What's Right"
TV :30
ANNCR: In Washington, they talk about who's up and who's down.
In Oregon, we care about what's right and what's wrong.
She's the one who will end No Child Left Behind so we teach children to learn, not take tests.
She's the one who voted against the Bush energy bill that threatens liquefied natural gas plants along Oregon's coast.
She's the one insisting on health coverage for every America.
She's been right when it matters.
She'll be there when it counts.
HRC: I'm Hillary Clinton and I approved this message.
