    "Only One" ad highlights Richardson's diplomatic experience
SANTA FE, NM-- The Presidential campaign of New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson today released an ad touting Richardson's one of a kind experience as a diplomatic troubleshooter around the world.
The ad, entitled "Only One," details a hostage situation in Iraq that then-Congressman Richardson was called upon to defuse. In the 60-second spot, Bill Barloon, the late David Daliberti, and his wife Kathy Daliberti praise Richardson for obtaining the release of the two men from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in July 1995.

"Governor Richardson is the only candidate with hands-on experience in tense international disputes," campaign manager Dave Contarino said. "This year, Governor Richardson has helped shut down North Korea's largest nuclear reactor and has obtained a temporary cease-fire in Darfur. Bill Richardson's record speaks for itself: even in the most hostile situations, he gets the job done right. The United States no longer can afford on-the-job diplomatic training and needs a President with the kind of international experience that only Bill Richardson has."
The ad is the latest in a series of spots that have spread Governor Richardson's message to voters around the country. Richardson steadily has climbed in the polls in the early caucus state of Iowa and early primary state of New Hampshire. Governor Richardson registers double-digit support in both the recent ARG Iowa and Rasmussen New Hampshire polls.
