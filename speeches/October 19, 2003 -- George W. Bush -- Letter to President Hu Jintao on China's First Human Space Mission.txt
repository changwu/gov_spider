    Dear Mr. President:
On behalf of the American people, I congratulate you and the Chinese people on the successful completion of China's first human space mission. I was pleased to learn that Lieutenant Colonel Yang Liwei returned safely to earth. This mission was an historic triumph for the Chinese people and a milestone in the continued exploration of space.
The United States of America warmly welcomes the People's Republic of China's achievement in becoming only the third country to launch an astronaut into space, and wishes you continued success in this endeavor.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
