    HOUSTON, Texas â€“ The Cruz for President campaign announced today the endorsement of leading New Jersey Assemblyman Michael Patrick Carroll who has served the 25th New Jersey legislative district for 20 years and has been a conservative leader in the Garden State.
"I am proud to have the support of Mike Carroll," said Cruz. "Mike is indicative of the caliber of leaders who are joining our campaign nationwide. A solid consistent conservative who understands and defends the Constitution and our conservative principles."
"New Jersey has no better friend than Ted Cruz," said Carroll. "We pay some of the highest federal taxes, and get the least back. President Cruz's proposed tax cuts will be a huge benefit to New Jersey residents. His flat tax proposal will do more to stimulate economic growth than any President since Reagan."
"For the last eight years, we've been in a long national malaise, caused by a President who ignores laws he dislikes, refuses to compromise, considers his political adversaries his enemies, and has brought a level of vindictive partisanship never before seen in all of American history," Carroll continued. "President Cruz will enforce the law, work on every front to reduce taxes, cut spending, pare back regulation, increase freedom, and produce prosperity."
"Ted Cruz brings a better understanding of the land and of the judiciary than any President in history," Carroll concluded. "He understands that the Courts exist to apply the law as the people, or the Legislature, give it to them, not to make it up as they go along. Unlike President Obama, who appointed politicians to the bench, to rule by decree, President Cruz will appoint judges, like Justice Scalia, who understand the appropriate role of the judiciary."
Carroll joins a team of leaders across all of New Jersey's 21 counties.
