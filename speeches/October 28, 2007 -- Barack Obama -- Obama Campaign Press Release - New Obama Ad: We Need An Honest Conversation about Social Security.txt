    Des Moines, IA -- Obama for America today released a new television ad about the need to have an honest conversation about the future of Social Security. The ad entitled "Wind" starts airing in Iowa today and can be found at www.iowa.barackobama.com/iawind.
The ad comes one day after Obama noted in a Des Moines townhall that Senator Clinton has repeatedly dodged opportunities to reveal her thinking about the best way to strengthen Social Security. Obama was introduced at the event by Tod Bowman, a previously undecided Iowa caucusgoer and Maquoketa high school teacher, who asked Senator Clinton for more details about her position on Social Security at a campaign event. In the public forum, she declined to directly answer Bowman's question, but later offered him a response when she thought no reporters were present.

Script of "Wind":
OBAMA: I'm Barack Obama and I approved this message.
OBAMA: We've got 78 million baby boomers who are going to be retiring. There's going to be more money going out than money coming in.
OBAMA: If we have failed to have a real, honest conversation about Social Security, it will not get fixed. This is a program that millions of people depend on.
The Obama Principles:
* Protect benefits
* No privatization of Social Security
* End Social Security tax exemption for the wealthy
OBAMA: I don't want to just put my finger out to the wind and see what the polls say. I want to bring the country together to solve a problem. [Applause]
