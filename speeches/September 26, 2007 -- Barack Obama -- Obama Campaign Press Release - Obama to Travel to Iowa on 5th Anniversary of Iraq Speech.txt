    Foreign Policy Speeches in Des Moines and Coralville Slated for Next Week
Des Moines, IA -- US Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign today announced that Obama is planning to return to Iowa next week to mark the fifth anniversary of a speech he delivered in Chicago's Federal Plaza articulating his opposition to the invasion of Iraq.
On Tuesday, October 2nd, Obama will travel to downtown Des Moines and Coralville to deliver a speech highlighting the experience and judgment he used to oppose the war before it started and his vision to restore America's security and standing in the world.
On Wednesday, October 3rd, Obama will participate in a town hall meeting sponsored by the Iowa City Foreign Relations Council. Later Wednesday afternoon, Obama will host a town hall meeting in Washington County where he will talk about his commitment to turning the page in Iraq.
During his October 2002 speech, Obama spoke out against President Bush's plan to invade Iraq saying it would lead to "a U.S. occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences." Less than two weeks later, the US Congress voted to authorize President Bush to go to war with Iraq.
Two weeks ago, Obama outlined a comprehensive plan to end the war in Iraq responsibly in a September 12th speech in Clinton, IA.
