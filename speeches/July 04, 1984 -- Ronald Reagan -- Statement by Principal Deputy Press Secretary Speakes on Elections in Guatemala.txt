    We have noted with pleasure the record turnout of Guatemalan voters in the July 1 Constituent Assembly elections. The bipartisan U.S.. observer team and our Embassy in Guatemala report from visits throughout the country that the process was fair and open, well organized, and orderly. We applaud the Government of Guatemala for taking this important step in carrying out its commitment for a return to constitutional practices and the unprecedented response of the citizenry to the opportunity to participate in their political process. We wish the Guatemalans well as they prepare a constitution and proceed with elections for a new government next year.
