Boston, MA â€“ Today, Romney for President launched its newest website, AnnRomney.com. As the premier location for information about Ann and her family, visitors to AnnRomney.com will get an insider's perspective into Ann's time on the campaign trail, the Romney family and Ann's causes. The website is a unique forum for people to connect directly with Ann.
"Campaigning with Mitt has been such an incredible experience. One of the best parts about being on the campaign trail is the opportunity to meet so many great Americans that we might not have otherwise met. Here at AnnRomney.com, I hope people from across the country will get to know a little bit more about me, my causes and the importance of family in my life. Our campaign is doing so many creative things online, and I'm proud that this site will be a part of that," said Ann Romney.
Central to AnnRomney.com is "Ann's Causes," a section detailing Ann's struggle with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and her work to promote awareness about the disease. As Ann writes on the website, she is "continually amazed by the number of people who approach me to offer support and relay their struggles and successes with MS." Through AnnRomney.com, she will continue to build awareness about the disease, support networks and treatments. On the website, Ann writes:
"As I learned more about the disease, I learned this is a very common feeling and have made an effort to reach out to newly diagnosed friends, family members and people I meet on the road to simply talk to them about their concerns and fears. I don't think anyone can prepare for a diagnosis such as this, but I was very fortunate to have the love and support of my husband, my family and my friends, and if by making a phone call to a newly diagnosed patient, I can ease a few of those fears, it is worth it. If you, or someone you know, has recently been diagnosed, please click here ."
Visitors to AnnRomney.com can also see video, news coverage and photos from Ann's time on the campaign trail. In the coming weeks and months, the website will be continually updated.
