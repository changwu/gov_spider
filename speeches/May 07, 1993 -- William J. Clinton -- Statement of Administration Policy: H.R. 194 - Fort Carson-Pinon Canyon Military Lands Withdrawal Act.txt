    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 5/10/93)(House)(Hefley (R) Colorado)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 194, but will seek an amendment in the Senate to provide a 25-year term for this land withdrawal as opposed to the 15-year term provided in subsection 8(a). Substantial lead time is required to comply with all statutory and administrative procedures applicable to military withdrawals. Thus, a 25-year term is more efficient and assures greater continuity of management.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 240 could affect collections that offset spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary PAYGO scoring estimate is zero.
