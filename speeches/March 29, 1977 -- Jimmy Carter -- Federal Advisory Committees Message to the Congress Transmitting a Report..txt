    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the provisions of Section 6(c) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the report on the status of advisory committees in 1976 is herewith forwarded.
This is the fifth annual report. It is organized to provide summary information about the activities of advisory committees, and public access to specific committees and the federal agencies to whom they provide advice.
With the current government-wide, zero-base review of all advisory committees, the number of existing committees should be sharply reduced. This reduction will be reflected in the next annual report.
