    NEW YORK â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday accepted an invitation from the Vatican to attend a conference hosted by the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences on social, economic and environmental issues.
"I am delighted to have been invited by the Vatican to a meeting on restoring social justice and environmental sustainability to the world economy. Pope Francis has made clear that we must overcome 'the globalization of indifference' in order to reduce economic inequalities, stop financial corruption and protect the natural environment. That is our challenge in the United States and in the world."
The high-level meeting will take place on April 15, the 25th anniversary of an important encyclical of Pope John Paul II, Centesimus Annus, which called for an economy of dignity, social justice and environmental sustainability.
Pope Francis is calling on world leaders, grassroots organizations and the scientific community to share their knowledge and insights on how these great objectives can be achieved in our time.
