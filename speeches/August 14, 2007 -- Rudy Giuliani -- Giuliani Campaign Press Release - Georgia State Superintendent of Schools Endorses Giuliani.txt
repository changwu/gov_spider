    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced that Georgia State Superintendent of Schools Kathy Cox has endorsed Mayor Rudy Giuliani for President. Cox, who won a landslide statewide reelection in 2006, joins a growing team of Georgia supporters.
"America needs real leadership in Washington. Mayor Giuliani's 12 Commitments to the American People, including his commitment to provide a high quality education to every child in America, will bring the same success to the country that he brought to New York City," said Cox, a former public school teacher for 15 years.
