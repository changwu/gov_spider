.@JudgeJeanine 'Bob Mueller isn't your whole investigation premised on a Fake Dossier paid for by Hillary created by a man who hates Donald Trump & used to con a FISA Court Judge.

.@GovMikeHuckabee 'Your paycheck is bigger your pension is stronger.' @foxandfriends Unemployment numbers are better than they have been in 50 years & perhaps ever. Our country is booming like never before - and it will get even better! Many companies moving back to the U.S.A.Retweets: 22278Favorites: 95322

Many @harleydavidson owners plan to boycott the company if manufacturing moves overseas. Great! Most other companies are coming in our direction including Harley competitors. A really bad move! U.S. will soon have a level playing field or better.Retweets: 18412Favorites: 84447

'Seems like the Department of Justice (and FBI) had a program to keep Donald Trump from becoming President'. @DarrellIssa @foxandfriends If this had happened to the other side everybody involved would be in jail. This is a Media coverup of the biggest story of our time.Retweets: 33759Favorites: 106933
