    MANCHESTER, N.H. – With less than 20 days until the New Hampshire primary, grassroots support for Sen. Sanders has continued to grow in the Granite State. Bernie 2020 announced today that the campaign has knocked more than 100,000 doors in the last two weeks alone, spanning all 10 counties. Since the start of the campaign, Bernie 2020 has had more than 10,000 active volunteers in New Hampshire.
Growing support for Bernie 2020 in New Hampshire is reflected in a new poll out today that shows Sen. Sanders leading among likely Democratic primary voters.
Sen. Sanders has spoken directly to more than 23,000 Granite Staters at 51 events across all 10 counties, and held one of the state's largest 2020 rallies to date.
"I am constantly impressed by the dedication and energy of our volunteers. We are not taking a single Granite State vote for granted," said Sean Ward, Bernie 2020 New Hampshire Field Director. "This movement isn't powered by one person, but by the thousands of grassroots volunteers who are rallying around Bernie Sanders' message for a better future. Together we are building a diverse coalition that gives the people a seat at the table. Bernie 2020 will not be slowing down until the last vote is counted on election night, February 11."
Later this week and ahead of another weekend of action, Bernie 2020 National Co-Chair Ben Cohen and national surrogate Jerry Greenfield, the co-founders of Ben & Jerry's ice cream, will campaign in New Hampshire — hosting Students for Bernie ice cream socials across the state, including stops in Plymouth, Henniker, Keene, Manchester, Durham, New London and Hanover.
