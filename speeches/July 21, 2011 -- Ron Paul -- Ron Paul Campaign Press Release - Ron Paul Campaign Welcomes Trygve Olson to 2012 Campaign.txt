LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” Today, the campaign of 2012 presidential candidate Ron Paul announced the addition of political consultant Trygve Olson as a senior advisor.
"It is a pleasure to bring Trygve Olson on board," said Ron Paul 2012 spokesman Jesse Benton. "He has a wealth of experience in political organizing, and brings the kind of skill required to help connect Dr. Paul's winning limited government vision with a growing number of supporters."
Mr. Olson is President at the public affairs and political consultancy Viking Strategies LLC and Founder of AdvancingFreedom.org. Olson served as advisor to the 2010 campaign of U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) and has worked on campaigns for all levels of office in over thirty countries around the world.
"It is a genuine privilege to be a part of Ron Paul's campaign for the presidency. My international experiences have reminded me time and again of the importance of freedom at home, and in America Ron Paul is our generation's greatest advocate of limited government and individual liberty," said Mr. Olson.
