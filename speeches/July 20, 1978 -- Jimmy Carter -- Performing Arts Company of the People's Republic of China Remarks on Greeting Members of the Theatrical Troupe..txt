    It's a great pleasure for me as President of our country to welcome to the United States such distinguished artists and performers from the People's Republic of China.
You represent a great nation. I know you've already been to New York and, now, Washington. You'll be going to Minneapolis and to Los Angeles and to San Francisco, and we are glad that you have an opportunity to see our great Nation.
We have an opportunity to observe your beautiful music, performances, the dances, not only the thousands of people who see your performances themselves, but through television, millions of Americans will have an opportunity to have their lives blessed by the observance of your artistry.
I know the performances are frequent and your work is difficult, but I hope that you enjoy your visit to our Nation. You've had other cultural missions here, and our Philadelphia Philharmonic Orchestra has been to the People's Republic, but this is the most ambitious cultural exchange that we've ever had with your country.
This is a good opportunity for us to learn more about you and about your people and to contribute to the friendship that is building between our two nations.
We admire your great performances, and we believe that this will be one further step toward full normalization of relationships between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America.
And now, I would like to speak personally to a few of you very famous people.
Thank you very much.
