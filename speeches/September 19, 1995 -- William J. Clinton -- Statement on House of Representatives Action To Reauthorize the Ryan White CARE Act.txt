    I congratulate the Members of the House of Representatives on their overwhelming vote to approve a 5-year reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE Act. This legislation will assure that Americans who are living with HIV and AIDS will continue to receive the life-sustaining services that they need. The Ryan White CARE Act is a lifeline to thousands of Americans who otherwise have nowhere to turn. I hope the House and Senate can quickly work out their differences on this legislation and send me a final bill as soon as possible.
