Motorcade now en route at 11:07 am for RON, where we will be tested and quarantining for a few hours.
Before our Singapore arrival, AF2 landed in Tokyo for another refueling stop at 3:23 amlocal time. We took off for the final leg of the flight at 5:06 am.
And in case you missed the in-town pool report from earlier today, VP joined POTUS for the security briefing earlier today from the plane.
There will be another background briefing for pool during our quarantine time. Will send info from it shortly after.

Motorcade made it to the hotel at 11:40 am. We immediately had to get in line for covid testing and are now quarantining for up to 6 hours.
