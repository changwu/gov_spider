    "We were downgraded because of years of reckless spending, not because concerned Americans demanded we get our finances in order"
LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” Today, the Ron Paul 2012 presidential campaign remarked on the blame game being played concerning the downgrading of the U.S. credit rating. See comments from Ron Paul 2012 Campaign Manager John Tate below.
"Since learning of the move by S&P to downgrade America's credit rating for the first time in history, political pundits and TV talking heads have been attempting to place blame on fiscal conservatives, grassroots activists, tea party members, and other Americans who are concerned enough about our unsustainable debt and deficit to speak up.
"This attempt to scapegoat folks who recognize that our debt is out of control and that we must change course should not be tolerated. They are simply demanding that Washington do its job.
"We were downgraded because of years of reckless spending, not because concerned Americans demanded we get our finances in order. The Washington establishment has spent us into near default and now a downgrade, and here they are again trying to escape responsibility for their negligence in handling the economy.
"Ron Paul has been warning about the potential effects of our bad spending and reckless monetary policies for many years. Finally, people have started to take heed. Washington must do the same if we have any hope of righting the ship.
"Ron Paul has pledged that if elected President, he will veto any spending bill that contributes to an unbalanced budget, and he will balance the budget in the first year of his term. He will also fight to strip away useless regulations and further taxes on businesses in the private sector.
"These are authentic solutions that will help people, help our economy, and get this country back on the path to prosperity."
