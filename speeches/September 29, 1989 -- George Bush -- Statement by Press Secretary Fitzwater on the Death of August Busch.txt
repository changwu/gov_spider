    The President and Mrs. Bush are saddened by the death of August Busch today. He had been a legendary figure in American life for almost a century, as a successful businessman, community leader, and philanthropist. In sports, as in other aspects of his career, he was a man who cared deeply about individual spirit and achievement. The President and Mrs. Bush join the citizens of St. Louis and all Americans in extending their sympathies to the Busch family.
