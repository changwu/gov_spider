    NORFOLK, Va. â€“ Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign on Tuesday released a new radio ad featuring director, producer and activist Spike Lee.
"Ninety-nine percent of Americans were hurt by the Great Recession of 2008," Lee says in the spot. "And many are still recovering. And that's why I'm officially endorsing my brother Bernie Sanders. Bernie takes no money from corporations. Nada. Which means he's not on the take! And when Bernie gets into the White House, he will do the right thing!."
"And the months leading up to the election in November will determine which way this country is going to go; forward or backward," Lee told a crowd in February 2008 when he endorsed then-Sen. Barack Obama. "It's up to you to do the right thing."
"How can we be sure?" the director and producer says in the spot supporting Sanders. "Bernie was at the March on Washington with Dr. King. He was arrested in Chicago for protesting segregation in public schools. He fought for wealth and education equality throughout his whole career. No flipping, no flopping."
