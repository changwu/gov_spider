    Economic Program Presentation
Q. Are you going to appear before Congress, Mr. President, in parliamentary-style Q&A?
The President. That hasn't been resolved yet. I'm interested in it, but we haven't finally resolved that.
Q. What would determine it?
The President. We just haven't resolved it yet. We'll probably know by the end of the day.
Q. Is Wednesday night's speech shaping up as the most important of your life?
The President. Well, I don't—[inaudible]. In the sense that every one—the ones that are ahead are more important than the ones that are behind.
I think tonight is important. I think Wednesday night is important. But you know, we're trying to change a direction of 12 years and take a new course. I'm going to offer a program that will create half a million or more jobs in the short run, that is highly progressive, that is very well-balanced, that is faithful to the great middle class of this country and good for the things that we care about, jobs and education and health care. But I think it's going to be very important that I sell it to the Congress and to the American people and that we have a partnership here. So yes, it'll be big.
