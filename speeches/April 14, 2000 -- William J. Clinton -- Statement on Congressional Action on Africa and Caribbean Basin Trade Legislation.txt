    The bipartisan agreement reached by the House and Senate on the Africa and Caribbean Basin trade legislation is a major step toward enactment of these historic initiatives. This bill is a win-win proposition for the United States and our friends in Africa and the Caribbean Basin. It will boost investment, economic growth, and job creation in these countries, while improving the global competitive position of our own textile industry. It will help promote economic reform, reduce poverty, and broaden participation in the benefits of the global economy. I congratulate congressional leaders from both parties who worked hard to reach this agreement. I urge Congress to complete the remaining work on the bill rapidly so that final approval can occur during the first week after its Easter recess.
