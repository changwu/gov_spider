'One of the biggest things to come out of Mueller's testimony was the fact that when he was asked was there ANYTHING that impeded your investigation the answer was a clear unequivocal NO.'

....Robert Mueller's testimony and the Mueller Report itself was a disaster for this illegal Democrat inspired Witch Hunt. It is an embarrassment to the USA that they don't know how to stop. They can't help themselves they are totally lost they are Clowns!Retweets: 17108Favorites: 86926

So sad that Elijah Cummings has been able to do so little for the people of Baltimore. Statistically Baltimore ranks last in almost every major category. Cummings has done nothing but milk Baltimore dry but the public is getting wise to the bad job that he is doing!Retweets: 26211Favorites: 110239

The Democrats are still doing the Russians dirty work as they continue to push the fake crime.

Someone please explain to Nancy Pelosi who was recently called racist by those in her own party that there is nothing wrong with bringing out the very obvious fact that Congressman Elijah Cummings has done a very poor job for his district and the City of Baltimore.

....a look the facts speak far louder than words! The Democrats always play the Race Card when in fact they have done so little for our Nation's great African American people. Now lowest unemployment in U.S. history and only getting better. Elijah Cummings has failed badly!Retweets: 30118Favorites: 147482

Speaking of failing badly has anyone seen what is happening to Nancy Pelosi's district in San Francisco. It is not even recognizeable lately. Something must be done before it is too late. The Dems should stop wasting time on the Witch Hunt Hoax and start focusing on our Country!Retweets: 32962Favorites: 127620

There is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know that Elijah Cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district and of Baltimore itself. Dems always play the race card when they are unable to win with facts. Shame!Retweets: 43224Favorites: 182307

If racist Elijah Cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district and Baltimore itself perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess that he has helped to create over many years of incompetent leadership. His radical 'oversight' is a joke!Retweets: 28009Favorites: 117232

Under the Trump Administration African American unemployment is the lowest (best) in the history of the United States. No President has come close to doing this before!
