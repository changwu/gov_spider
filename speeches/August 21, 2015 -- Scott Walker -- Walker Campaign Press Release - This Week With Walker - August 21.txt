On Tuesday, Governor Walker laid out his plan to fully repeal ObamaCare and replace it with a law that will put patients back in charge of their health care decisions and sends more power back to the states. The "Day One Patient Freedom Plan" received nearly universal praise from conservatives.

      We need to repeal #ObamaCare immediately. Here's my plan for how we replace it: http://t.co/L8tzWuZkab - SW #Walker16

Hillary Clinton let out another barrage of attacks against Walker and his record of conservative reforms. As you already know, Governor Walker is not going to be intimidated by the liberals' attacks and he's not going to back down. When Hillary came after him, Walker was ready to respond:

      Our southern border isn't secure, just like @HillaryClinton's email server. -SW #Walker16

      We should be enforcing the laws on the books, not rewarding illegal activity like @HillaryClinton wants to do. – SW #Walker16
