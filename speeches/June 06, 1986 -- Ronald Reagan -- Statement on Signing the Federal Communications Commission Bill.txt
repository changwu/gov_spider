    I have today signed S. 2179, which reduces the terms of office of members of the Federal Communications Commission from 7 to 5 years and adjusts the expiration dates of two terms to ensure that a term expires in 1989 and 1990. To accomplish this purpose, this legislation extends the term of office that would have expired on June 30, 1987, to June 30, 1989.
