    This is to convey, on behalf of the people of the United States, my support for the principles for which UNICEF stands.
The very important participation and active support of the members of UNICEF is of particular interest to me in that your organization is dedicated to the basic human fight of all people to be free of poverty and hunger and disease. The special emphasis you place on meeting the human needs of children, the future leaders of the world, makes your efforts even that much more essential to the goal of seeking human freedom and dignity for all mankind.
