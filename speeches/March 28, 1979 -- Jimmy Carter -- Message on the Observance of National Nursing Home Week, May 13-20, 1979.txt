    The conscientious, considerate care provided in American nursing homes is essential to the well-being of a large number of our valued older citizens. Over the years we have come to realize more fully just how important the excellence of nursing home care is to us and to our families.
The state of nursing homes today is a far cry from the situation that existed in the early part of this century. Many health professionals in nursing homes today are educated in the theory and practice of geriatrics. They are better able to meet the medical, social and emotional needs of their patients. By their resourcefulness and dedication these individuals are helping to relieve the burdens of families across this land.
I therefore welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to the unselfish individuals who provide service for those in nursing homes. New research and technology have helped to improve the quality and longevity of life; and thanks to these devoted professionals, America's nursing homes are meeting the challenge of maintaining the highest standards of patient care. I ask all Americans to join in the spirit of this observance.
