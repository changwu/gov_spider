    "I think it's very alarming for the President of the United States to suggest to Russia that he has a different agenda that he's going to work out with the Russians after the elections. This is a comment about his perspective on missile defense and a recognition that what he wants to do and what the American people would accept might be very different things and therefore he is going to wait until after the elections to do it. I find that a very troubling revelation." â€” Mitt Romney
