    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Sen. Wicker, R-MS, and 39 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports S. 109, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2019. The legislation would prohibit any funds authorized or appropriated by Federal law from being expended for any abortion, or for direct payments to insurers for health benefits coverage that includes coverage for abortions. In addition, the legislation would prohibit the purchase of abortion coverage with matching funds from federally subsidized programs, including Federal and State Medicaid funds. The legislation would not affect the treatment of any complication caused or worsened by an abortion, or the treatment of abortions in the case of rape, incest, or preserving the life of the mother. This bill would continue to prohibit the Federal Government from paying for affected procedures with the taxes of Americans and thereby protect the conscience rights of taxpayers who find abortion morally or religiously objectionable.
If S. 109 were presented to the President in its current form, he would sign the bill.
