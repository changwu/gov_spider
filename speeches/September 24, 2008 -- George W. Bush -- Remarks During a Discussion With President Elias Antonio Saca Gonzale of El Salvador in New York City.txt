    President Bush. Mr. President, thank you.
I want to let my friend know, and the people of El Salvador, that the United States will extend TPS status to El Salvadorans living in our country. This is a decision that was made to improve the lives of El Salvadorans.
I'm proud to make this announcement with you standing by my side. You've been a very strong and courageous leader, and you have been a friend. And I know this is an issue of concern to you because you care deeply about the people of your country. And so when you get back home, you can tell the people that TPS has been extended.
Thank you, sir.
