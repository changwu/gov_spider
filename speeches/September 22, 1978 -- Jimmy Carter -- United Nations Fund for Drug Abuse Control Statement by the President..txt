    For over 70 years, the United States of America has supported international measures to control drug abuse. Today, it is more important than ever to continue this support.
This administration recognizes that drug problems cannot be solved unilaterally but require concerted action by the world community. Drug abuse is exacting an ever greater toll on the citizens of developed and developing countries. It affects our economies, our societies, and, most of all, our culture.
The United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control has played a central role in this international effort. Despite limited funds it has been remarkably effective in finding cooperative ways for nations to work together on this international problem. Today I am pleased to announce that the United States will contribute $3 million to the Fund in 1978.
With the contribution, I want to extend my best wishes to Dr. Bror Rexed, the new Executive Director of the Fund.
The United States remains deeply committed to the cause of international drug control. We will continue to support the efforts of the Fund, the United Nations, and other governments.
