In-town pool report #2: Biden & TN state reps
Per White House:
This afternoon, the President spoke via conference call with State Representatives Justin Jones, Justin Pearson, and Gloria Johnson â€“ the three officials subjected to expulsion votes in the Tennessee statehouse yesterday for peacefully protesting in support of stronger gun safety laws following the recent shooting at Covenant School in Nashville. The President thanked them for their leadership in seeking to ban assault weapons and standing up for our democratic values. The officials thanked the President for his leadership on gun safety and for spotlighting the undemocratic and unprecedented attacks on them this week in the Tennessee statehouse. The President invited the three leaders to the White House in the near future.
