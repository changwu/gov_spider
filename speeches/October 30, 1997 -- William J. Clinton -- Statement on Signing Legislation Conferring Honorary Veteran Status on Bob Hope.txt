    Today I signed into law H.J. Res. 75, which confers upon Bob Hope the status of honorary veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces and extends to him the gratitude of the American people for his lifetime of accomplishments and service on behalf of our men and women in uniform.
Bob Hope is a great American whose life has defined patriotism and service. In times of war and peace, good times and bad, he entertained our troops and brought to them a familiar and comforting sense of home while they defended our nation's interests around the world. Bob Hope richly deserves this unique honor, and I am proud to be able to sign this measure into law.
