    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement today following Republican presidential candidates Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney's comments on the Bush doctrine of a "Global War on Terror."
"George Bush has made America less safe and less respected in the world. The Republican candidates are now trying to double down on his failed foreign policy.
They just don't get it. George Bush's strategy is a failure - the threat of terrorism has increased. We don't need more political huffing and puffing, we need a smart strategy that uses American power to stop terrorists from hurting us and to stop people from becoming terrorists in the first place.
That's why I laid out a comprehensive plan to build a strong military focused on protecting Americans and to use all the tools available to us to defeat terror groups and restore our moral leadership."
