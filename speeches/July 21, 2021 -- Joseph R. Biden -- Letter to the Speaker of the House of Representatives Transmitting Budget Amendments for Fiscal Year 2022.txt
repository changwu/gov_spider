    Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:) 
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 Budget amendments for the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor, and State, and for the District of Columbia and the United States Agency for International Development. These amendments are necessary to correctly reflect policies assumed in my FY 2022 Budget. The net discretionary budget authority in my FY 2022 Budget would increase by $5 million as a result of these technical corrections.
The details of these amendments are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
