    Losing ground in the polls, Senator Barack Obama announced over the weekend that he intends to abandon the politics of hope and attack Hillary in tonight's debate.
While her rivals hurl negative attacks, Hillary will continue to demonstrate her deep understanding of the issues and outline her positive vision for America.
Despite repeated attacks from Obama and John Edwards, Hillary enters tonight's debate in a position of strength. A Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg poll out last week shows her leading the primary by 31 points, and beating all of the Republicans in head-to-head general election matchups. And a recent CBS News poll showed Hillary surging to a 28-point lead.
In Philadelphia tonight, Hillary will make the case that she has the strength and experience to deliver the change America needs.
On Iraq, Hillary will talk about her three-step plan to get our troops home in the smartest, safest way we can. She'll make it crystal clear that if George Bush won't end this war before he leaves office, as President, she will.
On Iran, she will make clear that we need to prevent President Bush's rush to war while engaging in aggressive diplomacy to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. Hillary was among the very first Senators to speak out and make clear that George Bush does not have the authority to go to war in Iran, and is a co-sponsor of legislation to prevent him from doing so.
At home she'll detail her plan to offer quality, affordable health care to every American, move the nation toward energy independence and rebuild the road to the Middle Class.
Tonight, Americans will be reminded why poll after poll show that voters believe Hillary has the best combination of strength and experience to be President.
