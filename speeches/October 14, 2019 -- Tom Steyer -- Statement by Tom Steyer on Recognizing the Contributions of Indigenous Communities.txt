    (SAN FRANCISCO, October 14, 2019) â€” Candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Tom Steyer released the following statement recognizing Indigenous People's Day:
"The misleading legacy of Christopher Columbus fails to recognize the extreme brutality and suffering reflected in the stories of Indigenous people. We must acknowledge that the process through which our great nation was born was terribly taxing on the original Americans, particularly Indigenous women who today carry the burden of being disproportionate victims of disease and violence.
When I think about the ways my administration will unify and shape the future of our nation, I know it will be in a manner that celebrates the rich history of Indigenous communities, while atoning for these past atrocities and bolstering policies that will advance and protect the wellbeing of the Indigenous in our country.
Today, I honor the memory of our nation's first inhabitants and stand in solidarity with my Indigenous brothers and sisters, and honor their resistance to reclaim their rightful place in history."
