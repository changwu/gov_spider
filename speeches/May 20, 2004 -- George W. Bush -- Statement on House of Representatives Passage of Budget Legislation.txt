    I commend the House of Representatives for passing a responsible budget that meets our Nation's highest priorities of winning the war on terror, protecting the homeland, and helping our economy continue to create new jobs. This budget keeps tax relief flowing to married couples, families with children, and working people, while restraining overall spending and allowing the deficit to be cut in half in the next 5 years. I urge the Senate to follow the House's lead and pass this budget so that we can continue making progress on our shared agenda of building a safer, stronger, and better America.
