    Congress Is Ignoring The Recommendations Of Our Military Commanders By Withholding Funding For Troops In The Field



"We have nearly 200,000 troops in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan and they are relying on this Congress to send them the funding they need to complete their mission. We also have about 100,000 civilian workers at bases across the country who will be receiving furlough notices if Congress continues to delay action. Before leaving for another holiday break, Congress should stop ducking the issue of funding our troops and send the President a clean bill he can sign No matter how some leaders here in Washington, D.C. feel about the war, our troops deserve their full support."
â€“White House Press Secretary Dana Perino, 11/29/07
