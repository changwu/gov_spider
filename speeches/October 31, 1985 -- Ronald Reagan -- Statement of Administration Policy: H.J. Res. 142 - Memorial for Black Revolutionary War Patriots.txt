    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Reps. Johnson (R) Connecticut and 38 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.J. Res. 142, but will seek changes in the Senate to allow the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, to select an appropriate site for the memorial, rather than require that it be located in Constitution Gardens.
