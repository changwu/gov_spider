    Warmest greetings to everyone celebrating Rosh Hashana.
Throughout the centuries, the shofar has sounded on this day to herald the beginning of the High Holy Days and the start of a new year. It is a time for both joy and reflectionâ€” joy in the promise of another year in which to live and work, reflection on how to grow closer to God and family. It is also an opportunity to look back on our failures and shortcomings during the past year; not to dwell on them with bitterness and regret, but to learn from our mistakes so that the new year will be sweetened by the gifts of wisdom and hope.
As Jews across America and around the world gather to reaffirm their faith in God and their love of family and community, Hillary and I extend best wishes that the coming year will be blessed with great abundance, true peace, and lasting joy.
