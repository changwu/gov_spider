    Dear Madam Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed Fiscal Year (FY) 2011 Budget amendments for the Department of the Interior. Overall, the discretionary budget authority proposed in my FY 2011 Budget would not be increased by these requests.
These amendments are necessary to strengthen oversight of offshore oil and gas operations, address deficiencies in mineral revenue collection, and facilitate the reorganization of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement--formerly known as the Minerals Management Service.
The details of these requests are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,

BARACK OBAMA
