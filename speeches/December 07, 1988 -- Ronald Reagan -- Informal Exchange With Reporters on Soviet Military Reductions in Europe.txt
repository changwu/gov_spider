    Q. So, Mr. President, what do you think of the General Secretary's proposal for troop draw-down in Europe?
President Reagan. Well, that wasn't a proposal. That was a decision that has been made.
Q. And what do you think of that decision, sir?
President Reagan. Naturally, I heartily approve.
Q. Are you going to do the same thing in—
Europe for our forces?
President Reagan. Well, there are going to continue to be conversations between us on that matter. But, certainly, I think that we certainly would adjust it if it would turn out that this left us with a superiority—and we don't seek such a thing.
Q. And, Mr. Vice President, your reaction to the decision.
The Vice President. I support what the President says. [Laughter]
Q. That's safe. That's mighty safe.
The Vice President. Give me a ring on the 21st. [Laughter]
President Gorbachev. One of the best answers of the year. [Laughter]
