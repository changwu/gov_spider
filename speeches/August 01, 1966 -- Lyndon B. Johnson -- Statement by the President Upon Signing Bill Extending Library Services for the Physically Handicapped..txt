    FOR 35 YEARS, the Library of Congress has provided books in braille and on recorded discs to the blind. Fifty-four State agencies for the blind and 32 major libraries cooperate with the Federal Government in this program, which serves nearly a half million blind Americans.
Until recently, however, nearly 1,600,000 other physically handicapped persons have been without library services: older citizens who are bedridden or too weak to read; children and adults who are not legally blind, but whose vision is so limited that normal print is blurred.
Now we have been given an opportunity to correct this deficiency in our program-as simple justice requires.
I have signed into law S. 3093, a bill sponsored by Senator Jordan of North Carolina, which amends existing statutes to make it possible to serve this forgotten legion of handicapped Americans.
I am happy to sign this bill. I consider it not only an act of humane concern for our fellow citizens, but a major contribution to our Nation's educational development.
