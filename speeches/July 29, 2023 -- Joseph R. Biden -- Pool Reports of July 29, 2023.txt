Travel pool report #1 - holding
Good afternoon from sweltering Rehoboth Beach. This Saturday marks the first full day of the president's vacation here in Delaware. The pool has gathered, been swept and is holding in the press van. There are no scheduled events today, and we do not have a reportable movement for the president yet.
Please feel free to reach out with questions, comments, concerns, restaurant recommendations.

Travel pool report #3 - church
We arrived at St. Edmond Roman Catholic Church at 4:04 p.m. after an uneventful, short ride. The pool rushed toward the front of the church, but by the time we got there, the president was already inside. We heard cheers and could see churchgoers entering as we approached. We're now holding outside, where it's a toasty 93 degrees with a slight beach breeze.

Travel pool report #4 - questions and lid
The president walked out of the church at 4:54 p.m. to cheers from a crowd that had gathered. He verbally answered one of three questions.
Asked if he talked to Senate GOP Mitch McConnell since his health scare: "I have spoken to McConnell."
Asked how McConnell is doing: He gave a thumbs up.
As he got into the Beast, he didn't answer a question about if McConnell is fit to serve.
He was with his grandson, Hunter.
We were rolling at 4:56 p.m., and at 5:01 p.m. Biden's car pulled off onto his street.
We have a lid at 5:03 p.m.
Special thanks to WSJ's Ken Thomas, WHCA pooler.
