    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Pinal County (Ariz.) Sheriff Paul Babeu. Babeu will serve as a Co-Chair of the Arizona campaign.
"It is an honor to have the support of Sheriff Babeu," said Mitt Romney. "His efforts working to protect our border are critical to lowering crime, reducing illegal immigration, and stopping both drug and human trafficking. Sheriff Babeu has been a leader in the call for the federal government to secure the border. As President, I will work with leaders like Sheriff Babeu to protect our Southern border, provide the required assistance from the federal government, and put an end to the magnets that cause illegal immigration."
Announcing his support, Sheriff Babeu said, "Securing our border is an important part of our national security â€“ Mitt Romney understands this.
