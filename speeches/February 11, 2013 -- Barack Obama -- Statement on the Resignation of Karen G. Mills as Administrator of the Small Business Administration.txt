    I want to thank Administrator Mills for her outstanding work on behalf of America's small-business owners and entrepreneurs. I asked Karen to lead the Small Business Administration because I knew she had the skills and experience to help America's small businesses recover from the worst economic crisis in generations, and that's exactly what she's done. Over the last 4 years, Karen has made it easier for small businesses to interact with the Federal Government by reducing paperwork and cutting through redtape. She has played a leading role in my administration's efforts to support startups and entrepreneurs. And she was instrumental in the passage of the Small Business Jobs Act. Because of Karen's hard work and dedication, our small businesses are better positioned to create jobs and our entire economy is stronger. I want to thank Karen and am grateful for her service.
