New York, New York – December 20, 2019 – Mike Bloomberg 2020 announced today an experienced, robust field operation in more than 20 states across the country.
The initial team of more than 170 staff embedded in states, supported by the headquarters team, will engage voters across the country while focusing on the delegate-rich March primary contests and beyond.
"As he did at his company and in government, Mike Bloomberg excels at bringing together the best teams to challenge convention and innovate," said Kevin Sheekey, Campaign Manager for Mike Bloomberg 2020. "The impressive team we've built across the country will help us connect with voters and make Mike's case against President Trump everywhere."
"We'll be competing with teams on the ground in more states at once than any campaign in history," said Dan Kanninen, States Director for Mike Bloomberg 2020. "Our seasoned team has deep ties in all corners of states throughout the country."
In keeping with Bloomberg's commitment to defeating President Trump, the former New York City Mayor has pledged to keep staff in key states through the 2020 General Election to support the Democratic Party.
