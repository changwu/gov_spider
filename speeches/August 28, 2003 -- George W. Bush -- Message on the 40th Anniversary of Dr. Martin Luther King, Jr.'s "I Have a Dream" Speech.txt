    I send greetings to those gathered to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s historic "I Have a Dream" speech.
Through his leadership, courage, and determination, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. brought tremendous good to our country. His vision and words caused Americans to examine their hearts and live up to the ideals of our Constitution.
In his speech 40 years ago, Dr. King expressed his dream that people would be judged by the content of their character and not by the color of their skin. He viewed the summer of 1963 as a time for America to renew its commitment to equality. Today, we have come a long way, but there is still work to do to realize Dr. King's dream. As we honor this important anniversary, I encourage all Americans to continue the march to equality and opportunity for all.
Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a memorable celebration.
GEORGE W. BUSH
