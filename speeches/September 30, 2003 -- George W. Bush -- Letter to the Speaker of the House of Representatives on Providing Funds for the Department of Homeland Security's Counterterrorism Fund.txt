    Dear Mr. Speaker:
In accordance with provisions of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 (Public Law 106-554), and the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003 (Public Law 108-7), I hereby request and make available $38,100,000 for the Department of Homeland Security's Counterterrorism Fund. Of these funds, I hereby designate $28,748,918 as an emergency requirement pursuant to Public Law 106-554.
These funds would allow the Department of Homeland Security to continue to improve the security at our Nation's ports by deploying radiation monitoring devices nationwide and strengthening the system that is used to identify potential threats posed by international cargo shipments and international passengers.
The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
