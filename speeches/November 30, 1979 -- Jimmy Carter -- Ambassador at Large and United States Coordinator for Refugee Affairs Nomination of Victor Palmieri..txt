    The President has asked me to say on his behalf that he intends to nominate Victor Palmieri as Ambassador at Large, with special responsibilities for coordinating refugee affairs. Mr. Palmieri is one of the best managers in this country. He has made his reputation by solving large-scale, complicated problems in major organizational situations.
The President has selected him for this very important post, because the job of saving literally hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of people, requires the best managerial skills that this Nation has to offer. Mr. Palmieri will have the President's full support in mobilizing every available resource of the Government and the private sector. Mr. Palmieri will be working closely with the First Lady, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Defense in carrying out the duties and responsibilities of this office.
