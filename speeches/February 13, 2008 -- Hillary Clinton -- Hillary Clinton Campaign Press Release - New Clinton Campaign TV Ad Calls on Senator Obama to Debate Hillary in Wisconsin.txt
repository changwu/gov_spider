    MADISON, WI â€“ Today, Wisconsin for Hillary launched a new 30-second television ad entitled "Debate" asking Sen. Obama why he has not agreed to debate in Wisconsin.
With serious challenges facing the next president of the United States, Wisconsin voters deserve to hear both candidates debate the issues that matter. Hillary Clinton has accepted an invitation to debate at Marquette University in advance of Tuesday's primary, and is prepared to show she has real solutions for the problems facing residents of the Badger State.
Hillary is the only candidate with a plan to end the housing crisis and help people keep their homes. Hillary's plan takes bold action to stem the tide of foreclosures with a 90-day moratorium on foreclosures and a five year freeze on interest rates for subprime mortgages.
Hillary is also the only candidate with a health care plan that covers every American. Her plan allows for maximum flexibility while making sure health care costs are affordable for working families. Hillary hears the voices of Americans concerned about their future and is focused on providing solutions to the problems they face.

"DEBATE"
TV: 30
ANNCR: Both Democratic candidates have been invited to a televised Wisconsin debate.
Hillary Clinton has said yes.
Barack Obama hasn't.
Maybe he'd prefer to give speeches than have to answer questions.
Like why Hillary Clinton has the only health care plan that covers every American, and the only economic plan that freezes foreclosures.
Wisconsin deserves to hear BOTH candidates debate the issues that matter.
And that's...not debatable.
