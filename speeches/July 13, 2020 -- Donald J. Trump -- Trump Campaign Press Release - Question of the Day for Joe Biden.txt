    Your history of plagiarism includes incidents in law school, stolen speech passages from a British politician, thievery of President Trump's "America First" policies, and now word-for-word lifting of Bernie Sanders' agenda items.
Are there any other cases of plagiarism you would like to confess to now, before they become public?
