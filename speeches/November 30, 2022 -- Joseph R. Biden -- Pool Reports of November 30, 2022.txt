WH Pool 4: POTUS wrapped at 12:12
Motorcade moved at 12:17 for the 1:16 second drive— north on 18th, east on E and then into the WH grounds, north west exec. (There's some big party or something on the South Lawn tomorrow.)
Back at the event, there was a least one "four more years" chant, several applause interruptions and some scattered — but enthusiastic — ululating.

WH Pool 9: Pool has arrived at the Ellipse for 530 lighting
We approached by foot from the North and are staged for the arrival of the First and Second Families and the Interior Secretary.
Pool is enjoying the choir, their unique renditions of some classic carols and the soft advertising for the National Park Service. There's a Santa on stage.
Ten knot wind and fading light, hitting the low scattered clouds. French landscape sunset, but am told it will get darker for the tree lighting.
But you can watch that live.

WH Pool 12: Pool is staging in vans, destination unknown
We are back on the South driveway, with POTUS looking like he will head out for the evening.
Pool did not see POTUS depart from the Ellipse at the end of the Christmas tree program.
Reception was bad at previous event, so apologies if there were any delays.

WH Pool 13: Dinner with the Macrons at Fiola Mare
President and First Lady Biden are dining with President Macron and his wife, Brigitte at Fiola Mare, on the Georgetown water front —
a not inexpensive Italian seafood restaurant that saw its share of expensed lunches (and drinks) during the pandemic, when the town moved out from its core.
Pool departed WH at 7:42 and arrived at 7:52.
We did not see POTUS enter but will likely see him depart, for anyone wondering about photos.
Yes, Pool will ask what everyone ate and if they ordered on — or off — menu.



November 30, 202222:07

WH Pool 14: Dinner over. No news
First the wives emerged, chatting, patting, holding forth like old friends as they walked out of the restaurant and down the stairs to their cars.
Then came the presidents at about 9:54. Macron placing his left hand on Biden's left shoulder as they ambled down the stairs, then talking animatedly with his hands, making a Gallic point that will be lost to history.
Shouted questions by your pooler — "Did you make up on subsidies? Did you resolve any differences?" went unanswered. Unclear if they were even heard at 30 feet.
Motorcade now knifing through DC. Back at White House at 10:04.



November 30, 202222:11

WH Pool 15: lid
Good night.
