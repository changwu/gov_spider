    Today, chair of the Northwest Des Moines Democrats Vanessa Phelan announced her endorsement of Senator Kamala Harris. This is the second endorsement from a Democratic chair in as many days. Phelan's endorsement comes after she met and spoke with Harris at her Des Moines Town Hall on Wednesday evening.
"As a mother, I need a candidate who will fight for the future. As an activist, I need a candidate who inspires more people to fight today. I need a fearless boundary-breaker, a daughter of immigrants, an accomplished professional who bends the system until it works for the people," said Phelan.
"I need a candidate who leads with the truth, who uproots injustice, who wakes up at 3 am thinking about our most vulnerable. The candidate I need is Senator Kamala Harris," she concluded.
Yesterday, West Des Moines chair Victor Dutchuk endorsed Harris after hosting her at the annual West Des Moines Democrat picnic. Today's endorsement comes at the conclusion of Harris' three-day swing across Iowa, where she has had the opportunity to hear directly from Iowans about the issues that keep them up at night. At events during her swing, Harris has been discussing her "3AM Agenda" to find solutions for these issues and her plans to take action to make their lives better.
