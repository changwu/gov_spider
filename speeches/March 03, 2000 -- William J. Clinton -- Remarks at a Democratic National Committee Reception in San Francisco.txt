    Thank you. I want toâ€”you're looking here at a medical miracle. I got up this morning at 3 o'clock in the morning your time, and I'm still going. [Laughter] I'm glad to be back with Susie and Mark, and I'm glad to be here with all of you.
The major thing I would like to do tonight is have a chance to visit with you, so I think I'll forgo the speech and come around and just visit, and we'll all talk about whatever you'd like to talk about.
And Mayor Rendell, thank you for being here. Let me say, I've had a great night tonight. I made two appearances for Senator Feinstein and the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, and we had very good crowds, and we talked a lot about what's going on in America today. So maybe we can have some visits about it, and I look forward to it. Thank you very much for coming.
And give us some more music. I love that.
Thank you.
