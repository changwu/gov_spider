Boston, MA â€“ Today, Marlene Elwell, noted pro-life leader and Founder and President of Catholics in the Public Square, endorsed Governor Mitt Romney for President. Marlene was also at the helm of the successful "Marriage Protection Amendment" campaign in Michigan in 2004 that preserves marriage in the Michigan Constitution as between one man and one woman.
"I am proud to support Governor Romney in this campaign," said Marlene Elwell. "He grew up here in Michigan and shares our values. He will continue to advocate policies to promote stronger families and stand up for traditional marriage and the defense of life at every opportunity as our nation's President. Governor Romney's proven record and optimistic vision for the future of Michigan and our country will strengthen our nation for future generations."
A recent mail piece by Senator John McCain promoting his pro-life certification from "Pro-Life Federation of Michigan" prompted Marlene to announce her support of Governor Romney. Marlene continued, "There is one voice that for decades has stood for the pro-life community and that is National Right to Life and in Michigan, its affiliate, Right to Life of Michigan. Senator McCain's mailing threatens the integrity of one of the most consistent and conscientious guardians of life in the nation."
Marlene Elwell, who helped write and lead the fight for adoption of the pro-life plank in the national GOP party platform, is available for additional comments on this matter at (248) 477-5106.
