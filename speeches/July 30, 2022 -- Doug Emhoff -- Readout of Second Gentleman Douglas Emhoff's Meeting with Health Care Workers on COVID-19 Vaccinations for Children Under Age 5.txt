    Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff and Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy hosted a roundtable with health care workers at the Neighborhood Health at Richmond Highway Clinic to discuss the importance of vaccinating children under the age of 5 and hear about the clinic's vaccine education and outreach efforts. During the roundtable, the Second Gentleman and Surgeon General spoke about combatting health misinformation, including about COVID vaccines, and actions the Biden-Harris Administration is taking to address mental health and worker burnout. At the site, the Second Gentleman and Surgeon General also met with families of children who were recently vaccinated. The Biden-Harris Administration secured millions of doses of the COVID-19 vaccine for young children and has ensured that 85% of children under the age of 5 live within 5 miles of a potential vaccination site. The Second Gentleman has visited 22 vaccination clinics in communities across the United States. Families can learn more about vaccinations at vaccines.gov.
