PAUL RYAN: "This is not just who's going to be president for the next four years. This is what kind of country do we want to have? What kind of people do we want to be? If we want to be free, if we want to be Americans this is a defining moment. So here is the commitment that Mitt and I are making to you, our fellow citizens. We will not duck the tough issues. We will not kick the can down the road. We will lead. We will not blame others for four years; we will take responsibility and fix this country's problems. And we will not try to replace our country's founding principles. We will not try to transform America into something it was never intended to be. We will reapply our founding principles."
