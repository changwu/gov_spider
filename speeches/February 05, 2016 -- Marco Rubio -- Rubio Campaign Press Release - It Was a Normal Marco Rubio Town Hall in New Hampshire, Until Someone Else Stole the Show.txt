Marco's town hall in Salem, NH, was a pretty typical opportunity to talk to First In The Nation primary voters, until someone else stole the show.

His 8-year-old son Dominick, who has been attending events with his dad, decided he wanted to join Marco on stage.

Dominick isn't old enough to vote for his dad this time around, but he would sure be proud to see him in the White House!
