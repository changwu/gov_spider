    I welcome the conclusion of the bilateral negotiations between China and the European Union on China's accession to the WTO. This agreement highlights the importance of congressional passage of permanent normal trade relations with China.
It is now clearer than ever that China will join the World Trade Organization. For America to reap the broad benefits of China's historic decision to open its markets and to strengthen the forces of positive change in China, Congress must enact PNTR. A vote against PNTR will cost America exports and jobs, cede this massive new market to our competitors in Europe and Japan, and embolden those resisting reform in China.
