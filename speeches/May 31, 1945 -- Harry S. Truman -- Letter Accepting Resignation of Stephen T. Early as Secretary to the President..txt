    Dear Steve:
I am very loath to see June first come around because, as you state in your very kind letter of the twenty-eighth, it means that you are definitely leaving your official post at the White House.
You know that it is no mere politeness for me to say that I hate to see you go. During these recent difficult weeks you have been such a help to me in getting acclimated to my new duties and responsibilities that I shall miss you very much--officially as well as personally. You have given me the benefit not only of your long experience in the White House, but of your innate wisdom and sound judgment; and I am sure that, without you, my task would have been much more difficult.
The quality and quantity of your work during the past twelve years are well known to all of us who have been in Washington. I know from the lips of President Roosevelt how much you meant to him, and how much he relied upon you. And I now know from personal experience how greatly your assistance, cooperation and association can lighten the burdens of high office.
I have been willing to let you go-but not without strings. You are to be subject to frequent calls to help me in many ways. You have been most gracious in offering whatever future help you can render; and I assure you that I shall take advantage of that offer to the fullest.
My best wishes go with you in your new venture and in anything you undertake.
Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
