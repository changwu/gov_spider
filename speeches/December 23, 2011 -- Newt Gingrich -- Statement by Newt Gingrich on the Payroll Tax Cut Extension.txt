    Washington Fails, Bails on Leadership
Columbia, SC - GOP candidate Newt Gingrich called the two-month payroll cut extension a complete failure in leadership by both the president and the Congress.
"We need a long-term plan for jobs and economic growth, not short two-month Band-Aids.Â  We must move now to cut taxes, reduce regulations, fully utilize America's energy resources and take steps to stabilize the value of the dollar," said Gingrich.
