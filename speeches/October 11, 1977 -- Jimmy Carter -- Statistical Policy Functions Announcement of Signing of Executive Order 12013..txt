    The President has signed an Executive order transferring certain statistical policy functions previously centered in the Office of Management and Budget to the Commerce Department. The order implements a section of the Reorganization Plan for the Executive Office of the President.
Functions transferred as a result of the Executive order include:
--authority to develop programs and issue regulations for the gathering of statistics by Government agencies;
--authority to determine, with the approval of the Secretary of State, what statistical information to provide in response to requests from international organizations;
--functions relating to study of international investment statistics and access to information collected under the Investment Survey Act of 1976.
The Executive order also establishes the Statistical Policy Coordination Committee, headed by the Secretary of Commerce. It will advise the President on development and coordination of statistical services.
OMB will retain a general oversight role in statistical collection through its responsibilities for reviewing collection and use of statistical information under the Federal Reports Act. In other words, the Executive order assigns to the Commerce Department primary responsibility for interagency coordination of statistical policy programs but retains in OMB sufficient authority to resolve any differences between agencies which cannot be handled by Commerce.
