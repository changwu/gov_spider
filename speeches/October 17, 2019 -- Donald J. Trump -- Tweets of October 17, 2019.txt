Nancy Pelosi needs help fast! There is either something wrong with her 'upstairs' or she just plain doesn't like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her she is a very sick person!Retweets: 48667Favorites: 191097

Hope all House Republicans and honest House Democrats will vote to CENSURE Rep. Adam Schiff tomorrow for his brazen and unlawful act of fabricating (making up) a totally phony conversation with the Ukraine President and U.S. President me.
