    Yemen's Houthis have responded to efforts by the United Nations to reinvigorate a political process in Yemen by threatening to conduct more reckless missile attacks, like those they conducted on Sunday. These actions call into question the Houthis' commitment to a peace process. These attacks again demonstrate that Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is continuing to disrupt a nascent political process, escalate hostilities, and destabilize the region by proliferating weapons to the Houthis and others. The United States will remain steadfast in helping our partners defend themselves, providing desperately needed humanitarian assistance, and supporting an inclusive United Nations process to help resolve the conflict and bring peace and security to the region.
