    Jim Shinn is a first generation American and volunteer for Newt 2012 in Atlanta. At his blog, he writes about calling Iowans from our Atlanta headquarters Wednesday.
Yesterday was a kickoff for Newt's campaign to reach out to Iowa voters in order to listen to their thoughts and concerns about the upcoming election. Not a call for money. Nor to convince them how to vote. Just genuine concern for their issues, if they've been spoken about or haven't and what they personally think.
Some came from across town and some from as far away as North Carolina. All were volunteers, most all first timers. Yet when I spoke to each, the common themes I heard were how this guy, Newt, is the smartest man in the room wherever he goes and that is what we need for America today. That he had done it before and can do it again.
A small group of +35 people consisting of a high school student, some employed & some unemployed, small business owners, moms & wifes, as well as lifelong staffers and family members. I would add for me personally that his Historical & Philosophical perspectives, which he bases his solutions upon, are unmatched by any of his declared or undeclared rivals. Especially so versus our Community Event planner who is always on holiday.
The energy in the room was unlike any I've felt before. Even before Newt arrived. Similar to a religious meeting, yet in quite a different way but just as strong. Almost like being at a championship college basketball or football game. People were pumped, they were happy to be there, they were ready to work with Newt.
The phone calling was non-stop. I did not see anyone take a break until Newt arrived. Everyone was on a phone having a great time speaking with people in Iowa. Quite a few lively discussions but always positive. No, not everyone supported Newt but all were impressed that his volunteers were calling to listen to them and their issues.
