    "Rosen is wrong on so many levels. Stay-at-home moms hold the purse strings for the family. Statistically, they are better qualified to give economic advice then Obama's advisors. Talk about energy policy, these women see the effects every day of desperately trying to manage paying almost four dollars a gallon for gas at the pump. They make tough choices to live within their families' budget every month, something this administration is clearly unable to do." — Penny Nance, Concerned Women For America CEO

CWA Responds to Rosen's Ann Romney Comment
Washington, D.C. — Democrat strategist and DNC advisor Hilary Rosen says that Ann Romney, who raised five boys, "never worked a day in her life." Penny Nance, President and CEO of Concerned Women for America, the nation's largest public policy women's organization, says in the brief statement below that raising kids is the hardest and most important work in the world:
"Rosen is wrong on so many levels. Stay-at-home moms hold the purse strings for the family. Statistically, they are better qualified to give economic advice then Obama's advisors. Talk about energy policy, these women see the effects every day of desperately trying to manage paying almost four dollars a gallon for gas at the pump. They make tough choices to live within their families' budget every month, something this administration is clearly unable to do. Stay-at-home moms are also experts in the areas of education, nutrition, and a host of other issues. Rosen's remarks expose a deeper problem with the values of this administration and even sometimes society at large. We say raising kids is the hardest and most important work in the world. How does this administration not get how important stay-at-home moms are to our nation? Haven't they heard the saying, 'The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world'? And in this case, it swings elections."
