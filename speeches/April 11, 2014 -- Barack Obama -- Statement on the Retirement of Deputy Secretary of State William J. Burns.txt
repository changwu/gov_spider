    Since I met Bill in Moscow in 2005, I have admired his skill and precision. Since I took office, I have relied on him for candid advice and sensitive diplomatic missions. He has been a skilled adviser, consummate diplomat, and inspiration to generations of public servants. Given his vital role on our leading priorities, earlier this year, I asked him to delay his retirement, and I'm grateful to him and Lisa for doing so. The country is stronger for Bill's service.
