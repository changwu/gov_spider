    As Commander-in-Chief of our Armed Forces, it is an honor to join all those celebrating the 70th birthday of the United States Air Force.
For seven decades, the brave men and women of the United States Air Force have defended our Nation through unmatched courage and airpower that is second-to-none. This year, as we celebrate this impressive milestone, we also mark the centennial anniversary of America's entry into World War I and the beginning of our fixed-wing air combat.
During World War I, the Aviation Section of the U.S. Army Signal Corps served as an early predecessor of our modern Air Force. On the war's Western Front, daring American aviators flew dangerous reconnaissance missions, engaged in first-of-their-kind "dogfights" against enemy planes, and shot down heavily defended observation balloons. Our Nation owes an eternal debt of gratitude to these early American heroes of the sky and the dedicated men and women of the United States Air Force who continue to uphold an honored legacy of service and sacrifice.
I proudly salute the service members, veterans, and military families of the United States Air Force, who each day live up to their motto "Aim High . . . Fly-Fight-Win." Thanks to their selfless actions, America remains a beacon of liberty and hope around the world. May God bless each of you, and may He continue to bless the United States of America.
