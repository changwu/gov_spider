My meeting in Argentina with President Xi of China was an extraordinary one. Relations with China have taken a BIG leap forward! Very good things will happen. We are dealing from great strength but China likewise has much to gain if and when a deal is completed. Level the field!Retweets: 16456Favorites: 73335

President Xi and I have a very strong and personal relationship. He and I are the only two people that can bring about massive and very positive change on trade and far beyond between our two great Nations. A solution for North Korea is a great thing for China and ALL!Retweets: 14471Favorites: 65427

I am certain that at some time in the future President Xi and I together with President Putin of Russia will start talking about a meaningful halt to what has become a major and uncontrollable Arms Race. The U.S. spent 716 Billion Dollars this year. Crazy!Retweets: 21346Favorites: 91956

We would save Billions of Dollars if the Democrats would give us the votes to build the Wall. Either way people will NOT be allowed into our Country illegally! We will close the entire Southern Border if necessary. Also STOP THE DRUGS!Retweets: 26903Favorites: 105758

'I will never testify against Trump.' This statement was recently made by Roger Stone essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about 'President Trump.' Nice to know that some people still have 'guts!'Retweets: 23763Favorites: 99508

Bob Mueller (who is a much different man than people think) and his out of control band of Angry Democrats don't want the truth they only want lies. The truth is very bad for their mission!Retweets: 26098Favorites: 100413
