    TALLAHASSEE, Fla.â€” Today, Ron DeSantis issued the following statement in response to Vice President Kamala Harris' visit to the state of Florida:
"Democrats like Kamala Harris have to lie about Florida's educational standards to cover for their agenda of indoctrinating students and pushing sexual topics onto children. Florida stands in their way and we will continue to expose their agenda and their lies.
The Harris-Biden administration is obsessed with Florida...yet they ignore the chaos at the border, crime-infested cities, economic malaise, and the military recruitment crisis. Maybe if Biden's granddaughter moved to Florida he'd actually visit her."
