    Chapel Hill, North Carolina – Senator John Edwards released the following statement following the issuance of the latest in a series of Supreme Court decisions this term that limit protections for working Americans, women and the environment.
"Like President Bush, Chief Justice Roberts sought high office claiming he would be a consensus-builder. But this term's rash of far-reaching 5-4 decisions proves that Roberts, like Bush, is exactly the opposite. With its two newest members, today's Supreme Court is moving the right-wing's agenda faster than we've seen in decades—slamming the courthouse doors in the faces of ordinary people, favoring big businesses over civil rights, and undermining protections for women and the environment. Because the next president will likely nominate at least one Supreme Court justice, which could shape the balance of power on the Court for years to come, the stakes in the 2008 election could not be higher."
