    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
The American Red Cross makes its annual appeal for funds in the month of March. This is one of the three campaigns authorized to be conducted within Executive Departments and Agencies.
The work of the Red Cross has wide benefits. During the year it responds to emergency calls for help from communities stricken by natural disaster--and it maintains many diverse programs of daily import to all citizens. Under charter by the Congress, it provides welfare services to the members of the Armed Forces and to their families at home and overseas.
Employees of the Federal Government, and members of the military establishment, have long given generous support to the Red Cross appeal for volunteers and funds. I hope you will encourage this fine tradition during the coming campaign in March.
