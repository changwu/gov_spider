    On behalf of the American people, President Obama warmly congratulates Prime Minister Enrico Letta of Italy and the new Italian government on their swearing-in. The United States and Italy share an enduring and essential friendship -- one built on shared values and common commitment to promote peace, liberty, and prosperity both regionally and across the globe, including as NATO allies. The President looks forward to working closely with Prime Minister Letta and President Napolitano as our two countries jointly seek to promote trade, jobs, and growth on both sides of the Atlantic and tackle today's complex security challenges.
