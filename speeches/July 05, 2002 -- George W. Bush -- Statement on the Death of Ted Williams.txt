    With the passing of Ted Williams, America lost a baseball legend. Whether serving the country in the Armed Forces or excelling on the baseball diamond, Ted Williams demonstrated unique talent and love of country. He inspired young ballplayers across the Nation for decades, and we will always remember his persistence on the field and his courage off the field. Ted gave baseball some of its best seasonsâ€” and he gave his own best seasons to his country. He will be greatly missed.
