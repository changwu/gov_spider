    HOUSTON, Texas - Yesterday, the Wisconsin Right to Life's PAC endorsed Ted Cruz for President saying Cruz is "the only presidential candidate with a proven record on life who can win."
In a statement the group said, "Wisconsin Right to Life's Political Action Committee supports Ted Cruz as the only presidential candidate with a proven record on life who can win.
'There has never been an election more important than this election, and the stakes have never been higher when it comes to protecting the unborn,' stated Chelsea Shields, PAC Director of Wisconsin Right to Life. 'There is only one candidate for president who has always been pro-life, who has a 100% pro-life voting record with National Right to Life and Wisconsin Right to Life, and who can win the Republican nomination and defeat pro-abortion Hillary Clinton in November. And that candidate is Ted Cruz.'
As president, Ted Cruz would:

Work to restore legal protections to unborn babies and their mothers
Protect unborn babies from abortion, including painful and barbaric dismemberment abortions
Appoint judges who protect life
Keep your tax dollars from paying for abortion.

For these reasons, Wisconsin Right to Life's Political Action Committee is urging every pro-life voter in Wisconsin to vote for Ted Cruz in the Presidential Preference Primary on April 5th."
