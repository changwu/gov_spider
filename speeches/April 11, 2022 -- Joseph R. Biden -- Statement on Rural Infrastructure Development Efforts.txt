    I have always believed that for America to succeed, rural America must succeed. Since taking office, my administration has focused on building pathways to the middle class for rural Americans in rural America, including investing in rural infrastructure and rebuilding the communities that feed and fuel our country.
For far too long, opportunity has been out of reach for rural communities. My administration is changing that. Through the American Rescue Plan, we supported rural families and provided rural communities with the tools and resources that made them central to America's strong economic recovery. I also secured historic investments for rural America through the bipartisan infrastructure law to make sure we revitalize and rebuild rural communities for years to come. These generational infrastructure investments will provide rural communities across America affordable high-speed internet, clean drinking water, reliable electricity, better roads and bridges, and good-paying jobs. Strong infrastructure in rural communities is good for jobs, good for keeping the economy moving, good for lowering prices, and good for America.
I am proud today that my administration is launching a rural infrastructure tour to double down on our unwavering commitment to building a better America where rural communities thrive. In the coming weeks and beyond, Cabinet members and senior administration officials will crisscross the country to meet with, listen to, and deliver infrastructure investments to rural communities. As we unlock Federal resources and generate results for these communities, we are unlocking opportunity: job opportunities, educational opportunities, and the opportunity for a better future.
