Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement regarding Senator Mel Martinez (R-FL) stepping down as General Chairman of the Republican National Committee:
"Senator Martinez led the Republican Party with principled leadership, working to articulate the core conservative ideals of less government and more freedom to voters across the country. As Republicans, we can be proud of the way he helped lay the groundwork for our party as we head into 2008 and this critical election. His hard work and determination as RNC Chairman has helped pave the way toward victory in November. I wish him the best as he continues to passionately represent his Florida constituents in the United States Senate."
