    Today the world lost a creative icon. Michelle and I join millions of fans from around the world in mourning the sudden death of Prince. Few artists have influenced the sound and trajectory of popular music more distinctly or touched quite so many people with their talent. As one of the most gifted and prolific musicians of our time, Prince did it all: funk, R&B, rock and roll. He was a virtuoso instrumentalist, a brilliant bandleader, and an electrifying performer.
"A strong spirit transcends rules," Prince once said. And nobody's spirit was stronger, bolder or more creative. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, his band, and all who loved him.
