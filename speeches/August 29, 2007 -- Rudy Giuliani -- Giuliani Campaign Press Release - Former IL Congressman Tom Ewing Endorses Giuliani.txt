    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced several current and former elected officials throughout Illinois who are endorsing Mayor Rudy Giuliani for President. Included in the list is former U.S. Congressman Tom Ewing, who served as an Illinois State Representative from 1974 to 1991 and later represented Illinois' 15th District in Congress from 1991 to 2001.
Today's announcement follows the release last week of ten Giuliani regional chairs and several county chairs throughout Illinois. Twenty Illinois State Representatives, including Giuliani State Chairman Rep. Tom Cross and Giuliani Regional Chair Rep. Bob Biggins, and five former State Representatives, including Gwen Klingler, have endorsed Rudy Giuliani for President. In addition, U.S. Representatives Jerry Weller and Judy Biggert are supporting the Mayor.
"Mayor Giuliani is a problem-solver who demonstrated in New York that he can get real results, even in the most difficult of situations," said Ewing. "Giuliani can win in Illinois because he's a proven leader with a clear vision for America."
