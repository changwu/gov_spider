    This morning I received a letter from Justice Byron White informing me that he intends to retire at the end of the current Supreme Court term.
He is a living example of the American dream fulfilled. He came from humble beginnings, was a star college and professional athlete, a Rhodes scholar, a prominent private attorney, and Deputy Attorney General at one of the most important times in our history before joining the Court in 1962. In his 31 years on the Supreme Court, Justice White served his country and our Constitution well. We are all more fortunate that he devoted the great portion of his life to public service.
