    Dear XXXXX:
Last night the savings and loan conferees reached a compromise on the financing plan included in the savings and loan legislation. The compromise avoids any amendment of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget process, while including both the Administration's approach to financing and direct Treasury borrowing.
The conferees deserve our thanks and our congratulations. They have worked diligently to fashion a strong and responsible bill to deal with this extraordinarily serious problem. Importantly, the bill includes tough and sensible new capital and accounting standards. Final passage remains critical to the stability and solvency of our financial system.
This legislation has been developed in a bipartisan process. It is badly needed, and must be enacted without further delay. Consequently, I ask that the House and Senate approve this legislation today, and that we pledge to maintain our commitment to resolve this problem.
Sincerely,
George Bush
