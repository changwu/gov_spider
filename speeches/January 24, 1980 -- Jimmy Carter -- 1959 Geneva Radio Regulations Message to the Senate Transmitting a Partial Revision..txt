    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith the Partial Revision of the Radio Regulations (Geneva 1959)—signed on behalf of the United States at Geneva on March 5, 1978—for the advice and consent of the Senate.
I am also transmitting, for the Senate's information, the Department of State's report on the Partial Revision.
The primary purpose of the Revision is to update the Radio Regulations to take into account the present technological state of the art and the increasing demands on these frequencies.
The Partial Revision (except for the Frequency Allotment Plan itself, which will take effect at 0001 hours GMT on February 1, 1983) went into force on September 1, 1979, for Governments that had notified the Secretary General of the International Telecommunication Union of their approval by that date. I believe that the United States should be a party to the Partial Revision, and it is my hope that the Senate will take early action on the Revision and give its advice and consent to ratification.
