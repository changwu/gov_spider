Homeland Security @SecNielsen did a fabulous job yesterday at the press conference explaining security at the border and for our country while at the same time recommending changes to obsolete & nasty laws which force family separation. We want 'heart' and security in America!Retweets: 22451Favorites: 96708

The Fake News is not mentioning the safety and security of our Country when talking about illegal immigration. Our immigration laws are the weakest and worst anywhere in the world and the Dems will do anything not to change them & to obstruct-want open borders which means crime!Retweets: 32075Favorites: 126623

It's the Democrats fault they won't give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation. They want open borders which breeds horrible crime. Republicans want security. But I am working on something - it never ends!Retweets: 23501Favorites: 96534

'FBI texts have revealed anti-Trump Bias.' @FoxNews Big News but the Fake News doesn't want to cover. Total corruption - the Witch Hunt has turned out to be a scam! At some point soon the Mainstream Media will have to cover correctly too big a story!Retweets: 22186Favorites: 83338

Had a great meeting with the House GOP last night at the Capitol. They applauded and laughed loudly when I mentioned my experience with Mark Sanford. I have never been a fan of his!Retweets: 10029Favorites: 53851
