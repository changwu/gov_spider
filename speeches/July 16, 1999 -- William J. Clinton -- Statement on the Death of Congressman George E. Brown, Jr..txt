    I was greatly saddened to learn of the death of Congressman George Brown. When he last visited the White House, I noted that he was affectionately known as Mr. Science. His legacy of service and lifetime of contributions helped sustain American leadership across the frontiers of scientific knowledge. George Brown's support for science was drawn from his deep belief that science and technology could help achieve a peaceful world and a just society. For almost 40 years, from his earliest days fighting racial inequality, George Brown challenged us to build a better world. Our Nation has lost a good man and an irreplaceable voice for science and justice.
Hillary and I extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Marta, and to his family.
