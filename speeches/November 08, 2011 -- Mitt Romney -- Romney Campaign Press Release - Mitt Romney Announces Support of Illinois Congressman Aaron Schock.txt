    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Illinois Congressman Aaron Schock.
"In order to improve our financial standing, we must get spending under control," said Mitt Romney. "Congressman Schock has been a leader in the fight to reduce government spending. I am proud to have his endorsement and look forward to working with him to reduce our burdensome debt."
