    Warm greetings to all those observing Yom Kippur.
This Day of Atonement, the most solemn of all the days of the Jewish calendar, is a time for intense prayer, fasting, and reflection. For the duration of Yom Kippur, Jews across America and around the world separate themselves from the comforts and distractions of everyday life to focus on repairing their relationship with God. It is a time to look back on the failures and transgressions of the past year, to make amends, and to seek God's forgiveness.
In neighborhoods across our nation, as Jewish families gather for Yom Kippur services, they offer people of all faiths an extraordinary witness. They remind us of the power of faith that changes lives, the love of family that strengthens spirits, and the blessing of God's forgiveness that allows us to repent of our sins and begin anew.
At this difficult time for all of us who have worked for peace, let us pray for an end to the violence and for a new beginning in the Middle East. Hillary joins me in extending best wishes to all for a meaningful Yom Kippur.
