Jason Chaffetz, a rising conservative leader from Utah, is going to join Marco on the campaign trail this week. Here's what he has to say:
Marco Rubio is a conservative leader who understands the challenges facing American families in the 21st century. I'm looking forward to hitting the campaign trail with Marco to talk about the future of our country and the importance of electing a next-generation conservative in 2016.

Chaffetz is currently serving as Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, which is tasked with holding the Executive Branch accountable.
Chaffetz will join Marco at a town hall in Concord, New Hampshire, on Friday.
