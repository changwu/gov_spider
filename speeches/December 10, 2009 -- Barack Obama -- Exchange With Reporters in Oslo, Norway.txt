    Signing Norwegian Nobel Institute Guest Book
Q. What did you write, Mr. President?
The President. I wrote, "Thank you." No, what I did write, actually, is worth mentioning. In addition to being honored to receive it, I think it's important to congratulate the Nobel Committee for the work that it's done over the course of history to highlight the cause of peace, but also to give voice to the voiceless and the oppressed around the world.
When you look at the wall, Michelle and I were commenting on the fact that when Dr. King won his prize it had a galvanizing effect around the world, but also lifted his stature in the United States in a way that allowed him to be more effective. And that's a legacy of the Nobel Committee that we're very grateful for.
