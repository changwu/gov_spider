    To the Congress of the United States:
Supervisors and management officials in GS-13, 14, and 15 positions throughout the Federal Government are covered by the Merit Pay System as required by Chapter 54, Title 5, U.S. Code, unless otherwise excluded by law.
Upon proper application from the heads of affected agencies and upon the recommendation of the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, I have, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5401(b)(2)(B), excluded two agencies from coverage under the Merit Pay System. In addition, one agency previously excluded because of emergency conditions will no longer be excluded.
Attached is my report describing the agencies to be excluded and the reasons therefor.
