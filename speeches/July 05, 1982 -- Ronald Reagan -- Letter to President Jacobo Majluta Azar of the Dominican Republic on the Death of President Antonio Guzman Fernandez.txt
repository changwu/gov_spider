    Dear Mr. President:
I was deeply saddened to learn of the tragic death of President Antonio Guzman Fernandez, a man, who was a good friend of the United States and who made a lasting contribution to the continuing growth of democracy and freedom in the Dominican Republic. As you assume your duties, I wish to assure you, the family of President Guzman and the Dominican people that the United States shares your sense of loss and wishes to maintain the close cooperation and friendship which exists between our governments and peoples.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
