The greatness of America is a reflection of the strength, character, and the will of the American people. Without the dedication of millions of men and women willing to roll up their sleeves and go to work, the American dream would remain only that--a dream.
With that dedication and hard work, America has developed over the last 200 years into not only the most prosperous of nations but an enduring example of the democratic process and spirit. Yet, Labor Day is no holiday for those who are out of work through no fault of their own.
Let us this year give Labor Day special meaning by considering not only the working people but the millions of Americans who are looking for work. I pledge to do everything in my power to generate new and decent jobs.
When figures are published on the loss of jobs, some of the losses are not announced. These trouble me very deeply. I refer to the loss of hope among the young people seeking their first job, the loss of self-esteem among family people who are laid off, the loss of security that people work for for years to achieve, and most importantly, the loss of faith in America's future. These are tragic losses which the United States of America cannot endure.
One encouraging factor on this Labor Day is that there are more than 85 million Americans at work. That is 1,200,000 more than 6 months ago. We expect this trend to continue.
Let government, labor, and business today unite to hasten the moment when enough new jobs are created on a sound economic base to make every day Labor Day with all of its rewards.
As America enters its third century, let us pay tribute to those who have made our system work, the men and women of American labor, organized and unorganized.
On this Labor Day 1975, let us renew our dedication to making sure that there are jobs available for all Americans who want to work.
