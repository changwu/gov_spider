The United States is proud to be the global leader on Women, Peace, and Security both at home and abroad. When President Trump signed the 2017 Women, Peace, and Security Act, the United States became the first country to pass comprehensive legislation enshrining this milestone achievement.
This October marks the 20th anniversary of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, which institutionalized the Women, Peace, and Security agenda to steward the international response to conflict, crisis, and recovery. Today, we call on the UN and other Member States to join the United States to enhance women's role in preventing, resolving, and recovering from conflict.
We must build upon our progress worldwide to ensure women are guaranteed the meaningful protection and participation mandated by UNSCR 1325. To fully realize the promise of UNSCR 1325, the United States is working tirelessly in the Council and worldwide to hold accountable those responsible for gross human rights violations against women.
On this 20th anniversary, the United States urges the UN Organization and the international community to take meaningful action and fully implement the Women, Peace, and Security agenda.
