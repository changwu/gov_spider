    Today, the former Secretary of Veterans Affairs and Co-Chair of Mitt Romney's Veterans Policy Advisory Group Anthony Principi released the following statement:
"So many young Americans have voluntarily chosen to place themselves in harm's way for the sake of our country. The country must show its devotion in return. But today, we are faltering in that fundamental obligation. A country that isn't able to provide jobs to the men and women returning from the battlefield is not keeping faith with its veterans. We need a president who not only understands that we must provide our veterans with the world-class health care and benefits they deserve, but that an equally critical task is getting the American economy growing again. We need a president who will ensure that those who have sacrificed so much are now given a chance to find good jobs, live the American Dream, and not be forced into poverty. Mitt Romney will fix an economy that continues to falter, and will keep our nation's promise to our veterans."
