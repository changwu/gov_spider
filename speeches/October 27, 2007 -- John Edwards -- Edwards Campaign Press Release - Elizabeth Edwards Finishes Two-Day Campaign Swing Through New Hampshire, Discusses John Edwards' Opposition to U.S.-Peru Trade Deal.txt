    Tomorrow, Elizabeth Will be Joined in NH by Senator Edwards and Their Children, Jack and Emma Claire
Manchester, N.H. â€“ Elizabeth Edwards finished a two-day campaign swing through New Hampshire today with a canvassing kickoff with the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, house parties in Hampstead in Nashua, and a town hall in Hanover.
Speaking with the Carpenters in Manchester, Elizabeth discussed John Edwards' opposition to the U.S.-Peru free-trade deal.
"From Berlin to Groveton, working men and women in New Hampshire have seen firsthand the disastrous consequences of short-sighted trade deals that put corporate profits above American workers," said Elizabeth. "As president, the first question John will ask about any trade deal is 'Is this good for American workers?' John will implement smart and safe trade policies that put working families first."
Tomorrow, Elizabeth will be joined by John Edwards and their children, Jack and Emma Claire, to continue campaigning throughout the state.
