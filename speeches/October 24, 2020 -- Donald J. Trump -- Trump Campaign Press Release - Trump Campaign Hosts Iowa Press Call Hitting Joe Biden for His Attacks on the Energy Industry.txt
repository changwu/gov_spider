    Following Thursday's debate in which Joe Biden repeatedly attacked America's energy industry and promised to eliminate millions of jobs, the Trump campaign hosted a press call with former Iowa Governor and former Ambassador to China Terry Branstad. While President Trump has uplifted blue-collar workers by supporting America's energy independence, Joe Biden is launching a full-on assault against the fossil fuel industry. Joe Biden has made clear that he would happily sacrifice millions of good paying jobs to appease his radical, left-wing base.
"Under President Trump's leadership, America has become energy self-sufficient and a big part of that is also things like ethanol and biodiesel which are produced in the state of Iowa. With Biden's plan to end fossil fuels, this would also be the death knell to ethanol and biodiesel, devastating to thousands of jobs in that industry in the state of Iowa," said former Iowa Governor and former Ambassador to China Terry Branstad.
