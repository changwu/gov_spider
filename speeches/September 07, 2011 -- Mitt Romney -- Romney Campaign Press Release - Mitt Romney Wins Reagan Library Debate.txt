    Romney for President Communications Director Gail Gitcho issued the following statement following tonight's debate:
"Mitt Romney won tonight's debate because he demonstrated that he is the only candidate in the race who can return the country to economic prosperity. Career politicians got us into the mess and it will take someone with experience in the real economy to get us out. Mitt Romney has laid out the boldest, most sweeping jobs plan ever offered by a presidential candidate, which includes 59 proposals to spur economic growth and 10 specific actions that he will take on his first day in office. Mitt Romney also once again affirmed his commitment to fixing and protecting Social Security for current and future generations."
