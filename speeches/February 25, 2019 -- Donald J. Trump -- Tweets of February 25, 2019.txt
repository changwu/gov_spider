We have a State of Emergency at our Southern Border. Border Patrol our Military and local Law Enforcement are doing a great job but without the Wall which is now under major construction you cannot have Border Security.

Meeting for breakfast with our Nation's Governors - then off to Vietnam for a very important Summit with Kim Jong Un. With complete Denuclearization North Korea will rapidly become an Economic Powerhouse. Without it just more of the same. Chairman Kim will make a wise decision!Retweets: 15959Favorites: 76836

Former Senator Harry Reid (he got thrown out) is working hard to put a good spin on his failed career. He led through lies and deception only to be replaced by another beauty Cryin' Chuck Schumer. Some things just never change!Retweets: 23541Favorites: 102446

I hope our great Republican Senators don't get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security. Without strong Borders we don't have a Country - and the voters are on board with us. Be strong and smart don't fall into the Democrats 'trap' of Open Borders and Crime!Retweets: 29496Favorites: 119792
