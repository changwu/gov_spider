Memorandum for Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration
During the past six weeks I have reviewed extensively the aircraft noise problem. I have considered your recommendations as well as those of Secretary of Transportation William T. Coleman, Jr., Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Russell E. Train and many other Federal, State and local officials concerned with the effect of aircraft noise on the people in areas surrounding our major airports.
I am acutely aware of the seriousness of this problem for the six to seven million Americans living near our nation's major airports. We must take action to quiet the noisy aircraft which fail to meet and are not now required to meet proper noise standards.
I hereby instruct you, consistent with applicable laws and regulations, and in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, to promulgate, by January 1, 1977, a regulation that will require domestic commercial aircraft to meet present Federal noise standards in accordance with a phased-in time schedule, not to exceed eight years.
You and the entire Federal Aviation Administration are to be commended for your dedicated service on the aircraft noise problem. It is only through the joint working efforts of government, airport operators and industry working together cooperatively, that we will be able to quiet our nation's skies and improve the quality of life for millions of Americans.
