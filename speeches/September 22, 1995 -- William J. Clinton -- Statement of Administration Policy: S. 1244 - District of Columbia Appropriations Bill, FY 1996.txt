    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate Floor)(Sponsors: Hatfield (R), Oregon; Jeffords (R), Vermont)
This Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views on S. 1244, the District of Columbia Appropriations Bill, FY 1996, as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
The Administration is pleased that the Committee bill approves the FY 1996 total District of Columbia budget at the level recommended by the Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority.
However, the Administration is strongly opposed to the provision in Title II of the bill that would establish a Commission on Consensus Reform in the District of Columbia Public Schools. The Commission would infringe on Home Rule. Moreover, the Commission would add an unnecessary and costly layer of duplicative oversight to the District of Columbia educational system. Under the provision of the Committee bill, one member of the Commission would be appointed by the Senate Majority Leader and one member by the Speaker of the House. Because this Commission would have substantial powers to control the District of Columbia school system, the effect of this provision would be not only to enable Congress to legislate, but also to enable Congress to be involved in the execution of the laws. This would represent an excessive expansion of congressional power, the sort that the Supreme Court has deemed a violation of the separation of powers.
