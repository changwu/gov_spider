    I commend Congress for passing the Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003 and am pleased to sign it into law.
The act will allow us to strengthen State and community-based programs that prevent child abuse and family violence and treat victims. In addition, the legislation will help us keep children safe by requiring criminal background checks for foster and adoptive parents. It also provides additional resources to increase the number of older children placed in adoptive families.
