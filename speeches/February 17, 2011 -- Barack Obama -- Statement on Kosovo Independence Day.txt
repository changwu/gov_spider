    I join all Americans in extending my best wishes to all those who are celebrating Kosovo's Independence Day. This is a time both to reflect upon Kosovo's long struggle for independence and to look forward to a future of greater security and prosperity for all of Kosovo's citizens. In America, those who have roots and family in Kosovo can be proud of the tremendous progress the country has made in its first 3 years of independence. I am confident that the friendship between our nations will continue to grow in the years ahead.
