    "The Russia Collusion Hoax is the greatest political scandal in the history of this country. As this report proves – yet again – there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. The report does remind Americans that there was, however, political reliance on foreign assistance in 2016, since Hillary Clinton's campaign and the DNC paid for the bogus Steele Dossier assembled by a foreign operative using Russian disinformation. Additionally, Joe Biden still hasn't answered for his role in using the Logan Act to set up Gen. Michael Flynn."
