    Laura and I are deeply saddened by the loss of Governor Carroll Campbell. Carroll Campbell was a strong leader, a committed public servant, and a good friend. For more than two decades, he represented the people of South Carolina as a State legislator, Member of Congress, and Governor. He was a tireless advocate for the State he loved and was known for his integrity and character. We join South Carolinians and Americans around the Nation in mourning the passing of Carroll Campbell, and we send our thoughts and prayers to Iris and the entire Campbell family.
