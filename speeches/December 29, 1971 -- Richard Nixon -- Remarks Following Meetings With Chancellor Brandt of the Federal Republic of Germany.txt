    Mr. Chancellor, Mr. Foreign Minister, ladies and gentlemen:
The Chancellor and I have just finished a days of very intensive discussions. Those discussions covered the whole range of bilateral problems between the United States and the Federal Republic and also international problems with particular emphasis, of course, on the problems of Europe.
I can say without qualification that the state of German-American relations is excellent at this time. I can also say that in terms of the other discussions that we have had, that we found substantial agreement, as the statement which has been issued to the press has indicated, in economic areas and also on the problem of maintaining adequate forces in Europe in our commitment to NATO.
With regard to that commitment, incidentally, I am today announcing the appointment of Ambassador Kennedy as our Ambassador to NATO.1 This indicates, as I have told the Chancellor, the commitment that the United States has to NATO--the importance that we attach to that commitment, sending a man who has such broad experience, who has my total confidence, as our Ambassador to that very important post.
Finally, Mr. Chancellor, on a personal note, may I here, before American television, speak for all the American people in congratulating the Nobel Prize winner for 1971.
I hope and I believe that the talks that we have had, covering the whole range of world affairs, will contribute to peace in the years ahead for our two countries and for the world.
We are very complimented that you have chosen Florida for a brief vacation. We hope the waters are peaceful and that the fishing is good.
