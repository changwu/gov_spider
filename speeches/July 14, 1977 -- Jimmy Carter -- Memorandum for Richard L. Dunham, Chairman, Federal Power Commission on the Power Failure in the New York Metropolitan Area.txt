    Memorandum for Richard L. Dunham, Chairman, Federal Power Commission
Last night's power failure affecting 10 million people in New York City and parts of the metropolitan area is another dramatic reminder of the total dependence of this nation on reliable energy supplies. The Federal Power Commission is therefore directed immediately to investigate this power failure to ascertain the reasons why it occurred and to recommend specific actions to be taken to prevent a recurrence.
I am directing all agencies of the Executive Branch to support you in any way that their assistance may be useful. I hope that you will be able to report your findings at a very early date.
JIMMY CARTER
