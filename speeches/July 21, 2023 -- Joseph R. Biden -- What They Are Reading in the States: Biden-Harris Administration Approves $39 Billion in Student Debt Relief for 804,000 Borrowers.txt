    Across the country, local news outlets are spotlighting last week's announcement that the Biden-Harris Administration will provide loan relief for more than 800,000 people who have been in repayment for over 20 years but hadn't gotten the forgiveness they earned, totaling $39 billion. This new action addresses historical failures in the federal student loan program which prevented borrowers from making progress toward loan forgiveness.
These forthcoming discharges are a result of fixes implemented by President Biden's Administration to ensure all borrowers have an accurate count of the number of monthly payments that qualify toward forgiveness under income-driven repayment plans. Notifications of relief to borrowers have already begun.
President Biden is committed to fighting for students, borrowers, and families â€“ ensuring that hard-working Americans can access much needed relief.
