     Mitt Romney today made the following statement on today's comments made by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad:
"America must lead the world in stopping Iran's genocidal regime from obtaining a nuclear weapons capability.  Ahmadinejad's latest outrageous remarks are just another reminder of what is at stake. As I said recently when visiting Jerusalem, 'We have seen the horrors of history. We will not stand by. We will not watch them play out again.'"
