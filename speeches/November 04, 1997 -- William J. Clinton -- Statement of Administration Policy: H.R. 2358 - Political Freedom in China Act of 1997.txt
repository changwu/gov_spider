    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)
(Ros-Lehtinen (R) FL and 14 cosponsors)
Although the Administration strongly supports a robust human rights monitoring program, it opposes H.R. 2358, which authorizes appropriations to support increased staffing at the U.S. embassy in Beijing and the China consulates for the purpose of monitoring political repression in China. The Department of State actively monitors and reports on the human rights situation in China, including in the Department's annual human rights report. The Administration is seriously committed to the advancement of human rights in China and strives to ensure maximum coverage of China's human rights situation. H.R. 2358, however, would unnecessarily micromanage Department activities and impair the Administration's ability to manage resources effectively.
