    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-256; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Korea Extending the Agreement of July 26, 1982, Concerning Fisheries off the Coasts of the United States, as extended and amended. The agreement, which was effected by an exchange of notes at Washington on June 11, 1993, and October 13, 1993, extends the 1982 agreement to December 31, 1995. The exchange of notes together with the 1982 agreement constitute a governing international fishery agreement within the requirements of section 201(c) of the Act.
In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the Republic of Korea, I urge that the Congress give favorable consideration to this agreement at an early date.

WILLIAM J. CLINTON
