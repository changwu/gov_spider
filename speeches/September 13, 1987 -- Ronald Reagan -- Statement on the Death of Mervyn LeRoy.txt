    Mervyn LeRoy was a special part of our lives. It was he who introduced us, and he was always a precious friend. In fact, we always referred to him as our Cupid.
Mervyn LeRoy was one of the pillars of the entertainment industry, responsible for some of the Finest motion pictures ever. He was one of the greatest directors and producers of all time, knowing exactly how a scene should be and knowing just what to say to get his actors to make it right. He was dedicated to his profession and brought unmatched enthusiasm and energy to everything he did. He achieved excellence and earned the respect and affection of everyone he worked with.
We loved him and will miss him very much. His warmth and goodness will live in our hearts forever. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Kitty, and to their children.
