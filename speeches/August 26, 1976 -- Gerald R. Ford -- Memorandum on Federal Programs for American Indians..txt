I am today designating Bradley H. Patterson, Jr., of the White House Office to assist me in the area of American Indian affairs. It will be Mr. Patterson's specific responsibility to work with each of you to improve the coordination among the Federal agencies with programs that serve the Indian people.
It is important that you insure the effective delivery and efficient operation of Federal Indian programs and services. I request that priority attention be given to coordination of these efforts among the Departments and Agencies and within the Executive Office of the President.
In addition, I request you continue to insure that when Federal actions are planned which affect Indian communities, the responsible Indian leaders are consulted in the planning process.
