    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Today, John Edwards for President communications director Chris Kofinis released the following statement:
"Today, Senator Clinton made it crystal clear where she stands: she defends health care for politicians while millions of Americans and their families go without care.
"Voters have a clear choice between John Edwards, who will fight to finally pass universal health care, and Senator Clinton, who seems intent on defending the Washington establishment.
"When John Edwards is president, he will name names and the American people will know which members of Congress are taking the money of big insurance company lobbyists and voting against universal health care while protecting their own health care. And unlike what happened in 1993, John Edwards will never kill legislation to give health care to ordinary people while letting the politicians keep their coverage."
