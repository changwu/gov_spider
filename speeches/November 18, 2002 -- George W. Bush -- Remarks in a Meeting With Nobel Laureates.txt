    It's my honor to welcome this year's Nobel laureates to the Oval Office. Of course, I welcome somebody who spent a lot of quality time here. President Carter and Mrs. Carter, we're so honored to have you as well as the other distinguished Americans who are here with us.
These Americans are a great honor to their fields and a great honor to our country. And we're proud to have you here. We're proud for what you've done, for not only America but the world. And we're proud for your contributions.
And I want to thank the Ambassadors from Sweden and Norway for coming here as well. Mr. Ambassadors, thank you for being here. All Americans take great pride in the accomplishments of these good folks. We'll be watching the news clips of the ceremonies. We will be with you there in spirit.
And once again, we thank you and your families for your dedication to the greatest country on the face of the Earth. And may God bless your work, and may God bless your further endeavors. Thank you all very much.
