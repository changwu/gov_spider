    IN SENDING my greetings and best wishes for a successful meeting to the Atlantic Treaty Association on the occasion of its 19th Annual Assembly, I am conscious of the unstinting service its members have long given to the cohesion and strength of the Atlantic Alliance. A close and vigorous Atlantic relation?hip remains vital to the security and prosperity of all of our countries during this period of profound changes in the Atlantic Community and the world at large changes that offer new opportunities.
Collective defense remains the cornerstone of the Atlantic Alliance. The Government of the United States is pledged to maintain our commitments to the Alliance and to make a substantial contribution on a mutual defense. We confidently expect that each of our allies will assume its share of the common defense burden, joining in equitable arrangements which strengthen the solidarity of the Alliance. And we expect that the Alliance will continue to evaluate our mutual defense effort in light of the strategic and political conditions prevailing in this decade.
Not only in defense, but in all spheres we have the opportunity as equal partners to chart our future course, to define our common purposes and to strengthen the principles of mutual understanding on which our future relation will depend. I believe that in this we can infuse our old ties with a new dynamism. The United States will do its part, and we look to our partners to join in fulfilling the promise of the years that lie ahead.
