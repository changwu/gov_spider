    Today, the President met with members of the Senate Democratic Caucus. The group discussed their shared goals for 2014, and the President expressed his desire to continue to work together to advance a number of our priorities for the year to strengthen our economy, create jobs and build the middle class. The President has declared 2014 a year of action, and while he will continue to use his executive authority - his pen and phone - to get things done, he will also work with Congress to make progress on behalf of the American people. The President addressed a number of issues with the Caucus, including increasing the minimum wage so those Americans working hard can have a living wage, passing commonsense immigration reform, strengthening education and promoting a number of other jobs and growth measures.
