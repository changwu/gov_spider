    HOUSTON, Texas — Today U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz released the following statement in observance of Passover:
"As our Jewish friends sit down tonight at the Seder table with family and friends to celebrate the Passover, let us give thanks for the gift of freedom – the freedom to live and to practice our faith without fear. Let us also pray for protection from the enemies of freedom.
"The Passover Haggadah asks each generation to look upon the exodus from Egypt as if we had personally experienced it ourselves reflecting on Psalm 114, 'When Israel came forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; Judah became His sanctuary, Israel His dominion.'
"In our generation, there is no shortage of modern-day Pharaohs who seek to destroy freedom-loving people everywhere. But by standing together, we will prevail.
"Chag Sameach."
