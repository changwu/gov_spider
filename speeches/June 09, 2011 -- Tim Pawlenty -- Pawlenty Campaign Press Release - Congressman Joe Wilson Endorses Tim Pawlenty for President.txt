    Senior Republican Congressman to co-chair Pawlenty campaign in key early primary state
COLUMBIA, SC - Former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty's presidential campaign announced today that Congressman Joe Wilson will help lead its efforts in South Carolina. The senior congressman from Lexington will serve as a co-chair in the critical "First In The South" Presidential Primary.
"Congressman Wilson has been a strong conservative voice for the people of South Carolina over the past decade," Governor Pawlenty said. "I am honored to receive his support in this campaign to restore America."
"Governor Pawlenty is the best man to get our nation back on the right track," said Congressman Wilson. "As South Carolinians get to know Governor Pawlenty, as I have, they will see someone with a remarkable record of conservative accomplishments in a politically tough state for Republicans, and someone who has the kind of bold vision for America's future that we need to defeat Barack Obama."
