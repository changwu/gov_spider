(House Rules)
(Rep. Walden, R-OR)
The Administration is strongly committed to a free and open Internet, and thus ensuring that no party can restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas. Essential to this policy is ensuring that no cable or phone company can act as a gatekeeper, restricting what Americans can do or see online. That is why the Administration supports the Federal Communication Commission's decision in February 2015 to issue an Open Internet order providing strong, clear, carefully designed rules that prevent broadband providers from favoring certain Internet content over others.
H.R. 4596, the Small Business Broadband Deployment Act, would extend a temporary exemption for small businesses from the Open Internet order's enhanced disclosure rules for five years and expand the definition of a small business. The Administration does not oppose House passage of H.R. 4596 in its current form, as reported by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The Administration, however, will not support any attempt to undermine the important consumer and economic protections in the Open Internet order that are supported by millions of Americans. The Administration looks forward to continued conversations with the Congress to help ensure a free and open Internet.
