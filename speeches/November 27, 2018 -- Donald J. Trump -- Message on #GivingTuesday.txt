    During this joyous time of year, we give thanks for the many blessings of the season and remember those less fortunate as we reaffirm our commitment to generosity, kindness, and charitable giving. Through acts of charity, we reveal the compassionate foundation of our country. Acts of kindness are hallmarks of our great nation, and we acknowledge the tremendous contributions of the many organizations that provide love, hope, care, and counseling all year long, especially on #GivingTuesday.
As one Nation, we know there is no challenge too great for the American people to overcome. American resilience is evident not just in the selfless deeds of first responders, servicemembers, and volunteers, but also in the extraordinary generosity and benevolence of American families, businesses, and organizations that know that no kind gesture is too insignificant, no length of time volunteering is too short, and no contribution to charity is too small. May this holiday season be a reminder of the blessings we enjoy and of our duty to ensure that the spirit of American greatness continues to lift up people in need throughout our communities.
Melania and I thank all those who have dedicated their time, talents, and resources to charitable causes over this past year, and we encourage you to look for opportunities to contribute this coming year.
