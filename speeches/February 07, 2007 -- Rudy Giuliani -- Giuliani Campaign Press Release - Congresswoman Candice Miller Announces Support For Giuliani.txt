    Michigan Congresswoman Candice Miller (R-MI) announced her support for Mayor Rudy Giuliani to be the next President of the United States. Congresswoman Miller will speak about her endorsement this weekend during a speech to the Michigan GOP convention.
In announcing her endorsement Miller said Rudy Giuliani is the candidate ready to lead America.
"When deciding what candidate I wanted to be our next President of the United States I knew we needed someone who would continue the fight against terrorism, who has proven leadership and who has the record and experience of managing government and improving the economy," Congresswoman Miller said. "Again and again on the most important issues facing America I came to the same conclusion, that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is the man we need to lead our nation."
Mayor Giuliani thanked the Congresswoman for her support. "Candice Miller is an excellent public servant for the state of Michigan, and I am honored to have her support."
