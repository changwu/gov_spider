    The United States condemns in the strongest terms today's terrorist attacks in southeastern Turkey. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones of those killed, and we wish a speedy recovery to those injured. We remain steadfast in our support for Turkey, our NATO Ally and partner, which has suffered from several recent terrorist attacks, as well as a violent coup attempt on July 15. We are in close touch with Turkish authorities and reaffirm our commitment to work together with Turkey to confront the scourge of terrorism.
