    THE FOURTH of July is a uniquely American holiday. But it is also a holiday that echoes the hopes and aspirations of people throughout the world. In each of my-trips abroad, I have seen tangible evidence of people's basic belief in the value of the principles that underlie our Republic, and outpouring of affection and respect for the Nation that Abraham Lincoln called "the last, best hope of earth."
On this Independence Day, as we celebrate our Nation's birth, let us pledge that by our example, we will continue to carry to the people of other lands the basic American message of independence, liberty, and human dignity.
