    Little Rock, AR â€“ Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee has named former U.S. Senate Candidate Tim Michels as his Wisconsin State Chairman.
"I am proud to announce the addition of Tim Michels as Chairman of my Wisconsin Leadership Committee," Huckabee said. "He is a highly motivated manager, distinguished military veteran, and a strong supporter of common sense, conservative values."
Tim Michels is Co-owner of Michels Corporation, a diversified heavy construction company employing nearly 3000 people located in Brownsville, Wisconsin. The company specializes in building energy, communications, and transportation infrastructure throughout North America. In addition, Michels has 12 years active duty service as an Airborne Ranger Infantry Officer in the U.S. Army where he earned the rank of Major. He is also a former Commander of the Army's elite Honor Guard.
"I am honored to be on the Huckabee team and serve as his Wisconsin Campaign Chairman. Governor Huckabee is a family man and proven executive who has demonstrated the leadership that America needs during these challenging times," Michels said. "For more than a decade he provided consistent leadership for the State of Arkansas which resulted in fiscal responsibility and kept honor intact in the office of the Governor."
Michels was the 2004 Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate and received 1.3 million votes, more than any other Republican in the history of the state of Wisconsin.
"These are not times for the United States to have a president who has no executive experience or who has changed their positions on issues. Governor Huckabee's conservative credentials are solid and consistent," Michels said. "These are traits that hard-working Wisconsin people are looking for in their next president."
