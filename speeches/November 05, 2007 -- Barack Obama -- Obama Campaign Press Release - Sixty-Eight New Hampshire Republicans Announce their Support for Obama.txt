    Granite State Republicans cite Obama's direct answers, track record of forging bipartisan solutions
Manchester, NH -- Sixty-eight New Hampshire Republicans announce today that they have changed party registration to vote for Barack Obama in the primary. Many of these voters have never supported a Democrat before, but they see Obama as the only candidate in either party who has the character to be honest about where he'll take the country, and the only candidate who has a proven record of bringing people together for real change.
"I've been a Republican all my life, but the challenges we face are too great to choose a candidate based on his partyâ€”we need to the choose the candidate who can bring fundamental change to Washington and start getting things done again," said Jerry Spivak, an engineer from Nashua. "Barack Obama is the only candidate who will be able to break the partisan logjam and inspire Americans to come together around real solutions."
"I've always believed that you can only bring about real change when people come together across party lines, and I've seen what happens when folks put politics aside and get down to work," Senator Obama said. "If you can't bring people together across the old fault lines, you simply aren't going to be able to make progress on the challenges we face."
