LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” According to recent surveys in the New York Times, 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul polls quite well in a head to head match up against President Obama. In the polls, Paul comes within 5 percentage points of the president, performing better than a majority of the other Republican contenders.
"It is exciting to see how well Dr. Paul does against the President, better than the majority of announced candidates," said Ron Paul 2012 spokesman Jesse Benton. "It is proof that Americans are sick of the status quo and are eager to support a leader who stands for constitutionally limited government and individual liberty."
In a similar head to head survey from last year done by Rasmussen, Paul actually drew a statistical dead heat with the president. And earlier this year in a survey by CNN he does the best out of the other Republicans put up against Obama in a head to head poll.
