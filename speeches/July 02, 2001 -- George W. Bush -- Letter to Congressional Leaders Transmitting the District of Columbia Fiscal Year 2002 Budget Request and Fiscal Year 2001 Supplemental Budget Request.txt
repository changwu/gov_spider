    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Pursuant to my constitutional authority and consistent with sections 202(c) and (e) of The District of Columbia Financial Management and Responsibility Assistance Act of 1995 and section 446 of The District of Columbia Self-Governmental Reorganization Act as amended in 1989, I am transmitting the District of Columbia's Fiscal Year 2002 Budget Request Act and Fiscal Year 2001 Supplemental Budget Request.
The proposed FY 2002 Budget Request Act reflects the major programmatic objectives of the Mayor and the Council of the District of Columbia. For FY 2002, the District estimates total revenues and expenditures of $5.3 billion, resulting in an adjusted surplus of $85.8 million.
The FY 2001 Supplemental Budget Request seeks approval for the District to use $92.5 million in surplus local revenues to address FY 2001 budget pressures, and approval for the Water and Sewer Authority (an enterprise fund) to spend $2.2 million of its own revenue.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
