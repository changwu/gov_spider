    National Security Advisor Sullivan held a trilateral call with National Security Secretariat Secretary General Akiba Takeo of Japan and National Security Office Director Cho Tae-yong of the Republic of Korea to exchange views on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), including the recent summit meeting between Russian President Putin and DPRK leader Kim. The three NSAs reaffirmed the importance of trilateral coordination consistent with their commitment to consult. They noted that any arms exports from the DPRK to Russia would directly violate multiple UN Security Council resolutions, including resolutions that Russia itself voted to adopt. They reiterated their cooperation toward the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
