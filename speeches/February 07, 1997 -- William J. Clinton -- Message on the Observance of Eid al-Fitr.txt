    On behalf of all Americans, I want to extend greetings to all Muslims in the United States and around the world as you celebrate Id al-FÃ­tr.
This celebration, which marks the end of a month of fasting and sacrifice, is an occasion for rejoicing. It is an opportunity for Muslims to gather in joy, as well as in remembrance of those less fortunate.
It is also an opportunity for all of us to rededicate ourselves, not only to achieving spiritual growth, but also to the cause of peace between all peoples of the earth. It is our common challenge and our shared responsibility to create a better world for ourselves and our children.
To all who practice the faith of Islam, in the United States and abroad, Hillary and I extend our very best wishes. May peace be with you and your families, and may God grant you health and prosperity now and in the year ahead.
BILL CLINTON
