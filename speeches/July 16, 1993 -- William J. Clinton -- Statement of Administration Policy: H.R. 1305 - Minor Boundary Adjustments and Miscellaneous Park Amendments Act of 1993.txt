    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Vento (D) MN and Hansen (R) UT)
The Administration supports House passage of HR 1305. However, the Administration will urge the Senate to defer consideration of section 201, which re-authorizes two National Park Service advisory commissions. Under Executive Order 12838, a detailed review of the justification of all advisory commissions is underway. As a general policy, new statutory commissions should not be created pending completion of the review.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 1305 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. The preliminary OMB PAYGO estimate is zero.
