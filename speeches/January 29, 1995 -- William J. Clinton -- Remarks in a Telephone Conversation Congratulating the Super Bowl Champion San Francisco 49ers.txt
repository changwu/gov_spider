    The President. Eddie, can you hear me?
Eddie DeBartolo. Yes, Mr. President, I can.
The President. It's nice to hear your voice. Congratulations.
Mr. DeBartolo. Thank you so much, sir.
The President. I want to say to you and to George and Carmen and to all your wonderful players, it was aâ€”the whole season was thrilling for all of us, and I think the best thing I can say about the 49ers is, I haven't met a single fan anywhere in America who resents all the success you've had. And that's a rare thing. And it's a real tribute to you, to the coach, and to the players in the way you've won and the way you've conducted yourself. We're all happy and proud of you tonight.
Mr. DeBartolo. Well, Mr. President, I can't thank you enough for taking this time, and I know from a very busy schedule. And we're all your backers, and I thank you so much from the bottom of my heart.
The President. Thank you. Congratulations to all of you.
Mr. DeBartolo. Thank you very much.
The President. I liked seeing George without his glasses. He looks good.
