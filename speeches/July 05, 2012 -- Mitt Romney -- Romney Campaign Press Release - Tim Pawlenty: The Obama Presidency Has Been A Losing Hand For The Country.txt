GOV. TIM PAWLENTY: "First of all, President Obama is dubbing his bus tour 'Betting on America.' Well, of course we should bet on America but we shouldn't double down on Barack Obama. His presidency has been a losing hand for Ohio and it's been a losing hand for the country. And if he wants to have a debate about job growth and where jobs have gone my goodness, he's presided over 23 million Americans being unemployed, underemployed, or having given up looking for work. Over forty months of over eight percent unemployment. Families, moms and dads, not being able to achieve or see their dreams because they don't have a job or are worried about losing a job."
