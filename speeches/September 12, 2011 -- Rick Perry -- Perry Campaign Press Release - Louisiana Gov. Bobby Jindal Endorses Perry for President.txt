    TAMPA, Fla. - Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal today endorsed Texas Gov. Rick Perry for president, praising the candidate's unmatched record of job creation, lower taxes and smaller government.
"Rick Perry is the candidate who can lead our party to victory in 2012," said Gov. Jindal. "His record on job creation simply cannot be beat, and the one million jobs he's helped create as governor is a stark contrast to the 2.4 million jobs lost on President Obama's watch. President Obama promised hope, but he simply hasn't delivered. Rick Perry will bring our country more than hope â€” he'll get America working again."
As Governor, Rick Perry has helped build the nation's top economy. Since June 2009, Texas is responsible for nearly 40 percent of the net new jobs in America.
"I truly appreciate Gov. Jindal's endorsement because he is a leader who knows what it takes to rebuild an economy and restore people's confidence," said Gov. Perry. "His efforts to cut taxes and reduce unreasonable regulations are helping the Louisiana economy grow, and that is exactly what I aim to do for America. I look forward to continuing to work with him throughout this campaign, and with his help, we'll get America working again."
