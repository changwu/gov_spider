    Every single Republican Senator in D.C. except for Sen. Tom Cotton supported the Corker framework. That's when Republicans surrendered to President Obama on the Iran deal. Many have argued that bill paved the way for Obama to only need 34 votes to win.
By endorsing the Corker-Cardin framework, the Senators allowed the deal to go ahead. Amazingly, only one Senator had the sense to oppose this. It was not any of the four Republican Senators running for President, it was not Ted Cruz, it was Tom Cotton. He was the only one who had the guts to stand up and say no. The vote was 98-1 by the way.
Here's the real problem â€“ Republicans in Washington got conned by the President. The Iranians conned the President, and the President conned the Republicans in the Senate. Senate Republicans are the only ones who are worse negotiators than President Obama.
