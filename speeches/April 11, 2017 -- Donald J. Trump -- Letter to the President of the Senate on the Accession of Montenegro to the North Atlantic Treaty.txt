    Dear Mr. President: 
Consistent with the condition set forth in the Senate resolution of advice and consent to ratification of the Protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty on the Accession of Montenegro of March 28, 2017, and based on the recommendation of the Department of State, I hereby certify to the Senate that:
(i) the inclusion of Montenegro in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will not have the effect of increasing the overall percentage share of the United States in the common budgets of NATO; and
(ii) the inclusion of Montenegro in NATO does not detract from the ability of the United States to meet or to fund its military requirements outside the North Atlantic area.
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
