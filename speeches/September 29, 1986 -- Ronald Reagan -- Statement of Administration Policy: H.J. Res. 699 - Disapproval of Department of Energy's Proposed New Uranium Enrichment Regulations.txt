    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Richardson (D) New Mexico and 8 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.J. Res. 699. The bill would disapprove criteria which are vital for DOE's uranium enrichment enterprise to remain a competitive and reliable supplier of enrichment services. The criteria would help maintain a financially healthy enterprise which is essential in order to preserve the multi-billion dollar Federal investment and to avoid the need for Federal subsidy in the future. The President's senior advisors would recommend disapproval of H.J. Res. 699.
