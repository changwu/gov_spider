    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
Many of our young people in America look forward to summer with both the hope and need for summer jobs. We in Government have an opportunity to assist them in their efforts to find that employment.
I am again requesting Federal managers to give their full support to the Federal Summer Employment Program for Youth. Our experience over the years demonstrates that this kind of investment in our young people pays handsome dividends.
In addition to the values gained by young people through their involvement in a wide range of activities, Federal departments and agencies benefit. Young employees can come as replacements for regular employees who are on vacation. They help do the work generated by increased workloads which some agencies experience during the summer months. They provide Government agencies with a chance to expand relationships with educational institutions, and they frequently gain fresh insights from contact with these young workers.
Apart from your selection of young people from the Summer Employment Examination, agency merit staffing plans, and the Federal Summer Intern Program, we must continue to see that needy youths have opportunities for Federal employment experiences. For the latter purpose, I am again setting a general goal of one needy youth for every 40 regular employees.
The Chairman of the Civil Service Commission will continue to provide leadership and guidance on all aspects of the Federal Summer Employment Program and will report to me on accomplishments. The support of your organization for this program has contributed greatly to its success in past years. I am confident that you will give this year's program your continued personal support.
