    A new Politico-Harvard poll found that 73% of Americans think that President Biden's American Rescue Plan will help them in some way, including 61% of Republicans and 62% of Independents. This is especially true for low-income Americans, with 78% of those earning less than $30k reporting the plan will help them, and 80% of those earning $30-100k reporting it will help them.
