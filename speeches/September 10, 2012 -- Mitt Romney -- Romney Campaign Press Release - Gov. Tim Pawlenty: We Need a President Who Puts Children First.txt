    Former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty today made the following statement on the strike by the Chicago Teachers Union:
"Once again, President Obama has put the interests of organized labor ahead of the American people. By refusing to condemn the Chicago Teachers Union strike, the President has sent a clear message that the hundreds of thousands of children who are suffering because of this strike take a back seat to his political allies. This is not leadership. We need a president and an education system that puts children first. Mitt Romney understands that, and that's just another reason we need him in the White House."
