    The President announced today that he has asked the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a Council of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention. This Council will bring experts together to assess current health promotion and disease prevention activities. The Council also will make recommendations for better use of resources and for innovative methods to encourage healthy lifestyles.
Prevention of disease and pursuit of good health is a relatively untapped field of study. The Council's work on health promotion and disease prevention should prove particularly valuable in controlling the increasing costs of health care. The administration appreciates the leadership of Congressman Don Ritter of Pennsylvania, who initiated the proposal to establish the Council.
