    Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) announced today his fundraising totals as a candidate for President of the United States. Senator Santorum, who announced for president just three weeks before the end of the fundraising quarter, raised $582,348 and his political action committee, America's Foundation, raised $489,866 in the first half of 2011. In total, Senator Santorum's efforts raised over $1 million.
"In the short amount of time since Senator Santorum has been a candidate for president, he was able to raise a significant amount of resources. It is worth noting that Senator Santorum didn't hold his first official fundraiser until June 22, and between that day and June 30, he raised nearly half of the money he raised as an official presidential candidate," said Amanda Kornegay, finance director for Rick Santorum for President.
"Since announcing for president on June 6, Senator Santorum has seen success in many ways. In addition to raising more than a half million dollars in three weeks, Senator Santorum's has earned significant endorsements in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, has had several straw poll victories and had commanding performances in the first two debates," said Mike Biundo, national political director for Rick Santorum for President. "Senator Santorum's commitment to visiting the early states more than any other candidate is paying off."
Senator Santorum's presidential committee will report over $229,000 cash on hand and has no debt.
