    Justice Brennan, my prospective members of the Commission:
I think this is a very good day for the country and for the political process that we're going through at the present time. At long, long last, after many regrettable delays, we are finally putting the Federal Election Commission back into business.
The significance of today, however, is that once again we have a watchdog to ensure that the election process proceeds as fairly and as honestly as possible in full accord with the law.
By their actions, the members of this Commission whom we are swearing in today can do a great deal to build and to restore public trust in the political process. This is one of the greatest contributions that anyone can make in public life in America.
So, all of us wish you the very best and wish you well as you begin your work once again.
It's now my pleasure to call upon Justice Brennan to administer the oath of office to these six outstanding individuals who have great responsibilities.
