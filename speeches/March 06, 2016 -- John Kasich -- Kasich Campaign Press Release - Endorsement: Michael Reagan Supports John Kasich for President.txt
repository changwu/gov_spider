    Today Michael Reagan endorsed Gov. John Kasich for President of the United States.
Said Reagan, "You see many Republicans claiming the label of 'Reagan conservative' but not many whose leadership truly embodies my father's principles and spirit. Gov. John Kasich is a noteworthy exception. As a Member of Congress, he made a name for himself as a problem-solver and a diplomat when he worked across the aisle to balance the federal budget. As Governor of Ohio, he used conservative, commonsense reforms to breathe new life into a state that was undergoing a painful decline. I'm confident that his record of success, his vision for America and his ability to bring people together is exactly what our country needs in the midst of division and uncertainty. To continue my father's great legacy, I'm proud to endorse John Kasich for President of the United States."

The son of former President Ronald Reagan and Academy-award winning actress Jane Wyman, Michael Reagan is a best-selling author, former radio host of 26 years and prominent national speaker on issues related to conservative politics and adoption. As president of the Reagan Legacy Foundation, he plays an active role in numerous charitable organizations.
Said Kasich, "There is no leader I could hope to emulate more than President Ronald Reagan. No one understands his impact on our country more than his son Michael, so to receive this endorsement is a tremendous honor for me. Just as President Reagan's indomitable optimism and capable leadership filled America with new hope, I will do my upmost to honor his legacy by offering experience and vision that can steer our country to better days."
