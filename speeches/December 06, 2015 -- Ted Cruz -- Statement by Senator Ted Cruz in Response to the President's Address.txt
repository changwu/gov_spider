    HOUSTON, Texas â€” Presidential candidate Ted Cruz issued the following statement in response to President Obama's remarks from the Oval Office tonight:
"On December 7, 1941, in response to Pearl Harbor, FDR did not give a partisan speech, rather he called on Americans to unite and 'win through to absolute victory'.
"If I am elected President, I will direct the Department of Defense to destroy ISIS. And I will shut down the broken immigration system that is letting jihadists into our country.
"Nothing President Obama said tonight will assist in either case."
