    Sir:
I ask Congress to consider expeditiously the enclosed requests for emergency FY 1993 supplemental appropriations. These requests provide for emergency expenses arising from the consequences of the recent heavy rains and flooding along the Mississippi River, particularly in the Upper Midwest. I ask further that the legislation in which these funds are provided be kept free of extraneous matters in order that there may be a minimum of delay in providing necessary funds to the disaster areas.
I hereby designate the following requests as emergency requirements pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended:
• Department of Agriculture, Commodity Credit Corporation, Commodity Credit Corporation fund: $600,000,000;
• Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, Emergency conservation program: $20,000,000;
• Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, Watershed and flood prevention operations: $25,000,000;
• Department of Defense—Civil, Corps of Engineers, Flood control and coastal emergencies: $45,000,000;
• Department of Housing and Urban Development, Community Planning and Development, Community development grants: $3,000,000;
• Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, Federal-aid highways: $100,000,000;
• Department of Transportation, United States Coast Guard, Operating expenses: $5,000,000;
• Small Business Administration, Disaster loan program account: $70,000,000; and
• Federal Emergency Management Agency, Disaster relief: $550,000,000.
The details of these requests are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with the Director's comments and observations.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
