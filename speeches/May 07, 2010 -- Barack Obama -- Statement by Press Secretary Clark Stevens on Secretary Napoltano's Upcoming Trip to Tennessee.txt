    "At the request of the President, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will visit Nashville, Tenn., and the surrounding area to meet with Governor Phil Bredesen and federal, state and local officials to discuss the impact of historic flooding resulting from severe weather, and view firsthand the response and recovery efforts ongoing in the state. Secretary Napolitano will join Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Craig Fugate, currently on his second trip to Tennessee since the flooding began. President Obama has declared a major disaster for Tennessee, and FEMA personnel are on the ground in support of the state's response and recovery efforts. More details on the trip will be released once they are finalized."
