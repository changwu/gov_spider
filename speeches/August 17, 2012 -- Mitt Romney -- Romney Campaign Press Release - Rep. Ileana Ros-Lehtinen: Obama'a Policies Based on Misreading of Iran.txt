    Florida Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen today made the following statement on today's comments made by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad:
"Ahmadinejad's incendiary comments are just another warning that a fuse is burning and that we need to do everything possible to stop Iran from acquiring the capability to build nuclear weapons that can destroy cities and cause unspeakable horror. Given the Obama Administration's track record in dealing with rogue regimes, I have many serious concerns about this administration's Iran policy. Obama's approach seems to be based on a complete misreading of the intentions of the ayatollahs. And by wasting precious time, his policies have placed the security of the state of Israel in jeopardy. It's past time for a change in leadership in the White House."
