    Mitt Romney today announced the support of leaders from Oklahoma.
"I am proud to have the support of these important leaders in Oklahoma," said Mitt Romney. "We will partner together to bring a message of job creation and economic recovery to every American."
Announcing his support, former Governor Frank Keating said, "Mitt Romney is the candidate who has a solid plan to get Americans working again, and a track record to go with it. He spent 25 years in the private sector turning around failing businesses and creating jobs. While Governor, he balanced the budget every year without raising taxes and left in place a $2 billion rainy day fund. I am proud to support Mitt Romney for President."
