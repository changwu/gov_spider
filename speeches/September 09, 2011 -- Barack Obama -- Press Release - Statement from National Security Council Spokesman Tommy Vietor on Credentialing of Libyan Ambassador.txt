    Today, President Obama accepted the credentials of Ali Suleiman Aujali as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Libyaâ€”the first representative to the United States from the new Libya, and one of the first Libyan diplomats internationally to be fully credentialed since Qadhafi's fall. The United States congratulates the Libyan people for their courage and determination to chart a new and democratic future for their country. Libyans have been an inspiration to the international community in their dignified struggle for freedom and a new way of life. As the Transitional National Council undertakes an inclusive and democratic political transition where human rights are respected and valued, it will find a strong ally in the United States. We look forward to working with Ambassador Aujali and his team in the coming months.
