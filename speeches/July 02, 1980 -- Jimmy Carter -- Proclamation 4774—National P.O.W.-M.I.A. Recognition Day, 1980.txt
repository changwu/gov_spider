  A Proclamation

In each of America's wars our prisoners of war have been called upon to make uncommon sacrifices. Upon them has fallen the arduous responsibility of defending American ideals under the absolute control of the enemy. Extremely difficult at best, this responsibility becomes magnified almost beyond comprehension when men and women are treated inhumanely-in violation of ordinary human compassion, fundamental moral standards, and basic international obligations.
The Congress has by Joint Resolution designated July 18, 1980 as "National P.O.W.-M.I.A. Recognition Day."
All Americans should recognize the special debt we owe our fellow citizens who, as prisoners during wartime, sacrificed their freedom that we might enjoy the blessings of peace and liberty. Likewise, we must remember the unresolved casualties of war?our soldiers who are still missing. The pain and bitterness of war endures for their families, relatives, and friends.
Our Nation will continue to seek answers to the many questions that remain about their fate.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Friday, July 18, 1980, as National P.O.W.-M.I.A. Recognition Day, a day dedicated to all former American prisoners of war, those still missing, and to their families. I call on all Americans to join in honoring those who made the uncommon sacrifice of being held captive in war, and their loved ones.
And I call on State and local officials and private organizations to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.

JIMMY CARTER
