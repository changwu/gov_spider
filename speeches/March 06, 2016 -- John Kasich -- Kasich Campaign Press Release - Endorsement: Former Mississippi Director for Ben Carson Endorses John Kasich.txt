    Today, Daniel Ashford, the former Mississippi director for Dr. Ben Carson's presidential campaign, endorsed John Kasich for president and joined the Kasich for America leadership team.
"I believe in John Kasich because he represents the best chance to defeat Hillary Clinton and progressivism this year," Ashford said. "He has a proven record that could save my generation from socialism and economic collapse."

Daniel is a resident of Madison, Mississippi. He is a junior at the University of Alabama and previously worked on the campaign for Governor Phil Bryant.
Said Kasich, "I am very thankful to have Daniel Ashford's support. He is a dedicated, conservative leader and he understands that to defeat Hillary Clinton we need a positive, solutions-driven message that empowers everyoneâ€” not Washington bureaucrats. He will be a great asset to our team in Mississippi."
