    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Hatch (R) Utah)
The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 2037. Enactment of legislation implementing the two new World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) treaties is crucial for promoting electronic commerce over the Internet and in other networking environments, and for protecting U.S. copyrighted works from international piracy.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
S. 2037 would affect receipts and direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary PAYGO estimate is being developed.
