Let me just say on Lithuania -- and this is all I'll say on it right now -- obviously, we are watching the situation very, very closely. And we are waiting to see if the Soviet announcements are implemented. Clearly, those announcements are contrary to the approach that we have urged and that others have urged upon the Soviet Union. We are considering appropriate responses if these threats are implemented.

Q. But what is your -- --
The President. That's all. Some missed it: I said I'd take no questions. Some missed it: I said I would take no questions.
