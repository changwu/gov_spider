    The 2 days of meetings were serious, substantive, and businesslike. Each side was able to hear the other out in detail and to express its own views. The United States and the Soviets explored ideas and had a good exchange. This dialog is intended to support the Geneva negotiations and the Shultz-Shevardnadze meeting set for September. It is also a part of the overall U.S.-Soviet diplomatic process in arms control and other key areas of the bilateral agenda. We remain committed to our invitation for a summit in the United States this year. This dialog on arms control issues will be continued. We anticipate that this group of experts will meet again in the near future and will set the exact date in the next several days through diplomatic channels.
