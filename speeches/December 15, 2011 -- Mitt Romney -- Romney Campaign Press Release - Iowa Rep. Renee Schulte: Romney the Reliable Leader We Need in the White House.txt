    Iowa State Representative Renee Schulte made the following statement on tonight's debate in Iowa:
"Mitt Romney won tonight's debate by again proving that we need a president from outside Washington with private sector experience, not another Washington insider. Throughout his life, Mitt Romney has demonstrated the leadership experience required of the president; Newt Gingrich has proved time and again that he is an unreliable leader. Speaker Gingrich's recent attacks on Paul Ryan's plan and the private sector are prime examples of why he is not trusted by conservatives. We need a president who has experience creating jobs, not someone who only has theories about how to create them."Â
