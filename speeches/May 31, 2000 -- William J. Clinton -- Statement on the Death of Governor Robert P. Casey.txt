    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of Governor Bob Casey. Over the many years I knew him, I came to admire his toughness, tenacity, and commitment to principle. Those are the qualities that helped the son of a mule tender in the coal mines of northeastern Pennsylvania lead a life of dedicated public service, culminating in two successful terms as Governor.
Throughout his career, Bob fought tirelessly for the people of Pennsylvania, never losing sight of the poor and their children. That devotion was reflected in his support of universal health care, tougher environmental laws, expanded educational opportunity, and strong labor protections.
As Governors, Bob and I worked together on many of these causes. And when we disagreed, I understood that his views were based on deep religious beliefs and a commitment to his convictions.
Hillary and I send our thoughts and prayers to his wife, Ellen, and the entire Casey family.
