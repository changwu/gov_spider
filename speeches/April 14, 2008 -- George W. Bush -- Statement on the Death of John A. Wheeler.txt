    Laura and I are saddened by the death of John Archibald Wheeler, one of America's greatest physicists.
During his distinguished career, Dr. Wheeler collaborated with scientists such as Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr on projects that changed the course of history. His early work with Bohr on how nuclei split apart, his vision of the possibilities of Einstein's curved space, and his work on quantum theory demonstrated his innovation and brilliance. And he will always be remembered for giving the phenomenon of black holes its name.
Dr. Wheeler was also a great teacher who understood that educating young minds would be one of his most significant contributions. As a professor at Princeton University and the University of Texasâ€” Austin, Dr. Wheeler inspired generations of students, such as the late Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard Feynman, to transform their curiosity into scientific discoveries.
Today our thoughts and prayers are with the Wheeler family.
