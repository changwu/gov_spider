    Former Minnesota Senator Norm Coleman today made the following statement on comments made by the South Carolina Democratic Party chairman:Â 
"Democratic Party officials need to cease and desist from comparing those with whom they disagree to Nazis. The latest offender is Dick Harpootlian, the South Carolina Democratic Party chairman, whose outrageous words I will not repeat. In recent days, we've seen similarly disgraceful statements from a top Kansas Democratic delegate and from the chairman of the California Democratic Party. President Obama has called for civility in American politics. If his call is to be taken seriously, it's time for the President to rein in those of his supporters and allies who are trivializing Nazism while also shamelessly trampling on the most basic rules of American political discourse."
