    The Vice President met today with Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs Marcelo Ebrard at the White House. The Vice President acknowledged the Government of Mexico's meaningful and unprecedented steps to help curb the flow of illegal immigration to the U.S. border since the launch of the U.S.-Mexico Declaration in Washington on June 7, 2019. The Vice President commended Mexico's establishment of a National Guard and its deployment of thousands of troops to Mexico's borders to stem the flow of illegal migrants through Mexico. The leaders agreed that while progress has been made, more work remains in order to further reduce the flow of illegal migrants to the United States.
The Vice President highlighted the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's efforts to expand implementation of the Migrant Protection Protocols in order to expedite processing of immigration claims, and noted the need to work closely with the Government of Mexico to further expand these efforts. The leaders agreed to implement the Migrant Protection Protocols to the fullest extent possible.
