    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Minnesota leaders.
"I'm quite proud to have the support of these Minnesota conservative leaders," said Mitt Romney. "This wide-ranging support shows that my message of a smaller, simpler, and smarter federal government is resonating with Minnesotans as it is with voters across the country. I'm counting on these leaders to help me spread this message in the months to come."
Announcing his support, Speaker Kurt Zellers said, "Minnesotans simply cannot take four more years of President Obama's disastrous policies. Mitt Romney is the conservative candidate who has a clear plan to empower small businesses, rebuild the middle class, and create long-lasting economic growth. I am endorsing Mitt because he will work to improve the economy, reduce burdensome regulations and reverse economic policies that expand government rather than private sector job growth."
