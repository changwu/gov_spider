    IN THE death of President Georges Pompidou, France has lost one of her great leaders, and the world has lost a great statesman.
My profound personal regret is deepened by the fact that President Pompidou's first official visit upon acceding to office was to the United States. On that occasion and in my other meetings with him, I found him to be a man of vision, constraint, consistency, and enormous strength of character. He came from the Auvergne, the heart of France, and he reflected all the spirit and strength of the French people.
It was characteristic of his courage that despite his illness, he did not falter in his service to his people, nor to the purposes of world peace.
The people of America join me in extending our deepest sympathy to the people of France.
