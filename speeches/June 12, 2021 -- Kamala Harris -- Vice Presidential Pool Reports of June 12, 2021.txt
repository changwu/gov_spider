VP Supplemental Pool #2 â€” OTR over 
The Vice President and second gentleman walked with crowd down 13th and stopped at Pennsylvania/E.
She talked to the crowd for a bit. Pool could not hear much but she did say:
"We still have so much to do. We celebrate all the accomplishments. Finally marriage is the law of the land. We need to make sure that our transgender community are all protected."
"There is so much more work to do and I know we are committed."
The crowd chanted her name over and over. She stayed for about ten minutes waving and talking.
At the end, a bald man in a suit with a phone recording yelled "Kamala when are you going to the border." Stills believe it was a MTG staffer but I have NOT confirmed.
