    If you've ever worn the uniform, worked a shift on an assembly line, or sacrificed to make ends meet, then you've had a voice and a vote in Senator Carl Levin. No one has worked harder to bring manufacturing jobs back to our shores, close unfair tax loopholes, and ensure that everyone plays by the same set of rules. As Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin is a true champion for all those who serve, and his tireless work will be missed not just in his home State of Michigan, but by military families across our country. Michelle and I wish Carl, Barbara, and their family all the best, and I look forward to working with Carl over the next 2 years as we continue tackling some of our Nation's toughest challenges.
