    "There is no question that the global coronavirus pandemic is impacting every aspect of Americans' lives. President Trump is leading the nation through this crisis by approaching the problem in two ways: protecting the health and safety of our citizens and safeguarding the economy. The President has negotiated relief packages for unemployed workers and businesses, while also launching the Paycheck Protection Program through the Small Business Administration. Small businesses are the backbone of the economy and this program provides eight weeks of cash for small business that keep paying workers during this crisis. New loans are also available, which will be forgiven if businesses keep their employees on payroll and the money is used for rent or salaries. The American economy reached new heights under President Trump's leadership and he is clearly best suited to see our country through this difficult period.
"Joe Biden, meanwhile, continues his useless partisan sniping from the sidelines, offering incoherent musings during friendly interviews in his futile quest to stay relevant. His record, overseeing the slowest economic recovery since World War II as Vice President and supporting job-killing trade deals like NAFTA and TPP, render him unqualified to lead in a time of economic crisis. As a response to the coronavirus outbreak, he has proposed enacting the economy-strangling Green New Deal and has even endorsed local tax increases in Wisconsin. His policies would cost the nation millions of jobs at a time when families are looking for help, not higher hurdles and heavier burdens. The contrast has never been clearer between President Trump's record of economic accomplishment and Joe Biden's disastrous history and terrible proposals."
