    I am very pleased that USDA is presenting this comprehensive proposal to Congress today.
With this package, we are saying to the Congress that we expect the Food Stamp Program to continue to get food to people who need it but that we will not tolerate criminals who defraud the system and seek to profit from the hunger of others.
Over the past 2 years, this administration has made restoring public trust in Government a top priority. As part of our comprehensive strategy to reinvent the Food Stamp Program, we are today asking Congress for broad new powers, comprised of 13 specific items, to counterattack those who have exploited the program.
This administration has made clear our opposition to block grants for our nutrition programs. With this tough, workable antifraud initiative, we are ensuring that the Food Stamp Program will earn the public trust, and continue to help people who need it.
