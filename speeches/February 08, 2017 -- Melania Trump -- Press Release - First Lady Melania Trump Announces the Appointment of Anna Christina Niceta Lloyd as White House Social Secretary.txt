"Rickie brings with her over twenty-two years of solid diplomatic, political and social entertaining experience," said First Lady Melania Trump. "I am looking forward to sharing my ideas and traditions of entertaining and social hospitality to America's house, my new home as well. That, along with Rickie's vast experience, I am even more excited."

Ms. Niceta Lloyd is married to Thomas Lloyd, grandson of the late Bunny Mellon, wife of Paul Mellon, friend and mentor to Jacqueline Kennedy.
Mrs. Mellon was instrumental in designing the White House Rose Garden with First Lady Mrs. Kennedy. Ms. Niceta Lloyd's formidable precision and elegance was greatly influenced by Mrs. Mellon. Ms. Niceta Lloyd, along with her husband and two children live in Chevy Chase, Maryland.
