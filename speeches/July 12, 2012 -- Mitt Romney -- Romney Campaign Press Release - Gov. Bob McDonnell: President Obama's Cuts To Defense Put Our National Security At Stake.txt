    Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell today made the following statement on President Obama's devastating cuts to defense spending:
"Virginia is the home of America's military. We are home to the Pentagon, to Quantico, to Norfolk, to Langley AFB, and so many other critical components of our nation's armed forces. The President has put our defense budget on course for radical cuts that even his own Secretary of Defense says will be "devastating" to U.S. national security. An American president's most fundamental duty is to protect our country. As the Governor of Virginia, but also as a veteran, the son of a veteran and the father of a veteran, I fully understand that what is at stake is not only a potentially major economic blow to the Commonwealth but a great deal more: namely, our national security in a dangerous world."
