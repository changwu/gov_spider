    "Today's Supreme Court ruling to strike down commonsense health regulations on the abortion industry and deny women the protection they need in times of crisis is disappointing to say the least. States should have the ability to regulate medical procedures, including abortions, to protect the health and safety of their citizens. Instead, five unelected Supreme Court Justices decided to insert their political agenda in place of democratically determined policies. This case underscores the importance of re-electing President Trump, who has a record of appointing conservative judges, rather than Joe Biden, who will appoint radical, activist judges who will legislate from the courts."
