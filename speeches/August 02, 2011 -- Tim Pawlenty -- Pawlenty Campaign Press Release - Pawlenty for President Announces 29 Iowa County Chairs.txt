    Gov. Tim Pawlenty today released the names of 29 Iowa county chairs, underscoring his growing organizational strength in the state that holds the first-in-the-nation caucuses to launch the battle for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.
"I am honored to have such strong leadership at the grassroots level, which will be crucial to the success of my campaign in Iowa," Gov. Pawlenty said. "I'm grateful to these individuals for serving as leaders in their communities and for sharing my vision to rein in federal spending, reduce job-killing regulations and repeal President Obama's costly, government-mandated health care legislation."
"We're excited to welcome this accomplished group of activists to our team," Senior Political Advisor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. "As Gov. Pawlenty spends more time in the state, his message and fiscal vision for our country is increasingly resonating with Iowans, attracting the best talent to join his organization."
