    President, Vice President and Agency Officials Will Call for Building on Recovery Act Success with Action on Additional Job Creation Measures
WASHINGTON, DC - As the Recovery Act crosses the one-year mark, Administration officials will travel to over 35 communities across the country this week to survey Recovery Act progress to-date and continue the Administration's push for additional job creation measures to put more people back to work. Governors, mayors and Members of Congress will participate in the meetings and events, which will be held in more than 25 states and in every region of the country.
On Wednesday, President Obama will mark the anniversary here at the White House with an event involving Americans from across the country who have benefited from the Recovery Act. Today, the Vice President is spending the day in Saginaw, MI, hearing from local residents how the Recovery Act is helping this hard-hit former auto community reinvent itself to be competitive in the 21st century economy.
At the events, Administration officials will discuss how the President's additional job creation proposals will build on early Recovery Act progress to create more jobs and drive more economic growth. From assistance for small businesses to additional investment in green energy retrofits, many of the President's proposals are expansions or extensions some of the most popular and effective Recovery Act programs.
The Recovery Act was signed into law by President Obama on February 17, 2009. The program is a combination of tax relief, financial assistance and infrastructure projects designed to cushion the impact of the downturn and lay a foundation for economic recovery. Public and private forecasters estimate the program is already responsible for about 2 million jobs - putting it on-target to support more than 3.5 million jobs by the end of 2010.
