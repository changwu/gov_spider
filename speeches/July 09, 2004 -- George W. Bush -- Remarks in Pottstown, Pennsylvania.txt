    Thank you all very much for coming out to say hello. I'm honored to be here. I'm here to ask for your vote. I'm campaigning because I want America to be a safer place, a stronger place, and a better place.
It's such an honor to be in the great State of Pennsylvania, and it's such an honor to represent the greatest country on the face of the Earth. Thanks for coming out to say hello. May God bless you all, and may God continue to bless the United States of America.
