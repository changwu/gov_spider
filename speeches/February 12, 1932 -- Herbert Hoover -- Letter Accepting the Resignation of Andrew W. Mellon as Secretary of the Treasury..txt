    My dear Mr. Mellon:
I am in receipt of your resignation as Secretary of the Treasury, which I of course accept.
There is little need for me to comment in appreciation of the eleven years of service you have given to our country. I know of no more magnificent tribute that has come to a public servant than the universal expressions of the press and the public toward you during the past few days.
I am in hopes that your new and important responsibilities will prove congenial, and I am well aware of the extent of the burdens which you are undertaking out of a sense of patriotic duty.
I wish to take this occasion to again express the feeling of personal loss I have after these years of association in the Cabinet.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[The Honorable Andrew W. Mellon, Washington, D.C. ]
