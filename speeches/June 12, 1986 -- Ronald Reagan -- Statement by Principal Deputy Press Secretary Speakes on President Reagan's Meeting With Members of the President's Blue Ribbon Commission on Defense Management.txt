    President Reagan met today with David Packard and the members of the President's Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management. Mr. Packard briefed the President on the contents of the Commission's final report, which will be submitted to the President on June 30.
In his briefing, Mr. Packard noted that much progress has been made in implementing the Commission's recommendations within both the government and industry. Mr. Packard was especially pleased that a group of 24 major defense contractors has developed a code of ethics and procedures to review compliance with the code, in line with the recommendations of the Commission's interim report. He hopes that other firms will join this important initiative. The Commission will address the industry initiative in its final report to the President. Mr. Packard also noted that the Commission will soon publish a supplemental report containing more detailed recommendations for improving national security planning and budgeting procedures. The Commission's final report will also recommend development of centers of excellence in defense management that are similar to successful management initiatives used by industry.
Secretary Weinberger was also present at the meeting and outlined to the Commission and to the President the progress the Department of Defense has made in implementation of the Commission's recommendations to date. The President was pleased with Secretary Weinberger's report and asked that Mr. Packard and Secretary Weinberger report to him again early next year on the Department's progress.
