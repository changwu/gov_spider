    President Donald J. Trump hosted a working lunch in New York today with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and President Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea. The three leaders agreed that North Korea's continued aggressive actions—including its two recent missile launches that overflew Japan and its September 3, 2017 nuclear test—constitute clear and growing threats to their countries as well as to the rest of the world. The leaders committed to the fast and full implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2375, and they resolved to work with all other countries to achieve that goal. They agreed to mobilize all available means to maximize pressure on North Korea and call on all other nations to do the same. The three leaders agreed that North Korea's provocative actions have drawn their nations even closer together. Finally, they affirmed close and continuing coordination in preparation for President Trump's visits to Japan and the Republic of Korea later this year.
