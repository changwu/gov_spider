    Muscatine County Ironworker and Former Barack Obama Labor Steering Committee Member Switches Support to Hillary as Momentum on the Ground Continues to Grow
DES MOINES, IA — As the Clinton campaign's momentum continues to build in Iowa, the campaign spotlighted Bob McFadden of Muscatine County, an ironworker and former Barack Obama campaign labor steering committee member, who has switched his support to Hillary Clinton.
McFadden switched to Hillary because he wants a candidate who has the strength and experience to enact real solutions to the country's big challenges.
"Hillary Clinton won't just talk the talk – she cares about the issues important to all of us and will work to change the direction of our country," McFadden said. "I support Hillary because she has the strength and experience to enact universal health care and deliver the real solutions our country needs."
As momentum continues to grow for Hillary's candidacy, more and more Iowans are deciding to caucus for her on January 3rd. Hillary will launch the "Big Challenges, Real Solutions Tour – Time to Pick a President Tour" on December 26th. During the tour, Hillary Clinton will outline the challenges that Americans face at home and around the world and how her unique background makes her the most qualified person to be the next President of the United States.
