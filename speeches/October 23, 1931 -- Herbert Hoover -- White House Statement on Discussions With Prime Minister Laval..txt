There is no remote basis whatever for statements as to "demands, .... terms of settlement," or any other like discussions. Happily, there are no controversies to be settled between France and America. None such exist. The sole purpose of these conversations is the earnest, frank exchange of views with view to finding common ground for helpful action in the promotion of constructive progress in the world.
