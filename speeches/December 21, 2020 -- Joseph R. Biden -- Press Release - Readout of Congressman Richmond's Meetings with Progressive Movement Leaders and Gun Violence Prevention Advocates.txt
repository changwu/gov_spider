    Cedric Richmond, incoming Senior Advisor to the President and Director of the White House Office of Public Engagement, held virtual meetings today with progressive movement leaders and advocates and survivors of gun violence.
The meeting with advocates and survivors of gun violence included groups that work on a range of issues — including mass shootings, suicide, domestic violence, and everyday gun violence disproportionately impacting communities of color. They discussed how a Biden-Harris Administration can support their work and improve coordination on gun violence prevention at the federal, state, and local level — and how gun violence should be treated as a public health crisis. Congressman Richmond reiterated President-elect Joe Biden's commitment to ending the gun violence crisis.
The meeting with progressive movement leaders focused on how the economic crisis has hit Black, Latino, and Native American communities especially hard, with higher levels of unemployment and small business closure rates. They also discussed police and criminal justice reform, homelessness, and environmental justice. Congressman Richmond reiterated the Biden-Harris Administration's plan to Build Back Better and deliver for working and commitment to working with stakeholders to address the needs of working families.
