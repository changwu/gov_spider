    Earlier today, President Obama spoke with President Lula of Brazil and Prime Minister Tillman Thomas of Grenada as a part of his effort to advance a positive outcome at Copenhagen.
President Obama stressed to President Lula the importance of our two countries continuing to work closely to help achieve a robust agreement that makes real progress in forging global action to confront the threat of climate change. He noted the key role Brazil is playing, and explained both the steps that have been taken in the United States, and his commitment to an agreement in Copenhagen with emissions reductions, financing, and a transparent and internationally verifiable compliance regime. He emphasized the need for a strong foundation that includes action by all countries.
With Prime Minister Thomas, whose country chairs the negotiating group for the Alliance of Small Island States, the President stressed the importance of creating a successful framework for emissions reductions and the importance of putting into place suitable financing mechanisms and a transparent and internationally verifiable compliance regime.
