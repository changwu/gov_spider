    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Burdick (D) North Dakota)
The administration supports Senate passage of the "Federal Aid Highway Act of 1987," as reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee, without controversial amendments so that the Federal-aid highway program may be reauthorized without further unnecessary delay. If the bill is amended to increase spending for either "demonstration" or regular highway projects, or to authorize spending for mass transit programs at levels inconsistent with the President's proposals, the President's senior advisers would recommend a veto of the bill.
If the bill is amended to reauthorize the mass transit program, the administration urges the adoption of provisions in the "Mass Transportation Improvement Act of 1987" transmitted to Congress by the Secretary of Transportation on January 20th which would fund transit programs exclusively by formula from the Highway Trust Fund. The administration opposes the mass transit reauthorization bill as ordered reported by the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee.
The administration recommends the adoption of amendments to:
— incorporate the administration's proposed "Highway Safety Act of 1987," and "Highway Revenue Act of 1987" which would add $822 million to the Highway Trust Fund in 1988 and $900 million in each subsequent year by eliminating fuel tax exemptions; and
— delete provisions concerning (1) Federal liability for certain civil actions against the National Academy of Sciences involving activities conducted under or in connection with the Strategic Highway Research Program; (2) disclosure and admission as evidence of certain State reports and surveys concerning highway hazards mitigation; and (3) the relocation of utility facilities.
