    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Martinez (D) California and 6 others)
The Administration is strongly opposed to enactment of H.R. 5194 because it would: (1) inhibit the juvenile justice system's ability to deal effectively with violent juvenile offenders; (2) fail to address the need to provide for early intervention and an array of intermediate sanctions for at-risk youth; and (3) duplicate programs available throughout the Federal Government.
In particular, H.R. 5194, as reported, would:

—   Expand the definition of "jail or lockup for adults." This would have the effect of requiring separate facilities for juveniles and adults throughout all stages of the juvenile justice system, imposing an undue burden on State and local penal systems.
—   Expand the use of Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) funds to duplicate social service activities. This expansion goes beyond the scope of juvenile justice and duplicates services available from other Federal agencies, such as the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services.
—   Effectively remove OJJDP from the Office of Justice Programs. This will fragment and impair coordination of juvenile justice efforts.
—   Fail to recognize OJJDP's role as coordinator for all Federal juvenile justice and delinquency prevention programs and, instead, would place more services within OJJDP's direct jurisdiction.
Eliminate critical language regarding confidentiality rights of parents and guardians in the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA). The Administration believes that the current restrictions on disclosure in CAPTA are appropriate.
