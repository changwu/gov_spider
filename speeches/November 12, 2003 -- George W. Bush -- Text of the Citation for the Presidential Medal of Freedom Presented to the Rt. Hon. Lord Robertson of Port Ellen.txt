    Following is the text of the citation for the Presidential Medal of Freedom presented earlier today by the President:
The Rt. Hon. Lord Robertson of Port Ellen
With vision and leadership, George Robertson has helped transform NATO to meet the challenges of a new century. As the 10th Secretary General of NATO, he has distinguished himself as a passionate spokesman for freedom, an advocate for democracy, and a true friend of the United States. Leading NATO through its historic enlargement, he was instrumental in its decision to send aircraft to patrol American skies after September 11, 2001, the first time NATO has activated its founding principle of collective defense. The United States honors this statesman for his dedicated service and for his unique contributions to the advancement of peace and liberty around the world.
