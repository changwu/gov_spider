    Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal made the following statement on President Obama's remarks to the Democratic National Convention: 
"Americans across the country know that they're not better off today than they were four years ago. No amount of lofty rhetoric, promises of hope, or appeals for more time can make up for three and a half years of disastrous economic policies that have left millions of people out of work, underwater on their mortgages, and struggling to stay out of poverty. Our country needs and deserves better -- and that demands new leadership in the White House. Mitt Romney knows what it takes to create jobs and grow the economy, and he has the experience and the plan our country needs to get back on track."
