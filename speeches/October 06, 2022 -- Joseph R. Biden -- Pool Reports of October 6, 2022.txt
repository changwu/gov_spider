Travel Pool #5 IBM
(Entire pool had zero cell service/wifi at the IBM warehouse, so sorry for the delay in sending this. No major news.)
Biden arrived at the first stop of the tour at the IBM warehouse at 1:35 pm with the company's CEO Arvind Krishna. Biden walked by some IBM employees and asked how they were doing and thanked them.
He received a brief history of IBM as he walked over to an area where old IBM mainframes were set up to show how things have changed. He looked at the latest generation and the chips in the memory cards. He shook hands with some employees waiting for him in the area.
"More is going to change in the next 10 years than it has in the last 40," he said.
"Where in gods name is it written that we can't be the manufacturing hub of the world? There's a lot of reasons to be optimistic."
The IBM CEO praised the chips bill.
At one point, POTUS said, "There are some people who want to take away social security." It was unclear what that was in response to. Poolers guess is it was related to the CEO talking about secure transactions and info processed by mainframes.
Biden was in an area underneath signs that said "stretch wrap" and "pre stretch wrap". To the side was another sign that read "A Future Made in America."
Pool was moved to the second stop on the tour at 1:41 pm where a quantum computer was set up. Biden walked over to us at 1:43 pm. He shook hands with more employees, telling the first one "you look like you spend a lot of time in the gym."
One of them pointed to chips in the quantum computer and explained the advantages of it. "The impossible will become possible," the employee said, saying the chips act would help accelerate the technology.
Biden mentioned that it could be used in cancer research/radiation work.
Mr. Krishna then showed POTUS the back of the machine. Biden thanked him and have him a side hug. Pool ushered out of that area at 1:48 pm.
Joining him on the tour were:
Arvind Krishna, CEO IBMNY Gov HochulRep. Sean Patrick MaloneyRep. Patrick Ryan
Next up: Remarks, which were live-streamed. Pool will not be sending full quotes.
Speaking program:
Arvind Krishna, IBM CEOAbigail Wise, IBM Z Quality Engineer, who introduced POTUS.
POTUS came out on stage at 2:02 pm. He wrapped at 2:22 pm. He walked around the audience in the warehouse and shook hands and took photos with people but pool was ushered out.

Pool entered the foyer of Gov. Murphy's mansion at 4:32 pm. Pool listened to the remarks in the family room from here.
The governor and his wife opened with quick remarks. Donors were seated on plush couches around the family room.
POTUS began speaking at 4:34 pm. He spoke for roughly 30 mins. He jumped around to different topics. No news.
Please check quotes against transcript.
"There's an election coming up," Biden said with a laugh.
"There really is a lot at stake… based on statistics Democrats are running uphill," he said
"But so far it looks like the Senate we are not only going to hold but maybe pick up a couple of seats"
He said gerrymandering is going to make the House tougher. Mentioned recent surprises in special elections. "So there's a lot going on and a lot at stake."
"There's an overwhelming concern about democracy," he said of what the polls are showing before criticizing MAGA Republicans.
"It's a different time," he said.
Then moved on to the Dobbs decision and inflation. "My dad used to say everyone is entitled to a little bit of breathing room… and we're trying very hard to give them a little bit of breathing room."
Brought up lowering prescription drug prices as an example of giving people breathing room.
Biden then touted the passage of the gun bill, saying there was more left to do.
Next issue was climate change. He said he's spent a lot of time visiting states affected by natural disasters. "I just got back from Fort Myers…it's a literal disaster."
"There's no denying anymore that there is something fundamental that is changing."
Biden then talked about voting rights briefly and went back to gun violence, talking about kids being "scared to death" to go back to school.
He brought up problems with democracy around the world.
"You see what's happening in Hungary, which happens to be a NATO member… the point is there's a lot we can do about it."
Biden said there's a lot he's been able to get passed even though his agenda was considered dead on arrival.
Touted passage of ARP and infrastructure laws and jobs created under his administration. Said he had a reputation for being bipartisan as a senator, "but a lot of it has changed."
Then moved to CHIPS act. Reiterated some of his remarks from this morning. "There's a lot to be positive about."
"I'm trying to figure out how I can shorten all of this for you all," Biden said to laughs, as he went back to the Inflation Reduction Act to talk about the climate provisions.
Went back to Dobbs. "It's not just going to be abortion. It's going to be contraception….they are heading that way in some states right now."
"If you look at the record, we've made some genuine progress," Biden said.
Donors laughed when he said his dads saying of not being compared to the almighty but the alternative.
Biden then criticized Sen. Rick Scott's proposal. "These are basic, fundamental programs that have overwhelming support from the American public."
" I promise you if we maintain control we're going to eliminate assault weapons again…," he went on to talk about the importance of an educated workforce.
To wrap up, Biden again explained why he first ran for president. "There's a lot more but I've probably already said too much."
Pool ushered out as POTUS began taking questions at 5:04 pm.
Towards the end of his remarks, Biden left the lectern and walked around the room with a mic.
At the the governors sprawling water front property, pool spotted a basketball/tennis court, infinity pool, a kids soccer field and shuffleboard court. The mansion and pool house have a Spanish-style architecture with water fountain by a circular driveway.
In the family room, Murphy had photos of him with Bill Clinton, Obama and Angela Merkel.

Travel Pool #15 (correct #) Remarks/Putin quote
(Previous report should have been #14 — sorry!)
POTUS started speaking at 7:33 pm. He spoke for about 22 mins. Remarks were similar to previous fundraiser but spoke a lot more about foreign policy and he did bring up Putin. Those Putin quotes in bold below. Please check against transcript. (Thanks to AFP's Aurelia End for help)
Biden opened with "This is not your father's Republican Party."
"There's an assault on all these institutions," named the Supreme Court, White House.
Spoke of the challenges with governing with an evenly divided Senate.
"I feel pretty good where we are as it relates to the senate but it's premature…" he said
Repeated the line from previous fundraiser that House was a different story because of gerrymandering.
Moved on to Dobbs, "a lot of things are in play," bringing up contraception. Then moved to climate change. "The Colorado River is a bit of a canal now."
Touted passage of IRA, spoke of the insulin provision. Criticized Sens. Rick Scott and Ron Johnson again.
"So there's a lot at stake."
He said a lot was at stake in foreign policy too. Said he would continue to support Ukraine, spoke of the nuclear threat.
"First time since the Cuban missile crisis, we have the threat of a nuclear weapon if in fact things continue down the path they are going."
"We are trying to figure out what is Putin's off ramp? Where does he find a way out? Where does he find himself where he does not only lose face but significant power?"
He said he's spent a lot of time trying to hold NATO together. "There's a lot of changes going on."
Spoke of the CHIPS Act and his visit to IBM this morning.
Went back to Putin:
" We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis. 
"We've got a guy I know fairly well," he said of Putin. "He's not joking when he talks about potential use of tactical nuclear weapons or biological or chemical weapons because his military is you might say significantly underperforming." 
" I don't think there's any such thing as the ability to easily (use) a tactical nuclear weapon and not end up with Armageddon."
"I didn't realize how much serious damage the previous administration did to our foreign policy. "
Pool listened to the remarks from a staircase next to the room where the event was taking place and could not see much. Looked like there were large art pieces on every wall around the room. We were ushered out at 7:53 as Sen. Peters took the mic.
We came in as James Murdoch was introducing the president. There was a lectern set up but the President moved to the middle of the room.
