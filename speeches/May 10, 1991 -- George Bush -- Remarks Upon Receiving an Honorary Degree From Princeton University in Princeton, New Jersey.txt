    Thank you all very much. This is indeed for me an honor. And the last time, save one, that I was on this campus, I was not treated quite so hospitably. [Laughter] It was out at the baseball diamond, I think in 1948. Crowded along the first baseline -- it was very hostile, the way it worked in Princeton -- were a bunch of hyperventilating, celebrating alumni.
And I remember standing there at first base, and a gigantic tiger -- I think his name was Neil Zundel -- came to the plate. He lofted an easy fly towards Yale's first baseman, me. And as I reached for the ball, the guy just sheer bowled me over -- [laughter] -- to the cheers of the Princeton alumni. [Laughter]
I was hurt, my pride was hurt. But P.S., Yale won the ball game. [Laughter]
So, how lovely today it is, though. And I view this degree as a very high honor from an institution for which I have unlimited respect. It is a great privilege for Barbara and me to be up with you today. I hear the rites of spring over my shoulder out there, but it wouldn't be normal in my job if we didn't hear those rites chanting out there. But I hope I bring peace and tranquility to your campus because you bring great joy to our heart, my formerly fibrillating heart.
Thank you very much.
