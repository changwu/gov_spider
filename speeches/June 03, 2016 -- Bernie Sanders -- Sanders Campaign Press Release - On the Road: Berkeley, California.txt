    The Labor Department on Friday announced that nearly half a million Americans dropped out of the workforce in May. So while the official unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent, the reason for the decline raised red flags. Real unemployment in May remained at 9.7 percent. That figure counts those who gave up looking for work and those forced to settle for part-time jobs. "It was a bad day for American workers," U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders said at a news conference with former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich. Sanders, who is running for president, and Reich, who served in the administration of President Bill Clinton, discussed jobs and the economy during the news conference at the University of California at Berkeley.
