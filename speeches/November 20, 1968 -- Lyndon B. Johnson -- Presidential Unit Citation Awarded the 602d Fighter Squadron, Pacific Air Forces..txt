    CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION TO THE 602D FIGHTER SQUADRON
The 602d Fighter Squadron, Pacific Air Forces, distinguished itself by extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against opposing armed forces in Southeast Asia from 12 April 1967 to 30 July 1967. During this period, the pilots of the 602d Fighter Squadron flew approximately 400 sorties a month in the accomplishment of their diverse and extremely hazardous mission. Despite a formidable array of defenses, the Squadron was responsible for the safe recovery of 25 aircrew members, approximately 2,000 enemy troop losses, and the destruction of 120 trucks, numerous buildings, and a host of anti-aircraft weapons. Through their extraordinary heroism, superb airmanship, and aggressiveness in the face of the enemy, members of the 602d Fighter Squadron reflected the highest credit upon themselves and the United States Air Force.
