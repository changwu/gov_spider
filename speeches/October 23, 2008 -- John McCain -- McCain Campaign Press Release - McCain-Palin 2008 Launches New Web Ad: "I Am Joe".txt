    ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, McCain-Palin 2008 released its latest web ad, entitled "I am Joe." The ad features Americans who submitted their homemade videos to the campaign telling their stories and how they are like "Joe the Plumber." Like Joe in Ohio, people from across the country do not want to see their taxes increase as Barack Obama proposes. They don't want a president who will "spread the wealth around" instead of creating new wealth and new opportunity. They don't want a president who sees economic success, expansion and job creation as an excuse to increase taxes. They don't want a president who will place a tax on the American dream.
