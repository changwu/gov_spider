Sec. 3. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management and heads of executive agencies shall promptly move to rescind any orders, rules, regulations, guidelines, or policies implementing or enforcing Executive Order 12871 of October 1, 1993, or the Memorandum, to the extent consistent with law.
Sec. 4. Nothing in this order shall abrogate any collective bargaining agreements in effect on the date of this order. GEORGE W. BUSH
