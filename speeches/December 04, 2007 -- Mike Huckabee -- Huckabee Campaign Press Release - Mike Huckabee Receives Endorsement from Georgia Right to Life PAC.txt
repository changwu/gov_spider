    Little Rock, AR â€“ Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee has received the endorsement from the Georgia Right to Life PAC (GRTL PAC) for the 2008 Presidential primary.
"I'm pleased to have the support from the Georgia Right to Life PAC," Huckabee said. "Preserving the sanctity of human life has always been important to me on a personal level, and I have taken great steps to fight for preserving life while serving as Governor of Arkansas."
The mission of the GRTL PAC is to endorse and support candidates for public office who have a proven commitment to the sanctity of human life and will be a strong and effective voice for the unborn.
"While we appreciate their leadership and support, we believe that Gov. Huckabee is the strongest and most effective pro-life candidate in this race," said Bryan Lash, PAC Director for GRTL. "When elected, Mike Huckabee will work hard to establish our goal of restoring respect and effective legal protection to all innocent human beings, from the moment of fertilization until natural death."
Gov. Huckabee has a proven track record of solid pro-life legislation during his terms as governor of Arkansas. He is noted for having passed a state "Human Life Amendment" which says that "the policy of Arkansas is to protect the life of every unborn child from conception to birth."
