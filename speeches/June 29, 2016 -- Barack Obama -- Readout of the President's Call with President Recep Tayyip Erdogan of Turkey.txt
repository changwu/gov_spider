    The President spoke by phone today with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to express his condolences on behalf of the American people and to reaffirm the solidarity of the United States with Turkey following the terrorist attack on Istanbul's Ataturk International Airport yesterday. The President noted this attack, like the March attack at Brussels Airport, was an attack on the international community. President Obama offered any and all assistance to support Turkish authorities in their investigation and pledged to continue working with Turkey and all of our partners and allies to fight terrorism.
The President also commended President Erdogan and his government for their leadership this week in reaching a deal to normalize relations with Israel and in taking steps to ease tensions with Russia.
