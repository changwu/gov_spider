During a Democratic presidential town hall, Hillary Clinton was asked if she would fight inequality if she made it to the White House.
 
Hillary has spent her career fighting against all of the forces that keep people from living up to their potential.
In her first job after graduating from Yale Law School, Hillary work to end the injustice in our criminal justice system.

In that same job, Hillary also took on inequality in schools.
 
She fought inequality in our legal system.

And she took on all forms of inequality as first ladyâ€”most famously by going to Beijing in 1995 and proudly declaring:
 
As president, Hillary will fight inequality the same way she always has: not just by talking about problems, but by taking steps to change things.
