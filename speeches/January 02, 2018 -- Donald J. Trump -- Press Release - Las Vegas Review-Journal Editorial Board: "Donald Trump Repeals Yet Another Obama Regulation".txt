The Trump administration rounded out the Year of Deregulation in appropriate fashion, rescinding a rule intended to punish oil and gas producers.
The regulation, imposed under Barack Obama, would have added millions of dollars to the cost of fracking operations by piling burdensome and duplicative red tape on energy producers operating on public lands.

Mr. Trump, with the help of a GOP Congress, has wiped off the books more than a dozen major rules imposed by Mr. Obama in an effort to curry favor with progressive greens. By rescinding yet another Obama-era attempt to hamstring legitimate businesses, Mr. Trump has made clear that his job is nowhere near finished.
