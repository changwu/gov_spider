My dear Mr. Barstow:
I have your kind letter of March 30th, requesting that I accept the Honorary Chairmanship of the Sponsorship Committee of the Edison Pioneers.
I shall be delighted to act in any capacity that will be a genuine tribute to Mr. Edison's services.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. W. S. Barstow, The Edison Pioneers, Dearborn, Michigan]
