    I applaud the bipartisan majority of Senators who today confirmed Juli치n Castro as our next Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Juli치n is a proven leader, a champion for safe, affordable housing and strong, sustainable neighborhoods. I know that together with the dedicated professionals at HUD, Juli치n will help build on the progress we've made battling back from the great recession: rebuilding our housing market, reducing homelessness among veterans, and connecting neighborhoods with good schools and good jobs that help our citizens succeed. Juli치n has lived the American Dream in his own life, and I'm confident he will help Americans across our country seize their own piece of that dream for themselves and their children.
