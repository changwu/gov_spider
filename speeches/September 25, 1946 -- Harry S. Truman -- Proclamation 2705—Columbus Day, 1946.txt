  A Proclamation

Whereas Christopher Columbus is to be remembered as a man who " * * * found a world, and had no chart, Save one that faith deciphered in the skies;" and
Whereas we who are even now engaged in searching out a new world of peace and justice and respect for human rights should endeavor in a thousand and one ways to emulate that magnificent faith which brought Columbus to the Western World; and
Whereas by a joint resolution of Congress approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation designating October 12 of each year as Columbus Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Saturday, October 12, 1946, as Columbus Day. I direct, also, that on that day the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings; and I invite the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches, or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies expressive of the public sentiment befitting the anniversary of the discovery of America.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done at the City of Washington this 25th day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-first.

HARRY S. TRUMAN

W. L. CLAYTON,
