(House Rules)
(Rep. Terry, R-NE, and 36 cosponsors)
The Administration opposes H.R. 1938, which would: (1) require a determination on a Presidential Permit for the Keystone XL crude oil pipeline by November 1, 2011; and (2) limit the discretion of the Department of State in its historic, delegated role as specified in Executive Order 13337, issued by President George W. Bush, to oversee the issuance of permits for such border crossing facilities.
The bill is unnecessary because the Department of State has been working diligently to complete the permit decision process for the Keystone XL pipeline and has publicly committed to reaching a decision before December 31, 2011. Further, the bill conflicts with long-standing Executive branch procedures regarding the authority of the President and the Secretary of State, and could prevent the thorough consideration of complex issues which could have serious security, safety, environmental, and other ramifications.
