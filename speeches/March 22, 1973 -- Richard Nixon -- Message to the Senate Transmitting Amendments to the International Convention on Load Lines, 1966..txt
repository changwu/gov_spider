    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to acceptance of the Amendments to the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966, adopted at London on October 12, 1971, I transmit herewith a certified copy of those amendments. I transmit also the report of the Department of State with respect to the amendments recommending early acceptance of the amendments by the United States.
The 1966 Load Lines Convention established new uniform rules concerning the limits to which ships on international voyages may be loaded. Its purpose was to bring international load line regulations into accord with modern developments and techniques in ship construction. The purpose of 'the new amendments is to correct errors and ambiguities in the 1966 Convention on Load Lines which have become apparent since 1966.
The new Amendments should make the 1966 Convention more effective in bringing improvements in safety of ships as well as in the economics of shipping. I recommend that the Senate give the Amendments early and favorable consideration.
