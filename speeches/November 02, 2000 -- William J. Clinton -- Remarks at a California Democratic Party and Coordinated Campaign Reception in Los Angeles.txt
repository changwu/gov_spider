    That's the shortest speech by a politician on record. [Laughter] Thank you, and thank you, Governor. I'm looking forward to this little meeting today, but I want to thank you for the work you're doing for the Coordinated Campaign. I'm delighted to be here. We've got five congressional seats here we've got to try to win. And we've got to reelect Senator Feinstein and carry California for Al Gore and Joe Lieberman. So we know what we have to do.
And I can tell you, I've been around the country nowâ€”I've done like 160 events, maybe more, this year. I just got back from Louisville. And if people understand what the issues are and what the differences are and what the consequences are, we'll win. This is not complicated. So I hope I can help you in the next 2 days.
The only other thing I would say is, all the surveys show that basically this election could turn on whether our voters want to go vote as much as their voters do. And what motivates them is knowing what's at stake. So I'll do what I can to help you do that, and then when I leave, I know you'll bring them to victory.
Thank you very much.
