    To General Victor Krulak
I have just received from the Secretary of Defense the November 1976 Report of the Naval Academy Board of Visitors and wish to extend to you, as the elected Chairman of the Board, my sincere appreciation for the leadership so capably demonstrated in the preparation of this excellent report.
The comments and recommendations emphasize the Board's commitment to a Naval Academy whose growth will be equal to the challenge of the future. You have made a significant contribution to that vital undertaking and the security it provides our country.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
[Lt. General Victor H. Krulak, USMC (Ret.), President, Copley News Service, 350 Camino De La Reina, San Diego, California 92108]
