MITT ROMNEY: "We have to champion small business in this country. We got to make sure that we keep our taxes competitive and we keep our regulators encouraging businesses, not crushing them. And we have to take out that big cloud—there's a big cloud that's hanging out over small business. Small business people are very concerned about what's going to happen come January. They're very concerned about something known as Obamacare. That's why we're going to repeal and replace it."
