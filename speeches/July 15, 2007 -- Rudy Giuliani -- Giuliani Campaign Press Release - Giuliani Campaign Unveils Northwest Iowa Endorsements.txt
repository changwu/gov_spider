    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today continued to build on its growing Iowa team announcing endorsements in Northwest Iowa. Fort Dodge Mayor Terry Lutz, former State Senator Jim Kersten, local business owner Charese Yanney, the campaign's Northwest Regional Chair Theresa Hammond and several county chairs and county co-chairs throughout the region are actively working to help grow Rudy Giuliani's grassroots organization.
"Rudy is not only the fiscal conservative candidate, he is a proven leader with the executive experience this country needs," said Mayor Terry Lutz. "He understands lowering taxes, controlling wasteful Washington spending and keeping Americans safe at home are important issues for Iowans."
"Rudy's organization continues to grow in Iowa and our momentum builds as we approach the Iowa Caucuses," said Giuliani's National Political Director Mark Campbell. "We are honored to have Mayor Lutz and a strong support system across Northwest Iowa helping to communicate Mayor Giuliani's positive message and strong leadership to voters in the region."
This announcement of support comes on the heels of Giuliani announcing his Southwest Iowa leadership team.
