    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Wyden (D) OR and Lent (R) NY)
The Administration will not oppose House passage of H.R. 4773, which would establish a program for the certification of embryo laboratories. The Administration, however, will work in the Senate to address a number of objectionable features of the bill.
For example, H.R. 4773 should be revised to make it clear that the embryo laboratory certification standards specified in the bill are only a model. States should be able to develop their own certification programs and standards. Preferably, embryo laboratory certification programs should be developed and run by professional societies making participation by States voluntary. Embryo laboratories should not be required to be federally certified, but could and presumably would seek certification to enhance competition.
No standards or certification program should create barriers to improvements and research of infertility interventions. This is very much a changing science and should not be immobilized by this type of legislation.
