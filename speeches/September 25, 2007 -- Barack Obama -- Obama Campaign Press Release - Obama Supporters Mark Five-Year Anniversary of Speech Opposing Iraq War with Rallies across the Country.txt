    Chicago, IL -- The Obama campaign today announced that supporters will gather in 16 cities across the country on Tuesday, October 2nd, the five-year anniversary of Barack Obama's original speech opposing the Iraq War, to hold "Rallies to Turn the Page in Iraq."
In his 2002 remarks at a downtown Chicago rally, Obama warned that the war could lead to "a U.S. occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences." His remarks came less than ten days before the U.S. Senate's October 11, 2002 vote to give the President authorization to go to war in Iraq.
"I don't oppose all wars. What I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war," said Obama in his October 2nd speech. "...A war based not on reason but on passion, not on principle but on politics."
Five years later, Obama supporters will come together to demonstrate that there is a grassroots movement to change the way Washington works and it begins by finally turning the page in Iraq. The October 2nd rallies will be followed by dozens of grassroots canvasses across the country on Saturday, October 13th.
A list of the planned rallies is below. Supporters can RSVP for both the rallies and canvasses online at my.barackobama.com/turnthepage and use the organizing tools on the site to plan canvasses in their home communities.
Obama, the only major candidate to oppose the Iraq war from the beginning, will headline an event in Chicago on October 2nd. He previously outlined a comprehensive plan to end the war in Iraq responsibly in a September 12th speech in Clinton, IA.
