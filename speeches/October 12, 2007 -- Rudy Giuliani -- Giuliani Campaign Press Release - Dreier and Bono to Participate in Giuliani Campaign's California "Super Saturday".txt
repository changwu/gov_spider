    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee is organizing a Super Saturday grassroots effort throughout California tomorrow. Giuliani volunteers will attend phone banks across the state to spread the word about Rudy's remarkable record of getting results, strong leadership and his 12 Commitments to the American People.
Congressman David Dreier will join volunteers at the Giuliani California Campaign Headquarters in Glendale to participate in the effort. Congresswoman Mary Bono, Assemblyman Ted Gaines and State Senator Chuck Poochigian will also participate in phone bank locations throughout the state. Thousands of phone calls are expected in every region of California at Giuliani call centers.
