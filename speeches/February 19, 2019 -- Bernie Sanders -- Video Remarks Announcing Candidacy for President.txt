    Hi, I'm Bernie Sanders. I'm running for president and I'm asking you today to be part of an unprecedented grassroots campaign of 1 million active volunteers in every state in our country.
Our campaign is not only about defeating Donald Trump, the most dangerous President in modern American history. It is not only about winning the Democratic nomination and the general election.
Our campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice.
Our campaign is about taking on the powerful special interests that dominate our economic and political life. I'm talking about Wall Street, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, the military industrial complex, the private prison industry, and the large multi-national corporations that exert such an enormous influence over our lives.
Our campaign is about redoubling our efforts to end racism, sexism, homophobia, religious bigotry, and all forms of discrimination.
Our campaign is about creating a vibrant democracy with the highest voter turnout of any major country on Earth, while we end voter suppression, Citizens United and outrageous levels of gerrymandering.
Our campaign is about creating a government and the economy that works for the many not just a few. We are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. We should not have a grotesque level of wealth inequality in which three billionaires now own more wealth than the bottom half of the country.
We should not have 30 million Americans without any health insurance, even more who are underinsured and in a nation in which life expectancy is actually in decline.
We should not have an economy in which tens of millions of workers earn starvation wages and half of older workers have no savings as they face retirement.
We should not have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth, and a dysfunctional child care system, which is unfair to both working parents and their children.
We should not have a regressive tax system in which large profitable corporations like Amazon pay nothing in federal income taxes.
Make no mistake about it. The powerful special interests in this country have unbelievable power and they want to maintain the status quo. They have unlimited amounts of money to spend on campaigns and lobbying and have huge influence over the media and political parties.
The only way we will win this election and create a government and an economy that works for all is with a grassroots movement the likes of which has never been seen in American history.
They may have the money and the power. We have the people. That is why we need 1 million Americans who will commit themselves to this campaign.
You know, as well as I do, that we are living in a pivotal and dangerous moment in American history. We are running against a president who is a pathological liar, a fraud, a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe, and someone who was undermining American democracy as he leads us in an authoritarian direction.
I am running for president because now more than ever, we need leadership that brings us together, not divides us up. Women and men, black, white, Latino, Native American, Asian American, gay and straight, young and old, native born and immigrant—now is the time for us to stand together.
I'm running for president because we need leadership that will fight for working families and the shrinking middle class, not just the 1%.
We need a president who understands that we can create millions of good paying jobs, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and constructing the affordable housing we desperately need.
I am running for president because we need trade policies that reflect the interest of workers and not multinational corporations.
We need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, provide pay equity for women and guarantee all workers paid family and medical leave.
I'm running for president because we need to understand that artificial intelligence and robotics must benefit the needs of workers, not just corporate America and those who own that technology.
I'm running for president because a great nation is judged not by how many billionaires and nuclear weapons it has, but by how it treats the most vulnerable, the elderly, the children, our veterans, the sick and the poor.
I'm running for president because we need to make policy decisions based on science, not politics.
We need a president who understands that climate change is real, is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet, and that we can generate massive job creation by transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy
I'm running for President because the time is long overdue for the United States to join every other major country on earth and guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege through a Medicare for all single payer program.
I am running for president because we need to take on the outrageous level of greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug prices in this country.
I'm running for president because we need to have the best educated workforce in the world. It is totally counterproductive for our future that millions of Americans are carrying outrageous levels of student debt while many others cannot afford the high cost of higher education. That is why we need to make public colleges and universities tuition free and lower student debt.
I am running for president because we need real criminal justice reform. We need to invest in jobs and education for our kids, not more jails and incarceration. We need to end the destructive war on drugs, private prisons and cash bail and bring about major police department reform.
I'm running for president because we need to end the demonization of undocumented immigrants in this country and move the comprehensive immigration reform. We need to provide immediate legal status for the young people eligible for the DACA program and develop a humane policy for those at the border who seek asylum.
I'm running for president because we must end the epidemic of gun violence in this country. We need to take on the NRA, expand background checks, end the gun show loophole and ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons.
I am running for president because we need a foreign policy which focuses on democracy, human rights, diplomacy and world peace. The United States must lead the world in improving international cooperation in the fight against climate change. militarism, authoritarianism and global wealth inequality.
That is why we need 1 million people to join our campaign and help lead the movement that can accomplish all of these goals.
Needless to say, there is a lot of frightening and bad news in this world.
Now, let me give you some very good news that we should all be very proud of.
Three years ago, during our 2016 campaign, when we brought forth our progressive agenda, we were told that our ideas were "radical," and they were "extreme."
We were told that Medicare for all, a $15 an hour minimum wage, free tuition in public colleges and universities, aggressively combating climate change, demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes—we were told that all of these concepts were ideas that the American people would never accept.
Well, three years have come and gone. And as a result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans.
Together, you and I, and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution.
Now it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for.
So here is my question for you. Will you stand with me as part of a million-person grassroots movement which cannot only win the Democratic nomination, not only win the general election, but most mportantly, help transform this country so that finally we have a government that works for all of us and not just a few.
Together, we can create a nation that leads the world in the struggle for peace and for economic, racial, social and environmental justice.
And together we can defeat Donald Trump and repair the damage he has done to our country.
Brothers and sisters. If we stand together, there is no limit to what we can accomplish.
I hope you'll join me.
Thank you very much.
