    Beginning at 8:30 p.m. e.d.t. yesterday, there were indications that the Cambodians appeared to be attempting to move U.S. captive crewmen from the ship to the mainland. After giving warning, U.S. aircraft began efforts to block this movement.
Three Cambodian patrol craft were destroyed and about four others were damaged and immobilized. One boat succeeded in reaching Kompong Som.
U.S. aircraft had been receiving small arms fire from such boats for several hours prior to this action.
The Mayaguez is still anchored off Koh Tang Island. The first U.S. Navy vessel, the destroyer U.S.S. Holt, is now in the area.
