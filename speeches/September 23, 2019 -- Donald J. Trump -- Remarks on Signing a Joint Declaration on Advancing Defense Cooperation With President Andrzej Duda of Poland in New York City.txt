    President Trump. Thank you, everybody. We're signing a Joint Declaration on Advancing Defense Cooperation with Poland and the United States. And it's been underâ€”I think you could say under review. We've been looking at it for many years, and it's getting done now. We have a great relationship to Poland.
And, Mr. President, I'd like to thank you very much. It's been a lot of fun working with you, and I think it's been very productive.
We're also doing waivers, the visa waivers for Poland. And that's in the work. We're working on the structure right now. But you can report back to the people of Poland, and the Polish people in the United States, that President Trump got it done, and nobody else could for a long time, as you know. [Laughter]
President Duda. Yes.
President Trump. So thank you very much, Mr. President.
President Duda. Thank you, sir.
President Trump. Thank you.
[At this point, President Trump and President Duda signed the documents. President Trump then handed his pen to President Duda.]
President Trump. Okay. That's for you. I'll keep that one. Yes, good. Keep them both. [Laughter]
Thank you. Congratulations. That's fantastic. Great people. Thank you very much.
President Duda. Thank you.
President Trump. Thank you. We're going into the other room now. And if you want to go, come on.
