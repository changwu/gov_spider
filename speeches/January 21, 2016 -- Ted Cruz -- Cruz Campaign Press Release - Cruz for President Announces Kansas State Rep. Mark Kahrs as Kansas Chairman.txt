    HOUSTON, Texas â€“ Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today announced Kansas State Representative Mark Kahrs from Wichita, Kansas Chairman for the Cruz for President campaign. Rep. Kahrs has been active in Kansas politics for over twenty-five years serving in various offices within the Kansas Republican Party, including former Chairman of the Sedgwick County Republican Party and most recently as former Chairman of the Fourth District Republican Committee. Mark was recently chosen by his Republican House colleagues to serve as Vice Chairman of the Republican House Campaign Committee. A fourth generation Kansan, Mark is a small business owner, has served as board member on the Wichita Independent Business Association, and practices law in his own law firm.
"This is an extremely critical election for conservatives," said Rep. Kahrs. "We need a leader that will stand up and fight the Washington establishment to restore the power back to the people and stand up for conservative values. Ted Cruz is a consistent conservative and has the record to prove it. I am excited to be part of this campaign and lead the effort in Kansas to unite conservatives to get Cruz elected to the White House in 2016."
"Mark is a principled conservative who has spent his time fighting in Kansas to limit the size of government, create jobs and grow the economy, and protect life, marriage, and the Constitution," said Cruz. "We need more legislators like Mark who are passionate advocates for liberty and who work to restore the power back to the people. I am thrilled to have Mark join our campaign and look forward to working with him to coalesce conservatives in Kansas."
