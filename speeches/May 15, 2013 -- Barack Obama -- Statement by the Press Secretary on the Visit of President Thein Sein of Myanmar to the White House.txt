    President Obama will welcome His Excellency President Thein Sein to the White House on Monday, May 20, 2013. Since President Obama's historic trip to Rangoon last November, the United States has continued to advocate for continued progress on reform by President Thein Sein's government, in close cooperation with Aung San Suu Kyi, civil society leaders, and the international community. The President looks forward to discussing with President Thein Sein the many remaining challenges to efforts to develop democracy, address communal and ethnic tensions, and bring economic opportunity to the people of his country, and to exploring how the United States can help.
President Thein Sein's visit underscores President Obama's commitment to supporting and assisting those governments that make the important decision to embrace reform, and highlights the dedication of the United States to helping the Burmese people realize the full potential of their extraordinary country.
