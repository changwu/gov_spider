    The President is pleased that the U.S. Senate has given its advice and consent to the ratification of the supplementary extradition treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom, amending the 1972 extradition treaty between our two countries.
The administration submitted the supplementary treaty to the Senate in July of last year. This has been a long process. We are gratified with the vote of approval, and we welcome this bipartisan call to combat political violence.
We strongly believe the supplementary treaty will further our efforts to develop effective tools in the fight against terrorism. Many in the Senate merit praise. We particularly thank Chairman Lugar, Senator Trible, and Senator Eagleton for their indispensable assistance.
