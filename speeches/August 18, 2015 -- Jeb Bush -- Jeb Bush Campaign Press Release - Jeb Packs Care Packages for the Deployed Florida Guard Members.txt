    Bagram Air Force Base sits in the shadows of Afghanistan's Hindu Kush mountain range — nearly 8 thousand miles from Miami. But a short time from now, that distance will be momentarily bridged thanks to some cardboard boxes from Florida.
Recently, Jeb spent time with veterans and military spouses packing some of the comforts of home into care packages for our troops in Afghanistan. These parcels will be delivered to Bagram Air Force Base and other forward operating positions, where members of Florida's National Guard, 265th Air Defense Artillery Regiment, are currently deployed.
As governor of Florida, Jeb had the tremendous honor of serving as Commander-in-Chief of the Florida National Guard. It was a profound responsibility that he undertook with the utmost seriousness and pride. Jeb's commitment to the military comes from a great respect for our servicemen and women — born out of admiration for his father, who was injured in combat while serving as a United States Naval pilot.

If elected to serve as Commander-in-Chief, he will work tirelessly to ensure that our troops receive the support, regard and care they so richly deserve.
Jeb had the opportunity to learn more about how our troops live and serve in Afghanistan when he visited Kabul in 2006. While he loaded items like Sriracha, sunscreen and beef jerky into the care packages bound for Bagram, Jeb spoke candidly with the veterans about their concerns and gave a heartfelt thank you to all the families who bear the burden of sacrifice for America's safety.
"A lot of guys and gals that are serving are separated from their families," Jeb said after packing up the final box. "Giving them a remembrance of what's back here, I think, is really important."
