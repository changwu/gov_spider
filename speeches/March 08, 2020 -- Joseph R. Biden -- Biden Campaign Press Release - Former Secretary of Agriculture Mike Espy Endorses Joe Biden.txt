    Today, former Secretary of Agriculture and Mississippi Congressman Mike Espy released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"Our nation is searching for a leader- someone with competence, integrity, humanity and steely resolve.
"Someone we can trust- who will look us in the eye and tell us the truth. We are tired of lies, hatred, suspicion and hyper-partisanship.
"We want a leader we can respect, and who will again engender respect for our nation across the globe.
"We need a real leader who can unite us, heal us, and excite us. Someone who not only can win the presidency but can also usher in down ballot victories- because we need to hold the House and flip the Senate.
"Because of his experience, his humanity, his vision and his world view- I heartily endorse Joe Biden for President and will do all I can to ensure that he becomes our nation's 46th President."
Secretary Espy served as the 25th Secretary of Agriculture from 1993 to 1994 and was the first African American to serve in that role. He is currently running for United States Senate against Mississippi Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith.
Espy joins a strong list of Mississippi leaders backing Biden, including Congressman Bennie Thompson, and more than 25 state legislators including all 16 members of the Mississippi Senate Democratic Caucus. Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,700 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
