    Although we strongly disagree with the Ninth Circuit's decision to leave in place the district court's unjustified injunction of the Government's lawful action to curb asylum abuse, we are glad the Ninth Circuit recognized that the nationwide application of the injunction was improper. While the injunction remains overbroad – even as modified by the Ninth Circuit's decision – we will now be able to apply the rule at issue to curb asylum abuse outside of the Ninth Circuit. We look forward to having the injunction lifted in its entirety on appeal so that we can protect legitimate asylum seekers, preserve resources for addressing their claims, and prevent illegal migrants who bypass regional asylum opportunities from overwhelming our asylum system.
