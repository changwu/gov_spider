    Today I am pleased to approve S. 2235. This legislation amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, which makes grant funds available under the Justice Department's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program, to encourage local school systems to enter into partnerships with local law enforcement agencies by employing "school resource officers" in and around elementary and secondary schools. A school resource officer will now be a sworn law enforcement officer and be deployed to work in collaboration with schools and community-based organizations. By helping to educate students in crime prevention techniques and peaceful conflict resolution and by identifying changes in a school's environment that might discourage crime and violence, the officer will address crime, disorder, gangs, and drug-related activities.
We have achieved almost 90 percent of our pledge to put 100,000 additional cops on the street in community policing activities, and this has helped drive down crime rates across the Nation. This bill will help bring those same successful community policing methods to our schools.
I want to thank the sponsors of this legislation for their leadership in securing enactment of this law: Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell in the Senate, and Representative Jim Maloney of Connecticut who worked tirelessly to secure overwhelming bipartisan passage of this important safe schools measure in the House.
