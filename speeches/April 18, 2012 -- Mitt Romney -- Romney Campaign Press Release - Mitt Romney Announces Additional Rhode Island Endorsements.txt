    Mitt Romney today announced additional endorsements in Rhode Island.
"After three years in office, it is clear that President Obama's policies have failed Rhode Island," said Mitt Romney. "I don't accept high unemployment like President Obama does and I will work with these leaders to implement pro-growth policies that will create jobs and cut spending."

"Mitt Romney has shown throughout this campaign and throughout his life that he is ready to take on the challenges facing our country," said 2010 gubernatorial candidate John Robitaille. "His bold economic plan will bring back jobs and shrink government and his experience working in the real economy should give confidence to Rhode Island job creators that they will have an ally in the White House. I urge all Rhode Islanders looking for a change in Washington to support Mitt Romney."
