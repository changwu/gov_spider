    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Helping people to help themselves through private sector initiatives is a commitment of this Administration, and we are extremely proud of our record in this regard. As leaders in the Federal government, we participate side by side with individuals, groups, voluntary organizations, and corporations to provide opportunities for others less fortunate. We do our part through our leadership of the Combined Federal Campaign in our respective agencies.
It gives me great pleasure to announce that Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Hanford Dole has agreed to serve as Chairperson of the fall 1985 Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area. I am asking that you support Secretary Dole by personally serving as Chairman of the campaign in your organization and appointing a top official as your Vice Chairman. Please advise Secretary Dole of the person you designate.
Your personal interest, visible support, and active participation are vital to the success of the campaign. Make a special effort to encourage your employees in the Washington area, and in all CFC locations worldwide, to support the Combined Federal Campaign at greater levels than ever before.
