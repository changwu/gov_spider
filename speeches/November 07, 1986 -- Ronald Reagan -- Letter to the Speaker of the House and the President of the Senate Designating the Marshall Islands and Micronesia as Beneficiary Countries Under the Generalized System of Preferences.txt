    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am writing to inform you of my intent to add the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) Program, effective October 21 for the Republic of the Marshall Islands and November 3 for the Federated States of Micronesia.
Prior to November 3, 1986, the Marshall Islands and Micronesia were part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Consistent with the Trusteeship Agreement and U.S. law, they were eligible for GSP benefits. By presidential proclamation, dated November 3, 1986, I determined that the Trusteeship Agreement is no longer in effect as of October 21, 1986, with respect to the Marshall Islands and as of November 3, 1986, with respect to Micronesia. Therefore, this designation is necessary to permit the Marshall Islands and Micronesia to continue to receive GSP benefits in accordance with section 401 of the Compact of Free Association Act of 1985, Public Law 99-239, 99 Stat. 1770 (January 14, 1986).
This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
