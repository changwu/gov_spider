    Today the President received a recommendation from the National Mediation Board asking him to appoint a Presidential Emergency Board in the dispute between American Airlines and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants. The President will accept that recommendation and create the Emergency Board if the parties are unable to reach a negotiated settlement prior to the expiration of the 30-day cooling off period provided under the Railway Labor Act.
The President is concerned that a major airline strike could threaten the economy. He also wants to assure the flying public that they can enjoy the upcoming Fourth of July holiday without fear that their travel plans will be disrupted by a strike at American Airlines.
