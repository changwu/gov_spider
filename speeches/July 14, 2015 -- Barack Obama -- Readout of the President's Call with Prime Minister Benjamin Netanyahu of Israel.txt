    The President spoke by phone today with Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel to discuss the agreement among the P5+1, the European Union, and Iran on a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) regarding Iran's nuclear program. He noted that the JCPOA will verifiably prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon while ensuring the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program going forward. The President also underscored his Administration's stalwart commitment to Israel's security and noted that the JCPOA will remove the specter of a nuclear-armed Iran, an outcome in the national security interest of the United States and Israel. The President told the Prime Minister that today's agreement on the nuclear issue will not diminish our concerns regarding Iran's support for terrorism and threats toward Israel. The President noted that Secretary of Defense Ash Carter's visit next week to Israel is a reflection of the unprecedented level of security cooperation between the United States and Israel, and that the visit offers a further opportunity to continue our close consultation on security issues with Israeli counterparts as we remain vigilant in countering the Iranian regime's destabilizing activities in the region.
