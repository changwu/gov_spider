So what are Marco's most important jobs?

"I believe that generally speaking. I believe that at home my most important job is to be a husband to my wife and a father to my children. If I can't do that right, I can't lead a nation. If you can't lead your family, you can't lead a country. So obviously, it's an important aspect of it. One day I will no longer be in politics. One day I will no longer be a senator or president or anything else. But, I will always be a father and I will always be a husband. It's important for me to do those jobs right first."
