Boston, MA â€“ Today, Staples Founder Thomas Stemberg released the following statement regarding Governor Mike Huckabee's appearance on CBS' "Face The Nation":
"Governor Huckabee talks about creating jobs, but save for more government bureaucrats in Arkansas, he has never done it in the private sector. Michigan and our nation need leaders in Washington who are more than just talk. We need a leader like Mitt Romney who actually knows what it takes to create jobs. As a businessman, Governor Romney took a chance and invested in the first Staples store. Today, tens of thousands of Staples employees and Americans are benefiting from that decision. That's a clear record of action that Mitt Romney repeated time after time. Washington needs leaders who can do more than just talk about creating jobs."
