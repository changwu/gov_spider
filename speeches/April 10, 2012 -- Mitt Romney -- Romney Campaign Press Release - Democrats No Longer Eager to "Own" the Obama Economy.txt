    "If Representative Wasserman Schultz's recent comments are any indication of what we can expect from President Obama today in Florida, he won't be rushing to accept responsibility for an economy Democrats used to be eager to ‘own.' After three years of chronic unemployment and economic hardship, Floridians and all Americans can't afford another four years under President Obama." —Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
Last Year, President Obama's DNC Chair, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Was Eager For Democrats To "Own The Economy":
In 2011, Wasserman Schultz Was Eager To Say That She And Her Fellow Democrats, Including President Obama, "Own The Economy." "Democrats are ready to take responsibility for the state of the economy and they deserve credit for putting it on the right track, the party's chairwoman, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, said on Wednesday. ‘We own the economy. We own the beginning of the turnaround and we want to make sure that we continue that pace of recovery, not go back to the policies of the past under the Bush administration that put us in the ditch in the first place,' Wasserman Schultz told Mike Allen at POLITICO's ‘Playbook Breakfast.'" (Molly Ball, "Debbie Wasserman Schultz: ‘We Own The Economy,'" Politico, 6/15/11)
Wasserman Schultz, Also In 2011: "I'm Going To Take Ownership [Of The Economy] Right Now..." "Wasserman Schultz made similar comments earlier this week: ‘I'm going to take ownership right now, because we've begun to turn the economy around.'" (Editorial, "We Own The Economy," New York Post, 6/18/11)
But This Weekend, Rep. Wasserman Schultz Was Busy Avoiding Blame For The Economy, Claiming It Wasn't "A Legitimate Criticism" To Hold President Obama To His Own Promises:
Wasserman Schultz On Holding President Obama To His Own Economic Promises: "I Don't Think It's A Legitimate Criticism." CROWLEY: "‘Over three years ago, President Obama projected that the unemployment rate would be below 6 percent by now thanks to his stimulus. But the stimulus failed and unemployment has been far above that level ever since.' Is that legitimate criticism because in fact that is what the president's economic folks projected with the stimulus that was passed?" WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: "Again, that's another example of where the Republicans just refuse to acknowledge that we've made progress. We have made significant progress, even in manufacturing..." CROWLEY: "But ... it was the president's benchmark. And is holding him to that fair?" ... CROWLEY: "But it failed to do what was promised. Isn't that..." WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: "No. No, no, no, I..." CROWLEY: "I'm just trying to see if you think that is a legitimate criticism?" WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: "No, I don't think it's a legitimate criticism." (CNN's "State Of The Union," 4/8/12)
Why The Change In Tune From The DNC Chair? Maybe It's Because Floridians Are Still Struggling Under President Obama's Failed Economic Policies:
