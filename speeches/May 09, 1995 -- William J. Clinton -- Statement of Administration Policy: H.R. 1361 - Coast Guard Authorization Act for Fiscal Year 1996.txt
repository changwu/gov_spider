    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Coble (R) North Carolina and 3 Cosponsors)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 1361.
The Administration will, however, seek amendments during Senate consideration of H.R. 1361 to provisions related to the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. These amendments will include an amendment to maintain the Federal Government's ability to recover oil pollution cleanup costs directly from insurance companies and other entities that are designated as sources of financial guarantees, as required under that Act. The Administration will also seek amendments relating to the Bridge Alteration and the Boating Safety statutes, and to Coast Guard personnel provisions.
Pay-As-You-Go-Scoring 
H.R. 1361 would affect receipts and direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary PAYGO estimate is that H.R. 1361 would result in a net deficit increase of less than $500,000 per year. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
