    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:) 
Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order to take additional steps with respect to the national emergencies declared in Executive Order 13660 of March 6, 2014, as expanded in scope and relied upon for additional steps taken in subsequent Executive Orders, and Executive Order 13694 of April 1, 2015, as relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order 13757 of December 28, 2016.
Title II of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Public Law 115-44) (CAATSA) and the Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-272), as amended (UFSA), provide for the imposition of certain sanctions with respect to the Russian Federation. The Executive Order I issued will further the implementation of those sanctions by providing authority under IEEPA to the Secretary of the Treasury to take certain actions with respect to those sanctions and directing departments and agencies of the United States Government to take all appropriate measures within their authority to ensure the full implementation of those sanctions. These sanctions may include prohibitions on certain financial transactions; blocking all property and interests in property; denial of export licenses; denial of visas and entry into the United States; and imposition of sanctions on the principal executive officer or officers of sanctioned persons.
I have authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, including promulgating rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA and certain sections of CAATSA and UFSA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the Executive Order.
I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
