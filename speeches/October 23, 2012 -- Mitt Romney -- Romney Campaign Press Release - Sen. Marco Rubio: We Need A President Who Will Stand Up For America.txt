    Boston, MA — Florida Senator Marco Rubio made the following statement on tonight's third presidential debate:
 
"Over the past four years and particularly over the past few weeks, we have witnessed the unraveling of President Obama's foreign policy. Tonight's debate between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama only served to highlight the enormous gap between the President's words and his actual achievements. Thanks to four years of vacillating diplomacy, economic weakness, and cuts to our military, America's standing in the world is hitting lows not seen since the Jimmy Carter years. We're seeing the bitter fruits of this failed strategy in the Middle East on a daily basis — but other regions of the world are also growing more dangerous. It's time we had a leader in the White House who will stand up for America and restore the essential elements of American power: economic, military, and moral. Mitt Romney is the man for the job."
