    Each year on Independence Day, Americans honor and celebrate the courageous action that our Nation's Founders took on July 4, 1776—the signing of the Declaration of Independence. With that brave and profound decision, the Founders demonstrated their love for liberty and proved that they were willing to fight and die for freedom. As we honor our Founders' bold vision on this first observance of Independence Day since September 11, Americans possess a greater national unity and a deeper appreciation of the things that matter most in our lives—our faith, our love for family and friends, and our freedom.
In this new era, Americans share a renewed appreciation for the ideals that make our country strong. Our fine service men and women are fighting and winning the war on terror. They deserve the gratitude of all people who cherish freedom.
Throughout our Nation's history, Americans have been steadfast in their efforts to build a country of liberty, peace, and opportunity for all. As we act to lift the dark cloud of terror from our Nation and the world, we reaffirm our determination to preserve our Forefathers' legacy of freedom. In doing so, we honor their legacy as we move forward into the 21st century.
On this Independence Day we pay special tribute to all those currently serving in the Armed Forces and to our veterans. Their contributions have been critical to the defense of our country, and our Nation is grateful.
Laura joins me in extending best wishes for a safe and memorable Independence Day. May God bless you, and may God continue to bless America.
GEORGE W. BUSH
