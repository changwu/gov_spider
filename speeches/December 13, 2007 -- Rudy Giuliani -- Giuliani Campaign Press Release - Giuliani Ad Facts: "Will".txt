In 1986, Congress Approved And The President Signed Immigration Reform Into Law. "The immigration bill, hotly debated for nearly six years, would legalize possibly millions of aliens already living in the United States and fine or jail employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens. … Backers hailed the immigration legislation as the most comprehensive effort in decades to deal with the nation's mounting immigration problems." (P.L. 99-603, Signed 11/6/86; Christopher Drew, "Senate Sends Major Antidrug, Immigration Bills To Reagan," Chicago Tribune, 10/18/86)

In 1996, Congress Passed Yet Another Immigration Reform Bill That Was Signed Into Law. "Unfortunately, when you take the longer view, you can't help but conclude that what Congress has done in 1996 will be no more effective in solving this nation's immigration problems than the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 was." (Frank del Olmo, Op-Ed, "Perspective On Immigration," Los Angeles Times, 9/29/86; P.L. 104-208, Signed 9/30/96)

  IN LAST SEVERAL YEARS, NEW TECHNOLOGY HAS
  BEEN DEVELOPED TO CONTROL OUR BORDERS

Homeland Security Has Added New Technologies To The Border Including "Ground-Based Radar, Unmanned Aerial Systems, And, [In December 2007] … The First Stage Of Our Virtual Fence Under SBInet." (Sec. Michael Chertoff, Remarks At The Woodrow Wilson International Center For Scholars, Washington, D.C., 12/12/07)
New Technological Fence Along Part Of Arizona Border Just Became Operational. CNN's CHRISTINE ROMANS: "Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff opened a 28-mile stretch of border fence in Arizona today. But as Jeanne Meserve reports the fence is not made out of stone or concrete, instead, it's a virtual one." CNN's JEANNE MESERVE: "Telephoto cameras, motion detectors, thermal imaging devices, all perched on 98-foot tall towers, integrated to form a virtual fence along the border. The $20 million project along a stretch of the Arizona desert has been bedeviled by software problems, but now six months later than expected, the Department of Homeland Security is declaring it operational." SEC. CHERTOFF: "It's not the be all and end all at this point and it's not what it can be eventually, but we needed to get possession of it and we need it to operate in order to really develop the next stage of this." (CNN's "Lou Dobbs Tonight," 12/7/07)
New Technology Uses Broadband Wireless Network To Monitor Borders. "Here is another example [of new technology on the border]: Distributed Instruments, Sterling Heights, Mich., has developed a surveillance sensor network powered by a chain of aerostats – or tethered balloons – to provide a broadband wireless network for sensor data and surveillance platforms for digital video. The sensors can be integrated with a chain of ground sensors that enable listening devices and other monitors." (Paul Rothman, "Opportunity At The Borders," Government Security, 6/1/06)
"New Technology Gives Border Patrol Agents State-Of-The-Art Helicopters To Search For Migrants From The Air And A New Generation Of Ground Sensors And Remote Video Systems To Track Them On The Ground." (Niko Price, "AP Investigation: No Evidence Costly Effort To Shut Southwest Border To Terrorists Has Stopped A Single One," The Associated Press, 10/30/03)
"More Agents Guard The Canadian Border, Aided By New Remote Video Surveillance Technology." (Romesh Ratnesar, "The State Of Our Defense," Time, 2/24/03)
New Technology Allows For Mobile Biometric Identification Using Fingerprints. "Datastrip's new DSVII-SC handheld biometric identification terminal takes identity verification out of the police station and onto the street, providing a wireless fingerprint capture and matching solution that can be used for mobile Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS) and a variety of other in-the-field law enforcement applications. The device enables officers to quickly screen suspects against any fingerprint database at traffic stops and other field encounters without returning to headquarters. (Datastrip, "Datastrip's New DSVII-SC Handheld Device For Law Enforcement Enables Fast Mobile Fingerprint Capture And Matching," Press Release, 6/21/05)

  ONLY MAYOR GIULIANI CAN PROVIDE LEADERSHIP
  AND WILL TO END ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

Former FBI Director Louis Freeh "Identifies 'Will' And 'Accountability' As Previously Missing But Which, He Contends, Giuliani Will Bring To Immigration Reform." (Jennifer Rubin, "Be Prepared," The American Spectator Online, 9/7/07)
Rep. Peter King (R-NY) Said Giuliani Will Apply Himself To End Illegal Immigration Much Like He Reduced Welfare In New York City. King: "He would be constructing a 700 mile fence. A real fence. A technological fence. He would be going all out putting all the efforts in to combating illegal immigration which he did to combating to crime and welfare in New York where he dramatically turned that city around. I mean Bill you and I knew how bad the city was. There were over 2,000 murders. He reduced that by 2/3. Reduced the welfare by about 60% and he did it because he applied himself, he took politically incorrect decisions, he would do the same with illegal immigration." (Rep. Peter King, Bill Bennett's "Morning In America," 8/17/07)
Former U.S. Customs And Border Protection Commissioner Robert Bonner Said Giuliani Is The Only Candidate Who Had "Leadership Skills" To Control Border. "Bonner says Giuliani 'is the only candidate who has articulated a plan and the only one with leadership skills to get it done.' He points, not surprisingly, to Giuliani's CompStat program for reducing crime in New York City and says Giuliani would take that plan 'for holding people accountable for crime and apply it to the border, which is an enforcement issue.' He says Giuliani sees enforcement of the borders as '100%, not 70% and not 80%' attainable." (Jennifer Rubin, "Border Guard Rudy," The American Spectator Online, 8/20/07)
