    Florida Senator Marco Rubio today made the following statement on President Obama's comments about redistributing wealth: Â 
"Over the last four years, President Obama has clearly demonstrated his belief in wealth distribution and that government does a better job running the economy than private citizens. Spending is out of control, the debt is soaring, and the size of government grows larger every day. Redistribution of wealth undermines the true sources of America's prosperity and progress: our entrepreneurial people and our free enterprise system. Mitt Romney understands that. He knows that American free enterprise has lifted more people out of poverty than any government program in history. We need more liberty in this country, not more government. That's precisely what Mitt Romney will deliver."
