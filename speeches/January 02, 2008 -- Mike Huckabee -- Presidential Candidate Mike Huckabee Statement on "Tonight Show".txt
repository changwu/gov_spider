    LITTLE ROCK, AR -- The following is a statement from the campaign of former Arkansas Governor and Presidential candidate Mike Huckabee:
Governor Huckabee is excited to join Jay Leno when the "Tonight Show" returns to live broadcasting later this evening. The Governor would only agree to join Jay, an active member of the Writers Guild, for the taping after he was assured that no replacement writers were being used in the show's production. Governor Huckabee believes that the writers deserve to be fairly compensated for the sale of their work.
