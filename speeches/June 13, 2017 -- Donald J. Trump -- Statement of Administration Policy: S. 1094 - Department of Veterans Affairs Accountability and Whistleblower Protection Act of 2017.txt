    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Senator Rubio, R-FL, and 39 cosponsors)
The Administration supports S. 1094. The Administration is committed to ensuring the Nation's veterans have access to the care, services, and benefits they have earned. To achieve this goal, it is critical that employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are held to the highest performance standards, and that they are accountable when those standards are not met. In addition, it is important that employees be able to discuss concerns without fear of retribution or reprisal, particularly when those concerns deal with the quality of care Federal employees provide to our veterans. Therefore, whistleblower rights and processes must be clear and unambiguous. S. 1094 holds VA employees to high standards of performance and conduct, and clarifies whistleblower rights and processes.
The Administration thanks the Senate for passing this important bill, and looks forward to passage in the House of Representatives. If S. 1094 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.
