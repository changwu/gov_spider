    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Johnson (D) South Dakota)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2772 because of long-standing policy opposing funding by Federal water resources agencies for contruction of single-purpose municipal, industrial, or rural water supply projects. The Administration believes that the construction and operation of such projects should remain the responsibility of non-Federal interests.
