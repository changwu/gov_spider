    The President. It's with great pleasure that I today announce my intention to nominate Judge William Steele Sessions to be Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Judge Sessions is well recognized as a man of great personal integrity and honor, dedicated to the vigorous enforcement of the criminal laws of our country and to the evenhanded administration of justice. I'm happy to be able to draw upon the talents of a person with such extensive experience, both on the bench and as a prosecutor, to lead the FBI in our fight against crime.
Judge Sessions has established himself as a fair-minded, tough prosecutor and one of the finest Federal judges on the bench today. He's committed to protecting the rights of all Americans under the Constitution. He understands and has demonstrated unwavering dedication to constitutional principles in securing protection of the lives, the property, and the homes of our citizens, not only with respect to those who violate our laws but with respect to those who are charged with the responsibility of enforcing our laws. Under Judge Sessions' leadership, I'm confident that the FBI will continue its impressive tradition as one of the finest law enforcement agencies in the world, unmatched in integrity, commitment, and skill.
Judge Sessions. Mr. President, I thank you for reposing the confidence in me to become the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I look forward to trying to maintain the high standards that Judge Webster has provided for leadership in the Bureau, to working with Attorney General Meese as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and I'm grateful to you, sir. Thank you.
