    The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attacks in Parachinar and Quetta on Friday.
These attacks, which deliberately targeted civilians, and killed over 80 people, are a strong reminder of the threat posed throughout the region by the scourge of terrorism.
We stand with the people of Pakistan in their fight against it.
