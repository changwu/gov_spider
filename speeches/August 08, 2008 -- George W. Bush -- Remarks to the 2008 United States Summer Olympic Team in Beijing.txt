    Congratulations for representing the finest nation on the face of the Earth. The honorary captain and I are proud to be with you. We're here to wish you all the very best.
First, I want to say thanks to the U.S. Olympic Committee, chaired by Peter Ueberroth, CEO Jim Scherr, Judge Charles Lee. I wasn't exactly sure what to say to you, except to start with, God, I love our country, and I love what we stand for, and I love being with you.
Laura and I and a lot of our family are here to cheer you on. We're just a handful of a lot of folks who care about you a lot. There are going to be a lot of people pulling for you. We want you to win as many golds as you possibly can.
We appreciate all the hard work you've put in to get to this spot. It's got to be really exciting, thinking about marching in that stadium and representing our country. So I guess all I've got to say is, go for it, give it all you've got, and may God bless you.
