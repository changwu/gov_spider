    I am pleased to send greetings to all those commemorating National Missing Children's Day on May 25. This observance provides an opportunity to honor hardworking and dedicated law enforcement officers, celebrate the recovery of missing children, and draw attention to children who are still missing.
As we remember the children we have lost on National Missing Children's Day, we renew our resolve and dedication to reuniting families with their loved ones. I commend local, state, and Federal law enforcement personnel for the important role they play in missing or exploited children investigations and searches. Across America, partnerships between local law enforcement officers and community groups are helping to protect our children so that they can be nurtured in love and live rich, full lives.
The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children deserves special recognition for its work to reunite children with their families. Since 1984, the center has received more than 1.5 million hotline calls, provided assistance in the recovery of more than 55,000 children, and distributed millions of publications regarding missing and exploited children. These efforts make a difference in the lives of countless individuals, and I salute you.
Laura joins me in sending best wishes on this special occasion.
