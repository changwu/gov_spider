Former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson said Tuesday that Ted Cruz is wrong to call Ohio Gov. John Kasich "a spoiler" and that voting for the Texas senator ultimately benefits Hillary Clinton.
"I think that Ted Cruz is trying to get as many votes as he possibly can and trying to get them away from John Kasich," he told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on "New Day." "I think a vote for Ted Cruz is actually a vote for Hillary Clinton. I don't think Ted Cruz could beat Hillary Clinton."
