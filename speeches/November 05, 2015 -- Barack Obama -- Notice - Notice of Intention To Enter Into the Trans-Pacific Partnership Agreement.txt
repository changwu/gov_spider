    Consistent with section 106(a)(1)(A) of the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-26, Title I; the "Trade Priorities Act"), I have notified the Congress of my intention to enter into a free trade agreement, known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement, which will generate export opportunities for U.S. manufacturers, service suppliers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses; help create jobs in the United States; and help American consumers save money while offering them more choices. I am negotiating to enter into the TPP Agreement with the following countries: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam; provided that those countries meet the market-access goals that we set out to achieve and agree to high-standard obligations, consistent with the Trade Priorities Act.
Consistent with section 106(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Priorities Act, this notice shall be published in the Federal Register.
