    To the House of Representatives:
I return herewith without my approval House Joint Resolution 251, to authorize the issuance of a special series of stamps commemorative of the one-hundredth anniversary of the coming of the Swedish pioneers to the Middle West.
Under existing law the Postmaster General has general authority to issue commemorative postage stamps, and such stamps are issued from time to time for the purpose of honoring significant events in American history. However, the commemorative stamps that can be approved each year must be restricted to a comparatively few issues because of the limited production facilities of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The issuance of the stamp provided for by this joint resolution might make necessary the cancellation of one or more of the special stamps which the Postmaster General has already announced will be issued during 1948 for the purpose of commemorating other historic events.
I am proud, as other Americans are, of the contributions which have been made to our democracy by Americans of Swedish origin, and I believe that these contributions should be recognized by all appropriate means. However, a special stamp in commemoration of the establishment of the first colony of Swedish and Finnish settlers in America was issued in 1938. Thus, the event to be honored by the present measure is similar to one which has already been honored by the issuance of a special postage stamp within recent years. Equitable use of the practice of recognizing the historic importance of events by the issuance of special stamps requires that this recognition be accorded at this time to other elements in our national life.
For these reasons, I am unable to approve this joint resolution.
