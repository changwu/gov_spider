    Today, I have signed into law H.R. 3222, the "Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2008." The Act appropriates funds needed to support the U.S. Armed Forces as they protect the United States and the American people and advance United States interests around the globe.
The Act contains certain provisions identical to those found in prior bills passed by the Congress that might be construed to be inconsistent with my Constitutional responsibilities (sections 8005, 8009, 8012(b), 8034(b), 8052, 8082, 8085, 8089, 8091, and 8116, and the provision concerning consolidation under the heading "Operation and Maintenance, Defense Wide"). To avoid such potential infirmities, I will interpret and construe such provisions in the same manner as I have previously stated in regard to those provisions.
The Act also continues through December 14, 2007, funding for Government programs for which the Congress has not yet passed regular appropriations acts. However, the Act does not provide funds needed to support members of the U.S. Armed Forces deployed for combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, and I expect and urge the Congress to promptly present separate legislation to meet that urgent funding need.
