Travel pool report #7 - church departure 
POTUS left the church at about 5:06 pm. There did not appear to be any grandchildren accompanying him on the way out.
He did not respond to a shouted question about whether he was committed to working with Republicans on gun reform.
Several onlookers were on hand as he left - they appeared to be taking a pit stop from an exercise walk.
Several demonstrators were gathered near the church around the time the president arrived, but were gone by the time he left.
One of the earlier demonstrators' signs read "Joe Biden Equals Abortion Euthanasia and Infanticide."
"Puppets," one of them said before departing, apparently directing the remark toward the pool.
