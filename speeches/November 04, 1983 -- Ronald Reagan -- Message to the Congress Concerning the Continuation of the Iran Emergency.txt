    To the Congress of the United States:
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination on the anniversary date of a declaration of emergency, unless prior to the anniversary date the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the Iran emergency is to continue in effect beyond the November 14, 1983 anniversary date. Similar notices were sent to the Congress and the Federal Register on November 12, 1980, November 12, 1981, and' November 8, 1982.
The crisis between the United States and Iran which began in 1979 has eased, but it has not been fully resolved. The internal situation in Iran remains uncertain; the war between Iran and Iraq continues. The international arbitral tribunal established for the adjudication of claims of U.S. nationals against Iran and by Iranian nationals against the United States continues to function; however, full normalization of commercial and diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Iran will require more time. In these circumstances, I have determined that it is necessary to maintain in force the broad authorities that may be needed to respond to the process of implementation of the January 1981 agreements with Iran and the eventual normalization of relations.
