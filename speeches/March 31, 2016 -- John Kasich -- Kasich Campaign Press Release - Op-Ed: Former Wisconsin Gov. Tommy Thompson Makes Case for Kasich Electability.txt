    ICYMI: Former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson Makes Case for Kasich Electability
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
On April 5th, we have the opportunity to vote for the only Republican with a real shot of winning the White House in November — John Kasich.
As a congressman and governor, John Kasich's record of producing economic growth stands head and shoulders above anything Donald Trump or Ted Cruz have accomplished.

There is no doubt John Kasich has the best history of conservative accomplishments of any Republican candidate, but all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing if Republicans cannot win the White House.
Republicans need to win in November, and John Kasich represents our best opportunity.
No Republican has ever won the White House without winning Ohio. In 2014 John Kasich won re-election by a 30-point margin. He currently enjoys a 62% approval rating in a state that has gone to the Democrats in the last two presidential election cycles.
A Quinnipiac Poll released this week shows Hillary Clinton would beat Trump 46% to 40% and Cruz 45% to 42% in November. Kasich, on the other hand, polls ahead of Clinton at 47% to 39% in a head-to-head matchup.
