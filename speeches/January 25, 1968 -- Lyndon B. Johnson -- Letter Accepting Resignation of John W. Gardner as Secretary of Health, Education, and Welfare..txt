    Dear John:
I accept your resignation with deep regret. You have served your Nation and your President well and faithfully. You have helped to build HEW during a critical period of its growth and to administer programs which touch the lives of all our citizens.
I have appreciated your willingness to stay in government beyond the term of your original commitment. I am pleased that you are going to undertake leadership in the area of pressing urban problems. You may count on my continued strong support in any way I can be helpful.
Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Honorable John W. Gardner, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, Washington, D.C.]
