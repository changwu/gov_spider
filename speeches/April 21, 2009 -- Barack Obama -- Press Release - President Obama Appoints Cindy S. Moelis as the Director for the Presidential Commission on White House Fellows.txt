    Today, President Barack Obama appointed Cindy S. Moelis as the Director for the Presidential Commission on White House Fellows.
The White House Fellows Program was founded in 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. President Obama strongly supports the original mission of this program: To encourage active citizenship and service to the nation. Today, the purpose of the program is to help future leaders make an even more significant difference. The program attracts and selects people with extraordinary leadership ability and an interest in service to others. Previously, the First Lady was involved in the Fellows selection process and will continue to provide leadership and support.
Moelis most recently served as the Executive Director of the Pritzker Traubert Family Foundation. Throughout her career, she has diligently worked to preserve the public interest through education reform and fighting social justice challenges.
Moelis holds an undergraduate degree from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, and a J.D. from Stanford Law School.
