"Once again the president shows just how willing he is to distort the facts to score cheap political points, and how dangerous his reelection would be for the future of this country. In fact, I have enthusiastically endorsed the House Republican budget, including the Ryan-Wyden optional premium support plan in Medicare. My concern over previous versions of this budget was limited to the fact that the premium support plan was mandatory rather than optional. That concern has been addressed. For the president to so blatantly distort the facts while offering no plan of his own just shows how little he is concerned with governing and solving the debt crisis enveloping this country."
