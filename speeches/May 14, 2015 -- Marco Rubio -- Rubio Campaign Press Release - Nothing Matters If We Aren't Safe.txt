The economy will always be a major domestic issue. It's the daily concern of millions of Americans, but it won't matter if we can't keep the people and processes that run it safe from foreign threats.
From China, to Russia, to Iran, there are multiple threats to our national security at this very moment. The world has never been more dangerous than it is today, but in the New American Century, a stronger America will make the world safer.
