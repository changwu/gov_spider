    Today, Wisconsin Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"With so much at stake in this election, there's only one candidate for president who can lead our country toward a real, equitable recovery – and that's Joe Biden.
"During the last three years, Donald Trump has pulled the levers of power for the wealthy and well-connected – rigging the tax system against working-class families and American manufacturers, retreating from commitments like the Paris Climate Agreement, and waging partisan battles to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He's fanned the flames of hate and division for his own political gain. Now, as we navigate a deadly global pandemic and double-digit unemployment, Wisconsin families are paying the price for Donald Trump's failure to lead.
"Joe Biden has outlined a better path forward for the American people. As president, Joe will bring our country together to build back better than before – revitalizing our manufacturing economy in Wisconsin, and creating good-paying jobs that can support a family. He recognizes the existential threat of climate change and will mobilize our country to build a more resilient, green infrastructure and clean energy future. And Joe will be the ally Black and Brown communities need in the White House to root out the systemic racism we experience in everything from policing to housing and health care.
"Joe has the character, empathy, and experience to build a country that works for all of us – and I'll work tirelessly to deliver Wisconsin for Joe this November."
