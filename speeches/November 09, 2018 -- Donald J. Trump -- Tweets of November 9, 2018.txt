As soon as Democrats sent their best Election stealing lawyer Marc Elias to Broward County they miraculously started finding Democrat votes. Don't worry Florida - I am sending much better lawyers to expose the FRAUD!Retweets: 43706Favorites: 135525

Rick Scott was up by 50000+ votes on Election Day now they 'found' many votes and he is only up 15000 votes. 'The Broward Effect.' How come they never find Republican votes?Retweets: 33793Favorites: 113555

Mayor Gillum conceded on Election Day and now Broward County has put him 'back into play.' Bill Nelson conceded Election - now he's back in play!? This is an embarrassment to our Country and to Democracy!Retweets: 35860Favorites: 128691

In the 2016 Election I was winning by so much in Florida that Broward County which was very late with vote tabulation and probably getting ready to do a 'number' couldn't do it because not enough people live in Broward for them to falsify a victory!Retweets: 23262Favorites: 86386

President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S. China and Russia. Very insulting but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!Retweets: 39996Favorites: 148502
