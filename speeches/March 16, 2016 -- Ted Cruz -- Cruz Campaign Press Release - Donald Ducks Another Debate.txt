HOUSTON, Texas – The presidential campaign of Ted Cruz today criticized Donald Trump for ducking yet another Fox News debate and committed to attend the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference being held in Washington, D.C., on Monday, March 21st, where Trump will also be speaking.
"Let's be intellectually honest about what's going on here – Donald Trump is scared to debate Ted Cruz next week," said Cruz for President Spokesman Ron Nehring. "Perhaps Mr. Trump is unable to speak for more than one minute about any given topic because of his shallow understanding of basic policies, or perhaps he is scared of voters learning the truth — that he has spent his entire adult life promoting liberal positions completely opposite of the conservative platform that he has campaigned on. Mr. Trump, if you won't debate in Utah, we'll bring the debate to you."
While the AIPAC speaking opportunity is not a debate, Ted Cruz will use his speaking opportunity to highlight Trump's positions – or lack thereof – in front of the thousands of AIPAC members in attendance, including Trump's recent comments that he would be "neutral" in the debate between Israel and the Palestinians.
"Donald can't duck us for the rest of this campaign, and so we will happily press the issue until the public pressure becomes too much for him to bear," continued Nehring. "Anytime, anyplace...let's do it, Donald."
