    I am heartened by the news this morning that more Americans found jobs again last month—345,000 between May and June alone. The number of employees on payrolls is up 1.1 million from last December.
Day by day, month by month, America is gathering strength and moving forward. We still have a long way to go, but the recovery is spreading. Our most pressing task is to keep it rolling while holding down inflation, and that means holding down Federal spending. I urge the Members of the Congress-both Republicans and Democrats—to work with us and exercise the discipline we need to continue building a new era of lasting growth for the American people.
