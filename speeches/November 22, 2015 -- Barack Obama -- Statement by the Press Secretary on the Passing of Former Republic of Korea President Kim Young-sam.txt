    On behalf of the American people, we send our heartfelt condolences to the people of the Republic of Korea for the passing of former President Kim Young-sam. President Kim led the Korean people through one of the most challenging periods of the transition to democracy and set a precedent for a peaceful transfer of power in South Korean leadership that endures to this day. His contributions to the peace, stability, and prosperity of the Republic of Korea will always be remembered, and his legacy is enshrined in America's unbreakable relationship with the Korean Government and people.
