    Today's dismal jobless claims report is a reminder that we are in the midst of a growing economic crisis and Senator McCain has yet to answer the call of economic leadership. Americans need a president who understands the complex challenges our economy faces – from lagging employment to record gas prices to a housing and credit crisis which threaten to drive us into a painful and deep recession. Senator McCain has already admitted that he doesn't know much about economics, and he is proving that point on the campaign trail. His plan for the housing crisis is simply not to have one.
I've been trying to deliver a wake up call to the Administration on the housing crisis for more than a year. I have the most aggressive plan to help homeowners of any candidate in this race – including $30 billion in emergency assistance for families and communities to fight foreclosures. And I believe the government should stand ready to go further and temporarily purchase at-risk mortgages to help unfreeze the mortgage markets and keep millions of families in their homes.
