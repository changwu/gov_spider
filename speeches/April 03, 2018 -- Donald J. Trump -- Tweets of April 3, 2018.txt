As ridiculous as it sounds the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our Southern Border back where they came from. A whole big wasted procedure must take place. Mexico & Canada have tough immigration laws whereas ours are an Obama joke. ACT CONGRESSRetweets: 24596Favorites: 89883

Honduras Mexico and many other countries that the U.S. is very generous to sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES. Caravans are heading here. Must pass tough laws and build the WALL. Democrats allow open borders drugs and crime!Retweets: 20587Favorites: 79542

39% of my nominations including Diplomats to foreign lands have not been confirmed due to Democrat obstruction and delay. At this rate it would take more than 7 years before I am allowed to have these great people start working. Never happened before. Disgraceful!Retweets: 30648Favorites: 103239

'President Trump's approval rate among likely U.S. voters hit 50 percent on Monday which puts him higher than former President Barack Obama's score at the same point into his first term according to a new poll.'

The Fake News Networks those that knowingly have a sick and biased AGENDA are worried about the competition and quality of Sinclair Broadcast. The 'Fakers' at CNN NBC ABC & CBS have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction!Retweets: 21418Favorites: 86809

The big Caravan of People from Honduras now coming across Mexico and heading to our 'Weak Laws' Border had better be stopped before it gets there. Cash cow NAFTA is in play as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW!Retweets: 25533Favorites: 99245

Check out the fact that you can't get a job at ratings challenged @CNN unless you state that you are totally anti-Trump? Little Jeff Zuker whose job is in jeopardy is not having much fun lately. They should clean up and strengthen CNN and get back to honest reporting!Retweets: 16830Favorites: 70804

Thank you to Rasmussen for the honest polling. Just hit 50% which is higher than Cheatin' Obama at the same time in his Administration.Retweets: 22540Favorites: 99903

I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy. Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the American Taxpayer. Many billions of dollars. P.O. leaders don't have a clue (or do they?)!Retweets: 20292Favorites: 84366
