    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question covering the period October 1 to November 30, 1999. The previous submission covered events during August and September 1999.
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan announced on November 13 the start of proximity talks in New York on December 3 to work towards a resolution to the long-standing Cyprus dispute. The goal of these talks is to prepare the ground for meaningful negotiations leading to a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem.
This welcome news was highlighted during my trip to Turkey and Greece from November 15-20 as a positive step toward bringing about a just and lasting solution for all Cypriots and improving Greek-Turkish relations for a more secure southern Europe.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
