    "After four years of wasteful spending and record debt, Americans already know what President Obama's second term will look like. The President's failed policies have allowed welfare spending to skyrocket. And it's the middle class that will pay the price, with a crushing debt that will cost middle-class families $4,000 in higher taxes. As president, Mitt Romney will deliver a real recovery to get Americans off of welfare programs and back in good-paying jobs with higher take-home pay." — Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
Under President Obama, The Nation's Spending On Federal Welfare Programs Has Skyrocketed:
Under President Obama, The Federal Government's Expenditures On Welfare Programs Have Expanded From $563,413,000,000 To $745,840,000,000, An Increase Of More Than 32 Percent. (Congressional Research Service, 10/16/12)


    While Welfare Spending Has Skyrocketed, The Federal Government's Expenditures On Employment And Training Components Of Welfare Programs Have Only Increased By 3.6 Percent. (Congressional Research Service, 10/16/12)
  

"Welfare Spending Has Grown Substantially Over The Past Four Years ... More Than Social Security, Basic Defense Spending Or Any Other Single Chunk Of The Federal Government..." "Welfare spending has grown substantially over the past four years, reaching $746 billion in 2011 — or more than Social Security, basic defense spending or any other single chunk of the federal government — according to a new memo by the Congressional Research Service." (Stephen Dinan, "Welfare Spending Jumps 32 Percent In Four Years," The Washington Times, 10/18/12)
The Federal Government's Expenditures On Food Stamps In The Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) Doubled From $37,179,000,000 To $74,943,000,000. (Congressional Research Service, 10/16/12)


    But Expenditures On The Employment And Training Component Of The SNAP Program Have Only Increased From $351,000,000 To $354,000,000 — Less Than 1 Percent. (Congressional Research Service, 10/16/12)
  

"Most Of The Increase Came From Spending Due To Obama's Stimulus, The CRS Study States." "The study, commissioned by Senate Budget Committee ranking member Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), included traditional welfare, food stamps, Medicaid, Pell grants and 80 other federal programs but excluded veterans assistance programs. Together, the federal government spent $746 billion in 2011 on these programs in 2011, up from $563 billion in 2008. Most of the increase came from spending due to Obama's stimulus, the CRS study states." (Erik Wasson, "Study Shows 33 Percent Spending Increase In Federal Poverty Programs," The Hill, 10/18/12)
The Dramatic Increase In Spending Is Due To Both The Sluggish Economic Recovery And Because Of "Broadened Eligibility" Requirements. "The steady rise in welfare spending, which covers more than 80 programs primarily designed to help low-income Americans, got a big boost from the 2009 stimulus and has grown, albeit somewhat more slowly, in 2010 and 2011. One reason is that more people are qualifying in the weak economy, but the federal government also has broadened eligibility so that more people qualify for programs." (Stephen Dinan, "Welfare Spending Jumps 32 Percent In Four Years," The Washington Times, 10/18/12)
And Now That He's Gutted The Work Requirements In Welfare, President Obama's Federal Spending Will Only Skyrocket Faster:
The Obama Administration's Welfare Changes "Quietly Opened The Door For States To Seek Major Changes" In Work Requirements. "The Obama administration has quietly opened the door for states to seek major changes in how they meet federal welfare-to-work requirements for some of their poorest residents, and leading conservatives are crying foul." (Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, "Obama Administration Opens The Door For States To Seek Major Changes In Welfare-To-Work Law," The Associated Press, 7/13/12)
President Obama "Tossed Out The Clinton-Era Welfare Reform That Required Able-Bodied Aid Recipients To Work." "Democrats and Republicans alike should be distressed by President Barack Obama's disregard for constitutional limits on his authority. The president's flouting of the separation of powers risks turning this country into something other than a representative democracy. Congress should move in a bipartisan rebuke of Obama's overreach before he neuters that institution. In a blatant challenge to the legislative branch, Obama by executive order tossed out the Clinton-era welfare reform that required able-bodied aid recipients to work, saying the federal government will no longer enforce the law." (Editorial, "Obama's Power Grab Flouts Constitution," Detroit News, 8/6/12)
The Wall Street Journal: "The Administration Has, In Fact, Gutted" Work Requirements. "This is the reform that the Administration has, in fact, gutted. There's flexibility to innovate and there's 'flexibility.' In the first case, HHS has denied Governors the running room to redesign Medicaid to be more cost effective. But now it tells states that they don't have to comply with the most basic obligation of welfare reform. It's as if HHS told states they can have the 'flexibility' not to cover health care for poor people." (Editorial, "Welfare Reform As We Knew It," The Wall Street Journal, 9/19/12)
Americans Can't Afford Four More Years Of Wasteful Spending — The Next Generation And Middle-Class Families Will Pay The Price:
Under President Obama's Policies, The National Debt Is Projected To Surpass $20 Trillion By The End Of 2016 — An Increase Of More Than $4 Trillion In New Debt. ("Fiscal Year 2013 Mid-Session Review: Budget Of The U.S. Government," Office Of Management And Budget, 7/27/12)


    President Obama Has Already Presided Over A National Debt That Has Surpassed A Record $16 Trillion — An Increase Of $5.5 Trillion On His Watch. (US Department Of The Treasury, Accessed 10/15/12)
  

American Enterprise Institute Has Calculated That The Annual Cost Of President Obama's Current And Looming Debt Burden Amounts To $4,000 Per Year In Higher Taxes On The Middle Class. "In a new paper, AEI's Matt Jensen looks at the real annual cost of servicing the debt for households at various levels of income — including a potentially higher tax burden. As the table below illustrates, a household making between $100,000 and $200,000 a year could find its tax liability higher by roughly $2,400 every year. Over ten years, that works out to $24,000. And when you add in the debt already accrued the past four years under President Obama (the second table), that's another $1,600 a year. So now we are now talking about $4,000 a year, $40,000 over ten years." (James Pethokoukis, "Study: Obama's Big Budget Deficits Could Mean A $4,000 A Year Middle-Class Tax Hike," American Enterprise Institute, 10/2/12)
