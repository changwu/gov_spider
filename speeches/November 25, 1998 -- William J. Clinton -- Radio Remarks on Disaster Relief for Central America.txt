    Throughout this week, families in the United States are coming together to give thanks for the blessings we enjoy. As we celebrate, we must remember our neighbors, particularly the people in Central America whose lives were devastated by Hurricane Mitch a month ago.
The Americas are also a family, and many relatives of our own citizens live in the nations hardest hit by the hurricane: Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador. The United States has already pledged $263 million to the relief effort, offering food, loans, and vital health services. Our Armed Forces are on the scene transporting supplies, rebuilding roads and communities. The First Lady and Tipper Gore visited the region and renewed our pledge to do all we can to help.
So this Thanksgiving I ask you to keep the hurricane victims in your thoughts and prayers and to continue your generous donation to relief organizations. In this season of need, we will not let down our fellow Americans.
