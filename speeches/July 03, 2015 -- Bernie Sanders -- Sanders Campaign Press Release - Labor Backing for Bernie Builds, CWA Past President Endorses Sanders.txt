    COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa â€“ In another show of union support for Bernie Sanders, one of the nation's most influential labor leaders on Friday endorsed the Democratic Party presidential candidate.
Larry Cohen, the past president of the Communications Workers of America, gave his backing to Sanders at a news conference held here in a local union hall.
"This is not a close call," Cohen said at the news conference. "This is a guy who for his entire life has been there for working people." Cohen also laid out the case for Sanders in an op-ed for The Huffington Post.
"I am proud to have the support of Larry Cohen and so many workers in the American trade union movement," Sanders said. "They know we need an economy that works for the middle class and not just the wealthy."
Sanders and Cohen were flanked at the news conference by members of other labor organizations, including the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the National Association of Letter Carriers, the Iron Workers Union, the Laborers' International Union of North America, National Nurses United, the American Postal Workers Union and 75 others.
Cohen's endorsement was the latest example of growing enthusiasm for Sanders' candidacy.
More than 1,000 union leaders and members recently launched a Labor for Bernie 2016 network, a diverse grassroots initiative built to support Sanders' presidential campaign.
Sanders also was praised in resolutions adopted by the Vermont and South Carolina AFL-CIO executive boards. The Vermont-NEA also backs Sanders.
