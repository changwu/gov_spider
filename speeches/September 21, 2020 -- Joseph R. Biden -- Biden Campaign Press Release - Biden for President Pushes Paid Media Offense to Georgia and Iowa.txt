    New Ads Geared Towards African American Voters Highlight "Shop Talk" 
Today, Biden for President announced it is pushing its paid media offensive into the key battleground expansion states Georgia and Iowa, growing the campaign's robust advertising program to span a total of 12 critical states between now and Election Day and represent the broad and diverse map that paves multiple paths for Joe Biden to reach 270 electoral votes.
Additionally, the campaign is debuting new ads in Georgia on television and digital featuring its "Shop Talk" series, a national program that facilitates roundtable discussions on the challenges impacting Black men in America, and will be geared towards African American voters in the Peach State.
"Shop Talk: Criminal Justice Reform" is a 0:60 and 0:30 spot that features a group of African American men discussing criminal justice issues facing their communities, families, and selves, and why America needs Joe Biden's plan for strengthening America's commitment to justice. Additionally, "Shop Talk: Yes She Can" is a 0:30 spot that features their conversation about the historic nature of Kamala Harris' candidacy as the first African American woman on the ticket. The previously released ads "We Are Listening" and "He Knew" will also be airing in Georgia markets.
In Iowa, the campaign will be up with previously released ads that highlight Joe Biden's leadership experience, plans to beat COVID-19 and build back our economy better, and unify the country â€” drawing a sharp contrast to the failures of Donald Trump's administration. "Be Not Afraid," "Defend," and "Personal" are examples of ads that will be airing in key Iowa media markets and on digital platforms in the Hawkeye State.
The full list of battleground states the campaign is pushing its ads now includes Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Nebraska, and Minnesota.
