NBC's Chuck Todd: "Mitt Romney's last answer about what he's been hearing on the campaign trail was one of his best messages I've heard yet." (Chuck Todd, "Romney's Best Debate Answer In Months," MSNBC's First Read, http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/, Posted 1/10/08)

ABC's Rick Klein: "Ahh, the R-word. 'Could we be headed for a recession? Absolutely. Do we have to be headed for a recession? Absolutely not.' Good answer by Mitt Romney." (Rick Klein, "Live Blogging During GOP Debate By Rick Klein," ABC's Political Radar, http://blogs.abcnews.com/, Posted 1/10/08)

Townhall's Hugh Hewitt: "Romney had less screen time tonight, but each time he answered he was poised and eloquent." (Hugh Hewitt, "Tonight's Debate," Townhall Blog, http://hughhewitt.townhall.com/, Posted 1/10/08)
- Hewitt: "The opening response on the economy, aimed specifically at Michigan voters was very strong, and his 'Nope' answer to Wallace's question about whether the voters in New Hampshire might be saying that they do not want change in D.C. was perfect pitch..." (Hugh Hewitt, "Tonight's Debate," Townhall Blog, http://hughhewitt.townhall.com/, Posted 1/10/08)
- Hewitt: "[Romney's] grasp of the foreign affairs questions impressive." (Hugh Hewitt, "Tonight's Debate," Townhall Blog, http://hughhewitt.townhall.com/, Posted 1/10/08)

National Review's Kate O'Beirne: "It wasn't a friendly question, but Chris Wallace did Romney a favor. Solid answer on reforming Washington by a guy with a track record." (Kate O'Beirne, "Again The Outsider," National Review's The Corner, http://corner.nationalreview.com/, Posted 1/10/08)
- O'Beirne: "Mitt Romney's optimism recalls Reagan." (Kate O'Beirne, "Nice Outsider Appeal," National Review's The Corner Blog, http://corner.nationalreview.com/, Posted 1/10/08)

The American Spectator's Quin Hillyer: "Now Romney gets a tough question on abortion. He starts out with a really really strong answer. Now he segues back to Reagan. He ably defends 'the principles that Ronald Reagan espoused.' Good answer." (Quin Hillyer, "Reagan Coalition Gone?" The American Spectator Blog, http://corner.nationalreview.com/, Posted 1/10/08)
- Hillyer: "Romney says people do NOT want "Washington experience" more than change. Gives a good litany of complaints against Washington. Also gives the best, most concise and effective summary of his own experience that I have heard yet from him in this campaign. Good answer." (Quin Hillyer, "Change Or Experience?" American Spectator's AmSpec Blog, http://www.spectator.org/, Posted 1/10/08)

National Review's The Corner: "Talking about broken Washington is much more convincing from an outsider who has turned things around before. Romney was a contrast with McCain, I thought." ("Re: Outsider Appeal," National Review's The Corner, http://corner.nationalreview.com/, Posted 1/10/08)
National Review's Jim Geraghty: "Paul's argument that the threat from Iran is overstated was a high, hanging curve, and it was a solid hit from Romney."
