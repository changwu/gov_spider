    I have the honor to transmit herewith for the consideration of Congress a supplemental estimate of appropriation amounting to $7,000,000 for the Department of Agriculture for the fiscal year 1930, to remain available until June 30, 1931, for the purpose of making advances or loans to farmers as authorized by the joint resolution entitled "Joint resolution for the relief of farmers in the storm, flood, and/or drought stricken areas of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Ohio, Oklahoma, Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana, New Mexico, and Missouri," approved March 3, 1930.
The details of this supplemental estimate of appropriation, the necessity therefor, and the reason for its transmission at this time are set forth in the letter of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, transmitted herewith, with whose comments and observations thereon I concur.
Respectfully,
