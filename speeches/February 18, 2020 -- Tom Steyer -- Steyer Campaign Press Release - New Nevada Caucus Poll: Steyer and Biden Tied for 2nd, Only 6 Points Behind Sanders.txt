    (LAS VEGAS, February 18, 2020) –– A new poll from Beacon Research conducted for the Steyer campaign shows Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer continuing his strong rise in Nevada just days before the Caucus. The poll shows Steyer statistically tied with Vice President Biden for 2nd place and trailing Senator Sanders by just 6 points. The research shows Steyer finishing strong regardless of the turnout model, and making strong inroads with African Americans and Latinos, two voting blocks critical to picking up delegates in Nevada, South Carolina, and the delegate-rich Super Tuesday states.
"Tom Steyer is putting together a strong coalition in Nevada that could shock the world on Saturday," said Beacon pollster Matthew Shelter. "Tom's made strong gains with African Americans and Latinos, and his message is resonating with an electorate that's looking for a leader to champion their communities and build the diverse coalition needed to beat Donald Trump in November."
Regardless of the turnout model, the data shows Steyer well over the 12% threshold put forth by the DNC to make the Nevada debate. Due to a lack of qualifying polls, Nevadans could very well miss the opportunity to see the candidate tied for second place take the stage tomorrow night in Las Vegas. Lastly, the data shows Senators Warren and Klobuchar struggling to poll in the double digits.
Beacon Research is a nationally-recognized polling and analytics firm that provides rigorous quantitative and qualitative research to political candidates, nonprofits, ballot initiatives, corporations, foundations, and more. The poll of 600 likely Democratic caucus-goers in Nevada was conducted between Feb. 12-15, using a mixed-mode of online, cellphone and landline interviews.
