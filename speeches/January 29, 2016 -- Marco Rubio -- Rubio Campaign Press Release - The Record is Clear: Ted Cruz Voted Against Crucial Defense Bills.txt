Here are the facts:
In 2013, Senator Cruz voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014. (RC Vote #284, Passed: 84-15, 12/19/13)
In 2014, Senator Cruz voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. (RC Vote #325, Passed: 89-11, 12/12/14)
In 2015, Senator Cruz voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. (RC Vote #277, Passed: 70-27, 10/7/15)
What does the NDAA do?
The NDAA "advances the vital funding and authorities that America's military requires."
"The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)...is the primary way Congress meets its most important constitutional obligation to 'provide for the common defense.' It advances the vital funding and authorities that America's military requires. In an era of unprecedented threats, uncertainty, and technological change, the legislation ensures America's Armed Forces are agile, efficient, ready, and lethal." (NDAA For FY2016 Conference Report, Fact Sheet)

The Cruz record is clear:
Senator Cruz "has consistently voted against defense reauthorization bills that enable troop funding."
"Mr. Cruz regaled the crowd about how he had opposed a proposal to intervene in Syria and how he doesn't support 'nation building.' To this he could add a few others: He has consistently voted against defense reauthorization bills that enable troop funding." (Kim Strassel, Wall Street Journal, 11/19/15)

Senator Cruz "has voted no on each of the National Defense Authorization Acts during his tenure in Congress."
"Cruz, a member of the Senate Armed Service Committee, has voted no on each of the National Defense Authorization Acts during his tenure in Congress, citing his objection to laws that would permit the indefinite detention of an American citizen." (The Weekly Standard, 12/15/15)

"Paul and Cruz were the only Republicans to oppose a compromise national defense policy bill."
"Paul and Cruz were the only Republicans to oppose a compromise national defense policy bill last month, another area in Cruz's record that Rubio's team believe is ripe for inspection. And senior Republicans are still annoyed at those votes." (Politico, 11/17/15)

The NDAAs Fund The Iron Dome Program In Israel …
Senator Cruz has voted against the annual NDAA "that helps fund missile-defense programs in Israel like Iron Dome."
"And since entering the Senate in 2013, Cruz has voted against the annual National Defense Authorization Act, a broad, comprehensive defense budget authority bill that helps fund missile-defense programs in Israel like Iron Dome." (The Weekly Standard, 12/3/15)

"But of the many programs funded by the NDAA support missile defense in Israel."
"But of the many programs funded by the NDAA support missile defense in Israel. Included in the FY2015 NDAA passed last year, for example, were $622 million for cooperative programs with Israel, including $351 million earmarked for Iron Dome. The next year's NDAA, passed earlier in 2015, added an additional $320 million to the president's request for Iron Dome and other cooperative programs with Israel. His reasons may have been unrelated to these programs, but Cruz voted against the comprehensive bills that funding." (The Weekly Standard, 12/3/15)

But Ted Cruz has stood behind his bad votes:
