    Dear Mr. Randall:
I am transmitting herewith the report of the Lewis Douglas mission following up the financial and economic conversations held between representatives of the United Kingdom and of our Government in Washington last March.
The analysis and findings of the Douglas report represent, in my opinion, a real contribution to thinking in the field of dollar-sterling relationships. I commend the report to the earnest attention of you and your associates as you undertake your canvass of the whole broad field of foreign economic policy.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
