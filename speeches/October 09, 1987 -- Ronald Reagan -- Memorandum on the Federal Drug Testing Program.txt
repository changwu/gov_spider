    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesSubject: Drug Testing Plan
As you know, ending illegal drug use is one of the most important goals we must work together to achieve. For that reason, I signed an Executive Order on September 15, 1986, directing each Executive branch department and agency to develop a plan that provides for drug education, counseling and rehabilitation, as well as a testing program to identify drug use by Federal workers in sensitive positions.
I was impressed by the strong determination shown at the National Drug Policy Board meeting in July to implement the Executive Order. I know that all of the departmental plans are scheduled to be submitted to the Interagency Working Group by October 15, 1987.
I have asked Secretary Bowen to provide me with a status report on our progress. Because we cannot go forward until all plans are in place, your personal attention to your department's plan as a priority matter will be helpful in ensuring that our program is successful.
