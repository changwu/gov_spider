    The freedom, security, and prosperity that we enjoy as a nation exists only because of the heroic and selfless sacrifices of America's service men and women. Today we owe special remembrance to the veterans of the Korean war and especially the United States and Allied combatants who made the ultimate sacrifice in Korea. For their courageous actions in pursuit of freedom and democracy for the Korean Peninsula, these dedicated men and women deserve our unending respect and gratitude.
