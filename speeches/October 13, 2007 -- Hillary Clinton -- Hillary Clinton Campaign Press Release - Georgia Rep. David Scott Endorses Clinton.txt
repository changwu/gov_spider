    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Georgia Congressman David Scott.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to deliver the change this country needs," Rep. Scott said.
First elected to Congress in 2002, Rep. Scott has worked tirelessly to expand opportunity for American workers, leading the fight to raise the minimum wage and keep American jobs here at home. He has been an outspoken advocate for preserving and expanding the Children's Health Insurance Program, promoting an effort to overturn President Bush's veto and expand health care coverage to nearly 4 million more kids. And Rep. Scott has stayed focused on supporting the people of his district, holding annual job and health fairs to bring new employers and health care options to Georgia.
Rep. Scott began his career as a successful advertising executive, and was elected to the Georgia State House in 1975. He later served in the Georgia State Senate from 1983 to 2002.
Rep. Scott is a member of the influential Financial Services Committee, the Capital Markets and Financial Institutions Subcommittees, the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Middle East and South Asia Subcommittee, and the Agriculture Committee. He is the Vice Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade and the Co-Chairman of the Democratic Group on National Security.
"David has led the fight on so many important issues, from raising the minimum wage to ensuring that our veterans get the benefits they deserve," Clinton said. "I am honored to have David's support, and delighted that he'll help lead our efforts in Georgia."
