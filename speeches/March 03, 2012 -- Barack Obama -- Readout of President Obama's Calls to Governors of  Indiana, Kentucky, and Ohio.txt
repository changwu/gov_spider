    Today, after receiving a briefing from FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate, President Obama called Indiana Governor Daniels, Kentucky Governor Beshear, and Ohio Governor Kasich to express his concern for citizens impacted by the severe weather and tornadoes this week, including yesterday and overnight, and condolences to families who had lost loved ones. The President acknowledged that the extent of damage may not be known for days, and reiterated to each Governor that FEMA stood ready to provide assistance, if necessary, to the extensive response efforts already underway in each state, led by the Governors' teams. The administration, through FEMA, is closely monitoring the storms and their impacts and remains in close contact with emergency officials in impacted states across the country to ensure there are not any unmet needs.
