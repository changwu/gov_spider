    I applaud the Senate's vote in support of a separate department of education. This department will bring tighter management to more than 150 Federal programs. It will eliminate the bureaucratic duplication necessitated by the current organizational structure. It will cut redtape for States, local governments, and others who deal with Federal education programs. It will make one Cabinet official responsible full-time for the effective, economical management of programs which cost the American taxpayer $13 billion annually.
Today's Senate vote confirms the inadequacy of the existing administrative structure. I would like to thank Senators Ribicoff and Byrd for giving this very important legislation the priority it deserves. I hope the House will move quickly to ensure that Federal education programs receive the full-time management attention and accountability that they clearly require.
