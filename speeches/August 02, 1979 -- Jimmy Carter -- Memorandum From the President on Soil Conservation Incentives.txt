    Memorandum for the Secretary of Agriculture
In my Environmental Message of August 2, 1979, I underscored my serious concern that since 1935 wind and water erosion have reduced by half the top soil on nearly one-third of the Nation's potentially usable croplands. Although more than $20 billion in federal funds has been invested in soil and water conservation programs of the Department of Agriculture, erosion continues to occur at very high rates. There are 28 existing soil conservation and water quality-related Department of Agriculture programs which are designed to help remedy this problem. the Resources Conservation Act (RCA) and Resources Planning Act (RPA) processes will review these and other programs and provide me in January 1980 with recommended improvements in program design and administration.
Due to the importance of the soil erosion problem I direct you, in consultation with the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, to undertake a comprehensive study of possible conservation incentives, building on the analysis of the RCA process, and to provide me with a report in January 1981.
A major goal of your effort should be to analyze the implications of modifying or interrelating existing agricultural assistance programs to bring about a greater reduction in soil erosion and related nonpoint pollution. The study shall also identify conflicts between farm income programs and soil conservation programs and develop recommendations for eliminating these conflicts where possible. The report shall set forth specific administrative and legislative recommendations to reduce soil erosion and to improve soil stewardship in order to maintain the Nation's long-term agricultural productivity, building on policy recommendations contained in the RCA 1980 Program report.
Please give this assignment your immediate attention.
