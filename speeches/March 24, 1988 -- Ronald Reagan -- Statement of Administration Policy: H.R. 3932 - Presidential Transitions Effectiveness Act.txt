    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Brooks (D) Texas and Horton (R) New York)
The Administration supports the provisions of H.R. 3932 that would increase the transition-related funding available to an incoming President and Vice President from $2 million to $3.5 million and that would index that amount, as well as the amount made available to an outgoing President and Vice President, to inflation. In that regard, the Administration believes that H.R. 3932 should be amended to increase the transition-related funding available to an outgoing President and Vice President from its current level of $1 million to $1.75 million.
The Administration opposes the public disclosure provisions of H.R. 3932 and believes, in the absence of compelling evidence of past abuse, that they are unnecessary. If disclosure requirements are deemed imperative, however, the Administration believes that the bill should be amended to make them simpler and less intrusive (e.g., by requiring that private transition-related contributions be reported only if they exceed a specified threshold, such as $1,000).
