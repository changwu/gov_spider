    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ In honor of Rosh Hashanah, Senator John Edwards shared the following message:
"Rosh Hashanah is an occasion for contemplating the past year and considering our future path. What have we done to make the world a better place? What can we do to improve ourselves as individuals?
