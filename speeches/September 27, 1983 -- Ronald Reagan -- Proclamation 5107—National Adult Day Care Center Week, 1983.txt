Adult day care centers provide supervised community settings in which partially disabled men and women of all ages can obtain care that may not be available in their own homes. These centers provide opportunities for adults who are socially isolated to find friends and learn skills. Day care centers enable individuals to obtain the care they need without being forced to live in institutions, and they offer needed respite to families whose infirmed relatives live with them.
In recognition that adult day care centers and their dedicated professional staffs serve many health maintenance functions, provide vital medical care, including medication monitoring, therapies, and health education, and provide invaluable opportunities for social interaction to disabled elderly Americans, the Congress of the United States, by House Joint Resolution 132, has designated the week beginning September 25, 1983, as "National Adult Day Care Center Week" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of that week.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning on September 25, 1983, as National Adult Day Care Center Week, and I call upon every American community to consider the value of adult day care centers and to give appropriate recognition to centers offering these important services throughout that week.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 27th day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.
RONALD REAGAN
