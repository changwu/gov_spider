The wonderful Diamond and Silk have been treated so horribly by Facebook. They work so hard and what has been done to them is very sad - and we're looking into. It's getting worse and worse for Conservatives on social media!Retweets: 27760Favorites: 101522

There is nothing easy about a USA Infrastructure Plan especially when our great Country has spent an astounding 7 trillion dollars in the Middle East over the last 19 years but I am looking hard at a bipartisan plan of 1 to 2 trillion dollars. Badly needed!Retweets: 16116Favorites: 71351

Anything in this very interesting world is possible but I believe that Kim Jong Un fully realizes the great economic potential of North Korea & will do nothing to interfere or end it. He also knows that I am with him & does not want to break his promise to me. Deal will happen!Retweets: 20132Favorites: 88312

Very good call yesterday with President Putin of Russia. Tremendous potential for a good/great relationship with Russia despite what you read and see in the Fake News Media. Look how they have misled you on 'Russia Collusion.' The World can be a better and safer place. Nice!Retweets: 21219Favorites: 90790

How can it be possible that James Woods (and many others) a strong but responsible Conservative Voice is banned from Twitter? Social Media & Fake News Media together with their partner the Democrat Party have no idea the problems they are causing for themselves. VERY UNFAIR!Retweets: 46773Favorites: 163630
