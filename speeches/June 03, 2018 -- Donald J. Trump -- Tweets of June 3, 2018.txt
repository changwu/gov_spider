As only one of two people left who could become President why wouldn't the FBI or Department of 'Justice' have told me that they were secretly investigating Paul Manafort (on charges that were 10 years old and had been previously dropped) during my campaign? Should have told me!Retweets: 22810Favorites: 95387

....Paul Manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time (he represented Ronald Reagan Bob Dole & many others over the years) but we should have been told that Comey and the boys were doing a number on him and he wouldn't have been hired!Retweets: 20706Favorites: 86911
