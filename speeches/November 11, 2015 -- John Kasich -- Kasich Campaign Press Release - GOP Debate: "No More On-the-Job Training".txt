"We need an executive who's been tried and tested, and judge the decisions that executive makes," he said.
Americans need a seasoned executive who has successfully led the charge on conservative issues like balancing the federal budget, cutting taxes, and helping to spur job creation.
Enough is enough with the on-the-job training. For the last eight years, America has experienced the consequences of electing a President who was woefully unprepared for the job.
President Obama has proven that a lack of experience finding real, meaningful solutions to problems faced by everyday Americans creates an atmosphere of uncertainty and decline. Our country has been adrift in the absence of effective leadership. With a tried and tested leader in the Oval Office, America will see and feel the difference.
John Kasich is restoring confidence that our brightest days are ahead of us.
