    Today's shooting at Heritage High School in Georgia was deeply troubling to us all. In the wake of these terrible incidents, all Americans must come together and do everything we can to protect children from violence. I applaud the Senate for today's historic vote to close the gun show loophole and keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children.
