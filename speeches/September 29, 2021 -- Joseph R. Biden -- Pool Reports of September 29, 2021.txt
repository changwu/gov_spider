In town pool report #9: Biden appearance
?The pool entered Nats Park through a tunnel that deposited us at field level near right field.
The park's lower decks are relatively full of spectators. The lights and screens are on, like a major league game is being played. The congressional game is played Democrats versus Republicans, and Biden started his visit on the Democratic side.
When he first appeared, the game paused, and there were cheers and a few boos. Biden shook hands and took selfies. He also signed some baseballs. (He was visible on the jumbo screen.) We were told that he was dropping off some ice cream bars.
Biden is wearing an open collared, button down shirt and a dark blue sport coat, and he put on a dark blue hat.
The game resumed at 7:52, and Biden continued to mingle in the Democratic dugout.

In town pool report #10: Republican dugout
?FYI, the logo on Biden's hat is from the Beau Biden Foundation.?
Speaker Pelosi was also in the Democratic dugout. The pool spotted her chatting with POTUS.
POTUS moved to the Republican dugout in the middle of the third inning, as Democrats were winning 8 to 5. There were some boos from the crowd. (Republican fans were in the stands behind the Republican dugout, Democratic fans behind the Democratic dugout.)
It was hard to see what was happening because POTUS was not on the jumbo screen as he approached the dugout. But the pool noticed that he was accompanied by Cedric Richmond.
