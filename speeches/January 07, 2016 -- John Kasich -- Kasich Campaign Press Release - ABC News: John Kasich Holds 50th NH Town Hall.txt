  By Brad Mielke

ABC News: Ohio Governor John Kasich held his fiftieth town hall in New Hampshire Wednesday night, more than any other candidate in the presidential race.
And to celebrate, he brought a cake.
"Isn't that cool?" he said of the American flag design, encouraging supporters to come up and grab a slice. "It's really neat."
Kasich finds himself among a swarm of Republicans pinning their presidential hopes on the Granite State. Jeb Bush recently sent several of his Miami staffers to New Hampshire, and Chris Christie has spent the vast majority of his campaign in the state.
Kasich admitted that a poor finish here would doom his chances.
"If I get smoked here, I'm going to cry and I'm going to go home," he said. "I don't think that's going to happen, because we have too good of an organization."
Bruce Berke, a Concord lobbyist who supports Kasich, says the town hall "blitz" will pay off.
"I think it just really demonstrates what the New Hampshire primary is all about," Berke told ABC News. "The governor is working harder than anybody else. And think about it â€” no one has done fifty."
