(House Rules)
(Rep. Oberstar (D) Minnesota and two cosponsors)
The Administration supports a risk-based approach to highway bridge reconstruction and inspection, but objects to the provisions in H.R. 3999 that run counter to this objective, such as requiring shorter inspection frequencies and stipulating inspection technology that may be superseded by future developments. The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to ensure that all regulatory and reporting deadlines in the bill are realistically achievable. However, the Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 3999 unless it is amended to delete the bill's additional authorization of appropriations of $1 billion for FY 2009 for highway bridge replacement and rehabilitation. The Administration's requested funding level of $39.4 billion for the Federal-aid Highway program is both responsive to current needs and consistent with budgetary realities. The Administration does not intend to request additional funding.
