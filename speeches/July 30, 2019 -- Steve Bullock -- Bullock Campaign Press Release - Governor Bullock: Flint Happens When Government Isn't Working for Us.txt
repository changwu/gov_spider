    Flint is a tragedy that is all too common when we treat politics like a game. When government can barely function and science is ignored, working people — and too often communities of color — are the ones who get hurt. 
In 2019, it's an outrage that communities in America lack access to clean, safe drinking water. And it's another reason we need a President who will actually get stuff done, and not just talk about it. DC hasn't passed a budget on time in over two decades — if Governor Bullock didn't pass a budget, he'd be out of a job. 
As Governor, Bullock worked with a Republican legislature to pass a $400 million infrastructure package — Montana's first in over a decade. As President, Bullock will pursue a national infrastructure package that will ensure the people of Flint — and all American families — don't have to worry about the quality of their drinking water, let alone their roads and bridges.
