    Today, the Indian American Impact Fund ("Impact Fund") is endorsing Senator Kamala Harris for President. The Impact Fund's mission is to support and elect Indian American candidates who reflect the values of the Indian American community. In 2016, Harris became the first Indian American person elected to serve in the United States Senate.
"In a large, talented, and diverse field, Senator Kamala Harris is our best choice for President of the United States. She is a tested leader who has demonstrated throughout her career a strong commitment to our community's progressives and pluralistic values," said Deepak Raj, co-founder of IMPACT and Chair of the IMPACT Fund. "With so much at stake in this coming election, we need a bold champion for the people in the White House. We are confident Senator Harris is the right person for the job."
Last year, Senator Harris delivered the closing keynote address at Impact Summit 2018, a gathering of over 200 Indian American candidates, elected officials, supporters, and community leaders in Washington, D.C., hosted by the Indian American Impact Project.
"In such a critically important election, one that will shape policy and politics for generations to come, Indian Americans can't afford to stay on the sidelines. That's why Impact Fund is proud to be the first Indian American or Asian American political organization to endorse Senator Harris, and we call on our partner organizations to do the same," said Raj Goyle, co-founder of Impact Fund and a former member of the Kansas House of Representatives. "In the coming months, we look forward to marshaling our resources and networks to ensure Senator Harris secures the Democratic nomination and is elected the next President of the United States of America."
Last month, Senator Harris earned the endorsement of the California Asian Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus that is made up of the Democratic API members of the California State Legislature.
