    Former Virginia Governor and current member of the NRA Board of Directors Jim Gilmore made the following statement on Mitt Romney's record of supporting the Second Amendment:
"Mitt Romney has always been a strong supporter of the Second Amendment and will continue to be an advocate for gun owners as president. He understands that the Second Amendment is a basic American freedom and his record proves this. As Governor, he supported legislation supported by gun owners that reformed Massachusetts' onerous gun laws. President Obama has promoted policies that limit Americans' Second Amendment right, and it is critical that we work together to defeat him in November as he will undoubtedly pursue even more aggressive anti-gun policies if reelected. I urge gun owners who want an ally in the White House to support Mitt Romney this November."
