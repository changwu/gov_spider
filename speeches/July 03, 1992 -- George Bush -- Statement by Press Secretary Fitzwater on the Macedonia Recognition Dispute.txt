    The President strongly supports early resolution of the dispute over recognition of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. In this connection, we welcome efforts of the European Community to find a solution, including those taken at the June 29 summit. The United States would support any solution that is acceptable to the parties themselves. The United States therefore stands ready to do what it can, in support of European Community efforts, to help the parties solve this problem so that they can get on with a normal relationship.
