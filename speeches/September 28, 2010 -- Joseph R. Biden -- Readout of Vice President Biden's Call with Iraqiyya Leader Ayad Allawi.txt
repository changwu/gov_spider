    Earlier today, the Vice President spoke with Dr. Ayad Allawi, former Iraqi Prime Minister and leader of the Iraqiyya coalition. The two discussed the status of Iraqi negotiations on the formation of a new government. The Vice President said the U.S. government shares the goal of the Iraqi people for an inclusive government that reflects the results of the election. The Vice President reiterated the fact that the United States is not backing specific candidates. He said that all four winning coalitions should have the opportunity to play a role in the new government and expressed support for Iraqi consideration of power-sharing arrangements in accordance with the constitution. The Vice President urged Dr. Allawi, as he is urging all Iraqi leaders, to expedite efforts to form an inclusive and legitimate government responsive to the needs of the Iraqi people.
