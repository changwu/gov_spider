    Majority of Republicans Support American Rescue Plan After Being Told It's Democrats' Plan
A new Morning Consult poll today shows that 77% of Americans support the American Rescue Plan, including 59% of Republican voters. After describing the plan as the Democratic plan, bipartisan support for the plan maintained: 71% of Americans support the plan and 53% of Republicans.
Morning Consult wrote, "As the Senate prepares to advance President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, new Morning Consult/Politico polling shows strong bipartisan support for the measure is holding against an uptick in Republican attacks on its size, scope and price tag...That level of backing from the public is consistent with findings from a survey conducted ahead of the House's Feb. 27 successful vote on the bill, which passed without any GOP support."
The poll follows a letter from the National Restaurant Association and a joint letter from over 400 organizations from across the country, both urging the Senate to pass the bill and deliver desperately needed federal support and a boost to state and local economies.
