    On behalf of the American people, I congratulate the Iraqi people on the completion of yesterday's parliamentary elections. Millions of Iraqis embraced their democratic right to vote. The people of Iraq know better than anyone else the enormous challenges that they face, and yesterday's turnout demonstrated to the world that they seek to pursue a more stable and peaceful future through the political process.
Once results are finalized, a new Parliament will convene and debate the makeup of a new Government to serve the Iraqi people. Whatever the outcome of this process, it should serve to unite the country through the formation of a new Government that is supported by all Iraqi communities and that is prepared to advance tangible and implementable programs. There will be more difficult days ahead, but the United States will continue to stand with the Iraqi people as partners in their pursuit of a peaceful, unified, and prosperous future.
