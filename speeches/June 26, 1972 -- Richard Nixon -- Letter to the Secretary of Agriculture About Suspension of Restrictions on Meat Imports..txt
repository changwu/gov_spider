    Dear Mr. Secretary:
I have taken action today to liberalize the imports of beef. The action is being taken to help us meet the exploding demand for beef in this country.
As I have discussed with you, I am satisfied that in taking this action we are not endangering the economic position of our livestock producers.
Over the years they have made a sustained and essential contribution to meeting our growing demand for beef. I recognize fully that their continued economic health is essential so that they can play their full part in meeting our future demands. I know you are confident that they will continue to make this contribution and that you will call on me for any assistance you may need.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[Honorable Earl L. Butz, Secretary of Agriculture, Washington, D.C.]
