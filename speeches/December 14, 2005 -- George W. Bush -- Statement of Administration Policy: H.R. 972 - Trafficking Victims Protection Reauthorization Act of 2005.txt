    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Smith (R) NJ and 103 cosponsors)
The Administration supports reauthorization of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) and commends the International Relations and Judiciary Committees for addressing this important issue. H.R. 972 enhances U.S. efforts to combat both international and domestic trafficking in persons.
H.R. 972 makes a number of improvements to the TVPA. These include strengthening anti-trafficking and protection measures in conjunction with post-conflict and humanitarian emergency assistance. H.R. 972 also supports improved domestic efforts to combat trafficking, including a requirement that the best methods and practices for training state and local law enforcement be gathered and disseminated. Further, H.R. 972 brings important attention to reducing the demand for the commercial sex acts that fuel sex trafficking.
The Administration is committed to abolishing trafficking in persons. We look forward to continuing to work with Congress to address our remaining issues, such as the Department of Labor's requirements under Section 105 regarding imported products, as the legislation moves forward.
