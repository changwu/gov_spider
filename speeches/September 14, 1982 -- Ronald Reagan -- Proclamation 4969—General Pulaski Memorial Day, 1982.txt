  A Proclamation

Two hundred and three years ago the Polish and American patriot General Casimir Pulaski fell at the battle of Savannah while fighting for the principles of freedom and equality in our young Nation's struggle for independence. His example of dedication to democratic ideals has provided continuing inspiration to all of us. His name and deeds remain alive in the hearts of the Polish people, never more so than in this difficult time when so many of their basic rights are being denied to them.
In remembrance of General Pulaski's heroic sacrifice and his dedication to the ideals of freedom, we pay tribute to him and to the Polish nation of which he was such an esteemed son. In doing so, we also honor the contributions made by generations of Polish-Americans to the greatness of America.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Monday, October 11, 1982, as General Pulaski Memorial Day, and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 14th day of Sept., in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightytwo, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.

RONALD REAGAN
