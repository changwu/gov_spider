    The President. I have a short statement here. I had hoped that we'd mark the end of the dog-ate-my-homework era of congressional budgetry, but it was not to be. I'd hoped to return tonight to sign the last of the required 13 appropriations bills, but they're not all here. So, Congress is going to have to stay and work so that all remaining bills will be complete and in a form I can sign. So, goodnight, and pleasant dreams.
Q. Do you think you'll be able to sign them all by tomorrow?
Q. Are you disappointed?
The President. Yes.
