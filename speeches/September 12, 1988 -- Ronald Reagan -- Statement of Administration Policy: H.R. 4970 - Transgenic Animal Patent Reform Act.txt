    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Kastenmeier (D) Wisconsin)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4970., which would exempt from patent infringement law genetically engineered patented farm animals, thereby setting a precedent for limiting the^exclusive rights to royalties provided by a patent grant and diminishing the incentive to innovate in new and important fields of technology.
