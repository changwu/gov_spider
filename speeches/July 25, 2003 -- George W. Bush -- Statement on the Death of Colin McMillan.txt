    Laura and I are saddened by the death of our good friend Colin McMillan. Colin was a public servant and patriot who served his country and State as a marine, State legislator, Assistant Secretary of Defense, community leader, and successful businessman. We send our condolences and prayers to his wife, children, and friends.
