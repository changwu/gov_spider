    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)
(Manzullo (R) IL and 64 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1993, which would authorize important trade and investment programs of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), the Trade and Development Agency (TDA), and the Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration (ITA). OPIC, TDA, and ITA programs play a strong role in helping American companies compete in today's global environment and advancing U.S. interests overseas. These programs also provide substantial benefits to American workers, and provide an effective and efficient means of opening new markets that help to maintain economic growth and create new jobs.
