    SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday welcomed an invitation to debate Hillary Clinton in California before the June 7 primary election.
The Clinton and Sanders campaigns in January agreed to hold a debate in May in California, the largest state with the greatest number of delegates at stake. So far, however, the Clinton campaign has balked at keeping that pledge.
"Both campaigns have been invited by Fox News to a debate. We have told the network that we would accept the invitation with the understanding that we can reach mutual agreement on the debate moderators, the format and other details," said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager.
Fox News on Tuesday sent letters to Sanders and Clinton requesting their participation in a California debate. The San Francisco Chronicle also has expressed interest in cosponsoring a California debate.
"More than half way through the month of May, we hope Secretary Clinton will soon make good on her campaign's commitment and agree to a time and place for a debate," Weaver added. "There are issues of enormous importance facing the people of California and our nation and the people of our largest state deserve to hear the Democratic candidates opinions."
Presidential nominating contests often have been decided by the time of California's June 7 primary, but this year neither candidate yet has enough pledged delegates to clinch the nomination.
"That means the people of California have a rare and important opportunity to play a significant role in determining who the Democratic Party nominee for president will be. Before making that choice, Californians deserve to hear what both candidates have to say on important issues confronting the state and the country," Weaver concluded.
