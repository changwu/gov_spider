  A Proclamation

American farmers are the most productive in the world. But without farm machinery, fuel, electric power, chemical products, and other supplies from industry, our farms could never have achieved this remarkable level of efficiency.
American consumers have the widest variety and the most plentiful supply of food and fiber products that can be found anywhere. But without adequate transportation, processing, and marketing, our consumers could not reap the full benefits of our bounteous farms, orchards, and ranches.
It is the successful synergism of farms, towns, cities, industry, and business that makes the United States a cornucopia for its own citizens, able to share its superabundance with a world where large regions suffer from critical shortages of food, often because of policies that discourage initiative and thwart progress.
To arrive at a better appreciation of how our American system works—with its cooperation between farm workers and city workers—we set aside in each November a Farm-City Week. During this time we seek to highlight the contributions that farmers and city dwellers, working together, make to the bounty, vitality, and strength of our Nation.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning November 22, 1985, through November 28, 1985, as National Farm-City Week. I call upon all Americans, in rural areas and in cities alike, to join in recognizing the accomplishments of our productive farmers and of our urban residents in working together in a spirit of cooperation and interdependence to create abundance, wealth, and strength for the Nation.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth.

RONALD REAGAN
