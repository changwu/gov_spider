    To the Congress of the United States:
In declaring my intention to disapprove House Joint Resolution 122, the further continuing resolution for fiscal year 1996, I stated my desire to approve promptly a clean extension of the continuing resolution that expired on November 13. Accordingly, I am forwarding the enclosed legislation that would provide for such an extension. This legislation also provides that all Federal employees furloughed during the Government shutdown through no fault of their own will be compensated at their ordinary rate for the period of the furlough.
I urge the Congress to act on this legislation promptly and to return it to me for signing.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, November 16, 1995.
