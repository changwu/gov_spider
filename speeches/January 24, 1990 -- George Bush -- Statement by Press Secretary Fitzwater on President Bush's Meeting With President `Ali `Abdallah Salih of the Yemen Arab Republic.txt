    President Bush met with President Salih of the Yemen Arab Republic this morning in a 30-minute private meeting followed by a half-hour plenary session. This is the first state visit by a Yemeni President. The two Presidents held discussions on a wide range of bilateral, regional, and international issues.
President Bush stated that he is pleased that the United States has been able to help Yemen realize some of its economic and development goals and noted that the United States has increased the PL480 program with Yemen this year.
President Bush reaffirmed the U.S. desire for peace and stability in the Middle East and reviewed continuing efforts to find a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. President Bush reaffirmed our strong belief that our diplomatic efforts with Egyptian and Israeli officials to develop a dialog between Israelis and Palestinians offer the best hope for moving the peace process forward toward direct negotiations between the parties on a comprehensive peace settlement.
The two Presidents also discussed South Yemen and President Salih's ongoing efforts to reunify the two Yemens. They also reviewed the current situation in Afghanistan and our shared support for self-determination for the Afghan people. The two Presidents agreed to work together in the continued search for peace throughout the Middle East region. President Bush took the opportunity to recall the warm hospitality he and Mrs. Bush received during their visit to Yemen in 1986.
