    SANTA FE, NM -- Today, Governor Bill Richardson and First Lady Barbara Flavin Richardson celebrate 35 years of marriage.
"Barbara and I have been together since we were teenagers," said Governor Bill Richardson. "We have practically grown up together. Over the past 35 years Barbara has been my wife, best friend and my number one advisor. She has stood by my side through it all and on this special day I thank her for her love and devotion. Truly, there is no luckier man. Barbara here's to another beautiful 35 years."
Bill and Barbara first met when Bill was a senior at Middlesex High School in Concord, MA. It all began one afternoon in downtown Concord, MA when Barbara asked Bill if he needed a ride back to school. They immediately began dating and since then have been a couple.
They were married in Goddard Chapel, on the Tufts campus, on August 5, 1972.
