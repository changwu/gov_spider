    Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Easter.
For almost two millennia, Christians around the world have celebrated this sacred and joyous season as a time of promises fulfilled. It is the promise that a long, harsh winter will dissolve into the warmth and beauty of spring. It is the promise that hearts can be changed and lives renewed by God's love and forgiveness. It is the promise that the sufferings of Good Friday will be transformed into the glorious triumph of Easter morning.
Now, as we swiftly approach the dawn of a new millennium, let us strive together to fulfill our own promise, both as individuals and as a nation. By strengthening our families and communities, bringing hope and help to those in need, and creating a climate of peace and reconciliation where hatred and violence and prejudice have no place, we can each play a vital role in carrying out God's loving plan for humanity. As Saint John's Gospel so eloquently reminds us, ". . . God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved."
As you gather with family and friends to share the joys of this holy season, Hillary and I extend best wishes to all for a wonderful Easter.
