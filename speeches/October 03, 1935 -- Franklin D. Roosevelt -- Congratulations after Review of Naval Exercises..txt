    I extend to you and to the officers and men of the Fleet my congratulations on the excellently executed tactical exercises today. I was especially interested in several phases of the exercises which I had never seen previously and in the timing and precision of attacks. I wish I could stay with the Fleet longer.
Roosevelt,
Commander-in-Chief,
We have seen today the extremely interesting tactical exercises of the Fleet. Admiral Reeves accompanied me on U.S.S. Houston and has just returned to his ship. We are headed south. Wish you could be with us. Warm regards.
Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Secretary of Navy,
Washington, D. C.
