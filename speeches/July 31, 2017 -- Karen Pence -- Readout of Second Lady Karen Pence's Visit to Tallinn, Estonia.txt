    Today, Second Lady Karen Pence visited the North Estonia Medical Center Psychiatric Clinic to meet with art therapists and observe an art therapy session. During the visit, she also met with the Head of the Arts Therapies Master Program at Tallinn University, Dr. Eha Rüütel, and the Director of North Estonian Medical Center Psychiatry Clinic, Dr. Kaire Aadamsoo. Art therapy is a relatively new discipline in Estonia. In the 1990's, the Tallinn Psychiatric Hospital, now the Psychiatric Clinic of the North Estonia Medical Center, implemented art therapy techniques in treatment and trained new art therapists. After the art therapy program visit, Mrs. Pence enjoyed a walking tour of Old Town Estonia. After the tour, the Second Lady had a lovely lunch with Mrs. Joanna Melville, the wife of United States Ambassador to Estonia, James Melville, at the Restaurant Rataskaevu 16. Then, she headed to the airport to depart to Tbilisi, Georgia. Upon arrival in Tbilisi, the Second Lady joined the Vice President for an official dinner hosted by Prime Minister Giorgi Kvrikashvili of Georgia.
"Art therapy is a relatively new discipline in Estonia with about 45 practicing therapists in the country," said Second Lady Karen Pence. "I was encouraged by the art therapists during the roundtable discussion as they shared valuable insight on their profession and the difference they're making with their patients. They're doing good work."
Tomorrow, Tuesday, August 1st, Mrs. Pence will participate in activities in Tbilisi, Georgia. To stay updated on Mrs. Pence's events, follow her on Twitter at, @SecondLady.
