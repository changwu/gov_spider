    To the Congress of the United States:
In returning to the Senate without my approval S. 557, the "Grove City" bill, I urged the Congress to enact promptly, in lieu of S. 557, my alternative proposal, the "Civil Rights Protection Act of 1988."
My proposal, which is enclosed, would address the many serious shortcomings of S. 557, as explained in the attached copy of the veto message on the bill.
I pledge my wholehearted support in working with the Congress to enact promptly this carefully crafted and effective alternative to S. 557.
RONALD REAGAN
The White House,
March 16, 1988.
