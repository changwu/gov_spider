Pursuant to section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(c)(1), I hereby determine that it is important to the national interest that up to $20 million be made available from the U.S. Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund to meet urgent and unexpected needs relating to the program under which the United States will provide refuge in the United States to refugees fleeing the Kosovo crisis.
