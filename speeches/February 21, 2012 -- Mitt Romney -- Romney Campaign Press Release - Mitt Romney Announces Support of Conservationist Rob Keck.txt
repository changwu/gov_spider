Announcing his support, Rob Keck said, "As a hunter, as a conservationist, and as a father and grandfather, I'm very concerned about the future of America and the ability we have to pass along our rich hunting and angling heritage to the next generation. In order to ensure that America's future is as bright as our past, we need an outstanding and trusted leader, someone who understands business and can fix our economy â€” that man is Mitt Romney. Mitt also understands the importance of wildlife conservation, as well as hunting and angling's economic and political engine that powers America. He will ensure that this tradition continues and is strengthened.
