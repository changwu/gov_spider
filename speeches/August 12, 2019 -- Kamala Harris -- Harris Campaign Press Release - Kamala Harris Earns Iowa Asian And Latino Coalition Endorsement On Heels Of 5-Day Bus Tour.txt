    On the heels of her 5-day river-to-river bus tour, the Iowa Asian and Latino Coalition announced their endorsement of Kamala Harris for President. The coalition is a key organizing body in the Iowa caucuses, holding events for candidates and members of the public. The coalition spent the last year meeting with more than a dozen candidates and voted Monday night to support Harris, saying: "The Asian and Latino Coalition officially endorses Senator Kamala Harris."
Coalition Chair Prakash Kopparapu said, "She has the strength and the personality to take on Donald Trump on the debate stage."
In response, Harris said: "I am honored to receive the endorsement of the Asian and Latino Coalition. During this campaign I've been lucky to have the chance to spend time with leadership and get to know members of the coalition. Their mission and values of equality and justice are the same values I am fighting for in this campaign. We must ensure that all Iowans have a voice in this caucus, and I look forward to working together to make sure that happens. I am thankful I will have the Coalition's organizational strength in my corner as we head toward February."
Harris has been a trailblazer her entire career, and was the first South Asian-American and second Black woman elected to the United States Senate.
