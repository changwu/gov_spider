    WE ARE real honored to have the two Wimbledon champions--Arthur Ashe and Billie Jean King. We are pleased to have them in the White House. They represent the excellence in athletics in the field of tennis.
I just told them I watched them both on television and envied their competence and regretted that I could only watch and not participate.
We are proud of them and delighted to have them back after having done such a first-class job.
We are glad to have you.
