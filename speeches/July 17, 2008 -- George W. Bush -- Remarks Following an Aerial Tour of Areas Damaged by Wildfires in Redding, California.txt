    The President. It's been my honor to travel with the Governor and the Senator and Forest Service folks and the fire folks here in California to see the fires. Couple of things I'd like to reflect on, and I asked the Governor to say a couple of words.
One, I always come to make sure that the Federal Government is coordinating closely with the State government. I know Governor Schwarzenegger well enough to tell you that if we weren't, he'd let me know.
Governor Arnold A. Schwarzenegger of California. That's right.
The President. And I want to thank those in the—who work for the Federal Government for their hard work and willingness to respond quickly and their service to our country.
Secondly, I want to say something to the firefighters. We had the privilege of going and meeting some of these smoke jumpers. These are unusual people who are very courageous, determined, and dedicated. And I had this special sense there, when I was with them, the esprit de corps, and we want to thank them for their courage.
I want to thank all those who are helping making the effort work here. People are working long hours, and the citizens of this part of the world really, really thank you for it.
I want to thank the Boy Scouts. We've got three scouts here who are representative of a bunch of scouts who are working on the Healthy Forest Initiative and are helping make sure these firefighters are— don't have to deal with some of these hot blazes the way they have in the past.
And finally, I'd like to just let the people out here know that we're paying attention in Washington, DC, we care about you, and that we'll respond as best as we possibly can.
