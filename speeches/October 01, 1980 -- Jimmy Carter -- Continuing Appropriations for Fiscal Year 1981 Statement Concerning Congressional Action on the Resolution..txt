    The failure of Congress to approve a continuing resolution for fiscal year 1981, which begins today, will cause an interruption of services if not rectified promptly.
Since the Attorney General has ruled that Federal workers should report to work, any serious disruption can be avoided if the Congress acts today. In the strongest possible terms, I urge them to do so. Once they have acted, the resolution will be forwarded to me and signed immediately.
