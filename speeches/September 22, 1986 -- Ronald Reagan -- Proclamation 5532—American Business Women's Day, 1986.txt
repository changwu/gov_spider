  A Proclamation

American business women have made significant and increasing contributions to our economy and to the competitiveness of the United States internationally. The need continues for American working women to expand their horizons, diversify their skills, and set high personal and career goals. The American Business Women's Association, a national educational association, has greatly assisted in this effort. The Association awarded $2,900,000 in scholarships to over 6,000 women in 1984, and more than $18,000,000 in scholarships since 1949. The Association has more than 110,000 members and 2,100 chapters, throughout the United States. This organization has encouraged the many important contributions of American business women to our Nation's continuing vitality.
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 196, has designated September 22, 1986, as "American Business Women's Day" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 22, 1986, as American Business Women's Day.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.

RONALD REAGAN
