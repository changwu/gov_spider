    Dear Anne:
It was with the deepest regret that I learned that important family responsibilities have prompted your letter of resignation as a Presidential Counsellor and as a member of my Cabinet.
You will be greatly missed at the White House. I am certain, however, that the same sense of dedication to family that has characterized your dedication to country has made your decision a necessary one.
When I assumed the office of the Presidency on August 9, 1974, it was critically important that I have the immediate assistance and support of highly able, skilled, compassionate and loyal leaders in government. You were one of those key people who helped to fill that urgent requirement.
I thank you not only personally but on behalf of our fellow countrymen for your distinguished service.
Betty joins with me in wishing to you and yours the very best.
Sincerely,
JERRY FORD
[The Honorable Anne Armstrong, Counsellor to the President, The White House]
