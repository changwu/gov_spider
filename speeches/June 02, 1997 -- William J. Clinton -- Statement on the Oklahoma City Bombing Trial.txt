    I cannot comment on the jury's verdict, but I will say that this is a very important and long overdue day for the survivors and families of those who died in Oklahoma City. And I am very, very proud of the work of Attorney General Janet Reno, the prosecutors, the FBI, and the ATF.
Two years ago, I spoke to the families of 168 people who lost their lives at the Murrah Federal building. I told them that though they had lost much, they had not lost everythingâ€”and they had not lost America. I pledged then and I pledge now that we will stand with them for as many tomorrows as it takes. Today I say to the families of the victims, no single verdict can bring an end to your anguish, but your courage has been an inspiration to all Americans. Our prayers are with you.
