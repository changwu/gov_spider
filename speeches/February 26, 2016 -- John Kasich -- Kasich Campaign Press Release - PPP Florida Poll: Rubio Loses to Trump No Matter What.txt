    "Marco Rubio isn't going to win Florida and can't stop Donald Trump. He needs to withdraw from the race."â€“ John Weaver, Chief Strategist Kasich for America
Public Policy Polling just released a devastating new poll for Marco Rubio. It shows Rubio trailing Trump by 20 points in a race with the entire Republican field and a stunning 14 points in a head-to-head match-up against Trump. The PPP poll is the second public Florida poll released today showing Rubio trailing Trump by double-digits in Florida.
Senator Rubio's stunning weakness in Florida makes it clear that John Kasich is the only Republican who can stop Donald Trump and win the White House in November.
An independent analysis published yesterday by The Washington Post shows that John Kasich defeating Trump in Ohio is likely the only way to stop him. Recent polls show Governor Kasich in a statistical tie with Donald Trump in Ohio and defeating him by a wide-margin in a head-to-head matchup in Ohio.
Just yesterday, Senator Rubio said, "[b]y the time you get to March 15, now you're in some big states like Ohio and Florida that award all their delegates at once. That's where you have to start winning states."
Today, it's become clear that Marco Rubio can't win in Florida or Ohio. He's down 16 points in Florida and 18 points in Ohio.
