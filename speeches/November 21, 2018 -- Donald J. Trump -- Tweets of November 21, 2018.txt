So-called comedian Michelle Wolf bombed so badly last year at the White House Correspondents' Dinner that this year for the first time in decades they will have an author instead of a comedian. Good first step in comeback of a dying evening and tradition! Maybe I will go?Retweets: 22461Favorites: 123576

Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts but you do indeed have 'Obama judges' and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country. It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an 'independent judiciary' but if it is why......Retweets: 23967Favorites: 88727

.....are so many opposing view (on Border and Safety) cases filed there and why are a vast number of those cases overturned. Please study the numbers they are shocking. We need protection and security - these rulings are making our country unsafe! Very dangerous and unwise!Retweets: 22417Favorites: 89238

There are a lot of CRIMINALS in the Caravan. We will stop them. Catch and Detain! Judicial Activism by people who know nothing about security and the safety of our citizens is putting our country in great danger. Not good!Retweets: 25090Favorites: 100552

'79% of these decisions have been overturned in the 9th Circuit.' @FoxNews A terrible costly and dangerous disgrace. It has become a dumping ground for certain lawyers looking for easy wins and delays. Much talk over dividing up the 9th Circuit into 2 or 3 Circuits. Too big!Retweets: 20603Favorites: 77622
