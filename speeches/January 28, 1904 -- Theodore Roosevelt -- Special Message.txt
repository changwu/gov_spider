    To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I herewith lay before the Congress a letter from the Polish organizations of the United States, and the report thereon from Col. Thomas W. Symons, Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds. In view of the recommendation of Colonel Symons I advise that the very patriotic offer of the Polish organizations be accepted, and that instead of the statue of Pulaski (which, in the judgment of his Polish compatriots should be an equestrian statue, and which it is now proposed to place in reservation 33, on the north side of Pennsylvania avenue, between Thirteenth and Fourteenth streets), there be a pedestrian statue of Kosciusko accepted by the Government, to be placed on one of the four corners of Lafayette Square. These four corners would thus ultimately be occupied by statues of Lafayette, Rochambeau, Von Steuben, and Kosciusko, all of whom in the stormy days which saw the birth of the Republic rendered service which can never be forgotten by our people,
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
