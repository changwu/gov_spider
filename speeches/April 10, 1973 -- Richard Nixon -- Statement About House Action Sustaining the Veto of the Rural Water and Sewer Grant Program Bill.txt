    IN SUSTAINING my veto of H.R. 3298, the rural water and sewer program, the House of Representatives has convincingly demonstrated that it, too, has the courage and determination to take a firm stand in favor of the American consumer and taxpayer. This is responsive government at its very best.
The 189 Members of the House who voted to sustain my veto today have now joined the 36 Senators who voted last week to sustain my first veto of the year to prove that working together, we can hold the line against wasteful, inflationary Federal spending.
On behalf of the American people, I want to express my gratitude to all of these dedicated public servants who have taken such a responsible stand on these two crucial votes. Ahead lie further tests which will demand from us the same measure of courage and cooperation. I urge all Members of the Congress to stay the course with me in keeping a tight rein on the Federal budget.
