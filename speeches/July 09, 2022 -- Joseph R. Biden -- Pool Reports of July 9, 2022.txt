Pool, COVID-tested this morning, was assembled and is now waiting near the Biden beach home for the president to get into his motorcade.
It has been raining on and off much of the day, and there has been no bicycling or beach walking.

WH travel pool report 2 — arrival at church
The motorcade arrived at St. Edmund's Catholic Church at 1605, following a short drive south, along a route with a great number of homes decorated with pink hydrangeas, into Rehoboth Beach proper.
There were a number of clusters of onlookers applauding the motorcade it is passed, and pool did notice a pickup truck adorned with lots of anti-Biden stickers, including: "Lying Biden is roadkill."
Pool did not see the president enter, but we are now waiting outside the church.
Pool van joined the motorcade at 1559 from our hold area near the Cape Henlopen State Park parking lot.

He did not respond to shouted questions and pool was hustled back to the press van.
At 1653 the motorcade is underway.
