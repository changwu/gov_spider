    I am pleased today to sign S. 993, the "Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989." This Act will impose new criminal penalties against those who would employ or contribute to the dangerous proliferation of biological weapons, and it will add teeth to our efforts to eradicate such horrible weapons. I salute the bipartisan consensus in the Congress that has demonstrated its support for this humanitarian objective and the leadership's commitment to our shared goal of destroying forever the evil shadow these weapons have cast around the world.
The United States has renounced these weapons, as have all civilized countries, by joining the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972. Scrupulous compliance with the obligations of that Convention and similar prohibitions against the use of chemical weapons are essential to the security of all mankind. I call upon the leaders of all nations to join us in our drive to rid the world of biological and chemical weapons and to do everything in their power to stop the proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction. We must halt and reverse the threat that comes from such weapons and their proliferation. This Act that I sign today is a measured but important step in that direction.
George Bush
The White House,
