    Dear Madam President: 
Consistent with the conditions set forth in the Senate resolution of advice and consent to ratification of the Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden of August 3, 2022, and based on the recommendation of the Department of State, I hereby certify to the Senate that:
(i) the inclusion of the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will not have the effect of increasing the overall percentage share of the United States in the common budgets of NATO; and
(ii) the inclusion of the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden in NATO does not detract from the ability of the United States to meet or to fund its military requirements outside the North Atlantic area.
Sincerely,
JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
