    This weekend, as we celebrate the 12th annual National Youth Service Day, I want to recognize the millions of young Americans across the country who give to their communities dayin and day-out. They are rebuilding our Nation's schools and neighborhoods and sparking a new spirit of civic engagement. And they know that service is not the work of just a single day; it is the work of a lifetime.
In recent months we've had too many tragic reminders that young people pay the price when bonds of community and responsibility become frayed. But we should also remember that our children are our greatest resource and that, if we are to build a stronger, safer Nation, we should begin by empowering young people to make a difference. That's why I am so proud of the young citizens who have served in AmeriCorps. And that's why I am so proud of the many contributions that so many of our youth are making on this special day. Through the leadership of young Americans, all of us— whatever our age—can help keep alive our sense of opportunity, responsibility, and community.
