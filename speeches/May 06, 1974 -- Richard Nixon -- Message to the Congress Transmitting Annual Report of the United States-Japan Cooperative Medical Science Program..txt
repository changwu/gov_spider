    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to send to the Congress the Seventh Annual Report of the United States-Japan Cooperative Medical Science Program.
This joint research effort in the biomedical sciences, undertaken in 1965 following a meeting between the Prime Minister of Japan and the President of the United States, continues to focus upon diseases of both worldwide importance and of special significance to the peoples of Asia: cholera, environmentally induced diseases, leprosy, malnutrition, the parasitic diseases filariasis and schistosomiasis, tuberculosis, and the viral diseases dengue and rabies.
The sustained success of this biomedical research program reflects its careful management and the strong commitment of both nations to its continuation. The increasingly effective research planning and communication between investigators in our two countries has intensified our scientific productivity and strengthened our determination to work together toward better health for all mankind.
