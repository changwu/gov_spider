    Hillary and I are deeply saddened to learn of the death of our good friend Ambassador David Hermelin.
All of us who knew David admired him deeply for his remarkable combination of energy, wit, optimism, and commitment to family, faith, and the common good. From the businesses he built to the charities he supported to the causes he championed, David demonstrated the qualities of active citizenship which have made our country the greatest democracy in history. He was a magnificent man. I will be forever grateful for his friendship, support, and outstanding service as our Ambassador to Norway. With characteristic energy, he made impressive contributions to U.S.-Norway relations, something I saw firsthand when he persuaded me to make the first-ever visit to Norway by a sitting U.S. President in November of 1999. I will miss him very much.
Hillary and I extend our condolences to his wife, Doreen, their children, and grandchildren.
