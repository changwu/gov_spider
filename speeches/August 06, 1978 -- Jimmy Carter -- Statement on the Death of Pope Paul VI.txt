    I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of Pope Paul VI, a man whose life and works have served me personally as a source of great moral inspiration. As a man of peace and profound spirituality, he will be greatly missed not only by all Roman Catholics but by all people, whatever their religious convictions.
Of Pope Paul's many contributions, two stand out for me at this sad moment: first, his untiring efforts in the ecumenical movement. Not only was he inspired in the cause of humanity to pursue greater unity of purpose within the Catholic Church, but also among all other faiths. Second, Pope Paul's world travels, at no small expense to his own physical wellbeing, exemplified his role of pilgrim, carrying the message of peace and love to the far corners of the world, including an inspiring visit to the United States.
During his 15 years as Pontiff, the voice of Paul V! served as a clear, moral beacon to a troubled world. With his passing, we have all been deprived of a strong voice for reason, for moderation, and for peace.
