    Dear Mr. Chairman: 
In accordance with section 303(a)(6)(A) of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (the "Act") (50 U.S.C. 4533(a)(6)(A)), I transmit herewith notice of a shortfall in the defense industrial base relating to alane fuel cells and of actions to remedy that shortfall. The Department of Defense will take actions to develop and purchase equipment and materials needed for pilot production of alane fuel cells for military usage.
I have also included my determination required pursuant to section 303(a)(5) of the Act. These proposed initiatives are essential to the national defense.
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
