    
GETTYSBURG, Pa. â€“ Speaking near this famous Civil War battleground, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday invoked the memory of Abraham Lincoln and echoed the 16th president's call for of a government "of the people, by the people and for the people."
Sanders also paid tribute to the men and women who serve in the military today and generations of veterans who "fought and died to preserve our way of life."
"There are times when you have to respond militarily, when our freedom is in danger," Sanders told more than 2400 people at Gettysburg College. "But in my view the use of military force should be the last response, not the first response. Diplomacy and doing everything we can to avoid a war is not weakness. It is intelligence. It is strength."
As chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, Sanders worked with veterans and veterans' organizations to develop and pass comprehensive veterans' health care legislation in 2014.
Sanders worked with Sen. John McCain on the legislation that allowed the VA to hire more than 14,000 doctors, nurses and other medical staff. It reduced the time it takes for a veteran to see a doctor and expanded access to care by creating 27 new VA clinics in 18 states.

Sanders told the crowd here that he remains committed to helping the men and women who fight to protect us. Sanders has pledged to improve the processing of veterans' claims for compensation and appeals. He also will expand the Department of Veterans Affairs' Caregivers Program, improve mental health programs and services for veterans and make certain that dental care is considered part of health care.
Sanders' stop at Gettysburg was part of a swing through the Keystone state ahead of Tuesday's Democratic primary election. Five states vote on Tuesday with 384 pledged delegates at stake.
