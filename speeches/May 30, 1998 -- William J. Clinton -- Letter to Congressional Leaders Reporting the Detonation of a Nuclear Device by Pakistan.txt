    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Pursuant to section 102(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, I am hereby reporting that, in accordance with that section, I have determined that Pakistan, a non-nuclear-weapon state, detonated a nuclear explosive device on May 28, 1998. I have further directed the relevant agencies and instrumentalities of the United States Government to take the necessary actions to impose the sanctions described in section 102(b)(2) of that Act.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
