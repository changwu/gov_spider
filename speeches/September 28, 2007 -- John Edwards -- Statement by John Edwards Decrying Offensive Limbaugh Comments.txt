    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Today, Senator John Edwards released the following statement:
"Rush Limbaugh should be ashamed of himself for calling brave members of our military 'phony soldiers.' There's nothing phony about the sacrifices being made by any of our troops in Iraq. Two soldiers who bravely told the truth about flawed U.S. policy in an August New York Times op-ed died a very real death in Iraq three weeks ago. Limbaugh should apologize to these soldiers' families and to all the brave men and women in our armed forces fighting for the very freedoms he enjoys as an American every day. All Republicans and Democrats should join with me in condemning his disgusting words."
