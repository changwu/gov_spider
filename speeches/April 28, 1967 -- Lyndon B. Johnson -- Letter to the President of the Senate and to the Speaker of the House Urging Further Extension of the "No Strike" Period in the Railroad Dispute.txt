    Dear Mr. President: (Dear Mr. Speaker:)
A rail strike would bring industrial tragedy to America. It would disrupt our commerce, cripple our industries, create shortages of food. It would adversely affect the lives of every man, woman, and child in this country.
Such a strike would be a gross disservice to our valiant men in Vietnam, who are making sacrifices greater than any of us are called upon to make.
The public interest demands that every practical step be taken to avert a strike, now scheduled for 12:01 a.m. May 3rd.
Since my return from Germany on late Wednesday I have consulted with the bipartisan leadership of the Congress, and with ranking members of the Senate Labor and House Commerce Committees. They join with me today in urging that the Congress extend the no-strike period for an additional 45 days. I am submitting herewith a Joint Resolution to accomplish this.
This additional period will give the Congress time prudently to consider legislation which will protect the public interest in this case.
I shall recommend such legislation to the Congress within a few days.
An additional 45-day period may enable the parties to press forward with their search for accord and reach an agreement themselves.
I hope and believe that, in the interest of all Americans, the Congress will want to act promptly.
Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
