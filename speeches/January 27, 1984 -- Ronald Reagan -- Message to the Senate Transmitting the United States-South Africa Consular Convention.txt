    To the Senate of the United States:
I am transmitting for the Senate's advice and consent to ratification the Consular Convention between the United States of America and the Republic of South Africa which was signed at Pretoria on October 28, 1982. I am also transmitting for the information of the Senate the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention. This Convention will establish firm obligations on such important matters as free communication between a national and his consul, notification of consular officers of the arrest and detention of their nationals and permission for visits by consuls to nationals who are under detention.
I welcome the opportunity through this Convention to improve the relations between the two countries and their nationals. I urge the Senate to give the Convention its prompt and favorable consideration.
