    Michigan families are facing enormous challenges right now. More than 140,000 Michiganders have been infected by COVID-19, hundreds of thousands are out of work, small businesses are scared that they won't make it through the winter, and parents are worried about their kids' safety at school. Yet all President Trump is offering the people of Michigan is more lies and distractions — no plan to get the virus under control, no strategy for pulling our economy out of this recession, no vision for uniting the country.
With their votes, Michiganders now have a chance to put an end to President Trump's chaos and failures. Michigan deserves a leader in the White House who will fight for workers and families — not just big corporations and the super wealthy. I will unite our nation to get control of this virus, lower health care costs, and build our economy back better.
