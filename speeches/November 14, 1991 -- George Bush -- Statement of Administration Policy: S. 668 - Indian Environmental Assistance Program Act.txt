    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 11/15/91)(House)(McCain (R) Arizona and four others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of S. 668, but will work in conference to eliminate the duplicative authority contained in Titles I and II of the House-reported bill and reduce the bill's excessive authorization level.
