    Melania joins me in sending our warmest greetings to people in the United States and throughout the world celebrating the Lunar New Year.
On this occasion, we join millions around the globe in welcoming the Year of the Rat and embracing a new year filled with opportunities to make a positive impact in the lives of others. As those of Asian heritage celebrate this special time of year through fireworks, food, and fellowship with loved ones, we wish them happiness, health, and prosperity in the year to come.
We also want to recognize and offer our sincerest gratitude for the many ways in which Asian Americans continue to enrich our Nation's culture, strengthen our economy, and enhance our national defense. Their immeasurable contributions to the United States are a unique part of our country's history and identity.
Happy New Year!
