    I just want to begin by thanking President Rousseff for her extraordinary hospitality. To the Brazilian companies who are here, many of whom have investments in the United States, we're grateful for the dialogue with our colleagues from the north.
As I stated in the statement that I just made before coming here, Brazil is on the rise. And the United States is excited and fully supportive of Brazil's rapid expansion, its extraordinary talent, its resources, its enormous potential that's now being realized, in part because of the outstanding leadership of President Rousseff.
And I think the goal today--so I'm not going to speak long--is simply to make sure that we were helping to facilitate an effective dialogue. I know that there are a couple of areas where we're going to be announcing agreements: an agreement on trade and economic cooperation, an open skies agreement. I know those are two issues that everybody was advocating and we're going to announce them today, so we're pleased to do that. I know there's been some work done on extending visas for both countries, and although we haven't gotten all that worked through, we are making progress, and we will continue to do so.
Brazil is going to be hosting several important sporting events over the next few years. I mentioned that it pains me to say this when it comes to the Olympics because--[Laughter]--Lula beat me on that one. [Laughter] But we want to make sure that through this forum, companies that have both an expertise on security and infrastructure, that they will potentially participate.
On energy, obviously, Brazil is a major player on the world stage----
[At this point, the press pool was escorted out of the room. The forum continued, but no transcript was provided.]
