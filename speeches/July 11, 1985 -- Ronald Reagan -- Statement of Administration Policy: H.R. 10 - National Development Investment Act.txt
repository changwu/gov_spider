    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Oberstar (D) Minnesota and 165 others)
The Administration strongly opposes enactment of H.R. 10, because the bill would authorize appropriations of $1.5 billion for the Economic Development Administration (EDA) during 1986-1988 and $2.1 billion for the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) during 1986-1992. The Administration has proposed to terminate both EDA and ARC at the end of 1985. H.R. 10 would add to the Federal deficit without producing lasting net economic development benefits. The Administration believes that local economic development is best fostered through sound economic growth, regulatory relief, fiscal constraint, and funding by local governments when appropriate.
If H.R. 10 were to reach the President's desk, disapproval would be recommended.
