    The United States condemns the Maduro regime's involvement in the death of Venezuelan opposition councilman Fernando Alban. Venezuelan authorities took Alban into custody on October 5, upon his return from the United Nations General Assembly, where he spoke to the world about the importance of returning democracy to the people of Venezuela. He died three days later while in the custody of Venezuela's intelligence service. The Trump Administration will continue to increase pressure on the Maduro regime and its insiders until democracy is restored in Venezuela. The United States calls for the immediate release of all Venezuelan political prisoners, and for the Maduro regime to take direct, credible steps to reestablish democracy in Venezuela and to prevent further suffering and bloodshed.
