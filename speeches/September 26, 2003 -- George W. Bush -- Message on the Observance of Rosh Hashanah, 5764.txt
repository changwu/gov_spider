    I send greetings to those observing Rosh Hashanah.
For the Jewish community in the United States and around the world, this holiday marks the beginning of the New Year and the onset of the Days of Awe. Rosh Hashanah is a time to seek the mercy and forgiveness of the Almighty and your fellow man, to reflect on past actions, and to demonstrate renewed commitment to faith and family. May you find inspiration for the days ahead as you remember the devotion of Abraham and Isaac and their willingness to sacrifice everything to do right.
During this holy time, I encourage you to pray for peace and mutual understanding throughout the world. May we build a future of promise and compassion for all, and may the coming year be filled with hope and happiness.
Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a blessed Rosh Hashanah.
