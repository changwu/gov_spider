    This year, we have a remarkable opportunity to work together across party lines to bring true progress to America's public schools. I welcome the idea of greater flexibility for States and school districts, and I urge the Senate to pass the so-called ed-flex legislation, because it provides for greater flexibility and greater accountability. But we must do more to give our children a world-class education. That's why I also strongly support the amendment to the legislation proposed by Senators Kennedy and Murray to continue the national commitment we began last year: to hire 100,000 new teachers and to reduce class size all across America. Studies confirm what every parent already knows: smaller classes make a big difference, from improved test scores to improved discipline. The Senate should pass the Kennedy-Murray amendment and give our Nation's children the individual attention they deserve in the classroom and the better future only a good education can bring.
