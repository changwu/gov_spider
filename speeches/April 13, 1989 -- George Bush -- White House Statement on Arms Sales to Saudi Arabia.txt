    Although Saudi Arabia has acquired intermediate-range ballistic missiles from the People's Republic of China, based on information available to the U.S. Government, there is no credible intelligence reporting indicating that Saudi Arabia possesses nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. We are not aware of production facilities for chemical munitions, chemical warfare agents, or biological warfare agents in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia possesses no significant nuclear facilities. In addition, the Saudis and the Chinese have told us that the missiles will not be equipped with nuclear warheads. The Saudis have also assured us that the missiles will not be equipped with chemical warheads. This commitment is reaffirmed by Saudi Arabia's adherence to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the 1925 Geneva Protocol, and the Biological Weapons Convention.
We remain concerned about the possible proliferation of these types of weapons in the Middle East and will continue to watch developments closely. Any evidence that Saudi Arabia has acquired chemical, biological, or nuclear warheads after the date of certification will be notified to the Congress, as required by section 1307(a)(2) of the National Defense Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1989.
