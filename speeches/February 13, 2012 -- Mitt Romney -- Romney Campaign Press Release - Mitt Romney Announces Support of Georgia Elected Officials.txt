    Mitt Romney today announced the support of current and former Georgia elected officials.
"My growing support in Georgia is proof that my conservative message is resonating with Georgia voters," said Mitt Romney. "With the help of my team, we will defeat President Obama, repeal Obamacare, cut government spending, and bring jobs back and turn around our economy."
"Mitt Romney is the one conservative candidate who will be able to defeat President Obama in November and bring real change to Washington — that is why he is supported by so many conservative Georgians," said former Attorney General Mike Bowers. "On the most pressing issue to our state and country, jobs and the economy, Mitt Romney possesses greater knowledge and experience than the other candidates combined. Georgians can be confident that if Mitt Romney is elected, they will have a president who will get Washington out of the way of job creation and personal freedom."
