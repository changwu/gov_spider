    Luciano Pavarotti was one of the most accomplished and acclaimed opera singers of all time. From singing with his father in a small church choir near Modena, Italy, to performing in sold-out stadiums in America and all across the world, Pavarotti entertained audiences with his perfect pitch and charismatic interpretations. Both as a soloist and as part of the Three Tenors, he sold millions of records and won many prestigious awards.
Pavarotti was also a great humanitarian, using his magnificent talent to rally tremendous levels of support for victims of tragedies around the globe. His international vocal competition in Philadelphia and his school in Modena have encouraged and inspired generations of young artists to pursue their dreams.
Laura and I join Luciano Pavarotti's fans across the world in mourning his loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Pavarotti family.
