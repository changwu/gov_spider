    ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, U.S. Senator Mel Martinez issued the following statement on Barack Obama's new Spanish ad:
"This election is about more than beautiful words, it's about who decides how your money is spent, who chooses your doctor, and our standing around the world. John McCain is a tested leader who loves America, puts his country first, and trusts you to make the best decisions for your family. At this time of great uncertainty, Hispanics and all Americans can trust in the leadership and experience of John McCain. He, like I, has lived the American Dream and wants to bring prosperity and security to all our families."
