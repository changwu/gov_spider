    Campaign opens office morning after Trump's Midwest geographic flub
KANSAS CITY, MO — Today, Mike Bloomberg 2020 announced the opening of two Kansas City field offices. The announcement comes hours after President Donald Trump's attempt at congratulating the Kansas City Chiefs for their comeback victory in Super Bowl LIV.
"Mike Bloomberg is focused on defeating Donald Trump and offering solutions that bring opportunity to the people and places often overlooked," said Grant Campbell, Mike Bloomberg 2020 Missouri State Director. "It's not shocking that so many Missourians feel shortchanged by Trump and his policies — he doesn't even know where the state's largest city is located."
Kansas City, known for its barbeque, jazz, and the National Football League (NFL) champion Kansas City Chiefs, has an estimated population of 491,918.
The Kansas City field offices are located at 6435 N Cosby Avenue and 427 Westport Road.
This latest announcement is an example of the momentum Mike Bloomberg 2020 is gaining in Missouri. According to the latest Missouri poll of likely voters, Bloomberg is polling in second place.
With the opening of the two Kansas City field offices, the campaign now has a total of five offices across the state, including St. Louis, Clayton, and Bridgeton.
Missouri voters head to the polls on March 10.
