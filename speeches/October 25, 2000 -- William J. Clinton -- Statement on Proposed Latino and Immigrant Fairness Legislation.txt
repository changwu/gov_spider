    It is long past time that we correct several injustices and provide fairness in our immigration system by enacting the "Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act." This legislation is a straightforward proposal to keep families together and to make our immigration policies more equitable. This legislation would help individuals and their families who have been living for many years in the United States and have developed strong ties to their communities to adjust their immigration status. My administration has been trying to negotiate with Republicans, but unfortunately, current Republican proposals would not help most of the immigrants that would get relief under the "Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act," and would perpetuate the current patchwork of contradictory and unfair immigration policies. These injustices should be corrected by Congress before they adjourn this year. If these issues are not resolved, I will veto the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations.
