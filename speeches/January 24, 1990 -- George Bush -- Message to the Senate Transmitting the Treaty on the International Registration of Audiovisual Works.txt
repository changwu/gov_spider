    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty on the International Registration of Audiovisual Works done at Geneva on April 20, 1989. I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.
The Treaty establishes a multilateral system to facilitate enforcement of rights and to increase legal security concerning audiovisual works in foreign countries and to contribute to the fight against piracy. Essentially, the Treaty is administrative and procedural in nature; it is not a copyright treaty and therefore would not affect substantive national copyright laws. The registration system is voluntary and may be used at the option of the producer of audiovisual works.
As noted in the report of the Department of State, United States ratification of the Treaty would not require any amendments to the copyright laws of the United States or any other implementing legislation.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
