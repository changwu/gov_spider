    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate) and House(Nunn (D) Georgia and 21 others)
The Administration supports the enactment of S. 244.
Pay-as-You-Go Scoring 
S. 244 could affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The preliminary OMB PAYGO estimate is zero. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
