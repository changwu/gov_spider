    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(McCloskey (D) IN)
The Administration supports the establishment of a voluntary leave transfer program for overseas teachers as provided in H.R. 3499. The Administration, however, suggests that the bill's requirement for a leave bank program be left to the discretion of the Secretary of Defense.
