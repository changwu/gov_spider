(House Rules)
(Rep. Camp, R-MI, and 23 cosponsors)
The Administration is committed to working with the Congress and States to strengthen the Nation's welfare programs to get more Americans employed and on a path to long-term self-sufficiency. Accordingly, the Administration does not oppose the extension of authority and funding included in H.R. 890, Preserving Work Requirements for Welfare Programs Act of 2013. With respect to the provision in H.R. 890 to limit State flexibility to strengthen the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program, the Administration notes that this flexibility was requested by Governors on both sides of the aisle to allow States to test new, more effective ways to place more people on a path to self-sufficiency. Ultimately, no States formally applied for State waivers, deterred in part by inaccurate claims about what the policy involves; therefore, the limiting provision would have no practical effect on any pending application. The Administration is disappointed that the bill includes this unnecessary bar to innovative welfare-to-work strategies.
