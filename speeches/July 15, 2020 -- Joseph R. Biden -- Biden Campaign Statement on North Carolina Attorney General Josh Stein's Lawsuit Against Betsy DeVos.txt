    Today, North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein filed a lawsuit against Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and the U.S. Department of Education for repealing the 2016 borrower defense regulations that protect defrauded students, an attempt by DeVos to benefit for-profit schools. Biden for President North Carolina Communications Director Maya Humes released the following statement:
"Betsy DeVos has proven time and time again that she is unfit for her post as Education Secretary. Whether it's pushing localities to rush students back to school amidst a global health pandemic, or furthering the exploitative practices of for-profit schools, Betsy DeVos and the Trump Administration continuously prioritize politics and profit ahead of protecting students. Joe Biden agrees with Attorney General Stein - it's time to crack down on predatory for-profit higher education programs that prey on the aspirations of students. No school should be allowed to turn a profit by misrepresenting program offerings and loading up students with excessive amounts of debt."
