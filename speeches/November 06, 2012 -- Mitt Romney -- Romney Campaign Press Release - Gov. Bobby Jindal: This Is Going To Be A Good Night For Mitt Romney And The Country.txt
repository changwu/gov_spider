Click Here To Watch Gov. Bobby Jindal
NEIL CAVUTO: "[New Hampshire] became a battleground state, a lot of them, about 11 of them right now up for grabs representing about 146 electoral votes. Bobby Jindal doing his best to make sure a good many of those votes go Mitt Romney's way. The Governor of Louisiana joins me right now. Governor, good to have you. How do you think it looks?"
GOV. BOBBY JINDAL: "I think it looks great for Governor Romney. We're going to maybe even set a record here in Louisiana for turnout but we are clearly voting for Governor Romney. The President made and broke a series of promises to the American people. Promised to cut the deficit in half. Didn't do it. Promised to turn around the economy. Didn't do it. He's got a campaign slogan, probably the most vacuous slogan in a generation, he's saying forward, doesn't say forward to what. If you were going 80 miles per hour towards a brick wall would you vote to go forward? And yet that is exactly what he is asking the American people to do. He hasn't told us forward to more debt. More spending. Forward to more government borrowing. Forward to fewer Americans working. This president has proven he is much better at getting his job than actually doing his job. He had a chance. He did not lay out a vision, did not lay out his plans for the second term. Three debates with Governor Romney, he didn't spend any of his time talking about the next four years, can't ask the American people are you better off than you were four years ago. So I think that this is going to be a very good day, very good night for Governor Romney, a very good day for the country. I think he is going to do very well not only in these traditional swing states like Ohio, Virginia, Florida, I think he is going to do very well in Colorado, New Hampshire and some of these other states as well. I think it is going to be a very good night for the country."
