    SANTA FE - Governor Bill Richardson today issued the following statement in response to President Bush's threat to veto the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).
"President Bush's threat to veto health insurance coverage for millions of children is neither compassionate nor conservative," said Governor Richardson. "The reauthorization of this federal-state partnership provides health coverage to 6.6 million low and middle income children nationwide, including 7,600 children in New Mexico. Reauthorization has strong bipartisan support and is the highest health care priority for Governors across the country."
SCHIP funding covers children in households with incomes up to 235% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), which equates to $39,036 annual income for a family of three.
"The President should stop the brinksmanship, and sit down and work with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to increase funding for this important program, and provide states with options and incentives to improve their programs," stated Governor Richardson.
