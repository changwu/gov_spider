    DENVER â€” Michael Bennet today issued the following statement endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"Americans are asking two questions in this election: Who can beat Donald Trump, and who can get anything done? That candidate is former Vice President Joe Biden, and I am proud to endorse him for President of the United States.
"Joe is a proven leader who can bring Americans together and show that our best days are still ahead. His vast experience, temperament, and decency stand in stark contrast to those of Donald Trump, especially in these challenging times. As a champion of the middle class, Joe knows how to make real and lasting change for families and workers across the country.
"In the midst of a public health crisis and economic downturn, now more than ever we need an experienced leader to protect and guide our country. We are all united around the ultimate goal of defeating Donald Trump, and Joe is the person who will lead us there in November."
