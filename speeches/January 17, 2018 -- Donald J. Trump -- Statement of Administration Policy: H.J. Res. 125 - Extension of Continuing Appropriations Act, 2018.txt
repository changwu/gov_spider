    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. Frelinghuysen, R-NJ)
The Administration supports passage of H.J. Res. 125, the Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018.
This legislation funds the Federal Government at current spending levels through February 16, 2018, providing more time for the Congress and the Administration to reach a longer-term funding agreement. The Administration supports the bill's multiyear funding extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). It also supports the legislation's delay of harmful Obamacare tax increases, including the medical device tax.
The Administration believes that looming defense spending cuts are harmful to our national security and military readiness, and supports responsible efforts to undo the defense sequestration in the context of a two-year budget agreement. As funding discussions continue, the Administration will continue to reject arbitrary demands for lower priority domestic funding that jeopardize critical defense funding.
The safety and security of our Nation depends on a strong military. Short-term funding measures are not ideal, but a lapse in funding for the Federal Government would be even more harmful for our military and our national security.
If H.J. Res. 125 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.
