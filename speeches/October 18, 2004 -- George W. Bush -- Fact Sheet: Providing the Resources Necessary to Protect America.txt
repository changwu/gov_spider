    Today's Presidential Action

Today, President Bush signed the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2005 to provide much-needed funds for our Nation's homeland security activities. This bill contains most of the FederalGovernment's investment in homeland security. With enactment of the remainder of the President's FY 2005 Budget, President Bush will have nearly tripled funding for homeland security activities since taking office.
This bill reflects the President's commitment to defend America by making sure the Federal Government and State and local first responders have the resources they need to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce America's vulnerability to terrorism, and minimize damage from attacks that might occur.

Background on Today's Presidential Action

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Appropriations Act signed today provides $28.9 billion in net discretionary spending, a $1.8 billion increase (6.6%) over 2004, and a $14.9 billion increase (106%) over 2001 levels.
Including Project BioShield, mandatory, and fee-funded programs, a total of $40.7 billion will be available to DHS in Fiscal Year 2005.
The Act includes $4 billion for State and local assistance programs - a 765% ($3.5 billion) increase over 2001 levels. This includes a 19% ($135 million) increase for the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) over 2004.


The UASI distributes terrorism preparedness grants to urban areas based on threat levels, instead of using arbitrary formulas.
Other State and local assistance programs funded by the appropriations act include $150 million for port security grants, $150 million for rail/transit security grants, neither of which were funded in 2001; and $715 million for grants to fire departments, a $615 million increase over 2001.


In addition, the Act provides for other key programs and initiatives vital to protecting America and reducing our vulnerability to terrorist threats, including:


$8.5 billion for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a 7% ($556 million) increase over 2004. This spending level funds programs to help secure our Nation's borders while facilitating the legitimate flow of commerce, including full funding for:


The Container Security Initiative to pre-screen cargo containers from 26 ports representing more than 80% of inbound cargo to the United States. With the legislation signed by the President today, spending on cargo security, screening, and inspections will total nearly $2.9 billion, an 80% ($1.3 billion) increase over pre-9/11 levels; and
The Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism, which facilitates partnerships between the Federal Government and American importers to improve security along the entire supply chain?from the factory floor, to foreign vendors, to land borders and seaports.


$340 million for the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology program (US-VISIT), an automated entry-exit system designed to expedite the arrival and departure of legitimate travelers, while making it more difficult for those intending to do us harm to enter our Nation. This is a $12 million increase over 2004.
$5.1 billion for the Transportation Security Administration, including aviation security fees, a $679 million increase over 2004. This includes $475 million for explosives detection system baggage screening equipment and installation, a 19% ($75 million) increase over 2004.
$6.3 billion for the Coast Guard, an 8.6% ($500 million) increase over 2004, and a 66% ($2.5 billion) increase over 2001 levels. Among funding for other programs, the appropriations bill includes $724 million for the Deepwater multi-year acquisition program to replace Coast Guard ships, aircraft, and communications systems.
$3.1 billion for the Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate, a 7% ($198 million) increase over 2004. This includes:


Funding for programs that support the Nation's ability to prepare for, mitigate against, respond to, and recover from natural and man made disasters.
$2 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund, a $53 million increase over base 2004 funding. This fund allows DHS to provide support to states for response and recovery to unforeseen emergencies and natural disasters.


$894 million for the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate (IAIP), $60 million above the 2004 level.


The IAIP is the focal point of the Department's efforts to assess and protect the Nation's critical infrastructures, including cyberspace, from terrorism.
The 2005 funding level will allow the IAIP to identify critical assets and send IAIP teams to conduct site visits to assist operators and owners in identifying and reducing vulnerabilities.


$1.1 billion for the Science and Technology Directorate, a $203 million increase over 2004. This includes $593 million to develop technologies that counter threats from chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological weapons, and high explosives; and $61 million to continue the development of innovative counter-measures to protect commercial aircraft against man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS).
