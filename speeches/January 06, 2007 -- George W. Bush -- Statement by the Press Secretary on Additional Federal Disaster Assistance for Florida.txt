    On Friday, January 5, 2007, the President made additional disaster assistance available to the State of Florida by authorizing an increase in the level of Federal funding for Public Assistance projects undertaken as a result of Hurricane Wilma.
Under the President's major disaster declaration issued for the State of Florida on October 24, 2005, for Hurricane Wilma, Federal funding was made available to State and local governments in multiple counties for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct Federal assistance, at 75 percent Federal funding. For a period of up to 72 hours, assistance for debris removal and emergency protective, including direct Federal assistance was provided at 100 percent of the total eligible costs.
Under the President's order, the Federal share for Public Assistance, including direct Federal assistance, has been increased to 90 percent of the total eligible costs, except for assistance previously approved at 100 percent Federal funding.
The increase to 90 percent Federal share is retroactive to the date of the President's major disaster declaration for the State of Florida.
