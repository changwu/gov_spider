Subject: Presidential Certification to Waive Prohibition on Assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by the laws of the United States, including section 1511 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103–160) and section 540 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997 (contained in Public Law 104–208 (the "Act")), I hereby certify to the Congress that I have determined that the waiver of the application of the prohibition in section 1511(b) of Public Law 103–160 and of the application of section 540(a) of the Act is necessary to achieve a negotiated settlement of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina that is acceptable to the parties, to the extent that such provisions apply to the furnishing of assistance to facilitate destruction of military equipment.
Therefore, I hereby waive the application of these provisions with respect to such assistance.
You are authorized and directed to transmit a copy of this determination to the Congress and arrange for its publication in the Federal Register.
