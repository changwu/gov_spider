(House)
(Rep. Skelton (D) Missouri and 23 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports the improvements in the areas of defense acquisition reform that are addressed in H.R. 2101, the Weapons Acquisition System Reform Through Enhancing Technical Knowledge and Oversight Act of 2009 (WASTE TKO Act), and applauds the bipartisan initiative on these critical issues. The Administration agrees with the sponsors of H.R. 2101 that the defense-acquisition process needs improvement in the areas of systems engineering, developmental test and evaluation, technological maturity, and cost estimation, and that changes are needed to strengthen a culture of acquisition excellence in the Department of Defense. The Administration is committed to making trade-offs among cost, schedule, and performance to significantly reduce cost growth in major defense acquisition programs. The Administration wants to ensure that the defense acquisition process is free from conflicts of interest and that the process supports the U.S. Government being a better steward of the taxpayers' dollars. The Administration believes that H.R. 2101, with some changes that we believe can satisfactorily be resolved, would enable the Administration to meet those objectives.
