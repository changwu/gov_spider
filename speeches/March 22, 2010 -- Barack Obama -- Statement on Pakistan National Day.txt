    On behalf of the American people, I send my best wishes to the people of Pakistan and all those of Pakistani descent here in America and around the world observing Pakistan National Day. Seventy years ago, Muhammad Ali Jinnah and those of the independence generation declared their dreams of self-determination and democracy. Today, the people of Pakistan are carrying on the great work of Quaid-i-Azam. In these efforts, the American people are proud to join in the education, health, and economic partnerships that can improve the daily lives of Pakistanis and their families. Here in the United States, our country is enriched by the many Pakistani Americans who excel as doctors, small-business owners, students, members of our Armed Forces, and in many other fields. On this national day, we give thanks for the contributions of these fellow Americans, and the United States pledges to remain a partner of all Pakistanis who seek to build a future of peace and prosperity.
