Boston, MA â€“ Governor Mitt Romney today announced additions to the Nevada Romney for President organization. These three staff members will join previously announced State Director, Joe Brezny, and Senior Advisor, Ryan Erwin, and a rapidly growing grassroots network of volunteers committed to delivering victory for Governor Romney in the Silver State. They will build Governor Romney's grassroots organization in Nevada, as well as coordinate volunteer efforts for Governor Romney leading up to the Nevada Caucuses next year.
"Nevada will play an important role in deciding the next Republican presidential candidate, and I look forward to working with this talented team to bring conservative change to Washington," said Governor Romney. "With their hard work on Election Day, every voter will know I will bring fiscal responsibility to Washington, strengthen families, and keep our military strong."
