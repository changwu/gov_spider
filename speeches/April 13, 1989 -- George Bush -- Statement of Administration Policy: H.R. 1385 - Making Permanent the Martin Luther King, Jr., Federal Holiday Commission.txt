    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Clay (D) MO and 84 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 1385, but believes a five-year extension of the Commission, as proposed in S. 431, would be preferable. The approach in the Senate bill would foster the desirable objective of ensuring periodic consideration of federally-supported activities.
