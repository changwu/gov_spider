    Thursday, Hillary For America Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri released the following statement in response to Senator Sanders' attacks on our last two Democratic presidents:
"If Senator Sanders wants to be the standard bearer of the Democratic Party, he should spend less time attempting to tear down the very real accomplishments of two of the most successful presidencies in modern times. Under President Clinton, the country experienced unprecedented job growth and the largest six-year drop in poverty in nearly 30 years. President Obama rescued the country from near financial collapse and achieved what every Democratic president since Harry Truman had attempted to put in place: quality, affordable health care for all Americans. Their records of accomplishing tangible, life changing results for the American people speak for themselves."
"This race is about a vision for the future that builds on the past and putting forth ideas with which to do so, not tearing other people down. Just last week, Senator Sanders said he hoped we can have a debate on the issues. Unfortunately, we haven't seen very much of that from him as of late."
