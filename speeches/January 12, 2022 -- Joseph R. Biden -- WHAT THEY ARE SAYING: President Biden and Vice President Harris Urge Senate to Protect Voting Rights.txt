    Yesterday, in Atlanta, Georgia, the President and Vice President forcefully defended the fundamental right to vote – the right from which all other rights flow. Speaking from the cradle of civil rights in America, they emphasized the urgent need to pass legislation to protect both voting rights and the integrity of our elections.
The President made it clear that to protect our democracy, he supports changing the Senate rules to prevent a minority of Senators from blocking action on voting rights. He reminded lawmakers that this is one of the defining moments in American history – and they have to decide which side of history they stand on.
Lawmakers, State and local elected officials, advocacy organizations, and community leaders across the country applauded the President and Vice President's remarks and joined the call to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.
See below for what they're saying:
Voting Rights Advocacy Organizations and Leaders
Stacey Abrams, Activist and Georgia Gubernatorial Candidate: "My statement: I thank @POTUS and @VP for returning to Georgia to continue their steadfast advocacy for passage of federal legislation to protect the freedom to vote. They made clear again today that they are committed to restoring the Senate to safeguard our democracy. Anyone working to invest in Georgia - our jobs, health, infrastructure, technology and votes - should come speak about the good work they are doing. That is what the President and VP did today, and I look forward to continuing to work with them to make progress for Georgians. While I was not able to attend today's event, the President and I connected by phone this morning. We reaffirmed our shared commitment to the American project of freedom and democracy, as he did in his remarks today here in Georgia. The President deeply understands that Congress must pass the #FreedomToVoteAct and the #JohnLewisVotingRightsAct by whatever legislative means necessary, including by reforming or eliminating the Senate filibuster … We must pave the way for swift Senate passage, because as President Biden declared today, if Republicans continue to prevent passage of legislation to protect the freedom to vote, "we have no option but to change the Senate rules, including getting rid of the filibuster." [Twitter Thread, 1/11/22]
Fair Fight Action, New Georgia Project Action Fund, Black Voters Matter Fund, GALEO Fund, Asian American Advocacy Fund, Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, and former Georgia NAACP State President Reverend James Woodall: "We appreciate President Biden and Vice President Harris amplifying the urgency of protecting our freedom to vote, as they demonstrated today in Georgia. We are looking forward to them delivering on their commitment to ensure we pass federal voting rights legislation." [Tweet, 1/11/22]
Virginia Kase Solomón, CEO, League of Women Voters of the United States: "Today we heard the President issue a bold call to end the Senate filibuster rule, which has blocked progress for the American people for far too long. The League of Women Voters thanks the Biden administration for heeding the months-long call from activists to take a strong stance against the filibuster for voting rights. In his speech, the President forcefully called out those who would obstruct democracy, rightly laying the onus of democracy protection on the US Senate. State legislatures across the country have passed anti-voter bills with a simple majority, while the President noted that the US Senate requires a supermajority to pass voting rights protections. We commend the President for acknowledging the legacies of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Congressman John Lewis, asserting that we must 'translate eulogy into action.' The Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act will protect and expand the freedom to vote, especially for Black and brown Americans, who are disproportionately targeted by state anti-voter laws. The Senate would sully the legacy of Dr. King and Congressman Lewis by invoking their names without passing these bills … After today's speech, we are confident in the power of the President's directive to the US Senate that nothing must stand in the way of voting rights for the American people." [Statement, 1/11/22]
Wade Henderson, Interim President and CEO, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights: "We applaud President Biden and Vice President Harris for their clarion call to action delivered in the home of one of the most stringent anti-voter laws in the nation. Now the Senate must meet this moment and pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. The freedom to vote must be above partisan politics and not be obstructed by procedure. Evidence of pervasive and pernicious racial discrimination in voting is clear. Yet too many Senate Republicans are hiding behind the filibuster and refuse to even acknowledge the need for debate on voting rights — nevermind that 16 current Republican senators voted for the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act in 2006. Some Senate Democrats, including Senators Manchin and Sinema, have been skeptical about changing the rules on the filibuster. But arcane Senate rules must not stand in the way of our democracy. The circumstances of this moment demand action now. We cannot afford to go back to a world reminiscent of Jim Crow — a world of exclusion, control, and violent inequality. For our democracy to work for all of us, it must include us all. Senators from both sides of the aisle must be on the right side of history, allow debate, and pass these crucial bills. However, if Senate Republicans refuse to join in that effort, Democrats must be willing to go it alone." [Statement, 1/11/22]
Jesus Rubio, Mi Familia Vota Georgia State Director:: "Mi Familia Vota is proud to organize and work in Georgia to help educate and register Latino voters and fight the 21st Century Jim Crow tactics from Republicans in the state. As I sat today in the audience listening to President Joe Biden's speech I left feeling inspired and more committed than ever to the cause of protecting our Democracy and building Latino political power. We must continue to put pressure on Republican Senators to join Democrats and pass common sense voting rights legislation in the Senate." [Statement, 1/11/22]
Héctor Sánchez Barba, Executive Director and CEO, Mi Familia Vota: "President Joe Biden's speech today showed that he understands that while this voter suppression trend is rooted in some of the worst episodes in our history when it comes to racial discrimination in voting – that these radical laws are targeting the rights of everyone, of any race, who Republicans are afraid might vote against them. While we welcome President Biden's speech, and are excited to hear that he is willing to amend the filibuster to get this done, now we need immediate action. We need a clear path forward on how this gets passed in the Senate. Congress must act, our Democracy and the Latino community cannot wait. We will continue to organize, educate and fight to get federal voting legislation passed immediately" [Statement, 1/11/22]
UnidosUS: "Protecting #VotingRights = safe & fair elections = a healthy democracy = no Jan 6 repeat. Passing the John Lewis VRAA and Freedom to Vote Act are the best ways to ensure every American can vote in the 2022 #midterms & beyond. The Senate must do what it takes to pass both NOW." [Tweet, 1/11/22]
Latino Victory: "Voting is the strongest pillar sustaining our democracy. Latino Victory was proud to join @POTUS & @VP in Georgia to urge the Senate to pass the Freedom to Vote & the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Now's not the time to hesitate--it's the time to act to save our democracy." [Tweet, 1/11/22]
Voto Latino: "'This is a moral moment. If we fail to protect the voices and votes of the American people, then we have fallen way short of our responsibility as members of this body.' — GA @SenatorWarnock The Senate must end the filibuster and protect our voting rights!" [Tweet, 1/11/22]
Students Learn, Students Vote Coalition: "The SLSV Coalition commends @POTUS and @VP for addressing voting rights and access at the @AUCConsortium, home to @CAU, @Morehouse, and @SpelmanCollege , a site of historic significance to the civil rights movement as well as extraordinary work to expand the #StudentVote. We are encouraged by Biden-Harris Admin actions and support for expansion of voting access to all eligible Americans, and to make the democratic process more equitable. We are also pleased by the Admin's continued emphasis of this issue, beginning with their Executive Order issued on March 7, 2021, promising action to promote access to voting. While today's address focused on congressional action, we believe the Admin should explore all avenues to expand access to the vote, for students and all Americans. We look forward to assisting in any efforts that will help student voters make their voices heard. #StudentVote" [Tweet, 1/11/22]
Senators
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer: "You heard it: In Georgia, President Biden made a strong case for the Senate to pass legislation to protect the sacred right to vote—and to take whatever steps necessary to accomplish that goal. And as soon as tomorrow, the Senate will move forward." [Tweet, 1/11/22]
Majority Whip Dick Durbin, Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee: "The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy. We should be doing everything we can to strengthen that foundation, not chipping away at it piece by piece and state by state. I join @POTUS in his call for immediate legislative action on voting rights." [Tweet, 1/11/22]
Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen: "As @POTUS laid out: our democracy faces a turning point, & the next few days are critical. We've got to stand up for the right to vote. We can't let the filibuster stop us. We must pass the #FreedomToVote & #JohnLewisVotingRightsAct. I urge my colleagues to heed this call." [Tweet, 1/11/22]
New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen: "Voting rights shouldn't be a partisan issue. I appreciate @POTUS' leadership on strengthening voting rights – now it's time for Congress to do its job. We must put politics aside & pass legislation that ensures every American can exercise their right to vote." [Tweet, 1/11/22]
Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley: "Glad to hear @POTUS voice support for changing the Senate rules to prevent a minority from blocking action on voting rights. We need to restore the Senate to working order and get this done!" [Tweet, 1/11/22]
Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse: "There is an all-out attack on voting rights taking place in this country. @POTUS is right: we need to act, no matter what it takes. Democracy could be on the line." [Tweet, 1/11/22]
Virginia Senator Mark Warner, Chairman, Senate Intelligence Committee: "'The leaders of the world – adversaries and allies alike – are watching to see if we can meet this moment.' Appreciated the words of @POTUS this afternoon. The time to act to preserve our democracy is now." [Tweet, 1/11/22]
Members of Congress
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi: "Today in Georgia, President Biden made it crystal clear: the Senate must find a path forward to enshrine critical voting rights legislation into law. The President is to be commended for his clarion voice and strong leadership in this fight as we strive to protect the sacred right to vote, which is the bedrock of our democracy. The need to protect our democracy could not be more urgent, as America faces the most dangerous assault on the vote since Jim Crow. Last year alone, Republican lawmakers introduced over 440 draconian voter suppression bills across 49 states, with at least 19 states enacting 34 measures into law. Meanwhile, Republican-appointed judges have erased hard-won voter protections, including on the Supreme Court. Shamefully, Republicans in the Congress have repeatedly voted to aid and abet this anti-democratic campaign. In doing so, they are not only diminishing our democracy here at home, but tarnishing our example of freedom around the world. Our beloved colleague, the late Congressman John Lewis, once said: 'Democracy is not a state. It is an act, and each generation must do its part.' In his memory, House Democrats have proudly passed the For The People Act to defend and expand voting rights, fight big money in politics, end extreme partisan gerrymandering and more. In his name, House Democrats have passed the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to block future voting restrictions imposed by states with disgraceful histories of discrimination. Yet, Senate Republicans cynically refuse to even begin debate on voting rights legislation – because they know the only way they can win elections is by barring voters from the ballot box. The President forcefully declared that the time has come for the Senate to heed the call of John Lewis and do its part to protect the vote and end the Republican nullification of elections. Nothing less than our democracy is at stake." [Statement, 1/11/22]

California Congressman Jared Huffman: "Across the country, state legislatures are introducing hundreds of bills to restrict access to the ballot box. .@POTUS is right: The Senate has changed its rules before, and it must do so again so we can protect our democracy and the right to vote."

Pennsylvania Congresswoman Chrissy Houlahan: "The right to vote is sacred, and it's a foundational pillar of our Republic. Yet in PA, some are trying to make it harder to vote.

That's why, as he and Vice President Harris called for today, the U.S. Senate must pass essential voting rights legislation — by whatever means necessary. The president and vice president are correct about the dangers of the anti-voter laws sweeping the nation — laws like Republicans' Senate Bill 1 in Texas. With Texas' first major election under the GOP's new anti-democratic legislation just around the corner, we can wait no longer for the U.S. Senate to act. Texas House Democrats have been sounding the alarm for over a year now, fighting for the freedom to vote in Austin — and in Washington, D.C. Last summer, more than 50 members of our caucus broke quorum and travelled to our nation's capital to shine a spotlight on the dangers of the anti-voter movement that grew from Donald Trump's big lie. Texans — indeed, all Americans — need the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act if we are to defeat voter suppression and preserve our democracy. As President Biden said today: 'pass it now!'" [Statement, 1/11/22]

Atlanta, GA Mayor Andre Dickens: "President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris' trip to our city underscores the importance of Atlanta's voice in fighting for voting rights.

As the cradle of the Civil Rights Movement and home of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Atlanta helped change the composition of the U.S. Senate by electing Senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff. Passing the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act must happen if we hope to preserve our democracy. I am honored that the President and Vice President chose Atlanta to share that message—and proud that my 17-year-old daughter was there to witness it.

He's here in Atlanta … which is the front lines, here in Georgia, of this fight against voter suppression … This not just a mere photo op. This is an understanding, I think, by the President that these are the front lines in this battle … If you can set the filibuster aside to, quote, 'allow for trade promotion and trade agreements to be passed, the debt ceiling to be passed,' then certainly, you can set it aside for the protection of democracy, which is foundational to the nation we are."

The story is the state of emergency. We have applied pressure in our own ways. Some of us are litigating; some are organizing; some are engaged in direct action. All - since last summer - have been clear that the filibuster cannot stand in the way of voter protection legislation. I, for one, am glad the President is now prepared to say the same.

Melanie L. Campbell, President and CEO, National Coalition on Black Civic Participation and Convener, Black Women's Roundtable: "I applaud the comments delivered by President Biden and Vice President Harris expressing their strong commitment to use their power to protect the right to vote. Since the beginning of this administration, we have urged the Biden-Harris Administration to use every possible tool at its disposal and apply the full influence of the bully pulpit to advocate towards the passage of The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom To Vote Act. As we have seen today, on the heels of Martin Luther King Holiday, that influence also includes taking that message to the communities most impacted by voter suppression and election subversion. That is why The National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, The Black Women's Roundtable, Black Youth Vote and Black Women Leaders and Allies have been focused on pushing the U.S. Senate and every institution in our federal government to prioritize these foundational protections – through advocacy, protest, dialogue and coalition building. Since the 2020 general election, legislators in 19 states have enacted dozens of laws that will restrict access to the ballot box, including in the State of Georgia, where an historic turnout of Black and brown voters shifted political power nationally. It is clear the attacks on voting rights at the state-level are an affront to the millions of Black people who came out to vote in the 2020 election. Individual states are instituting suppressive measures on the right to vote, and these changes will primarily affect our communities. Republicans are engaged in the greatest roll back of voting rights since Reconstruction, and we cannot sit on the sidelines as they continue to deny millions of voters, mostly Black and brown, of their democratic right to vote. President Biden's full throated support of changing the U.S. Senate rules in order to protect our democracy is an important step. We are running out of time and cannot let archaic Senate rules stand in the way of protecting our constitutional rights – especially voting rights for all Americans. The countless restrictive voting laws being passed in state legislatures throughout the country have only been perpetuated by the false pretext of the 'Big Lie' that led to the January 6th insurrection. As we are barely a year out from that dark day, Black Women and Allies will continue marching, advocating, protesting and pressuring the U.S. Senate to pass federal voting rights to protect our democracy from peril."

And now is the time to come together to defend our democracy. The Senate must pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act as a bold starting point in protecting our right to vote. The attempt to decertify the results of the 2020 presidential election was only the visible manifestation of more furtive efforts being taken nationwide by insurgents to restrict access to voting and, consequently, strip Americans of our right to vote. Separately, some elected officials are making it harder for people to register to vote and easier for state officials to delete your voter registration. They are also curtailing mail-in voting and early voting. This is simply wrong. We cannot allow anyone to chip away at and destroy the fundamental rights that are at the foundation of this Nation. We must end partisan manipulation and safeguard the election process. Voting is an act of love that demonstrates a commitment to one another, our country, and our community.

Now is the time for Democrats in Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Our party has a moral responsibility to act. Since 2015, Priorities USA has worked tirelessly to protect voting rights.

And every day Republicans are allowed to filibuster this bill is another day the forces seeking to undermine our democracy get stronger. It is far past time for the Senate to act. What happens over the next few weeks in Congress will determine whether we continue to have free and fair elections in this nation or whether we are going to continue to allow one party to destroy the great American experiment systematically. We can either have a democracy or we can have the filibuster. But Republicans have proven we can't have both. It is time to call the vote.

We endorse the position of the Biden Administration that at minimum there be a "carve-out" of the filibuster, if not its complete elimination, to allow for the passage of critical legislation effecting voting and citizenship rights.

American democracy is not a guarantee but rather a collective choice, and these two landmark bills, the Freedom To Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, will begin to restore the unmet promise of our democracy and create our future?—?a liveable planet, safe communities, and a democracy in which every person counts."

These transformative pieces of legislation are only controversial if you believe big money should rule politics, partisan machinations should trump the rule of law, and protecting our right to vote isn't worth fighting for. The faction that attempted to sabotage the last election is already putting in place the pieces to do it again. President Biden understands that, as does Senator Schumer, and they are prioritizing action to thwart the attack ... The Senate must immediately unite to preserve our elections and access to the ballot box for all. Anything less than the full passage of these bold reforms will fail democracy." [Statement, 1/11/22]

Karen Hobert Flynn, President, Common Cause: "In the United States, we are stronger when every American votes, when every American has a say in the future of this country. President Biden made very clear today that he knows we are at a pivotal moment in our nation's history and that a Republican minority in the U.S. Senate must not be allowed to turn back the clock and allow a new generation of Jim Crow laws to take root. He clearly stated that the Senate rules must not tolerated when they strip Americans – particularly Black and Brown Americans - of their fundamental right to vote. Those rules must be changed if they are abused. Simple majorities in state legislatures are deciding who can vote and who cannot while the filibuster has allowed a minority in the Senate to prevent Congress from acting to prevent voter suppression and protect the voting rights of every American. The fight over voting rights has clearly shown that the Senate is broken, and President Biden is right that it is time to fix it. As recently as 2006 every single Senator voted to amend and extend the Voting Rights Act – including 16 who are still in the Senate today – but for the last year, all Senate Republicans, with one exception, have continually voted against voting rights at every turn. If Republicans in the Senate continue to put their party before their nation, then the Senate must act with a majority to protect the fundamental freedom to vote. As the President and Vice President emphasized today, history is watching, and it is time for the Senate to act to 'keep the promise of democracy alive.'" [Statement, 1/11/22]

Naveed Shah, Political Director, Common Defense: "The January 6th storm of the Capitol Building was an unprecedented attack on our democracy. In order to prevent another insurrection, we must institute strong democracy safeguards that protect the freedom to vote for every American. President Biden's speech today in Atlanta, at a place with profound civil rights history, will be a powerful call to do just that by any legal means necessary – including a carveout of the filibuster for voting rights. I served in Iraq during their second ever national elections. On that day, the insurgents weren't after us Americans, but instead were targeting their own citizens to prevent them from exercising their right to vote. I never thought I would see anything like that here, but on January 6th, 2021, I was both proven wrong and reminded how fragile our democracy truly is. As veterans who risked their lives to defend democracy, we commend President Biden and Senate Democrats for leading the charge to protect our voting rights. In years past, we would be able to commend both parties, like in 2006 when the Senate passed an extension to the Voting Rights Act unanimously. Unfortunately, the Republican Party has blindly followed their leaders and have chosen anti-democratic laws over what our nation stands for. State legislatures are instituting voter suppression and ballot restriction measures across the country, including in Georgia, the likes of which we haven't seen since the Jim Crow era. In doing so, they are continuing the coup that began after the 2020 election with the Big Lie, and attacking the most fundamental, inalienable rights of Americans: the freedom to vote. As the Senate has done recently when it came time to pass tax breaks for the rich and the confirmation of judges, the Senate can and must amend the filibuster in order to secure our democracy now. Otherwise, we may not have the chance to have our voices hear in the next election." [Statement, 1/11/22]
Rakim H.D. Brooks, President, Alliance for Justice: "Our democracy has been under attack in state legislatures across the country for months, if not years, now— all with the Supreme Court's stamp of approval. It is vitally urgent that we pass legislation that ensures access to the polls, unrigs our legislative maps, and protects election results from sabotage. We cannot allow any obstacle to stop us. The filibuster cannot be allowed to stand if it means our democracy fails. So many lies have been told about its legacy, when the reality is its most vicious and frequent use was to prevent the passage of civil rights legislation. Today, it does just that, as it is now blocking attempts to restore access to the polls to many voters of color targeted by these states' voting restrictions. It was the right call to end the filibuster nearly a decade ago when it was used to block nominees to our courts and agencies, and it's the right call to end the filibuster for voting rights. We will likewise not fall for Senator McConnell's bait and switch to do less than is needed. Turnout was great in the 2020 election thanks to mail-in voting and extra precautions made available during a deadly pandemic. Since then, 19 states have passed a total of 34 different laws making it harder to vote, including limiting the very accommodations that made the 2020 election so successful. McConnell and the other Senate Republicans are intent on keeping these new obstacles in place in the hopes that they benefit when fewer people can vote. That's not how our democracy works. We will not cater to those who draw power from dysfunction. We are a country of the people, by the people, and for the people — all the people, not just some. It is clear we are in crisis, and we will not back down until we have passed the protections our democracy needs and deserves." [Statement, 1/11/22]
Leah Greenberg, Co-Executive Director, Indivisible: "This was the speech we needed to see from President Biden - a clear moral case and call to action. We must do what's necessary to fix the filibuster, protect our democracy, and guarantee the right to vote - ASAP." [Tweet, 1/11/22]
Tara Setmayer, Lincoln Project: "President Biden showed up today with a strong, no nonsense speech today. He laid out the stakes. Now they need to message the hell out of this to get Americans fired up & ready to go. Our democracy depends on it. #DefendDemocracy #Biden" [Tweet, 1/11/22]
Danielle Melfi, Executive Director, Building Back Together: "The guiding principle of our democracy is that in America, the voters decide the outcome of our elections. That core idea is under threat, as Republican legislators at every level work to undermine the free and fair elections that are the foundation of our country and government and push to enact hundreds of new restrictions on voting for tens of millions of Americans. President Biden and Vice President Harris have made clear that voting rights reform is a key priority. Yet not only do we face efforts to spread disinformation, sow distrust in our elections, and block access to the ballot box, we also face relentless obstruction by Republicans in Congress, including unanimous opposition from Republican Senators who refuse to even hold a debate on voting rights legislation. That's why it's clear, as the President stated today, that reform of the Senate's rules is a necessary step to ensure the ideals of our democracy are upheld. With reforms to the Senate rules, we can and we must continue the work to strengthen and secure our government and defend the rule of law in our country by passing the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. These reforms are how we will protect the rights of American voters, ensure that trusted local election officials are able to count every vote, and stop partisan politicians from sabotaging our elections. It's time for Congress to act." [Statement, 1/11/22]
UnPAC: "Thank you @POTUS for standing up for democracy today in Georgia. Your words spoke to the urgency of this pivotal moment in history.

Newtown Action Alliance: "We stand with the @POTUS & we urge @SenatorSinema @Sen_JoeManchin to #EndTheFilibuster to protect our votes.

Religious Organizations and Leaders
Latter-Day Saints for Biden-Harris: "Latter-day Saints know that voting rights undergird the most inspired aspects of the US Constitution, including the idea that the source of governmental power is the people, amendments to extend and defend human rights protections, the separation of powers, the vital guarantees found in the Bill of Rights, and the triumph of the rule of law over arbitrary authority ... We call on the Latter-day Saints currently in the House and, especially, the US Senate, to support voter protection measures that preserve moral agency and defend the checks and balances of our Constitutional order. The best way to accomplish these goals is to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act without delay. We must make sure that the attacks on our democracy that accelerated after the Shelby v. Holder decision, culminating in the January 6th insurrection and anti-voting laws passed in nineteen states last year are not the beginning of the end. As President Biden pointed out today, free and fair elections allow candidates to triumph based on the merits of their ideas, a core feature of the American way." [Statement, 1/11/22]
National Council of Jewish Women: "We need to protect our most sacred right — the right to vote — and ensure the will of people is never subverted. Help us demand the Senate pass the #FreedomtoVoteAct NOW. Take action" [Tweet, 1/11/22]
Sheila Katz, CEO, National Council of Jewish Women: "National Council of Jewish Women agrees with President Biden – it is time to change the rules of the Senate to pass transformational voting rights legislations. Our nation cannot wait any longer to pass the Freedom to Vote Act, John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement At, and DC Statehood. Voting is the foundation of our democracy and the right to vote is protective of all other rights. Without access to the polls, we don't get to tell lawmakers to prioritize the issues that matter most to our communities." [Statement, 1/11/22]
Rabbi Jonah Dov Pesner, Director, Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism: "We are grateful for the administration's re-affirmation of support for pivotal legislation that will end discriminatory voting practices and allow every voice to be heard, and every vote to be counted. Now, it is time for the White House to turn their words into action and use their full power to compel the Senate to enact filibuster reform to ensure the passage of the Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act … it is the duty of those who cherish democracy to ensure that all Americans are afforded the opportunity to have their votes counted. We turn our attention to the Senate and renew our call to senators to make reforms to restore themselves as a functioning legislative body. Despite the record turnout for the 2020 election, state elected officials have introduced over 440 restrictive voting laws in the last year. The only way to prevent further discrimination that disproportionately effects People of Color, poor people, language minorities, disabled individuals, and young and elderly voters, is through the passage of federal legislation to expand voting rights for all Americans. The obstructionist tactic of the filibuster can no longer prevent these bills from moving forward. This outdated rule has been reformed over 160 times in modern history, and must be reformed once again to prevent the Senate from upholding systemic racism and white supremacy. We are entrusting our elected officials to work for the people they represent by enacting filibuster reform and passage of these two bills." [Statement, 1/11/22]
American Jewish Congress: "Democracy is the American way, but it is at grave risk. NOW is the time to stand up for the right to vote. It is NOT the time for the vote to be undermined by partisan fear mongering. Thank you @POTUS for leading on democracy." [Tweet, 1/11/22]
United Church of Christ: "Democracy works best when we put in place protections that ensure every American has an equal opportunity to make their voice heard and be fairly represented. The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and Freedom to Vote Act offer a transformative moment for democracy protection. We're sitting at a critical juncture for our democracy, one that calls on Congress to rise to the moment. As the Senate once again takes up these bills and debates changes to procedure, we ask that they consider whom the senate rules are serving and make the necessary changes to those rules so the Senate serves as a functional body and can pass this critical legislation. The right to vote represents a place in the community, a recognition of the inherent worth and dignity of every person; as people of faith, we believe every person is deserving of a voice and a vote." [Tweet, 1/11/22]

Reverend William Barber: "All of the people & GA activists that challenged the President today stand in the same tradition of John Lewis when he challenged JFK at the March on Washington in 1963. Some civil rights groups didn't like it then, but John Lewis was right.

Lee Saunders, President, AFSCME: "Our democracy cannot stand unless the right of every citizen to vote is protected. It's as simple as that. Since the Voting Rights Act was gutted by the Supreme Court in 2013, we have watched in horror as anti-democratic state legislatures have ramped up their assaults on our right to vote. And this past year they were more successful than ever, passing restrictive voter suppression laws in 19 states. We cannot sit idly by and allow powerful special interests to rob us of our voice and rig our democracy. The legacy of leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Congressman John Lewis is on the line. It's time for the Senate to answer President Biden's call, stop hiding behind arcane rules and finally protect the right of every American to make their voice heard at the ballot box." [Statement, 1/11/22]
Communications Workers' Association: "In today's powerful speech on voting rights, President Biden sent a clear message to members of the United States Senate: voting rights are essential to our democracy, and failing to act is not acceptable. The Senate's antiquated filibuster rules require a supermajority to protect millions of working people from being disenfranchised, while egregious voter suppression laws are being enacted with a simple majority vote in many states. As Biden noted, these rules impede progress, preventing true discussion and deliberation. They have been so abused that they prevent bills from even coming to the floor for a simple debate. They allow politicians to avoid responsibility for their actions by providing an excuse for not taking any action at all. In his speech, Biden said that "[t]he right to vote and have that vote count, it is democracy's threshold liberty. Without it, nothing is possible. But with it, anything is possible." We wholeheartedly agree with the President and support his call for the Senate to take immediate action to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act before it is too late. CWA won't stop fighting until our members' sacred right to vote is protected." [Statement, 1/11/22]

Business Leaders
Rhett Buttle, Founder, Public Private Strategies and President, Public Private Strategies Institute: "This research clearly shows that the leaders in America's business community view democracy and voting rights as an economic issue. Now, it is important that advocates, policymakers, and leaders in Congress and the Administration engage the business community to advance solutions that will stabilize our democracy and protect access to the ballot for every voter." [Statement, 1/11/22]
Liz Fairchild, Executive Director, Business Forward: "Businesses are successful in competitive, transparent, and responsive markets. The same is true of our democracy. Since the 2020 election, major employers in Georgia and across the country have been speaking up to defend voter access because companies look for a talented workforce, sound infrastructure, good schools, and a strong community. States compete with one another for new investment and jobs and restrictive voter laws send the wrong signal and turn off investors — once you start losing bids, it gets harder to catch up. Georgia's state legislature introduced 30 bills last year that make it harder for Georgians to vote — and more than 550 anti-voter bills have been introduced nationwide. Fairchild added, "With less than a year until the 2022 midterm elections, President Biden's call to action comes at a critical time for our democracy." [Statement, 1/11/22]
Erika Gonzalez, Co-Chair, Small Business for America's Future:" Business leaders across the country applaud President Biden for his speech in Georgia today calling for the passage of voting rights legislation—as they firmly believe a stable democracy is crucial to capitalism and a strong economy. Passing legislation such as the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act will strengthen the fundamental elements of our democracy and failing to do so would be a threat to our nation's economy. Small business owners want our leaders in Washington to ensure that the power in our country remains with the people, which they say is what allows entrepreneurship and the economy to flourish. A Small Business for America's Future national survey shows 60% of small business owners responding are worried about the state of U.S. democracy. A national survey released last week by Public Private Strategies found that the leaders of businesses with more than 250 employees expressed the same concerns about our democracy and 7 in 10 said they support the passage of the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to preserve it. Especially noteworthy is that 74% support amending House and Senate rules to pass the legislation. Main Street small business owners, the nation's job creators, see voting rights as a clearcut economic issue. It is time for Congress to act to preserve and strengthen our democracy and our economy."

Airbnb Public Policy: "The freedom to vote is everyone's business. We have a responsibility to ensure our eligible communities can freely vote without discrimination. Congress must pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act." [Tweet, 1/11/22]
Luis Guardia, President, Food Research & Action Center: "The Food Research & Action Center (FRAC) calls on the Senate to swiftly pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Passage of this historic legislation will dismantle obstacles to voting, including those caused by the lingering harms of Jim Crow laws and the more recent waves of draconian state proposals, and ensure essential protections for voters. Ensuring that all eligible people can vote is a cornerstone of a functioning and just democracy, and is vital to nationwide efforts to end hunger and poverty in America. Millions of people experience voter disenfranchisement in the U.S., thereby undermining governmental action to secure fundamental rights that should be protected in a democracy such as food, shelter, and the right to participate in fair and open elections. State voter suppression laws disproportionately restrict the voting rights of Black, Latino, and low-income voters, intersecting with many groups that are more at risk of hunger. When eligible people are unable to participate in the voting process, our democracy suffers. We must ensure the voices of those struggling against hunger are fully represented in the democratic process so that elected officials are held accountable to effectively and accurately address the issues and priorities that matter to our nation. As Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday draws near, our nation is at a critical juncture. The Senate must act now to stop efforts by some states to return to the days of Jim Crow and to protect and safeguard our sacred voting rights that are essential to American democracy by passing the Freedom to Vote Act and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. This is a surefire way to commemorate Dr. King's legacy." [Statement, 1/11/22]
American Sustainable Business Network (ASBN): "The American Sustainable Business Network (ASBN) supports President Biden's call on the Senate to change its rules in whatever way is necessary to pass voting rights legislation to protect the fundamentals of American democracy. Democracy is the cornerstone of our economy. While the Senate continues to debate voting rights legislation, it is critical to note that business owners' voices in many states are being suppressed, particularly those in communities of color. The Senate must do its part to protect every eligible American's right to vote and guarantee that election results are respected by passing fair and transparent voting rights legislation. Failing to pass voting rights legislation that protects our democracy threatens our economy. Allowed to continue, these anti-democracy actions will result in autocratic government that will be unsupportive of the entrepreneurs who drive our local, state, and national economies. Changing Senate rules to expedite important legislation is neither new nor radical. The body already allows more than 160 types of votes and legislation to pass by a simple majority, including just in the last few weeks bypassing the filibuster rules to pass an increase in the debt ceiling. ASBN supports immediate Senate passage of the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. " [Statement, 1/11/22]
