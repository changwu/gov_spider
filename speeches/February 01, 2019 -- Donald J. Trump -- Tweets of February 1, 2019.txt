Just out: The big deal very mysterious Don jr telephone calls after the innocent Trump Tower meeting that the media & Dems said were made to his father (me) were just conclusively found NOT to be made to me. They were made to friends & business associates of Don. Really sad!Retweets: 26789Favorites: 115253

I inherited a total mess in Syria and Afghanistan the 'Endless Wars' of unlimited spending and death. During my campaign I said very strongly that these wars must finally end.

....after 18 long years. Syria was loaded with ISIS until I came along. We will soon have destroyed 100% of the Caliphate but will be watching them closely. It is now time to start coming home and after many years spending our money wisely. Certain people must get smart!Retweets: 20739Favorites: 99698
