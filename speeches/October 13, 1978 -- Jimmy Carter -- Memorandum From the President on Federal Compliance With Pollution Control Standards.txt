    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Subject: Federal Compliance With Pollution Control Standards
Today, I signed Executive Order No. 12088 which sets forth the policies which are to govern compliance with environmental standards by Federal facilities.
Federal agencies shall exercise leadership in the attainment of the Nation's environmental goals. This Executive Order makes the head of each executive agency responsible for ensuring that Federal facilities are at all times designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in compliance with all Federal, State and local environmental requirements. Consistent with existing law, there will be no exemption from these requirements except in the interests of National security or in extraordinary cases where an exemption is otherwise in the paramount interest of the United States.
The FY 1979 Budget which I submitted to the Congress provided for pollution control equipment at Federal facilities that are not in compliance with Federal environmental requirements. This policy also will govern the preparation of subsequent budgets. I have asked the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to monitor the use of funds appropriated for pollution abatement at Federal facilities so that we can be sure that Federal agencies actually comply with environmental requirements in the most direct and effective manner.
I know I can count on your cooperation in this effort.
JIMMY CARTER
