    As Joe Biden decides to travel to Minnesota for the first time in over a thousand days, three mayors from historically Democrat strongholds on the Iron Range have joined the chorus of former Democrats abandoning their party for President Trump. Only President Trump has stood up to the radical environmentalists and worked to preserve the mining and energy industries on the Iron Range that make America great. Joe Biden has simply become too radical for blue collar workers in America's heartland.
The letter from Mayor Chris Vreeland of Hoyt Lakes, Minnesota, Mayor Kathy Brandau of Winton, Minnesota, and Mayor Tony Nygaard of McKinley, Minnesota reads:
"As a result of the Trump Administration's policies, our communities were given a much needed shot in the arm so that our towns can roar back to life - and there is no one we Rangers trust to bring about the great American comeback more than President Trump. With 45 days left before Election Day, Joe Biden makes his first visit to Minnesota in more than 1,000 days - but it's too little, too late. Biden's willful ignorance of our way of life and his push to institute policies that will all but destroy our communities has ensured the continued exodus of Iron Rangers from the Democrat Party."
