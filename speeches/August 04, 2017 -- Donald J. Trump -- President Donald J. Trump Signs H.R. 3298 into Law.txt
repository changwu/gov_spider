    Today, President Donald J. Trump signed into law H.R. 3298, the Wounded Officers Recovery Act of 2017. The President is proud to sign this bill to allow the U.S. Capitol Police Memorial Fund to provide financial assistance to Capitol Police officers injured in the line of duty, including Special Agents David Bailey and Crystal Griner, who were injured defending Members of Congress and others during the shooting at the June 14, 2017 practice for the annual Congressional Baseball Game for Charity. Special Agents Bailey and Griner, and all of our law enforcement officers injured in the course of protecting our safety, deserve our steadfast support.
