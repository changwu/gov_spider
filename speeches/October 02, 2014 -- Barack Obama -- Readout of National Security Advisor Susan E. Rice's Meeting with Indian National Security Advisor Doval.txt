    National Security Advisor Rice and Indian National Security Advisor Doval met today to follow-up on the President's meetings with Prime Minister Modi earlier this week. They discussed how we can best build on the accomplishments from the Prime Minister's visit to Washington to strengthen the U.S.-India strategic partnership for the benefit of citizens in both countries and beyond. They exchanged views on regional developments, including cooperating on maritime security and the importance of reinforcing stability in Afghanistan after the inauguration of a new National Unity Government this week. They agreed to work together to address global crises such as the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa and the spread of violent extremism, and looked forward to continuing close consultations in the future.
