    I SINCERELY hope that no hats or dresses will be spoiled by this sprinkle. I didn't bring it on. In fact, I asked for good weather, because I hope that you have a pleasant time while you are here in Washington.
I understand what you are doing: studying Government, learning how it works, and preparing yourselves to make it work when your turn comes to run it, and it will come very soon--much before you anticipate that it will be here.
Your business will be to carry on this great Republic of the United States, I think the greatest Government in the history of the world.
It is a wonderful thing to have you young ladies interested in government and how it works. The most important thing that we have in our country is freedom of action and freedom of the individual. The fundamental part of the Constitution, in my opinion, is the Bill of Rights, the first Ten Amendments to it. I hope all of you will study those first Ten Amendments to the Constitution; and when you become responsible for the operation of the Government, see that those Ten Amendments are always enforced.
That is what we mean by freedom of the individual. That is the difference between us and a dictatorship or a totalitarian state. The very fact that you can come here and face your Chief Executive and listen to him discuss with you the Government under which we live is something not done in a great many countries. It is most difficult to see the heads of most states. You have to go through much formality--you probably couldn't even get to the front door. But you can come to the White House, you can interview the President, and he is glad to have you.
I hope you enjoy yourselves, and I sincerely hope that this sprinkle hasn't given anybody any colds.
Thank you very much.
