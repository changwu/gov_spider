    To the Senate of the United States:
For the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Protocol for the Extension of the Wheat Trade Convention and the Food Aid Convention constituting the International Wheat Agreement, 1971, open for signature in Washington from April 2 through April 22, 1974. The Protocol were formulated by a Conference of Governments which met in London on February 22, 1974.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol.
The Protocol for the Extension of the Wheat Trade Convention, 1971, extends the Convention until June 30, 1975, and maintains the framework for international cooperation in wheat trade matters. It also continues the existence of the International Wheat Council.
The Protocol for the Extension of the Food Aid Convention, 1971, also extends until June 30, 1975, commitments of parties to provide certain minimum annual quantities of food aid to developing countries. The United States intends not to deposit ratification of this Protocol unless the European Economic Community remains a party. This intention was for really recorded by the United States in a written declaration made at the time the Protocol were signed.
Both Protocol provide that instruments of ratification shall be deposited no later than June 18, 1974. The Wheat Council may, however, grant an extension of time to any signatory government that has not deposited an instrument of ratification by that date.
It is my hope that the Senate will give favorable consideration to the two Protocol so that, subject to the European Economic Community remaining a party to the Food Aid Convention, ratification by the United States can be effected and instruments of ratification for the Wheat Trade Convention and the Food Aid Convention can be deposited without undue delay.
