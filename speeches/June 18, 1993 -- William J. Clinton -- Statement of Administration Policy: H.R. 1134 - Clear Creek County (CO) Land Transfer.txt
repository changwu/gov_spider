    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 6/21/93)(House)(Skaggs (D) Colorado)
The Administration supports H.R. 1134.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 1134 could reduce collections that offset spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary PAYGO scoring estimate is zero.
