    Yesterday, the Biden-Harris plan to build back better in rural America was featured in Daybreak, the daily agriculture newsletter from Agri-Pulse. The rural plan was updated last week with more on how a Biden-Harris administration would build back better for rural communities, adopt smarter trade policies, promote ethanol and the next generation of biofuels, strengthen antitrust enforcement and support beginning farmers, among other goals.
Joe Biden knows we need to get serious about defeating the pandemic, dig out from the worst jobs crisis in nearly a century, and rebuild the middle class so everyone comes along. He believes this is no time to just build back to the way things were before â€“ this is the moment to build a new rural American economy for our families and the next generation.

Agri-Pulse: Biden beefs up rural outreach[By Steve Daines, 10/14/20]
Joe Biden's campaign has beefed up his rural plan for America by adding elements of his Build Back Better plan and drawing a sharper contrast with President Donald Trump, his campaign said.
Build Back Better is billed as Biden's jobs and economic recovery plan for working families. In it, the Democratic candidate says he'll "mobilize American ingenuity to build a modern infrastructure and an equitable, clean energy future."
The updated rural plan says Biden "will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment over four years in our infrastructure and clean energy future, putting millions of people to work in good-paying jobs and setting us on an irreversible course to meet the ambitious climate progress that science demands."
The plan says Biden will adopt smarter trade policies, promote ethanol and the next generation of biofuels, strengthen antitrust enforcement and support beginning farmers, among other goals.
