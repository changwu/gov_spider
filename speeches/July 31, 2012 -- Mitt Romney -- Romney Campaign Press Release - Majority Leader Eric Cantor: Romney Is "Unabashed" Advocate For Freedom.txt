ERIC CANTOR: "I think what Mitt Romney's trip has shown is he is willing to go be a leader, not to shy away from the fact that America is a leader. We are an exceptional nation and to put that out there on the world stage and to tell allies of ours, as well as foes, that we will be unabashed in terms of our commitment to freedom. Some won't like it because they're afraid of being tolerant. They're afraid that their systems will collapse. But at the end of the day, I think that this was a trip that Mitt Romney displayed the kind of person that he is: a decent, honorable man that is committed to the aspirations of freedom that were set in place by our Founders in this country."
