    Hillary Clinton released the following statement in response to the Senate Republicans' announcement to block any SCOTUS appointee by President Obama:
"The Senate Republicans' announcement today that they will refuse to consider any appointee by President Obama for the Supreme Court – no hearing, no debate, and no vote, on any potential nominee – is shameful and indefensible. Some Republicans have even suggested President Obama has no right to nominate anyone, as if somehow he's not a real President. The Senate has never taken more than 125 days to vote on a Supreme Court nominee, and on average a confirmation or rejection has taken just two months. The Senate Republicans' refusal to hold hearings on any nominee by President Obama is unprecedented, and it is an offense to the President and to the American people who elected him. What's more, they are hindering the Court from doing its work – leaving it with only eight members for the remainder of this term and into the next. It's time for the Senate to put statesmanship over partisanship, and live up to our constitutional principles."
