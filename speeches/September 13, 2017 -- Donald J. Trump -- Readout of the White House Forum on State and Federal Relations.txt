    Today as part of the Administration's commitment to open the doors of the White House for State and local officials to discuss mutually beneficial priorities, the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs hosted a bipartisan group of senior State government officials from 44 States and 4 territories at a forum on the relationship between State and Federal governments.
Senior White House officials, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price, Director of the Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney, and Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon participated in the forum and spoke about Administration initiatives and priorities, focusing on President Donald J. Trump's tax reform agenda which would provide tax relief for people at the local level and create jobs.
During their visit, the State officials met with their counterparts in the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, various other White House components, and Federal agencies in order to provide insight and perspective, streamline communication, and build on progress the Administration has made to empower State and local leaders.
"Providing tangible quality of life improvements for the American people starts by strengthening the relationships between State and Federal officials, and President Trump and his entire Administration look forward to continuing communication with our State and local partners in order to Make America Great Again," said Justin Clark, Director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs.
