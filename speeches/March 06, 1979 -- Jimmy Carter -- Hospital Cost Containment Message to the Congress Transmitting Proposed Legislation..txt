    To the Congress of the United States:
Inflation is America's most serious domestic problem. It affects every individual and every institution in the country, and it damages the health not only of our economy but of our society. The American people are demanding prompt action against inflation from their elected representatives-action that is strong, prompt, and effective.
One of the most important components of inflation is the soaring cost of hospital care, which continues to outpace inflation in the rest of the economy. A decade ago, the average cost of a hospital stay was $533. In just the past two years, the average cost of a hospital stay has increased by $317 to $1634 a day 1â€”an increase of almost 24 percent.
