    The United States believes the comprehensive proposals presented to the Northern Ireland parties by the British and Irish governments on August 1, 2001, constitute a fair and balanced approach to further implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. In the present circumstances, the United States also believes that the decision taken today by the British government to suspend the political institutions in Northern Ireland offers a useful path forward.
The United States echoes the hope that the review to be conducted by the British and Irish governments will be completed quickly and that the suspension will be lifted shortly. We ask all the parties to keep in mind the important progress that has been made over the last three years, and urge them to accept the Anglo-Irish proposals, to fully implement the Good Friday Agreement, and to take the steps that will permit the full resumption of all political institutions.
