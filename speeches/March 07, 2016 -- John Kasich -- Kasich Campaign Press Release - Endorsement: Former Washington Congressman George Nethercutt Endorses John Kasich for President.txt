    Said Nethercutt, "I had the distinct honor of serving in Congress with John Kasich. As one who has worked with him and watched him lead, I know America could not elect a more capable President. He led the fight to balance the federal budget for the first time in a generationâ€”and kept it balanced for four years, paying down some $500 billion on the national debt. He led Ohio to economic recovery. He will bring all Americans together around proven conservative solutions. I am proud to support John Kasich for President and stand behind his positive vision for America."

A native of Spokane, WA, Nethercutt unseated the House Speaker, Democrat Tom Foley, for the first time since 1860 to win Washington's 5th Congressional District in 1994. He won consecutive reelections until retiring from the House in 2005, after which he co-founded a consulting firm and promoted the nonprofit George Nethercutt Foundation, dedicated to helping all Americans, particularly students, receive a better civics education.
Said Kasich, "I'm humbled by the support of my friend and former colleague George Nethercutt. It takes incredible courage and tenacity to unseat the sitting Speaker of the US House, as George did, and I look forward to having those qualities on our side as we expand our operations in the coming weeks."
