    To the Senate of the United States: herewith the Treaty Between the Government
With a view to receiving the advice and con-of the United States of America and the Governsent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit ment of the Republic of El Salvador Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, with Annex and Protocol, signed at San Salvador on March 10, 1999. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to this Treaty.
The bilateral investment treaty (BIT) with El Salvador is the seventh such treaty with a Central or South American country. The Treaty will protect U.S. investment and assist El Salvador in its efforts to develop its economy by creating conditions more favorable for U.S. private investment and thereby strengthening the development of its private sector.
The Treaty is fully consistent with U.S. policy toward international and domestic investment. A specific tenet of U.S. policy, reflected in this Treaty, is that U.S. investment abroad and foreign investment in the United States should receive national treatment. Under this Treaty, the Parties also agree to customary international law standards for expropriation. The Treaty includes detailed provisions regarding the computation and payment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation for expropriation; free transfer of funds related to investments; freedom of investments from specified performance requirements; fair, equitable, and most-favored-nation treatment; and the investor's freedom to choose to resolve disputes with the host government through international arbitration.
I recommend that the Senate consider this Treaty as soon as possible, and give its advice and consent to ratification of the Treaty at an early date.
