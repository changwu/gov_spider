Boston, MA â€“ Today, Staples Founder Thomas Stemberg released the following statement regarding Governor Romney's record of growing businesses and creating jobs:
"At this critical time for our economy, the United States needs a leader in Washington who actually has a record in the private sector of creating jobs. That leader is Mitt Romney. He knows what it takes to create jobs because he has done it time and time again. As a businessman, Governor Romney took a chance and invested in the first Staples store. Today, tens of thousands of Staples employees across this country have jobs because of that decision. That's a clear record of action that Mitt Romney repeated time after time. Washington needs leaders who can do more than just talk about creating jobs."
