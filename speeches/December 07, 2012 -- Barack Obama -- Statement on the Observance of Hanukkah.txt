    Michelle and I send our warmest wishes to all those celebrating Hanukkah around the world. This Hanukkah season, we remember the powerful story of the Maccabees, who rose up to liberate their people from oppression. Upon discovering the desecration of their temple, the believers found only enough oil to light the lamp for one night. And yet it lasted for eight.
Hanukkah is a time to celebrate the faith and customs of the Jewish people, but it is also an opportunity for people of all faiths to recognize the common aspirations we share. This holiday season, let us give thanks for the blessings we enjoy and remain mindful of those who are suffering. And let us reaffirm our commitment to building a better, more complete world for all.
From our family to the Jewish community around the world, Chag sameach.
