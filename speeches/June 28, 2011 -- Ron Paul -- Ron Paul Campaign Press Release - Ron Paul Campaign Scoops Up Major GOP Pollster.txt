LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” The campaign of 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul has scored a major coup with the hiring on of heavyweight GOP pollster Fritz Wenzel, and his polling firm Wenzel Strategies to run its polling operations.
"I am very proud and excited to be a part of the Ron Paul presidential team," Wenzel said. "He has long stood strong for the core principles that have made our country great, and have made the Republican Party great when they heeded them."
"What makes Ron Paul such a strong candidate is his willingness to stand on principle, which has attracted more people to his message, to the point that the other candidates are now taking up his issues. At a time when our country is in great peril, voters are looking for a candidate who will turn to and rely on the wisdom of the Constitution, and there is no better student of that document than Ron Paul," Wenzel continued.
