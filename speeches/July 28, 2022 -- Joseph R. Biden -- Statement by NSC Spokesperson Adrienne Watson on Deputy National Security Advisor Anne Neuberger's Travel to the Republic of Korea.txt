    Deputy National Security Advisory for Cyber and Emerging Technologies Anne Neuberger traveled to the Republic of Korea (ROK) July 25-27 to deepen U.S.-ROK Alliance cooperation on cyber related issues. DNSA Neuberger's trip follows up on President Biden's joint commitment with President Yoon during his trip to the ROK in May to expand our bilateral cooperation on regional and international cyber issues and confront cyber threats, including from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
During her meetings with Korean counterparts, DNSA Neuberger highlighted the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to working with our partners to secure critical infrastructure and government systems; prepare for cyber incidents; reinforce respect for international law and norms of responsible behavior; and cooperate to deter disruptive and destabilizing cyber activity. She also highlighted the U.S. commitment to cooperation with the ROK to combat cybercrime and associated money laundering, secure cryptocurrency, build capacity, and share information.
