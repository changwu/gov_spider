    The President has established, effective August 10, 2004, a second Presidential Emergency Board to investigate and to make recommendations for settlement of the current dispute between the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority and its Conductors represented by the United Transportation Union.
Previously, by Executive Order 13334, the President established an Emergency Board for this dispute (effective April 12, 2004), at the request of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. On May 11, 2004, the Emergency Board terminated after reporting its findings and recommendations for settlement to the President. Subsequently, its recommendations were not accepted by the parties.
The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority has requested that the President establish a second Emergency Board to investigate and report on the dispute. The second Emergency Board will report its recommendations for settlement to the President within 60 days of its creation.
