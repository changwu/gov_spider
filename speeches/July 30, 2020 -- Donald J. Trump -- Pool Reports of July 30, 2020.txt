 In-town pool #1 — Greetings 
Hello from the White House, where it is mostly sunny and in the high 80s.
I'll be your pooler today. I was tested with the rest of the restricted pool for COVID-19 at call time, and they say no news is good news.
No changes to the schedule at this point.
The president will stop at the American Red Cross National HQ in DC at 2:45 p.m. for a tour and to talk about donating plasma.
The https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44f... website says the roundtable portion will be live-streamed, so will be sending off-camera details from tour, highlights, etc.

Trump:Saw reports on killing"It hit me very hard."Says Vanessa was spectacular person.Says DOJ involved‘We didn't want this to be swept under the rug."
Lawyer: says there aren't enough protections for victims of harassmentSays problem is widespread; retaliation happens after reportingSays Guillen may have been bludgeoned to death, carried body out to river
Trump: ‘And nobody saw this?'
Lawyer says it sounds akin to ISIS killingSays not enough transparency, need reform; praises Rep. Markwayne Mullin for bill, allows reporting to third party instead of chain of command‘Vanessa could have reported' and suspect's record pulled up"It's hard to go to the boss"
Another member, believe a sister, says Army should have shown more respect"She was afraid of retaliation""We need a change and we need a positive change"

President Trump joins the Nation in thanking and honoring the American Red Cross for their tireless work.
