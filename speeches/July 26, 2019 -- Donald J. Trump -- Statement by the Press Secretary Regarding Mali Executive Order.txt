    Today, President Donald J. Trump took action to combat the worsening situation in Mali. Despite the 2015 Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation, terrorist activities have expanded into southern and central Mali. Malign activities such as drug trafficking, hostage taking, attacks against civilians, and attacks against United Nations (UN) Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) personnel have intensified and made this the most dangerous UN Peacekeeping mission in the world. Despite the urgent need to address the underlying causes of the conflict, insufficient action has been taken and little progress has been made. Instead, the conflicting parties have taken steps to perpetuate the status quo.
With his action today, President Trump has provided the Department of the Treasury, in consultation with the Department of State, the authorities to sanction individuals who are responsible for or complicit in actions that exacerbate the deteriorating situation in Mali. This includes those who threaten the peace and undermine Mali's democratic processes or otherwise obstruct implementation of the 2015 Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation. By taking this action, President Trump is ensuring all tools of national power are employed to promote resolution of the conflict in Mali and to hold accountable those persons who have committed acts of violence or engaged in other crimes that have prolonged the conflict, causing the Malian people undue suffering.
