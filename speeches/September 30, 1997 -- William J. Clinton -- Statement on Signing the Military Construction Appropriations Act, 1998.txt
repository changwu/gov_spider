    I have today signed into law H.R. 2016, the "Military Construction Appropriations Act, 1998," which provides funding for military construction and family housing programs of the Department of Defense.
The Act funds the vast majority of my request for military construction projects, the military family housing program, other quality-of-life projects for our military personnel and their families, and the base closure and realignment program.
I am concerned, however, that the Congress has chosen to add funds for projects that the Department has not identified as priorities.
I urge the Congress to complete action on the remaining FY 1998 appropriations bills as quickly as possible, and to send them to me in an acceptable form.
