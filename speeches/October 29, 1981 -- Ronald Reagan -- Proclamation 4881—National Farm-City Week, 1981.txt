  A Proclamation

American agriculture is a modern-day miracle. In the last 30 years, United States farmers have increased productivity by 50 percent. Now, fewer than 4 percent of our population provides our Nation's agricultural products—and enough more to feed millions of people overseas.
The trust, reliance, and interdependence of farms and cities is a basic strength of this great Nation. Farm and city people have long been partners in economic and social progress. Without farms to provide food and fiber, cities would be barren; without the products and services of cities, farms would be primitive.
A close partnership between farm and city people in the productive use of land, labor, and capital is paramount if our Nation is to continue to have an abundance of safe, wholesome food as well as an abundance of goods and services at reasonable prices.
To achieve a deeper appreciation of the contributions and cooperation of farms and cities, the Nation has set aside a week in November as National Farm-City Week. The theme is: Partners in Progress—Key to the Future.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period November 20 through November 26, 1981, as National Farm-City Week.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 29th day of Oct. in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.

RONALD REAGAN
