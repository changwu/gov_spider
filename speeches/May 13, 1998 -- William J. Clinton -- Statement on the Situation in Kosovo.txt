    I welcome the news that President Milosevic and Dr. Ibrahim Rugova will meet on May 15 in Belgrade to initiate a dialog without preconditions.
As Ambassadors Holbrooke and Gelbard announced earlier today, the parties have also agreed to continue this dialog in a series of talks in Pristina.
This is a sober first step towards resolving a very dangerous conflict that clearly has the potential to spill over into neighboring countries and destabilize the region.
There is a great deal more to be done, however, before all the peoples of Kosovo enjoy the peace, security, and human rights they deserve. The parties face a complex challenge, but success is up to them. We expect each to make good their commitment to serious and productive dialog.
We should be mindful of the difficult road ahead, but we are encouraged to see this process underway.
