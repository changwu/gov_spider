    The President has signed an Executive order taking effect at 11:59 p.m. today to implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 748 by imposing additional sanctions on Libya. The Executive order bars any aircraft from landing in, taking off from, or overflying the United States as part of or a continuation of a flight to or from Libya. This prohibition covers legs or continuations of flights as well as direct flights. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and other Cabinet and senior administration officials, has primary responsibility for implementing this new ban.
This prohibition is in addition to the comprehensive embargo on U.S. exports to and imports from Libya adopted pursuant to Executive Order No. 12543, January 7, 1986. Taken together with the preexisting embargo, today's Executive order puts the United States in full compliance with U.N. Security Council Resolution 748.
