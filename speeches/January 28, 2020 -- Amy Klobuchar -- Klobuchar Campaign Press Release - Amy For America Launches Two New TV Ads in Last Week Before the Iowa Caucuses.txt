    "99" and "It's About You" Will Air in Iowa Ahead of the February 3 Caucuses
DES MOINES, IA â€” Amy For America announced two final television ads set to begin airing in Iowa today through the Iowa Caucuses on Monday, February 3.
"99" and "It's About You" are backed by a six-figure ad buy and will run statewide in Iowa in the final days leading up to the caucuses.
"99" touts Klobuchar's status as the only candidate to qualify for all of the Democratic debates who has visited each of Iowa's 99 counties. "It's About You" highlights how her agenda will lift up working families and how she will take on Donald Trump in November as the Democratic nominee for President.
Klobuchar has the support of 17 sitting members of the Iowa Legislature, more than any other candidate in the field. Her most recent endorsement came on January 26 from State Representative Ross Wilburn, who previously supported Sen. Kamala Harris.

KLOBUCHAR: We have a President who thinks everything is about him. His tweets, his golf courses, his ego. But I think the job is about you. Your healthcare, your schools, your security, your families, and your future. I'm Amy Klobuchar. I'll be a President and a commander-in-chief who restores decency to the White House and gets things done for you. That's why I approve this message.
