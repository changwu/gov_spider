HOUSTON, Texas — The Cruz for President campaign today released a 30-second TV spot called 'Values' that will appear on Fox News Channel in the Des Moines area starting today, leading up to his Rally for Religious Liberty on August 21st.
The spot comes on the heels of Sen. Cruz's robust debate performance and a new NBC poll showing a surge of seven points, ranking him second place among other GOP candidates. It highlights Sen. Cruz's commitment to upholding American values, specifically his continued leadership in calling for the defunding and prosecution of Planned Parenthood's corrupt practices of allegedly selling the body parts of aborted babies.


The Rally for Religious Liberty will be held at the Iowa Events Center Grand Ballroom at 730 3rd Street in Des Moines, Iowa on August 21. The headliners are Dick and Betty Odgaard, the Iowa couple who recently had to shut down their business as a result of the state's efforts to force them to host a same-sex wedding ceremony in violation of their religious beliefs. Doors open at 5:30 p.m. This event is open to the press. To RSVP go to www.tedcruz.org/rsvp/rally.
