    Dr. Eckener:
It gives me great satisfaction personally to congratulate you upon this noteworthy attainment. It shows that the spirit of high adventure still lives. Its success has been due to the eminent scientific and engineering abilities of the German people, translated by your own skill and courage. You have already witnessed the universal appreciation of the American [p.272] people of your accomplishment. You have given a most valuable service to aviation; you have added to the luster of your countrymen and you have lifted the spirits of men with renewed confidence in human progress.
