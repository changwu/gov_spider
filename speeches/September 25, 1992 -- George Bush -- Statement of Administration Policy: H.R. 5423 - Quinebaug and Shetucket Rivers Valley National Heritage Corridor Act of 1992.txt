    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Gejdenson (D) CT and 4 others)
The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5423, which would establish the 600-square-mile Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor (the Corridor).
First, the Corridor has not met the finding of "national significance" that is required to qualify it for status as an "affiliated area" of the National Park System. Second, the National Park Service is currently reviewing its involvement in heritage areas. Its process of review and the development of workable alternatives would not be helped by the designation of another heritage corridor at this time. Third, the bill establishes a 19-member Corridor Commission to assist in the development and implementation of a resource management plan for the area. The Commission would exercise significant Executive authority. However, the Commission would have to include certain Connecticut State officials and members of specified interest groups. By circumscribing the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior to appoint the Commission's members, the bill violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution.
