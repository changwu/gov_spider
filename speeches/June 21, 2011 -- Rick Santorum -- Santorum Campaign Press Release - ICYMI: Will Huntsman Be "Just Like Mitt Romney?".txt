Verona, PA - Today former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) released a new web ad questioning whether newly announced Republican Presidential Candidate Ambassador Jon Huntsman would stand in support of those who cannot defend themselves, or whether he would follow Governor Mitt Romney and abandon the unborn by refusing to sign the Susan B. Anthony List's Pro-Life Pledge.
As reported by outlets ranging from POLITICO to Vanity Fair, Senator Santorum's new ad parodies Ambassador Huntsman's much maligned media rollout to his announcement this morning. To watch Senator Santorum's ad: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov_wKKB4W88
"We certainly hope that Governor Romney will reconsider his decision not to sign and encourage Ambassador Huntsman to stand up and be counted on this important pro-life pledge," said National Political Director Mike Biundo. "Being pro-life is about more than just rhetoric, it's about consistency and it's about action. And above all, it's about fighting to help protect those who can't protect themselves."
