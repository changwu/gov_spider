    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Not sent per PAD-NRES and LA guidance) Murr 7/14/89
(House)(Wilson (D) TX and 4 others)
The Administration opposes the enactment of H.R. 919. The bill's proposed additions to the Big Thicket National Preserve, at an estimated cost of $28,000,000, are not required to protect the Preserve's resources. Current Federal policy emphasizes the use of limited land acquisition funds for acquiring lands within existing National Park boundaries. Moreover, to the extent the proposed additions would be accomplished through the bill's land exchange authority, it would result in a reduction of multiple-use National Forest System land. This would result in local job losses and lower local and Federal revenue because of diminished commercial timber activity.
