    SAN FRANCISCO, CA—Tulsi Gabbard, Hawaii congresswoman and presidential candidate, visited the Bay Area this morning and hosted a town hall at San Francisco University. She shared her experience serving as a soldier in the Army National Guard, being deployed twice to the Middle East, and serving in Congress for more than six years on the House Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committees.
Tulsi explained that as commander in chief, she will end wasteful regime change war policies, work to end the new Cold War and nuclear arms race, and take the trillions of dollars spent on those wars to instead serve the needs of our people—ensuring healthcare for all, fixing our crumbling infrastructure, protecting our environment, and so much more.
Tulsi Gabbard will be hosting a town hall and meet and greets in Fremont tomorrow, followed by visits to Nevada and New Hampshire next week.
