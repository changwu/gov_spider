    I am deeply pleased by today's vote in the Senate, and I want to express my thanks to those who voted for aid to the freedom fighters. The Senate's action is sure to send a profoundly reassuring signal to those fighting for freedom in Nicaragua and to Nicaragua's threatened neighbors. It helps to demonstrate that it is indeed possible to forge democracy and stability in our hemisphere.
Now the issue returns to the House, where I hope we can garner the few additional votes necessary to achieve a positive outcome. I urge those Members of the House who were not with us last week to cast a positive vote for freedom and for the national security interests of the United States.
