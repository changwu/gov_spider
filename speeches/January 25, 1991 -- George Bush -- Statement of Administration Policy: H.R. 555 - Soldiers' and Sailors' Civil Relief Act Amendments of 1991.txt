    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Rep. Montgomery (D) MS)
On January 25, 1991, the Administration transmitted to Congress a draft legislative proposal, "To amend the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940." That proposal would address the concerns of Reserve Forces activated for Operation Desert Shield/Storm. It would provide Reservists on active duty with protection in court proceedings and protection from adverse action by creditors. It would also protect their dependents from eviction. In addition, the Administration supports providing professional liability protection for certain military personnel.
H.R. 555 has the same goals as the Administration's proposal. The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 555.
