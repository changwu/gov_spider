    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Clinger (R) Pennsylvania and Kostmayer (D) Pennsylvania)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 1323, as reported by the House Interior Committee. The responsibility for administration of the segment of the Allegheny River which is downstream from the Allegheny National Forest boundary should be shifted from the Secretary of Agriculture to the State of Pennsylvania. If the downstream segment were to be administered by the Forest Service, the only method available for enforcement of the management plan would be land acquisition. This method is unnecessarily intrusive and costly. Encouraging State and local governments to manage the non-federal river segment through development and enforcement of land use regulations is a much better alternative. Accordingly, the Administration will seek amendments in the Senate which provide for "State administration" of this section of the Allegheny River.
