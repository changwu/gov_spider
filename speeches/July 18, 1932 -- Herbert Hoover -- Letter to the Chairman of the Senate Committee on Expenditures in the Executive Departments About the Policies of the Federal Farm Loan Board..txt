My dear Mr. Senator:
Last October, in a desire to have the Federal Land Banks function in a thoroughly humane and constructive fashion with relation to our farmers, I took up with the Farm Loan Board in Washington the whole question of the policies of the Board in respect to farmers who might be in difficulty.
Although I have no authority over the policies of the Board, I felt that, as I was about to recommend to the Congress the furnishing of $125,000,000 to the Farm Loan Banks for the purpose of enabling them to treat the farmers who were indebted to them with proper consideration in these times and to strengthen their situation both in loans and to their bondholders, I had a right to some understanding from them as to what policies they would pursue in case I made such a recommendation to the Congress.
The Farm Loan Board was most sympathetic in the entire matter and, as the result of our discussions, the enclosed letter was drafted by myself and the Chairman of the Board and sent to each of the banks. Responses were obtained that they would pursue these policies.
You will recognize that the banks must go through certain forms in cases of delinquencies to determine the cases honestly requiring relief but perhaps our farmers who are in difficulty do not realize the sympathetic view and the endeavor we are making in their interest in these times.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
