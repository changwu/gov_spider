Republican voters remember Ronald Reagan so fondly because he ran optimistic, winning campaigns that focused on forward-thinking ideas.
One Iowa caucus goer thinks we have a candidate who can pick up Reagan's legacy: Marco Rubio.

Here's what he had to say:
Senator, I just want to comment on the commercials that have been running on your behalf that I have been watching on television. I want to thank you for them. They are positive, and they are expressing an American vision, and a New American Century, and I think that's something that's sorely needed to be states.
I haven't heard anyone speak like that who is running for President since Ronald Reagan in 1980, and I want to thank you for that.
It's not just Iowa voters who see the resemblance â€” when he announced his support for Marco, Trey Gowdy said he sees Marco as a new Reagan, too.
Marco wrapped up a two-day bus tour in Iowa last week, making his case for ideas that will address the concerns Americans have in the 21st Century.
