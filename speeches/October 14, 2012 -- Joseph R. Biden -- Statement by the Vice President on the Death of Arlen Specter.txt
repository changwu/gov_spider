    Jill and I are deeply saddened. Arlen Specter was a great Senator who lived his life the way he died, with dignity and courage. He was my friend and I admired him a great deal.
For over three decades, I watched his political courage accomplish great feats and was awed by his physical courage to never give up. Arlen never walked away from his principles and was at his best when they were challenged.
Jill and I are thinking of Joan at the moment â€“ she was an incredible partner through his life journey. Our hearts go out to Shanin and Stephen and all who were deeply touched by his life.
