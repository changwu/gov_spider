    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the terrible crash landing of American Airlines Flight 1420 at Little Rock National Airport late last night. We join the American people in extending our deepest sympathies to the families of those who died or were injured.
Our Government is doing everything possible to aid the victims and help determine the cause of this tragedy. Family assistance counselors and other personnel from the National Transportation Safety Board are already on the ground in Little Rock, and FAA inspectors are assisting the NTSB. I have asked my staff to update me on our efforts throughout the day. I ask all Americans to remember in their prayers the passengers and their families.
