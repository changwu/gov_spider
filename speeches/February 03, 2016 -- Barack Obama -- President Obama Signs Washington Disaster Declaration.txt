Federal funding also is available to state, tribal, and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe winter storm, straight-line winds, flooding, landslides, mudslides, and a tornado in the counties of Clallam, Clark, Cowlitz, Grays Harbor, Jefferson, Lewis, Mason, Pacific, Skamania, and Wahkiakum.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
