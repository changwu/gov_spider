    I commend the Congress for responding with bipartisan cooperation and speed to my request for supplemental war funding. The House and Senate took strong and decisive action to provide our troops with the resources necessary to fight and win the war in Iraq, to respond to increased homeland security needs, and to strengthen the capabilities of our allies. As the bills go to conference, we will seek to combine the best elements of the House and Senate bills to help ensure that the final legislation includes both the funding and flexibility necessary to respond quickly and effectively to any changing needs at home and abroad.
