    On behalf of all the American people, I salute your triumphant adventure. Your daring voyage through the silent sky is a welcome reminder that individual acts of bravery and skill still capture our collective imagination.
I wish to invite you to visit with me in the White House once you've returned to this country.
We all celebrate your magnificent achievement and welcome you warmly back to the earth.
JIMMY CARTER
