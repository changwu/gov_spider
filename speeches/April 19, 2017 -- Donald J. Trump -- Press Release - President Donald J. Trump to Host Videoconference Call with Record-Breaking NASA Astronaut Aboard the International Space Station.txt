    (Washington, D.C.) On Monday, April 24th, at 10 a.m. ET, President Donald J. Trump will host a videoconference call from the Oval Office with NASA astronauts Peggy Whitson and Jack Fischer, who are currently orbiting the Earth aboard the International Space Station.
On Monday, Dr. Whitson will break the record for the most cumulative days in space of any American astronaut. The President looks forward to personally congratulating her and NASA on this incredible accomplishment, and to thanking her and Mr. Fischer for their service to our country in the cause of exploration and discovery.
The President will be joined in the Oval Office by his daughter, Ivanka, and NASA astronaut Kate Rubins.
After congratulating Dr. Whitson, the group will have a 20-minute conversation about life aboard the International Space Station, NASA's mission, and the importance of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education. In addition to signing the NASA Transition Authorization Act, the President also recently signed the INSPIRE Women Act, which ensures that NASA will continue recruiting women for important STEM-related jobs in aerospace.
The President's call will be live streamed to the public on White House and NASA online platforms.
The White House, NASA, and the Department of Education are working closely together to encourage students across the country to tune in live to this historic event. The Department of Education will also be making available educational tools for voluntary use by teachers to engage students in what promises to be a fascinating conversation between the President of the United States and two American heroes orbiting 220 miles above the Earth.
