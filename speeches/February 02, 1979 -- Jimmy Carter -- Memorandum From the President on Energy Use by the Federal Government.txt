    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesSubject: Reduction of Energy Use by the Federal Government
Because of the world shortfall in oil production resulting from the Iranian situation, 'I am directing that executive departments and establishments take immediate steps to reduce the use of petroleum fuels. For this purpose, all agency heads should establish goals, prepare plans and issue necessary instructions to implement them. The specific actions that agency heads can take include, but are not limited to, the following:
• Lowering thermostat settings in Federally owned and operated buildings to not more than 65 degrees during the day and 55 degrees during the night.
• Reducing electrical use generally throughout agency activities, particularly lighting.
• Reducing petroleum use by eliminating unnecessary activities and vehicle trips and combining and consolidating the essential ones.
• Reducing agency activities that use large amounts of energy and could be deferred, such as research and experimental activities that involve the use of highly energy intensive equipment.
In addition, I urge all agency heads aggressively to pursue employee awareness programs on energy conservation, and to promote employee use of carpools and mass transit.
Agency heads should submit their goals and instructions for implementation to the Secretary of Energy by February 15, 1979. Agencies which currently submit quarterly reports on energy consumption to the Department of Energy should include in their FY 1979 second quarter report a statement showing energy savings accomplished from this special effort.
Department of Defense operational readiness activities are exempt from this directive.
