    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Hatch (R) UT and 55 others)
The President is deeply committed to protection of the United States flag, and will continue to condemn those who would show it any form of disrespect. The Administration believes, however, that efforts to limit the Bill of Rights to make a narrow exception for flag desecration are misguided. The Congress should be deeply reluctant, to tamper with the Bill of Rights, which has never been amended since it was adopted over two hundred years ago.
