    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Subject: 2005 Combined Federal Campaign
The Secretary of Transportation, Norman Y. Mineta, has agreed to serve as the Chair of the 2005 Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area (CFC-NCA). I ask you to enthusiastically support the CFC by personally chairing the campaign in your agency and by encouraging top agency officials around the country to do the same.
The Combined Federal Campaign is an important way for Federal employees to support thousands of worthy charities. Public servants not only contribute to the campaign but also assume leadership roles to ensure its success.
Your personal support and enthusiasm will help positively influence thousands of employees and will result in another successful campaign.
GEORGE W. BUSH
