    Iowa Governor Terry Branstad made the following statement on President Obama's visit to Iowa:
"President Obama is back in Iowa, and we are hearing the same lofty rhetoric and the same promises of hope and change we heard four years ago. But the President has had a chance to keep his promises, and so far all we have to show for them is disappointment. President Obama hasn't kept his promise to bring down the deficit; it's exploded on his watch. He hasn't kept his promise to develop domestic energy sources; he's kept America's energy wealth locked in the ground. He hasn't kept his promise to create more jobs; Americans are stuck with unemployment over 8 percent for the longest stretch since the Great Depression. The President might wish that we forgot his promises, but we here in Iowa haven't forgotten. In November, the people of Iowa will vote based on his record, not his rhetoric."
