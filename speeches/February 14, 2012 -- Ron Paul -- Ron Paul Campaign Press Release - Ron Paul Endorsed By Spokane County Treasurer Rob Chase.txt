BELLEVUE, Washington â€” 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul was endorsed today by Spokane County Treasurer Rob Chase.
Spokane County is the fourth most populous in the state, with the city of Spokane being the second most populous in the state, comprising over 600,000 Washingtonians in the metro area.
In making public his endorsement, Mr. Chase issued the following statement.
"It is customary that just before a great nation collapses God will send a prophet who implores the people to turn back before it is too late. Today America's modern day prophet is Rep. Ron Paul from Texas. I endorse Ron Paul because he is the one Presidential contender who can lead us back to the America that was meant to be.
"The message of Ron Paul is one of liberty and we need liberty to live meaningful lives. We are on the brink of losing liberty for ourselves and our children. Therefore, I heartily endorse Ron Paul for President."
Mr. Chase was elected Spokane County Treasurer in 2011, an office providing service to about 80 regional governmental entities such as county, transit, school, fire, cemetery, airport, water, and more according to the Spokane County website.
Mr. Chase is a current Republican Precinct Committee Officer, former candidate for State Legislature in 2000, and former candidate for U.S. Congress in 2002. He holds a bachelor's degree from Eastern Washington University and he and his wife of 31 years have four children.
