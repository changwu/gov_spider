    Philadelphia Debate
While her rivals abandoned the politics of hope and launched one attack after another, Hillary demonstrated why she has the strength and experience to deliver the change America needs.
Barack Obama and John Edwards relentlessly attacked Hillary for two hours at tonight's debate in Philadelphia, but scored no points.
Hillary took the best they had, rose above it, and came out on top.
Hillary continued to show her deep understanding of the issues and outlined her positive vision for America.
On Iran, she emphasized that we need to prevent President Bush's rush to war but must engage in aggressive diplomacy to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Hillary was among the very first Senators to speak out and make clear that George Bush does not have the authority to go to war in Iran, and is a co-sponsor of legislation to prevent him from doing so.
On Iraq, she talked about getting our troops home in the smartest, safest way we can. She made it crystal clear that if George Bush won't end this war before he leaves office, as President, she will.
At home she detailed her plans to offer quality, affordable health care to every American, move the nation toward energy independence and protect Social Security by restoring fiscal responsibility.
Tonight, Americans were reminded why poll after poll show that voters believe Hillary has the best combination of strength and experience to be President.
Despite repeated attacks from Obama and Edwards, Hillary leaves tonight's debate in a position of strength. A Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg poll out last week shows her leading the primary by 31 points, and beating all of the Republicans in head-to-head general election matchups. And a recent CBS News poll showed Hillary surging to a 28-point lead.
