    Warm greetings to everyone observing the Chinese New Year as you welcome 4694, the Year of the Rat.
This ancient annual festival unites people of Chinese heritage across America and around the globe in a joyous celebration of hope and new beginnings. Family and friends gather to renew the bonds of love and to rejoice in the rich cultural traditions of the Chinese people. The sorrows and mistakes of the past year dissolve in a flurry of fireworks, dancing, feasting, and the exchange of gifts.
The Chinese New Year is a fitting occasion for us to reflect on the many contributions that Chinese Americans have brought to our national lifeâ€”among them a respect for family, a reverence for knowledge, and an unwavering determination to make tomorrow better than today. Let us rejoice together in this season of renewal and resolve to work for a future of harmony and prosperity for us all.
Best wishes for a new year of happiness, health, freedom, and peace.
BILL CLINTON
