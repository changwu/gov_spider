    Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Cinco de Mayo.
Each year the Fifth of May reminds us of the blessings of our nation's rich cultural diversity. The Mexican people have made profound and lasting contributions to our society, enriching our national life with the values of family, faith, and love of country.
In commemorating the victory of Mexico's army at the Battle of Puebla, we rededicate ourselves to strengthening the bonds of friendship and partnership between the peoples of Mexico and the United States. Our nations share a legacy of independence and courage in the face of adversity, and each time we celebrate Cinco de Mayo, we reaffirm our reverence for these ideals.
Hillary and I send best wishes to all for a wonderful holiday.
BILL CLINTON
