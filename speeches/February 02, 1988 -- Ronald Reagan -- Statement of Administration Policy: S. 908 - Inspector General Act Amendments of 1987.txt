    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Glenn (D) Ohio and 14 others)
The Administration would not object to S. 908 if it is amended consistent with the understanding reached between the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee and the Department of the Treasury concerning the creation of statutory Inspectors General at the Department. Unless this amendment is adopted in its entirety, however, the President's senior advisers would recommend the disapproval of the bill.
