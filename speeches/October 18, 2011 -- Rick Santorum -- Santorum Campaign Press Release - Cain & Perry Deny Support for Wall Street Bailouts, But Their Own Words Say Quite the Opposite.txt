    Verona, PA - At the Las Vegas CNN Republican Presidential Debate, former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) called out the flip-flopping of both Governor Rick Perry (R-TX) and Herman Cain (R-GA) on their support of the 2008 Wall Street Bailouts.
While both Governor Perry and Mr. Cain suggest they did not support TARP/Wall Street Bailout, their words either during the 2008 congressional debate or immediately following the 2008 congressional debate speak to the contrary.
