Iowa is home to more than 88,000 farms, and unless it is stopped, unaccountable bureaucrats will soon have far-reaching control over bodies of water on many of them. This rule will force farmers and ranchers to spend time and money complying with confusing and costly permits, instead of expanding and creating jobs.
In the Senate, I'm proud to have supported efforts to stop the devastating Waters of the U.S. rule. As president, I'll hold regulators accountable and ensure that we grow the economy, not the power of the federal government at the expense of our nation's vibrant agricultural sector.
