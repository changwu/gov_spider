    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. de la Garza (D) Texas and five others)
The Administration opposes House enactment of H.R. 4084, because it includes a provision changing the base period for wheat and feed grain programs, which would unnecessarily increase the cost of the recently enacted Farm Bill. The Administration would support legislation which would make the "cross compliance" provision of the Farm Bill discretionary for the 1986 crops.
