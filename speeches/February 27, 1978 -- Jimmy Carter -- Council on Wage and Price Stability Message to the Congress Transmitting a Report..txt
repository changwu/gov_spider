    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with Section 5 of the Council on Wage and Price Stability Act, as amended, I hereby transmit to the Congress the twelfth quarterly report of the Council on Wage and Price Stability. This report contains a description of the Council's activities during the third quarter of 1977 in monitoring both prices and wages in the private sector and various Federal Government activities that may lead to higher costs and prices without creating commensurate benefits. It discusses Council reports, analyses, and filings before Federal regulatory agencies.
In August 1977 I asked the Council to undertake an in-depth study of the Nation's steel industry. The study was released in October and served as an important information base in the Administration's development of its reference price system for imports of foreign steel.
Also in the third quarter, at the request of Secretary of HUD Patricia Roberts Harris, the Council accelerated its study of lumber prices and the lumber products industry.
The Council on Wage and Price Stability will continue to play an important role in supplementing fiscal and monetary policies by calling public attention to wage and price developments or actions by the Government that could be of concern to American consumers.
