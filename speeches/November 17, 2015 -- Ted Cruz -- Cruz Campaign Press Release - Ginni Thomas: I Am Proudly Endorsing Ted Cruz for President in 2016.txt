HOUSTON, Texas â€“ Today, the Cruz for President campaign announced that Ted Cruz has received the endorsement of Virginia "Ginni" Thomas, a longtime activist for conservative causes. Thomas has served as a top congressional advisor, a senior political appointee at the U.S. Department of Labor, and a senior executive with The Heritage Foundation. Her popular video series at the Daily Caller News Foundation focuses on conservative leaders who are breaking through in today's politics. Thomas said Cruz has leadership skills America needs to move forward.


"I am looking for the kind of person who will be the leader of the free world," Thomas said in an endorsement video. "Someone who has a North Star; someone who is a principled, experienced conservative. And Ted Cruz has got the scars to show he has tangled with the top Republican leaders and Democrats leaders in town...Rhetoric and promise on the campaign trail are not enough."
"You have to say Ted Cruz is a leader. And he is distinguishing himself as somebody who can make things happen and excite the country to bring us back on course," Thomas added. "That's why I have finally decided it is time to endorse a candidate. And I am proudly endorsing Ted Cruz for president in 2016."
Previously, Thomas also served as the Washington representative for Hillsdale College, and an advocate for free enterprise with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Since 2010, she has been an advocate for conservatives and a conservative media talent.
