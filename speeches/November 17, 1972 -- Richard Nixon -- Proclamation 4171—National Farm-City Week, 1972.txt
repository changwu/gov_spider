  A Proclamation

The breadwinners of our national family—those whose hard work helps to provide the rest of us with food to eat and clothes to wear—are America's nearly 3 million farmers.
American agriculture leads our own economy and the world in productivity. The bounty of our farms is an indispensable element in the steadily rising standard of living for our cities—indeed for every American community large or small. This is the strong bond of interdependence and mutual benefit which links farm people to city people throughout this country, and to peoples in other countries all over the globe, wherever the agricultural exports of our heartland alleviate hunger and so promote the cause of peace.
National Farm-City Week is an occasion for wider recognition of this interdependence and for new efforts to increase cooperation between farm and city people. It is a time for renewal of our commitment to balanced national growth and to assuring the farmer of a fair share in the national prosperity to which he contributes so much.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of November 17 through November 23, 1972, as National Farm-City Week. I encourage all citizens, especially leaders of agricultural organizations, business groups, labor unions, youth and women's clubs, schools, and other interested groups, to participate in this observance. I urge the Department of Agriculture, land-grant educational institutions, and all appropriate organizations and Government officials to mark the significance of National Farm-City Week with special events and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-seventh.

RICHARD NIXON
