    All Americans are shocked and saddened to learn of the shooting death of Maj. Arthur D. Nicholson, a U.S. Army officer assigned to the U.S. military liaison mission which serves as a point of contact for our government with Soviet forces in East Germany. The precise details are being investigated by our Embassy in East Germany, and we do not have full information, but it is clear that this violence was unjustified. We have protested this unwarranted act of violence and have asked Soviet authorities for a full explanation.
The Soviets have expressed their regret over Major Nicholson's death. We have no further comment at this time.
