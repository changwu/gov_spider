    MINNEAPOLIS, MN — Today, Senator Amy Klobuchar released a video from 109-year-old supporter Ruth Knelman. Born in 1910 — 10 years before women won the right to vote — Ruth has lived through 18 presidents and now wholeheartedly supports Senator Klobuchar's bid for the White House.
In the video, Ruth says, "There's one thing that would complete my life. If Amy was President and that she would invite me and a friend to the ceremony!" Ruth says she plans to be "around for a long time" and is ready to fly out for Klobuchar's inauguration.
On social media Klobuchar jokingly challenged her opponents in the Democratic field to top Ruth's endorsement. "Game on," she said.

Meet Ruth
My name is Ruth Knelman and I live in Minneapolis.
What year were you born, Ruth?
I was born in 1910 which makes me 109-years-old.
What's it like to be 109?
I don't feel it—I don't, really!
You've lived to see 18 Presidents! For you, what makes a good President?
18? My gosh. Be honest, upright citizen. Be truthful.
Do you think Amy would make a good President?
Amy—I tell you, we would really be in clover if she—oh! She is so, so wonderful for us—for people. Really.
What advice do you have for living a long life?
The worst thing in a person's life is stress. It really—that'll get you.
What's next for you, Ruth?
There's one thing that would complete my life. If Amy was President and that she would invite me and a friend to the ceremony! And wouldn't that be something? Oh! That would be the epitome, wouldn't it? Yeah, how many year—another year? Oh, well I'll be around. I'm going to be around for goodness sake. Going to be around for a long time, yeah!
