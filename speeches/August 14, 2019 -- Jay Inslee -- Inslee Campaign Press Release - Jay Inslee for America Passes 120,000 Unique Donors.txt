    Inslee continues to move rapidly toward the 130,000 donor threshold for the DNC's September and October debates
Seattle, WA â€“ Inslee for America has reached over 120,000 unique donors, just 10,000 short of the grassroots donor requirement to qualify for the DNC's September and October debates. Earlier this month, Inslee saw a surge in donors, breaking internal fundraising records following the second primary debate. Over the past two weeks since the debate, Inslee for America has received over 45,000 donations.
"The flood of grassroots-driven support for Jay Inslee's campaign sends a clear message: Democratic voters want climate to be front-and-center in this election," said Aisling Kerins, Inslee for America campaign manager. "Our momentum is a clear sign that the Democratic grassroots is fired up and ready for a President who will finally confront the fossil fuel industry to build the clean energy future we deserve. Hitting the grassroots debate threshold of 130,000 donors would be a major sign of strength for our climate movement."
