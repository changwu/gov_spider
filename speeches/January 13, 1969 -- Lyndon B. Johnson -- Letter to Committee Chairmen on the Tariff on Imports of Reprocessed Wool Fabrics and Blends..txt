    Dear Mr. Chairman:
On October 24, 1968, I signed H.R. 653, a bill which amended the tariff schedules of the United States to establish a uniform tariff on imports of re-processed wool fabrics or blends of such fabrics.
At the time of signing this bill, I indicated my concern that the tariff rate it established on these fabrics could result in a duty which was so high that it was not in the national interest. In an effort to avoid this undesirable result, I directed the Tariff Commission to study the effect of this legislation and make recommendations as to what simple ad valorem rate or rates of duty would provide a reasonable degree of tariff protection.
The Tariff Commission completed its work and reported to me on December 31. A majority of the Commission concluded that an ad valorem rate of 55% is equitable and will provide a reasonable degree of tariff protection for the U.S.. domestic industry.
Accordingly, I have today directed the Department of State to prepare and submit to you draft legislation amending H.R. 653 to reduce the duty on these fabrics to a 55% ad valorem rate. I urge you to introduce this legislation at the earliest practical date and give prompt consideration to it in the Committee. It is my hope that both Houses of the Congress will see fit to take favorable action on this measure.
Attached to this letter is a copy of my signing statement on H.R. 653 and the report of the Tariff Commission. I have today requested the Commission to make its report public.
Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
