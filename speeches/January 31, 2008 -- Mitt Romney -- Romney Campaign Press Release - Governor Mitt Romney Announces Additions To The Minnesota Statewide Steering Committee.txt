Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced the addition of four members of Senator Fred Thompson's steering committee who have now joined the Minnesota Romney for President Statewide Steering Committee. These members join the previously announced members of the committee in spreading Governor Romney's message of conservative change in Washington to the citizens of Minnesota.
"I am pleased to have these four individuals join my Minnesota team," said Governor Romney. "These people share in my vision of creating a stronger America through conservative principles such as low taxes and restrained government spending. Together we can create a stronger America for our future."
"Governor Romney's vision, values and experience make him the best choice for Minnesota voters," said Minnesota Steering Committee Co-Chairman Jack Meeks. "Governor Romney is the only candidate in the race who spent his life in the private sector learning how America, not Washington, DC, works. When the state of the economy is on the minds of many Minnesotans, Governor Romney is the candidate with the knowledge and experience to provide the ideas and leadership to ensure that America's economy remains the strongest in the world."
