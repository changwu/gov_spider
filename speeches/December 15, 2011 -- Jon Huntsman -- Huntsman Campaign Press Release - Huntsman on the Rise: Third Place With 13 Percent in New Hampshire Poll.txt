A new poll found Jon Huntsman with 13 percent support from likely Republican and independent voters surveyed in New Hampshire.
The 7News/Suffolk University poll released late Wednesday found Huntsman in third place among likely Republican and New Hampshire voters, trailing Mitt Romney (with 38 percent) and Newt Gingrich (with 20 percent). The survey's findings are the best yet for Huntsman in the Granite State. Previously, his best poll in New Hampshire showed him in fourth place at 11 percent, behind Romney, Gingrich and Ron Paul.
The poll also found that most New Hampshire voters hold a favorable view of the former Utah governor. Thirty-nine percent said in the poll that they have a favorable impression of Huntsman while 32 percent have either never heard of or are undecided on him and 29 percent hold an unfavorable view.
