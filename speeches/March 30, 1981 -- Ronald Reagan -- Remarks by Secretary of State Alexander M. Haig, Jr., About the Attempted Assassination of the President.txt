    Ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to touch upon a few matters associated with today's tragedy. First, as you know, we are in close touch with the Vice President, who is returning to Washington. We have in the Situation Room all of the officials of the Cabinet who should be here and ready at this time.
We have informed our friends abroad of the situation, the President's condition as we know itâ€”stable, now undergoing surgery. And there are absolutely no alert measures that are necessary at this time or contemplated.
