    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report a new Department of Commerce deferral of Maritime Administration funds totalling $122 million in budget authority and a new deferral of $0.4 million in outlays for the Antirecession financial assistance fund in the Department of the Treasury.
In addition, I am reporting routine revisions to two previously transmitted deferrals. A Department of the Interior deferral is increased by $2 million in budget authority, and a Department of the Treasury deferral is increased by $4.1 million in outlays.
The details of each deferral are contained in the attached reports.
