    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Conyers (D) MI)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 1926, but has serious concerns about the national security and budget provisions, which would interfere with the role and responsibilities of the President and Cabinet officers. These provisions are unnecessary to the effectiveness of ONDCP.
The Administration will work with Congress to address its concerns prior to enactment.
