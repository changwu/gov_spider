Annex 1Fostering Cooperation and Reducing Regulatory Burdens

Take the following steps to reduce barriers to transatlantic economic integration posed by new regulations by reinforcing the existing transatlantic dialogue structures:

Pursue development of a methodological framework to help ensure the comparability of impact assessments, particularly risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis;
Appoint heads of regulatory authorities as permanent members of the U.S. - EU High-Level Regulatory Cooperation Forum to report on any risks or benefits from significant differences in regulatory approaches identified in the sectoral dialogues or the European Commission Secretariat General (EC)-U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) dialogue called for under the 2005 U.S.-EU Economic Initiative, recognizing that the Financial Markets Regulatory Dialogue will continue its own, separate, work program described in Annex 6, and updating the Council on its progress as appropriate.
Reinforce the existing transatlantic dialogue on regulatory cooperation by cooperating to improve regulation, specifically through cooperation between OMB and the EC to:

Taking into account, among other things, the impact assessment considerations in place, evaluate progress regarding this cooperation, and consider a more formal basis to enhance this cooperation;
Intensify their dialogue focusing on issues of methodology;
Hold regular and active exchanges on the overall framework of our regulatory co-operation and on methodological issues which may arise in individual cases;
Review the application of their respective regulatory impact analysis guidelines so that the regulatory impacts on trade and investment are considered, as appropriate; and
Share forward planning schedules.




Take the following steps to reduce barriers to transatlantic economic integration posed by regulations in specific sectors by intensifying sector-by-sector regulatory cooperation, including through enhanced EC-OMB cooperation, including the following:

Encourage further cooperation in the areas of agriculture, sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures, and food safety;
Promote the application of the 2002 U.S.-EU Guidelines for Regulatory Cooperation and Transparency for specific sectoral pilot projects to be determined in consultation with stakeholders. We agree to discuss additional pilot projects on a case-by-case basis for exploring improved US-EU regulatory cooperation.
Pursue implementation of the Roadmap for Regulatory Cooperation, including the following priority projects to be pursued in 2007 and 2008:

Collaborating on cosmetics regulations, in particular with a view to reducing the need for animal tests by cooperating on alternative testing methods;
Seeking final agreement between U.S. and EU regulators on shifting resources away from implementation of the Medical Device Annex of the Mutual Recognition Agreement between the United States and the European Community to a more productive bilateral collaboration on medical devices;
Promoting administrative simplification in the application of regulation of medicinal products;
Addressing common concerns in the automotive sector in the area of road safety and fuel economy in order to avoid or reduce barriers to transatlantic trade;
