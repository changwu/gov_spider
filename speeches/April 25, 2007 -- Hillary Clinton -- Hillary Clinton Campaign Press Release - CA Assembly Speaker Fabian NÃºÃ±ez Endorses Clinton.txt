    NÃºÃ±ez Will Serve as Campaign Co-Chair
The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of California Assembly Speaker Fabian NÃºÃ±ez and named him a co-chair of Hillary's campaign.
"After the last six years, Californians -- and all Americans -- are ready to change the direction of our country," NÃºÃ±ez said. "Senator Clinton is the experienced and visionary leader who is ready to lead us towards that change."
NÃºÃ±ez became Speaker in 2004 after only two years in the Assembly, reflecting the respect of his colleagues and his deep understanding of local and state government. NÃºÃ±ez helped pass first-in-the-nation legislation to reduce California's greenhouse gas emissions, and has authored bills to boost funding for alternative energies and reform the state's health care system to provide insurance availability to nearly all Californians.
"Over her 35 years in public service, Hillary has fought for the issues I care most deeply about -- improving education for our children and making health care available to all Americans," NÃºÃ±ez said. "Given her breadth of experience, she is the only candidate who can hit the ground running on her first day in the Oval Office."
Prior to serving in the Assembly, NÃºÃ±ez was government affairs director of the Los Angeles Unified School District and before that served as political director for the Los Angeles County Labor Federation.
"Fabian NÃºÃ±ez has proven himself one of the most capable Assembly Speakers in California's history," Clinton said. "He's a results-driven leader who works across the aisle to get things done, and I'm honored to have his support."
