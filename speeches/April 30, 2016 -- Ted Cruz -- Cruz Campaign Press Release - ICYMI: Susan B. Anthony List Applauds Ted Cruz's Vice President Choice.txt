    HOUSTON, Texas - In a statement on Thursday, the Susan B. Anthony (SBA) list applauded Ted Cruz for selecting Carly Fiorina as his vice presidential running mate. SBA President Marjorie Dannenfelser made the following remarks —
"Carly Fiorina …is the ideal choice for a Vice Presidential candidate. She will take Hillary Clinton head on. Carly is ideally suited to challenge Hillary Clinton's entire platform, especially issues related to women.
"Hillary has claimed the ‘women's advocate' mantle, without offering any compelling fresh perspective. Carly on the other hand, has challenged and bested the entrenched feminist politicos who purport to advance women's rights even as they advance the usurpation of the rights of children."
In an article earlier this month, Dannelfelser had written, "…the best vice-presidential choice for any candidate is Carly Fiorina."
"…In her own presidential campaign, Fiorina emerged as a smart and tough leader with an impressive command of the issues. She demonstrated an in-depth knowledge of foreign and domestic policy that was firmly rooted in principle, and her classy campaign earned the respect of her supporters and opponents alike. …Carly really is Hillary's worst nightmare."
As reported by SBA, the Susan B. Anthony List and its affiliated committees spent $16.71 million in the 2014 election cycle to defeat pro-abortion incumbents and elect pro-life candidates to federal and statewide office. The SBA List is a network of more than 465,000 pro-life Americans nationwide, emphasizing the education, promotion, mobilization, and election of pro-life women.
