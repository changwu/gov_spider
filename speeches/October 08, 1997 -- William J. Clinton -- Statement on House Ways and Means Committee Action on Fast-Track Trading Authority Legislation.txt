    I am pleased that the House Ways and Means Committee has reported out legislation with bipartisan support that restores the traditional trading authority every President has had since 1974.
To keep our economy strong, we must continue to break down unfair foreign trade barriers to American products and services. This legislation, now passed by the committees of jurisdiction in both the Senate and the House, will allow us to tear down those barriers and help American businesses and workers compete and win in the global marketplace. I look forward to working with Members on both sides of the aisle to secure passage of this important legislation this year.
