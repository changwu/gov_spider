Because of the Trump Administration, hospitals are now required, effective immediately, to publish their REAL PRICES, which will create competition and drive downs costs MASSIVELY. Won lawsuit last week. Bigger than healthcare, it's called PRICE TRANSPARENCY....Retweets:Favorites: 304112

Some States are very slow to inoculate recipients despite successful and very large scale distribution of vaccines by the Federal Government. They will get it done!Retweets: 23302Favorites: 134784

For historical purposes remember, I was able to get rid of the INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, the most unpopular and expensive part of ObamaCare. You are no longer forced to pay a fortune for the privilege of NOT getting bad healthcare. This ended ObamaCare as we knew it. Thank you!Retweets: 49040Favorites: 248396

TRANSPARENCY in medical pricing will be one of the biggest and most important things done for the American citizen. It was just put into service, January 1, against long odds and bitter opposition. Final lawsuits won last week. Enjoy all the extra money you will have!Retweets: 49479Favorites: 236430

....Just a small portion of these votes give US a big and conclusive win in Georgia. Have they illegally destroyed ballots in Fulton County? After many weeks, we don't yet even have a judge to hear this large scale voter fraud case. The only judge seems to be Stacey's sister!Retweets: 33088Favorites: 138142

Why haven't they done signature verification in Fulton County, Georgia. Why haven't they deducted all of the dead people who voted, illegals who voted, non Georgia residents who voted, and tens of thousands of others who voted illegally, from the final vote tally?Retweets: 57887Favorites: 225271
