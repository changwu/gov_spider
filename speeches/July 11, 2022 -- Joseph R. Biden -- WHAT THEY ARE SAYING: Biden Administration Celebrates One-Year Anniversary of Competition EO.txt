    This Saturday marked the one-year anniversary of President Biden signing the Executive Order on Promoting Competition, creating the Competition Council and outlining more than 72 directives to promote competition in the economy and lower prices for every day Americans.
Since then, the Council has taken significant steps to increase competition and deliver concrete benefits to American consumers, workers, farmers, and small businesses. With broad bipartisan backing in the Senate, we've put in place strong leaders at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission who have already blocked mega mergers that would have costed taxpayers billions. Agencies have taken steps that will lower costs for Americans across the board?from making hearing aids more affordable to addressing high meat prices. These actions are just the beginning and in the coming weeks, months, and years, the Council will continue working to foster competition across the economy.
Read what external experts and advocates are saying about the anniversary:
