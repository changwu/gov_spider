    Today former New Hampshire GOP Chairman Fergus Cullen endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich for President.
Said Cullen, "I've seen a dozen candidates in person over the past year, attended at least 20 town hall meetings and hosted house parties for four candidates. I didn't prejudge anyone and like most New Hampshire voters, I didn't rush into a decision. Governor Kasich has an unmatched record of winning elections and of advancing a conservative agenda, not just talking about it. I appreciate the positive and inclusive tone he maintains on the campaign trail. If a Republican is going to win in November, we need to attract voters, not repel them. John Kasich can carry New Hampshire in a general election and I don't think most of the other candidates can."
Cullen served as chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Committee from 2007-2008. He is the author of Granite Steps, a new history of the New Hampshire primary published in partnership with the New Hampshire Union Leader.
"Fergus Cullen is an astute and engaged political figure in New Hampshire, and it is an absolute privilege to win his endorsement," said Kasich. "He knows what it takes to win over New Hampshire voters and will be a real asset to us as we keep the momentum going through these last weeks before the primary election."
