    HOUSTON, Texas â€“ CNN's Nia-Malika Henderson recently discussed Cruz's standing as the 'original outsider' and how he has the record of leading the fight in Washington on issues important to American voters.


Excerpt below:
"In a cycle when everyone wants to be an outsider, Ted Cruz really is going into this week trying to brand himself as the 'original outsider' in some ways it sort of makes him sound like an outlaw. He's been talking about the Washington Cartel and they're really going to try to emphasize his record in Washington going against the Washington Establishment whether it comes to voting against Chuck Hagel, and really leading that fight a long time ago, leading the fight against gun control, leading the fight against immigration reform, leading the fight against Obamacare. They really want to emphasize that. This week he's going to be on Stephen Colbert tomorrow, he's also going to be with the Pope incidentally. So that's one of the things they're really going to try to do. Everyone else are sort of pretenders to the outsider throne but Ted Cruz is the original outsider. That's what they're going to try to do this week."
