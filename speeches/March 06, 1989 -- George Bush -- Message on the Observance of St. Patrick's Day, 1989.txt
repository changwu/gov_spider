    It is a pleasure to send greetings to everyone celebrating this St. Patrick's Day.
The feast of the Apostle of Ireland occupies a special place on our calendar because it is a fitting time to celebrate the vibrant heritage of millions of Irish Americans, as well as the many contributions they have made to our country. Among the first of immigrant groups, the Irish overcame poverty and prejudice to become productive members of the American workforce and an influential voice in United States politics.
Today, our Nation continues to be inspired by the deep faith, strong family life, and hard work of Irish Americans. Their legendary sense of humor and resolve are an example to us all.
Barbara joins me in commending all of you on keeping alive the joyous spirit of St. Patrick's Day. May God bless you.
