    In a new 60-second NC Ask Me Ad unveiled today, Hillary Clinton addresses David Eichhorn's concerns about the treatment of our nation's veterans.
Eichhorn, 64, is a resident of Hickory who served 24 years in our nation's military. He asks, "I am really concerned about the vets coming back from this war that I know you question and I question, and I wonder if the V.A. is going to step up a little better with them."
Watch Hillary answer David's question here.
The ad will begin airing statewide today.
Over 11,000 questions have been submitted through the campaign's www.NCAskMe.com website. Staff and volunteers are working to answer every question and ensure that North Carolinians voices are heard. Senator Clinton will continue to answer voter's questions over the coming weeks.
Following is the complete script of the ad.
"David"
TV: 60
David Eichhorn: I am really concerned about the vets coming back from this war that I know you question and I question, and I wonder if the V.A. is going to step up a little better with them.
Hillary Clinton: Well David, we've got to step up. We have so many young men and women who are coming back and they have injuries that are visible and invisible, to the mind and the body and the heart.
And it's really important that we take care of them because they sure have taken care of us, and that's why we have to fully fund the V.A., and it's why we have to have special services for a lot of the problems that our vets are coming back with.
So, I have been a leader in the senate on trying to do more for traumatic brain injury.
It is one of the highest obligations of our president and commander in chief to take care of our veterans.
We owe everything to those who have served us.
I'm Hillary Clinton and I approved this message.
