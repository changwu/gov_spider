    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Williams (D) Montana and 166 others)
The Administration opposes the enactment of H.R. 1524 because it would usurp private-sector decisionmaking and is contrary to principles of Federalism. The Administration firmly believes that the terms and conditions of private employment, to the maximum extent possible, should be decided in the private marketplace. In addition, any polygraph misuse is more appropriately deterred by States restricting the conditions under which polygraphs are administered. Therefore, the Administration also opposes H.R. 3916, which establishes Federal standards for the administration of polygraph examinations, as a substitute for H.R. 1524.
