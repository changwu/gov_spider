HOUSTON, Texas â€” Today, Presidential candidate Ted Cruz announced he now has 100 County Chairs in Georgia, growing his grassroots network all across the state. He has also expanded his Georgia State Leadership Team to include 12 new current and former legislators and four of Georgia's top grassroots leaders who join the campaign as co-chairs. This announcement comes as the Cruz Campaign continues to build a strong grassroots army across the southeast.
"I am encouraged to have the endorsement of so many conservative Georgia leaders," said Cruz. "We are continuing to build the strongest operation in Georgia to get out the message that is resonating with so many Americans. I'm confident that we're building the conservative coalition to compete and win Georgia on Super Tuesday."
"This is an incredibly powerful group of leaders from across Georgia," said State Chair Ralph Hudgens. "It shows that Ted Cruz is the candidate that best reflects our Georgia values in the presidential race and that Georgia is confident a President Cruz will stand up and fight for them."
"Georgians are ready for a strong, conservative leader in the White House and that's why Ted Cruz has built so much support around the state," said Rep. Jody Hice. "We trust Senator Ted Cruz to be the true conservative who can help turn America around."
"Our organization on the ground is second-to-none," said State Director Stephen Siao. "We're excited these new leaders add even more strength to our team."
The following elected officials, faith-based community leaders, Republican women, pro-life activists, Tea Party leaders, and small-business owners will be leading efforts for the Cruz Campaign in the state of Georgia.
