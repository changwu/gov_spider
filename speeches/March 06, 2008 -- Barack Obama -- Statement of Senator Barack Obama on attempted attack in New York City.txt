    Chicago, IL - U.S. Senator Barack Obama released the following statement on the attempted attack in New York City:
"I am deeply concerned by this attempted attack on a military recruiting center in New York City. The immediate priority must be determining who carried out this heinous crime and bringing them to justice. Going forward, we must make it a priority to provide increased support for cities like New York that are likely targets for terrorist attacks, and for military installations and recruiting centers which may be targeted by foreign or domestic terrorists.
Right now, we are reminded of the courage of all who wear the uniform of the United States, including our military recruiters. Let us do whatever it takes to ensure their security, just as they sacrifice every day for ours."
