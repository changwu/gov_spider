    During National Nursing Home Week, we are particularly reminded of the needs of nursing home residents. They require special medical and health-related services delivered by individuals dedicated to their care in safe and healthful settings.
People in nursing homes also need contact with the communityâ€”often possible only when the community itself reaches out to those who have no families or whose families are far away.
Let us remember the elderly and dedicate our efforts to enabling these citizens to remain healthy and independent while at the same time ensuring that the care provided them in nursing homes fulfills the human needs of the people whom they are committed to serve.
