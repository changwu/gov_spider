  A Proclamation

The many achievements of American women in sports at home and abroad are sources of pride and inspiration for all of us. Whether on high school playing fields across our land or in Olympic arenas, female athletes time and again display qualities Americans cherishâ€”not only great ability but also greatness in spirit, courage, and skill.
Reflection on this record of accomplishment reminds us of the many benefits of women's and girls' sports and of the importance of physical fitness for people of all ages and abilities. True physical fitness helps us do our best in life, as well as in sports and physical activities at any level. Women's sports and fitness activities also help develop leadership skills that can carry over into many other areas. Opportunities for female athletes of every background can truly touch the lives of many people for the better and enrich our country. The same is true for greater attention in schools and communities to physical fitness for girls; fitness research; and private, volunteer, and public sports programs.
In recognition of the contributions of women's sports to our country, and of the need for continuing advances in these sports, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 196, has designated February 4, 1988, as "National Women in Sports Day" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 4, 1988, as National Women in Sports Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twelfth.

RONALD REAGAN
