It is important that our next President be someone who understands the threats we face and who is willing to fight to defend our security and our interests.

I have stated clearly that I will begin to undo the deal with Iran on day one:

Iran's leaders will have to choose between having a nuclear weapons program and having an economy.
I will back this up with a credible threat of military force if Iran decides to ramp up its program.
I will work with Congress to impose tougher sanctions on Iran for its support for terrorism and human rights abuses, rather than treating Congress as an afterthought as this administration has and as far too many Republicans have blindly accepted.
