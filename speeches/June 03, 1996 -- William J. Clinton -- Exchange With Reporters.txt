    Balanced Budget Amendment
Q. Mr. President, Bob Dole is challenging you today to support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. What do you say to Bob Dole?
The President. That he ought to come back to the budget negotiations and let's balance the budget.
Q. What's wrong with a constitutional amendment, though?
The President. He's pushed off the decision. Why don't we do it right now? We've got all the money we need. We can balance the budget tomorrow; all he has to do is come back to the negotiations. They walked out months ago. They should come back, take the savings we have in common, put it in the grill and, presto, we've got a balanced budget. We still have to make these decisions. That's what we ought to do.
Q. Do you think he's going to propose cutting taxes, and how would you respond to that?
The President. I don't know about that. I'm just going to work.
President's Health

Q. How do you feel?
The President. Great.
