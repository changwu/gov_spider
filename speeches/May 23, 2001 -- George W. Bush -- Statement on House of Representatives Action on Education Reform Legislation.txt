    I commend the House of Representatives for taking a giant step toward improving America's public schools. The education reforms adopted today build on the principles of accountability, flexibility, local control, and greater choices for parents. The reforms require annual testing of students in grades three through eight, give States unprecedented flexibility to meet critical education needs and, for the first time, tie Federal education funding to results. These education reforms also give parents real options to get their children out of persistently failing schools through public school choice with transportation provided, and supplemental services such as tutoring and summer school. I look forward to working with Members of the House and Senate to make sure this vital legislation becomes law so that no child in America is left behind.
