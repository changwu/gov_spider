    "These economic numbers reflect April through June, when much of the economy was essentially closed down to save millions of American lives. The media is also grabbing onto the annualized number which supposes that the economic conditions will remain the same for an entire year, which it undoubtedly will not. The President's policies already have the economy rebounding as the jobs reports from May and June show that an incredible 7.5 million jobs were created as lockdowns ended and businesses began reopening. The President has implemented the Paycheck Protection Program, keeping paychecks flowing for more than 50 million Americans. Additionally, retail sales and consumer spending have continued to rise, which are more good signs of a strong recovery. President Trump built the world's best economy once before it was interrupted by the global pandemic and he will do it a second time. Joe Biden oversaw the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression, supported disastrous trade deals, promoted China's economic advancement, and now promises to raise taxes on more than 80 percent of taxpayers and strangle job creation with the Green New Deal. To be clear, good news for Americans is bad news for Joe Biden, which is a pathetic position to be in for someone running for president of the United States. In November, voters will know that President Trump is the one to trust on bringing the economy back to greatness."
