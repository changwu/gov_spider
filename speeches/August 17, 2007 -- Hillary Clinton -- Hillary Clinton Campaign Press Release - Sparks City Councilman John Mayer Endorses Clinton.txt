    The Clinton campaign today announced the endorsement of Sparks City Councilman John Mayer.

In addition, Senator Clinton's support for rural America -- and specifically rural agriculture - signifies that she is in tune with the needs of our diverse communities. Our nation is ready for change and Hillary Clinton is ready to lead. I am thrilled to support her historic bid for the presidency and I look forward to mobilizing support for her campaign throughout northern Nevada."
