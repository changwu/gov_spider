    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revision)(House)(Ackerman.(D) NY and Lantos (D) CA)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4650 because the proposed programs duplicate numerous existing programs conducted at the Federal, State, and local levels and are therefore unnecessary. In addition, it is inappropriate to authorize new categorical programs at this time.
