    New "Thanksgiving" spot to air in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina
Chapel Hill, North Carolina – Today, as American families begin to gather together to celebrate Thanksgiving, the John Edwards for President campaign announced a new television spot, entitled "Thanksgiving," which will go up on the air Wednesday in three early primary states.
In the 30-second spot, which will run in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina through the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, Edwards tells voters what he is most thankful for – a loving family and the promise of America, "a nation filled with the most optimistic people on Earth." Edwards also delivers a personal message of thanks to the thousands of people he and Elizabeth have met on the campaign trail this year who have welcomed the Edwardses into their "homes and hearts." A full transcript of the spot is included below and the full spot can be viewed here: http://johnedwards.com/watch/thanksgiving.
