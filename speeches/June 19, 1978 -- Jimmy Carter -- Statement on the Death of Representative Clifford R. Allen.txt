    With the death of Congressman Clifford Allen, the Congress has lost a man of great integrity who dedicated his life to public service. He served the people of Tennessee in many capacities for 30 years and proved himself an earnest spokesman for our Nation's good in his all-too-brief tenure in the House of Representatives.
Congressman Allen well deserved his reputation as a champion of the common man. His concern for the welfare of all people is best exemplified by his successful effort to provide free textbooks for the schoolchildren of Tennessee.
He worked all his life for the things in which he believed and for the people of his State and country. I extend my own deepest sympathies to his family.
