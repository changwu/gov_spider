    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Ford (D) MI and 17 others)
The Administration is actively reviewing the establishment of an advisory commission on public service in the near future. In light of this, and because the statutory establishment of a commission is unnecessary, the Administration opposes of H.R. 4872. H.R. 4872 also raises constitutional concerns. The bill could be construed, for example, to give the Council programmatic functions, such as recruitment, in addition to its advisory responsibilities.
