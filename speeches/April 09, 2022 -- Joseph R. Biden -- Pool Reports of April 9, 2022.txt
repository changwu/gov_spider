In town pool report #1: Gathering
Good afternoon from the White House, where it is a partly cloudy, 54-degree day.
Pool has been Covid tested and is now gathering to depart to the Pentagon with the president. The president is scheduled to head from the Pentagon to Wilmington, where he will stay the weekend.

In town pool report #2 motorcade departure
Motorcade departed the White House at 12:54, en route to the Pentagon.
Pool did not see Biden enter the Beast. A small group of spectators did line up at the northern edge of Lafayette Square — security did not let them get any closer — trying to catch a glimpse of the motorcade as it left the White House.

In town pool report #3 arrival at pentagon/Marine 1 departure
Motorcade arrived at the Pentagon at 1:01. Pool saw a masked Biden board Marine 1 with the First Lady a few minutes later. Too much noise, and reporters were too far away, to yell questions.
Marine 1, stationed on a patch of lawn outside of the Pentagon, took off en route to Delaware at 1:07
White House passes along who was traveling with the president:
Annie Tomasini, Assistant to the President & Director of Oval Office Operations
Stephen Goepfert, Special Assistant to the President & Personal Aide to the President
Jordan Montoya, Director of Advance & Trip Director for the First Lady Brett McGurk, National Security Council Coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa
Uneventful, brief ride to the Pentagon. Many people lined up along the street of DC either waving at the motorcade or filming it with their phone. At least one woman held up her middle finger as we began crossing the Arlington Memorial Bridge.
Handing off to out of town pool. Hope everyone has a great day
