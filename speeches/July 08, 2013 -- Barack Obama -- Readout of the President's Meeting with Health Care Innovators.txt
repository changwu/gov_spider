    Following up on a Cabinet meeting focused on management and innovation, the President and senior members of the administration including Health & Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner, White House staff Valerie Jarrett, Mark Childress, Jeanne Lambrew and Todd Park met with selected leaders in the space of health and technology innovation to discuss the role of data and innovation in improving the cost and quality of health care for Americans. The meeting was a wide-ranging discussion focusing on innovation happening across the country, including progress made by individual doctors better using data in their practices, like Dr. Jennifer Brull with Prairie Star Family Practice in Kansas. They also discussed how innovation can lead to new companies built on improving the use of technology to help Americans get better care. For example, Kyruus provides a "unified view" of performance metrics for physicians by analyzing data streams, allowing doctors to increase efficiency and keep patients safe and healthy. Other participants included: Chris Chen, CEO of ChenMed, Christine Cassel, CEO of the National Quality Forum and Peter Hudson, CEO of iTriage. The administration's work to support use of information across the health care system to enable smarter decisions and improved outcomes has been highlighted in recent news reports as the administration has met and exceeded its goal for 50 percent of doctor offices and 80 percent of eligible hospitals to have electronic records by the end of 2013.
