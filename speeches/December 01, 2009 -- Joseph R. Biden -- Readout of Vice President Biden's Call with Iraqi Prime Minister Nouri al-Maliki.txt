    Vice President Biden spoke today with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to discuss the President's decision on the way forward in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Vice President stressed that U.S. actions to reinforce Afghanistan will not come at the expense of the U.S.-Iraq bilateral relationship. Also, as he did with other Iraqi leaders over the weekend, the Vice President commended Prime Minister al-Maliki for working to find a solution to the election law impasse and encouraged an arrangement that would be fair to all sides and that would allow for national elections, as desired by the Iraqi people and as outlined in Iraq's constitution.
