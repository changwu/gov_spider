    Hurricane Laura made landfall around 1 a.m. over Cameron, Louisiana, as a Category 4 Major Hurricane with 150 mph winds. Hurricane Laura continues moving north affecting the states of Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas. As we begin to assess the damage, please continue to heed the warnings and instructions of your State and local officials as storm hazards will persist long after the storm has passed.
Hurricane Laura remains a deadly hurricane with devastating coastal storm surges, destructive winds, and flash flooding. President Donald J. Trump was briefed earlier this week by Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf and Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency Peter Gaynor on the status of Hurricane Laura and the proactive preparations taken by the Administration, and he has continued to receive regular updates about the conditions on the ground. President Trump is committed to deploying the full resources of the Federal Government to rescue those in distress, support those in the region affected, and restore disruptions to our communities and infrastructure.
