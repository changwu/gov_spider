    Today, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Lisa Monaco concluded a series of meetings with Home Secretary Theresa May, Deputy National Security Advisor Paddy McGuinness, and other senior British security and intelligence officials on a range of security and counterterrorism issues, focused on our shared efforts to prevent and disrupt ISIL-directed and inspired attacks in the West. Noting that the United Kingdom is one of our strongest counterterrorism partners, Ms. Monaco discussed a number of ways we can continue to enhance our whole-of-government efforts to protect our nations from ISIL and other threats, including intensifying intelligence cooperation and information sharing with our European partners, working together to strengthen European counterterrorism capabilities, and enhancing our engagement with private sector partners to counter ISIL's destructive propaganda.
While in London, Ms. Monaco also co-led a session on "Counterterrorism in the Age of ISIL" at the Aspen Security Forum: Global with Deputy National Security Advisor McGuinness.
