    Q. Are you going to revise your timetable on the hostages? I know you're not going to-[inaudible]. Do things look better?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I just read the news reports this morning, and I think they stand for themselves. And what I said yesterday, I think is the best summary I can make.
Q. Are you encouraged, though, this morning, Mr. President?
Q. Are you going to win this election?
Q. You two are going together, with your arms around each other and so forth.
THE PRESIDENT [laughing]. We don't get to see each other very often.
Q. Do you really think you're going to win today—tomorrow?
THE PRESIDENT. I feel good about it. Q. I didn't expect you to say no.
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I feel good about it.
Q. Are you going to get those Anderson voters?
THE PRESIDENT. I hope so. Some. They're fine people. We need them.
Q. Will you get them—the Anderson voters?
THE PRESIDENT. I hope so. See you later.
