When I said in my phone call to the President of Ukraine 'I would like you to do US a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.' With the word 'us' I am referring to the United States our Country. I then went on to say that......Retweets: 21743Favorites: 100198

....'I would like to have the Attorney General (of the United States) call you or your people.....' This based on what I have seen is their big point - and it is no point at a all (except for a big win for me!). The Democrats should apologize to the American people!Retweets: 17143Favorites: 78591

Tremendous things achieved for U.S. on my NATO trip. Proudly for our Country no President has ever achieved so much in so little time. Without a U.S. increase other countries have already increased by $130 Billion-with $400 Billion soon. Such a thing has never been done before!Retweets: 16916Favorites: 70497

The Do Nothing Democrats had a historically bad day yesterday in the House. They have no Impeachment case and are demeaning our Country. But nothing matters to them they have gone crazy. Therefore I say if you are going to impeach me do it now fast so we can have a fair....Retweets: 33763Favorites: 132302

.....trial in the Senate and so that our Country can get back to business. We will have Schiff the Bidens Pelosi and many more testify and will reveal for the first time how corrupt our system really is. I was elected to 'Clean the Swamp' and that's what I am doing!Retweets: 32532Favorites: 122805

The Do Nothing Radical Left Democrats have just announced that they are going to seek to Impeach me over NOTHING. They already gave up on the ridiculous Mueller 'stuff' so now they hang their hats on two totally appropriate (perfect) phone calls with the Ukrainian President....Retweets: 21271Favorites: 82211

....This will mean that the beyond important and seldom used act of Impeachment will be used routinely to attack future Presidents. That is not what our Founders had in mind. The good thing is that the Republicans have NEVER been more united. We will win!Retweets: 16995Favorites: 65564

Nancy Pelosi just had a nervous fit. She hates that we will soon have 182 great new judges and sooo much more. Stock Market and employment records. She says she 'prays for the President.' I don't believe her not even close. Help the homeless in your district Nancy. USMCA?Retweets: 50558Favorites: 192342
