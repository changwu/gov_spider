    I am pleased to send warm greetings to those celebrating St. Patrick's Day. Each year on March 17, joyous events commemorate the remarkable life of Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland. Born in Britain many centuries ago, Patrick was captured as a teenager by pirates and sold into slavery in Ireland. During six years of forced labor as a herdsman, he looked to his religious faith for sustenance.
Patrick eventually escaped and returned to Britain, where he dreamed that he was being called to serve as a missionary. He began to study for the priesthood and returned to Ireland, dedicating his life to preaching Christianity. Patrick endured hardship and suffering, but his bravery and devotion to his faith became legendary in the hearts and minds of the Irish people.
Centuries later, St. Patrick's Day pays tribute to an incredible hero and to the rich cultural heritage of the Emerald Isle. Countless Americans symbolically proclaim Irish ancestry by taking part in the festivities celebrating the stories and traditions of Ireland. St. Patrick's Day is also a time to honor the contributions of Irish Americans to our Nation's history and way of life, enriching the United States in great measure.
As we move into the 21st century, Americans look forward to continued friendship and goodwill with the people of Ireland. Laura joins me in sending best wishes for a wonderful St. Patrick's Day.
