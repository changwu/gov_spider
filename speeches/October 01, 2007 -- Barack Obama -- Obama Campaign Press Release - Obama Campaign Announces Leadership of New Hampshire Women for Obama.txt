    State co-chairs, steering committee members, and county co-chairs to lead grassroots organizing efforts
Manchester, NH -- Senator Barack Obama's New Hampshire campaign today announced the leadership of New Hampshire Women for Obama. The state co-chairs, steering committee, and county co-chairs-comprising State Representatives, activists, and local community leaders-will advise the campaign on women's and family issues, host events across the state, and lead organizing efforts among the thousands of women supporting Obama in New Hampshire.
"New Hampshire women are so excited about Obama because he understands the challenges that today's women face," State Co-Chair Ann McLane Kuster said. "As a community organizer working with families, as the son of a single mother, and now as the father of two young daughters, he knows from personal experience that it's not enough to encourage women to dream big-we have to give women the resources they need to achieve those dreams."
New Hampshire Women for Obama is already extraordinarily active in the state. Teachers, attorneys, artists, doctors, mothers and grandmothers, Women for Obama members have been organizing in their communities and talking to friends and neighbors about why Barack Obama will be the best President for women and families. Recently New Hampshire Women for Obama hosted organizing trainings in Manchester and Keene, with more sessions are planned for the fall.
**State co-chairs, steering committee members and county co-chairs are available to speak to the media. Please contact Reid Cherlin for details at (603) 668-2008.
