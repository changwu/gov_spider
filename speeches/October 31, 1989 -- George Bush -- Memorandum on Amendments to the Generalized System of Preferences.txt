    Memorandum for the United States Trade Representative
Subject: Actions Concerning the Generalized System of Preferences
Pursuant to subsection 504(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the Act) (19 U.S.C. 2464(d)(1)), I have determined to modify the application of duty-free treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) currently being afforded to beneficiary developing countries. Specifically, I have determined, pursuant to subsection 504(d)(1) of the Act, that the limitation provided for in subsection 504(c)(1)(B) of the Act should not apply with respect to certain eligible articles because no like or directly competitive article was produced in the United States on January 3, 1985. Such articles are provided for in the following Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) subheadings:
9101.12.809101.91.209101.91.409101.91.809101.99.209101.99.409101.99.609101.99.809102.12.809102.91.209102.99.209102.99.409102.99.609102.99.80
This determination shall be published in the Federal Register.
