    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report three proposals to rescind a total of $55.3 million in budget authority previously provided by the Congress. In addition, I am reporting six new deferrals of budget authority totalling $1,517.1 million and seven revisions to previously transmitted deferrals increasing the amount deferred by $2.2 million in budget authority.
The rescission proposals affect the military assistance program, the Department of State's appropriation for contributions for international peacekeeping activities, and the revolving fund of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
The new deferrals and revisions to existing deferrals involve programs of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Health, Education, and Welfare, Justice, Labor, Transportation, the Treasury, and the Panama Canal Zone Government, the National Science Foundation, and the United States Information Agency.
The details of each rescission proposal and deferral are contained in the attached reports.
