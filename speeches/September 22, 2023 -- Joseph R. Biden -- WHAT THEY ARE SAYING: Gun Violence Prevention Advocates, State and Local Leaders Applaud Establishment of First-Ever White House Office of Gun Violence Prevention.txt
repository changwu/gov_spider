    Today, President Biden established the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention to reduce gun violence, which has ravaged communities across the country, and implement and expand upon key executive and legislative action which has been taken to save lives. The new Office will be overseen by Vice President Harris and builds on historic actions taken by President Biden to end gun violence in our country: including signing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant legislative action in nearly 30 years aimed at doing so, and taking more meaningful executive action than any other president to make our schools, churches, grocery stores, and communities safer.

This toll has only been exacerbated by easy access to guns and our nation's woefully inadequate policies. The creation of a White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention answers the call from communities nationwide for a meaningful investment in solutions and helps deliver on the Administration's promise to honor those stolen by this plague with action.

President Biden has taken more meaningful executive action than any other President to end the trauma and tragedy of gun violence that so many Americans face.

Our early voter poll showsgun safety is a top issue for Asian American and Pacific Islanders in Virginia with 70% of AAPI respondents in the state saying they are "much more likely" to back a candidate who supports universal background checks.

One of the first mass school shootings in the United States took place in 1989 when a white gunman targeted Southeast Asian children at an elementary school in Stockton, Calif.
