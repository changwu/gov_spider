Iowa Friends,
Governor Huckabee is hitting the "full Grassley" in Iowa today. He's campaigned in ALL 99 counties since May 6... It's been a great ride and just 26 more days to caucus night!
I think we are going to surprise a few folks in New York and Washington ... We are just getting started.
We have great campaign events today in Sigourney, Oskaloosa, Albia, Centerville, Chariton and Urbandale. Janet Huckabee is also on the campaign trail and she will be in Holstein, Logan and Council Bluffs. Learn more by clicking the link below. I hope you can come join the Governor or Janet today on the campaign trail!
Event info HERE.
With gratitude,
Chip Saltsman
