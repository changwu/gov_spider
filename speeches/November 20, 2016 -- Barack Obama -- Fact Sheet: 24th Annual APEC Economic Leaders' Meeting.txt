    On November 20, President Barack Obama and the Leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum adopted a set of ambitious initiatives at the 24th annual APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting under the theme of Quality Growth and Human Development. Under the chairmanship of Peru's President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, the United States worked with other APEC Leaders and Ministers to make sure that the benefits of the global economy are more broadly shared by more people. That is a central part of our work in APEC, to find ways that we can raise standards for trade across the region and bring benefits to more of our people.
APEC economies account for approximately 40 percent of the world's population, approximately 59 percent of world GDP, and about 49 percent of world trade. U.S. goods and services trade with APEC economies totaled over $2.9 trillion in 2015. U.S. exports to APEC economies accounted for 62.3 percent of overall U.S. exports in 2015. According to the Department of Commerce, U.S. goods exports to APEC economies supported an estimated 4.2 million jobs in 2015. U.S. trade in services with APEC economies (exports and imports) totaled nearly $475 billion in 2015. Services exports were up 98 percent since 2005 and the U.S. services trade surplus with APEC members was $130.1 billion in 2015.

•      Reaffirming that economies should not conduct or support information and communications technology (ICT)-enabled theft of intellectual property or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sectors.
•      Enhancing digital value chains and promoting digital trade in APEC by advancing economy and industry participation in the APEC Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) system.

•      This year marks the five-year anniversary of APEC's 2011 agreement in San Francisco to dismantle barriers restricting women's participation in the economy and maximize their contributions to economic growth.
