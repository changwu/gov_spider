JUSTIFICATION FOR PRESIDENTIAL DETERMINATION ON THE ELIGIBILITY OF BARBADOS TO MAKE PURCHASES OF DEFENSE ARTICLES AND DEFENSE SERVICES UNDER THE ARMS EXPORT CONTROL ACT
Section 3(a)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act requires, as a condition of eligibility for the purchase of defense articles and defense services from the United States under the Act, that the President find that the furnishing of defense articles and services to the country concerned "will strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace."
Presidential Determination No. 73-10, dated January 2, 1973, established a consolidated list of countries eligible to make purchases of defense articles and services on a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) basis under the Arms Export Control Act. Because of changing international circumstances, new countries are added to this list from time to time. It is my judgment that circumstances now merit the addition of Barbados to the list of countries so eligible.
The island of Barbados lies in the southeast approach to the Caribbean, an area of strategic importance to the U.S. Stability in this area will promote world peace. The small Barbados defense force is inadequately equipped to patrol its coast and territorial waters against smugglers, narcotics traffickers, and arms runners. The states of the area have come to feel increasingly vulnerable, and they have discussed regional security cooperation, including the possibility of forming a regional coast guard. My finding, enabling Barbados to purchase defense articles and services under the Arms Export Control Act, will enable the United States to respond quickly to justified requests for support for modest national or regional defense forces. In view of the limitations of section 4 of the Act on the purposes for which FMS sales may be made, no sale would be made to or for the police or other forces engaged in ongoing civil law enforcement.
I have concluded that the provision of modest amounts of defense articles to Barbados would be in the interest of the United States and will reduce the potential for instability in an area of particular concern to this country. For the foregoing reasons, I have found that the sale under the Act of defense articles and defense services to Barbados will strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace.
