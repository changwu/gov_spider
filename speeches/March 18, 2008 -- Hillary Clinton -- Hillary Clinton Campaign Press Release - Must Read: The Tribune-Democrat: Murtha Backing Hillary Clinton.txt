U.S. Rep. John Murtha today announced his endorsement of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
"I've known Senator Clinton for 15 years," the Johnstown Democrat said in a statement released by his campaign committee.
"I know that she continually reaches out for opinions and ideas, not just from our nation's leaders, but from all Americans."
Murtha is one of the most powerful Democrats in the House.
But his backing carries added importance this year because he also is a "superdelegate" - an official who is free to support any candidate at the party's national convention in August.
