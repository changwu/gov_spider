    I AM GRIEVED by the news of the death of George II, King of the Hellenes, who had so recently returned to his country to share with the Greek people the heavy tasks of reconstruction following the ravages of enemy occupation. It is a satisfaction to me that, only a few weeks before his unexpected death, I assured His Majesty and Greece of continuing American interest in the welfare of our gallant ally.
