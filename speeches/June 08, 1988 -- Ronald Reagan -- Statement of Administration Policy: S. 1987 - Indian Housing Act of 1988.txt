    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Inouye (D) Hawaii and 5 others)
The Administration opposes S. 1987, because it would make seriously objectionable amendments to the Indian housing program administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and because separate codification of Indian housing provisions in statute is unnecessary. The objectionable amendments include:

—      waiving income eligibility limits under the Mutual Help Program for certain units, thus making available subsidized housing to higher income families;
—      establishing a new, unnecessary Self-Help demonstration program, adding cost and complexity to the Indian housing delivery system;
—      limiting certain eligibility to non-reservation Indians who are not members of federally-recognized tribes, which raises constitutional concerns regarding racial preference under the Equal Protection clause; and
—      authorizing families in Indian areas to use a new travel-related deduction as an alternative to a child care deduction in determining eligibility for housing assistance, thereby increasing the Federal subsidy.
