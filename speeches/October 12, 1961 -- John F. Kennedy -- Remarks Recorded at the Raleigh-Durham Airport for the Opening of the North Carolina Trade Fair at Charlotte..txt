    Governor Sanford, Members of the Congress, Secretary Hodges:
I want to express my pleasure at again being back in North Carolina. The last time was a year ago, though the conditions were somewhat different.
I do want to say that it's a great satisfaction to me to join you in opening this fair. North Carolina has a great story to tell. Its progress in recent years has been among the most vigorous of any State in the United States. And this effort to tie together in a place where this State and country and world can see the products of this State, I think can mean increased development and wellbeing for the people of this State in the future.
What Governor Sanford and the officials and the people of this State are attempting to do in developing the economy of North Carolina, and in providing a better life for the people, we with the help of the Secretary of Commerce, Governor Sanford's predecessor, are attempting to do in the Nation.
This country cannot stand still. It must move forward. North Carolina has not stood still. It is moving forward, and I think together we can show what North Carolina and the United States can and must do.
And therefore, as President of the United States, it is a high honor to open this fair and with it to show the world what North Carolina stands for.
Thank you.
