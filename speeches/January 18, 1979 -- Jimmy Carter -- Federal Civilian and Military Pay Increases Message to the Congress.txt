    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the provisions of section 5305 of title 5 of the United States Code, I hereby report on the pay adjustment I am ordering for the Federal statutory pay systems in October 1978.
The Secretary of Labor, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission, who serve jointly as my agent for Federal pay, found that an increase averaging 8.4 percent would be appropriate if comparability with private enterprise salary rates for the same levels of work were to be achieved. The Advisory Committee on Federal Pay recommended that the findings of my agent be implemented.
After considering the findings of my agent and the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Federal Pay, I determined that an across-the-board increase of 5.5 percent was dictated by economic conditions affecting the general welfare and transmitted to the Congress the alternative plan to that effect called for by section 5305(c) of title 5 of the United States Code. On October 7, 1978 I signed the Executive order to implement this increase.
I am transmitting herewith copies of the reports of my Pay Agent and the Advisory Committee on Federal Pay, the alternative plan, and the Executive order I promulgated to put this pay adjustment into effect.
