    In U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' 1-day old presidential campaign, more than 100,000 people already signed up at BernieSanders.com to spearhead the mass movement he called for when he launched the campaign.
"This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders. It's about a grassroots movement of Americans standing up and saying: 'Enough is enough. This country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires,'" Sanders had written in a Thursday morning e-mail to supporters announcing his candidacy.
In addition to the growing number of online volunteers, more than $1.5 million in contributions was raised online in the 24 hours since Sanders spoke at noon on Thursday to a horde of reporters a news conference outside the U.S. Capitol. Underscoring the grassroots movement, there were 35,000 donors in the first 24 hours and the average donation was $43.54.
"This is a remarkable start for Bernie's campaign. People across America are yearning for authentic leadership that tells them the truth about what is holding back our nation. Bernie Sanders understands the problems we face, and is proposing bold policies to deal with those challenges â€” the crushing impact that inequality of wealth and income are having on working families and the middle class; the catastrophic threat of climate change; and the attack on democracy itself from Super PACs and the wealthy special interests that fund them," said Tad Devine, a senior adviser to the senator.
Sanders will travel to New Hampshire on Saturday for a mid-morning house party in Manchester and to address an AFL-CIO convention in North Conway. It will be his 10th trip to the Granite State in the past year.
