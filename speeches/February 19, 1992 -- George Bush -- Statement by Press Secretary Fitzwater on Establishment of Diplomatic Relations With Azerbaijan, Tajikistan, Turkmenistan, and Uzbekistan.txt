    The President has decided that the United States will take immediate steps to establish diplomatic relations with Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The United States had recognized their independence on December 25, 1991. Following Secretary Baker's recent visit to these countries, the President believes U.S. interests will be best served by having diplomatic ties to their Governments. Secretary Baker conducted detailed discussions with the leaders of the four countries on the political, economic, and security principles of most importance to the United States. The depth, extent, and richness of U.S. relations with each of these countries will depend on their commitment to these principles.
With this step, and yesterday's establishment of diplomatic relations with Moldova, the United States now has diplomatic relations with 11 of the 12 former Soviet Republics. The United States does not intend or seek to isolate the people of Georgia, as Secretary Baker said in Moscow. But, at this time, the United States is not in a position to establish diplomatic relations with Georgia.
The United States will open embassies in these countries by March 15. In addition, the U.S. will support their membership in relevant international organizations, including the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
