    National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice met today at the White House with African Union Chairperson Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma. Ambassador Rice commended the African Union's leadership on global health issues, and the two discussed the need to continue focusing on Ebola until we get to zero cases. Ambassador Rice reaffirmed that the United States remains committed to continuing to expand trade between the United States and Africa, including through initiatives launched at last year's U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit. She reiterated the strong U.S. interest in renewing the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) as soon as possible, for as long as possible. The two also discussed regional issues of mutual concern, including the need to work together to advance peace in South Sudan and Libya and to combat terrorism and prevent violent extremism. They agreed to continue to advance these shared priorities and to continue to deepen the strong partnership between the United States and the African Union.
