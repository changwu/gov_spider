    Your Majesty:
The people of the United States join me in expressing deepest sympathy to Your Majesty and to the people of Denmark at the passing of Prime Minister Hansen.
I came to know him personally during the course of meetings both in Europe and the United States. He was a statesman whose absence will be felt keenly in the future by all of us who appreciated his humanitarian views and valued his many contributions to international understanding.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
