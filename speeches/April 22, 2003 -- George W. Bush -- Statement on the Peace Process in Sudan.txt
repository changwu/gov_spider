    Today I informed Congress, consistent with the Sudan Peace Act, that the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) are negotiating in good faith and that negotiations should continue.
Both sides have made significant progress negotiating a just and comprehensive peace for the people of Sudan. There is still much work remaining. Sporadic military activities, primarily but not exclusively by the Government, have hindered these efforts and must stop. Despite these challenges, negotiators are advancing toward peace, and I believe that the current process presents the best prospects for peace.
It is now time to move the peace process to a new level where the actions of both parties replace promises as the measure of their commitment to peace. President Bashir and Chairman Garang must demonstrate the leadership necessary to ensure that their respective sides: 1) refrain from any hostile or provocative action; 2) complete negotiations on outstanding issues; and 3) sign and implement a comprehensive agreement.
The United States fully supports the invaluable mediation efforts of the Government of Kenya. We stand ready with other members of the international community to support the implementation of a comprehensive agreement when it is finalized this June.
