    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith propose nine new rescissions totalling $1,001.3 million and report eight new deferrals totalling $273.4 million in budget authority developed in connection with the 1978 budget. In addition, I am reporting $70.6 million in increases to five deferrals previously transmitted.
The rescission proposals pertain to programs of the Departments of Commerce, Defense, State, and Transportation as well as the Small Business Administration and an International Security Assistance program.
The new deferrals involve programs of the Department of Commerce and Transportation and the Energy Research and Development Administration while the increases to existing deferrals relate to the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, and Transportation.
I urge the Congress to act favorably on the rescission proposals.
