    This act provides congressional authorization to bring into effect the 1978 Interim Reciprocal Fisheries Agreement with Canada. This agreement is an essential step toward allowing fishermen of each country to resume traditional fishing in the waters of the other during 1978. Negotiations are continuing to conclude a comprehensive maritime boundary and resource agreement between Canada and the United States. Congressional approval of the agreement reflects the widespread support in the United States both for maintenance of reciprocal fishing with Canada and for the kind of comprehensive, cooperative, long-term arrangements now under negotiation.
I hope that our country and Canada can now immediately proceed to restore traditional patterns of reciprocal fishing. The interruption at the beginning of this month in these traditional reciprocal fisheries, which have continued since the 18th century, has created hardships for fishermen of both countries. Resumption of reciprocal fishing can only help the intensive efforts of both Governments to work out permanent arrangements for sharing and jointly managing our common fisheries resources, arrangements which would include mechanisms for resolving the very questions which gave rise to the present interruption.
I believe that the negotiations to conclude a comprehensive maritime agreement now being carried out by my Special Representative, Lloyd Cutler, and his Canadian counterpart offer the firm promise of a strengthened, cooperative maritime relationship which will bring benefits to the fishermen of both countries that neither country can provide on its own. Such a long-term agreement would be in the tradition of our close, cooperative relationship with Canada. In signing this act, I have asked the Secretary of State and Lloyd Cutler to make every effort with Canada to restore reciprocal fishing as soon as possible so that the important long-term maritime negotiations may proceed unimpeded.
