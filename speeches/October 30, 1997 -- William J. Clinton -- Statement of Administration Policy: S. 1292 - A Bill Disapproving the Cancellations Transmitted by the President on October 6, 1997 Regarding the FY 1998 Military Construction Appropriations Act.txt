    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Sponsor: Stevens (R), Alaska)
This Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views on S. 1292, a bill Disapproving the Cancellations Transmitted by the President on October 6, 1997.
S. 1292 would disapprove 34 of the 38 projects that the President canceled from the FY 1998 Military Construction Appropriations Act. The Administration strongly opposes this disapproval bill. If the resolution were presented to the President in its current form, the President would veto the bill.
The President carefully reviewed the 145 projects that Congress funded that were not included in the FY 1998 Budget. The President used his authority responsibly to cancel projects that were not requested in the budget, that would not substantially improve the quality of life of military service members and their families, and that would not begin construction in 1998 because the Defense Department reported that no architectural and engineering design work had been done. The President's action saves $287 million in budget authority in 1998.
While we strongly oppose S. 1292, we are committed to working with Congress to restore funding for those projects that were canceled as a result of the data provided by the Department of Defense that was out of date.
