    We are pleased to announce that our daughter, Ashley Blazer Biden, married Dr. Howard Krein this evening in Wilmington, Delaware. The private ceremony was attended by the bride and groom's close family and friends. We're happy to welcome Howard into our family, and we wish them all the best in their new life together.
