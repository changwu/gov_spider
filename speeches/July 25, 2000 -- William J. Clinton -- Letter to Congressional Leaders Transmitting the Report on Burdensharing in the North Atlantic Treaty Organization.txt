    Dear Mr. Chairman:
Pursuant to section 3(2)(B) of the Senate's resolution of April 30, 1998, providing its advice and consent to ratification of the Protocols on the Accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949, I hereby transmit to you the report concerning burdensharing in the Alliance and other matters.
The report contains two sections: (1) an unclassified section on allies' contributions to common NATO budgets, allies' national defense budgets and their adequacy, costs incurred to date in connection with the membership of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, and the status of discussions concerning NATO membership for Partnership for Peace countries; and (2) a separate, classified section on steps taken by allies to meet NATO force goals.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
