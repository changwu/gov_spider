    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question covering the period October 1-November 30, 2000. The previous submission covered events during August and September 2000.
The United Nations continued its efforts to bring about a comprehensive settlement between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots with the fifth session of proximity talks in Geneva from November 1 to 10. Special Presidential Emissary Alfred Moses, Special Cyprus Coordinator Thomas Weston, and U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Donald Bandler continued to provide diplomatic support to the process. The United Nations Secretary General invited both parties to continue talks in Geneva in late January. The United States remains committed to the United Nations process and efforts to bring about a solution based upon a bizonal, bicommunal federation.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
