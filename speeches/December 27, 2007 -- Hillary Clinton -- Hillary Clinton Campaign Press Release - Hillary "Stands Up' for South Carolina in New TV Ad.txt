    COLUMBIA - The Clinton campaign launched a new TV ad in South Carolina today highlighting Hillary's 35-year record of standing up for Americans, for health care, to protect Social Security and to provide National Guard members and Reservists the health care benefits they deserve.
"We need someone who will stand up for us in South Carolina. Hillary Clinton has the record of standing up for us and standing up against the Bush administration and others when it counts," South Carolina State Director for the Clinton Campaign Kelly Adams said.
The new 60-second spot, entitled "Stand By You," focuses on Hillary's record of standing up for universal health care when almost no one else would, standing up for seniors against Bush administration efforts to privatize Social Security and standing up for National Guard and Reserve members.
A complete transcript of "Stand By You" is included below. The TV ad can be viewed online at: www.hillaryclinton.com/southcarolina.
ANNCR: Hillary stood up for universal health care when almost no one else would and kept standing until almost 6 million kids had coverage. She stood up for seniors by fighting this administration's plan to head social security over to Wall Street and kept standing until Bush backed down. She stood by our National Guard and Reserve and kept standing until every member had access to the health care they deserve. Hillary spent 35 years standing up for people. As President, she'll stand up for you.
HILLARY: I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.
