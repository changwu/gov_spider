    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Sponsor: Whitten (D), Mississippi)
The Administration is concerned about the level of funding recommended which is $27.8 billion below the requested level of $304.1 billion and $9.5 billion below the Congressional budget resolution level of $285.9 billion. The Administration supports the funding level agreement reached by the Congressional budget resolution conferees and urges the restoration of funds consistent with this agreement.
The Administration is particularly concerned that the bill does not provide requested funding for procurement of binary chemical munitions and for the Strategic Defense Initiative. The bill now undercuts any leverage the U.S. might have in negotiations with the Soviet Union at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva and risks weakening the U.S. position in negotiations on Strategic Arms Reductions. Therefore, the Administration strongly urges the restoration of these funds.
The Administration also supports the provisions allowing for funds to be used for binary chemical munitions as agreed to by the conferees in the Defense Authorization bill, and urges the amendment of the Defense Appropriation bill, Section 8093, to be consistent with these provisions.
