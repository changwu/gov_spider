    New Mexico Congressman Steve Pearce made the following statement on Mitt Romney's vision for America as an energy superpower:
"Governor Romney's comprehensive energy policy recognizes that the West plays a vital role as an economic engine for our country.  Unlike the Obama Administration's energy policies which hamper job creators and handcuff America's energy producers, Governor Romney is offering a bold strategy to develop our natural resources, create jobs and make our country energy independent by 2020.  Governor Romney understands the key to rebuilding America's middle class lies in unleashing the potential of the West."
