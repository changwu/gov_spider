New data out from the Transportation Security Administration shows that the 7-day moving average for daily air travel has just exceeded 2 million for the first time since the pandemic began.

And this week, we learned that the Consumer Confidence Index – a measure of consumers' assessments of the economy – is at its highest level since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020. The Index increased from 120 in May to 127.3 in June, exceeding consensus expectations of 119.0. This latest increase in June marks the fourth straight month of gains, as Americans continue to feel the results of President Biden's historic economic and health plans. It's clear: Americans are more optimistic about current economic conditions, as well as the future.
It's clear that President Biden's economic plan is working.
