    Memorandum for the Secretary of Agriculture
Subject: Food Security Wheat Reserve
By virtue of the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the Food Security Wheat Reserve Act of 1980 (the "Act") (7 U.S.C. 1736f - 1) and section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code, I hereby delegate to the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to release up to 2 million metric tons of wheat from the reserve established under the Act (the "reserve"), in addition to any quantity of wheat previously authorized to be released from the reserve, to provide, on a sale or donation basis, emergency food assistance to developing countries under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (7 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.) when domestic supplies of wheat are so limited that quantities of wheat cannot meet the availability criteria of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954.
The Secretary shall consult with the agencies comprising the Food Aid Subcommittee of the Development Coordination Committee (Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, State, and the Treasury, the Agency for International Development, the National Security Council, the Office of Management and Budget, and the White House Special Assistant for Agricultural Trade and Food Assistance) with respect to the use of the wheat released from the reserve.
This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.
George Bush
