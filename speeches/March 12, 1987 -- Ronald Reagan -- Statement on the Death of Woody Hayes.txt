    Woody Hayes was a legend in college football. Colorful and sometimes even controversial, he cared deeply about his players, his team, and his school. Under his coaching, Ohio State University won 12 Big 10 titles and became one of the Nation's most respected college football teams. Coach Hayes' greatest satisfaction came from getting to know his players. He enjoyed a special relationship with them, many of whom stayed in touch with him years after their collegiate days were over. He was an institution at OSU and seemed to have a special knack for knowing just what to do to get an athlete to go the extra mile. Nancy and I extend our deep sympathy to his family and to the Ohio State University community.
