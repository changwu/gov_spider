    MINNEAPOLIS, MN â€“ Today, the Amy For America campaign announced that Senator Amy Klobuchar has qualified for the September and October Democratic presidential primary debates. Senator Klobuchar surpassed the 130,000 individual donor threshold less than 48 hours after her second debate. July was Klobuchar's strongest month of fundraising since announcing her campaign in February, and the average online grassroots contribution is $22.
Klobuchar took a different tack in both the first and second debates: she chose to focus her criticism on Donald Trump and not her fellow Democrats.
"While the debates are definitely about showing differences of opinion on policy, I think our time is better spent taking it to Donald Trump instead of each other. I'm glad that so many Americans agree," said Senator Amy Klobuchar.
Klobuchar previously met the polling threshold for the September and October Democratic presidential primary debates. A CBS News / YouGov poll of Iowa, showing Senator Klobuchar with 4%, was the fourth poll needed to meet the DNC's polling qualifications of 2% or more in four major surveys and Klobuchar has now hit at least 2% in five qualifying polls
"We're thankful for the strong grassroots support we've received from all across the country as our momentum continues to build heading into the fall," said Campaign Manager Justin Buoen. "Amy's debate performances have shown exactly why she is the strongest candidate to take on Donald Trump and she will continue to hold him accountable for his divisiveness and empty promises. As she takes the stage again this fall, voters will hear about her optimistic agenda and plans to make progress on the challenges and opportunities we face as a nation."
