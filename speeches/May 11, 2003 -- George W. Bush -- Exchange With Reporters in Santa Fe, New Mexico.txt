Q. How's the game?
The President. I need a lot of work.
Q. Better than yesterday?
The President. Equally as feebleâ€”equally as feeble.
It's been a fabulous weekend here in Santa Fe. I'm now ready to get back to work. Got some travel to do tomorrow; be talking to the country about the need for an economic stimulus package. And then we're going to go see, Tuesday afternoon, we're going to go to see some of the tornado sites. And it will give me a chance to tell the people who've suffered great loss how much a lot of the Nation prays for them and how we're concerned about them. But it's been a fabulous experience here in a wonderful part of the world. The hospitality by the people here has been just great. I really appreciate it.
Happy Mother's Day, everybody.
