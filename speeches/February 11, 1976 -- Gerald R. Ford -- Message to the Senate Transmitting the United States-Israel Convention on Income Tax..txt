    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, the Convention signed at Washington on November 20, 1975, between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the State of Israel with respect to taxes on income. Also I desire to withdraw from the Senate the Convention for the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income between the Government of the United State, of America and the Government of Israel which was signed at Washington on June 29, 1965 (Executive F, 89th Congress, 1st Session).
There is no convention on this subject presently in force between the United States and Israel.
The Convention signed on November 20, 1975, is similar in many essential respects to other recent United States income tax treaties.
I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
Conventions such as this one are an important element in promoting closer economic cooperation between the United States and other countries. I urge the Senate to act favorably on this Convention at an early date and to give its advice and consent to ratification.
