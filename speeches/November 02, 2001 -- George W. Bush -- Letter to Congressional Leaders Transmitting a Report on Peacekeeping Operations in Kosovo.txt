    Dear __________:
As required by section 1213 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, Public Law 106-398, I transmit herewith a semiannual report on the contributions of European nations and organizations to the peacekeeping operations in Kosovo.
This report, prepared by the Department of State, concludes that the Europeans have carried a significant portion of the aid-sharing burden in the region and that their commitment to reconstruction, humanitarian relief, and institution and peacebuilding has been a strong one. Continued attention and commitments of assistance from all donors remains crucial for medium- and long-term development in Kosovo.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
