    Today, as Vice President Mike Pence travels to North Carolina, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield released the following statement:
"Since the beginning of this pandemic, the Trump-Pence Administration has left North Carolinians out to dry when it comes to providing resources or any semblance of national guidance. Vice President Pence can try to convince educators and students otherwise with this school visit, but the reality is that he has been pushing educators across the country to reopen their doors without putting critical safety measures in place. Joe Biden knows that our number one priority has to be safeguarding our students and educators, which is why he has released a reopening plan that's in lock-step with Governor Roy Cooper. We need an administration that will put the lives of the American people over their own self-interest."
