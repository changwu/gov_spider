    Congressman Tom Price, M.D. (R-GA) today made the following statement on the selection of Congressman Paul Ryan as Mitt Romney's Vice Presidential running mate:
"Anyone who has had the opportunity to know or work with Congressman Paul Ryan understands his passion and dedication for solving the enormous challenges facing America.  He has always been a principled voice for positive solutions that will help strengthen our economy and build a future of opportunity and prosperity. There has been no greater ally in Congress for those of us fighting to change the reckless habits of the Obama Administration.  At a time when the country is in need of leadership, Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan will focus this election on the issues that matter to the American people.  As Paul's friend and colleague, I am confident he will help Governor Romney offer the American people a real choice in this election.  It will be a choice between the politics of President Obama that divide the nation and leave the American people with greater debt and economic insecurity and the solutions put forward by Republicans that embrace America's spirit of free enterprise while ensuring we do not leave a mountain of debt and economic uncertainty to the next generation.  In choosing Congressman Ryan, Governor Romney has set in motion a great debate about how best to move our country forward."
