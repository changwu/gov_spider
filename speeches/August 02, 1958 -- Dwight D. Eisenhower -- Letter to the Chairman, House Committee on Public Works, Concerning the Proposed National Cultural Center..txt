    Dear Mr. Chairman:
I am writing you with reference to legislation now pending before your Committee which would authorize the establishment of a National Cultural Center here in Washington on a site made available by the federal Government with funds raised by voluntary contributions.
There has long been a need for more adequate facilities in the Nation's capital for the presentation of the performing arts. An auditorium and other facilities such as are provided for in pending legislation, established and supported by contributions from the public, would be a center of which the entire Nation could be proud. I hope that the Congress will complete action on this legislation during this session.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
