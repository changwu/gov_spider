    I spoke with President Yeltsin this morning and conveyed through him to the Russian people my warm congratulations on the election, which is a success for Russia as a whole.
On Sunday, more than 70 million Russian citizens—representing about 70 percent of the eligible voters—voted in the first round of the Presidential election that will determine who will lead the Russian Federation for the next 4 years. They were able to choose among 10 candidates representing a wide range of political views in a contested election. Russian and international observers have reported nothing thus far to indicate any significant irregularities in the voting process.
This is an important milestone in Russia's history as a democracy and a welcome sign of just how far that country has come in a few short years. The runoff round will allow the Russian people to complete the process of electing their President.
A critical element of our post-cold-war relationship with Russia is its continuing development as a democracy. The United States will remain steady in its policy of active engagement with Russia to support political and economic reform and Russia's integration with the West.
