    DUBLIN, CA â€“ 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Congressman Eric Swalwell qualified Tuesday to participate in the Democratic National Committee's first presidential debate by breaking through the polling threshold in a third DNC-recognized poll.
The breakthrough comes just three weeks after Swalwell announced his candidacy on April 8. He had reached the 1% support threshold in polls released April 11 by Monmouth University (surveying Iowa voters) and April 22 by the University of New Hampshire (surveying New Hampshire voters); a national CNN poll conducted April 25-28 and released Tuesday found Swalwell at 1% as well.
"Support is growing for my campaign to go big on the issues we tackle, be bold in the solutions we offer, and do good with the way that we govern," Swalwell said Tuesday. "I'm grateful that I'll have a place on the debate stage to discuss ending gun violence, providing affordable healthcare for all while finding cures in our lifetime, ensuring all communities have top-notch schools, and making sure student loan debt isn't a lifetime burden."
The DNC will host the first presidential debates of the 2020 election on June 26-27 in Miami.
