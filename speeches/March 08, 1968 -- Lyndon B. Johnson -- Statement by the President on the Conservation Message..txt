    THERE ARE many things that Americans take for granted--a park, a tree, a field, a river.
Now the beauty of America is in danger. But today we are moving to lift that danger--to renew, to restore, to reclaim, and to refresh the spirit of our land and of our people.
This is the work of the new conservation. It can be the new strength of America. I sent Congress today an action program:
--An action program that will fight pollution that fouls the air we all breathe and blights our rivers and our streams.
--An action program to continue the great work which now enables 120 million Americans to reach a national park or lakeshore or camping area in just an afternoon's drive from the crowded city.
--An action program to make every community a place of pride for its people.
Now the question is for each of us: What kind of America do we really want to live in--and what kind of America do we want to leave to our children?
So I call upon all Americans--every mother and father, every businessman and worker, every Governor and every mayor-to join us in this urgent task of conserving America the beautiful.
