    ON THE occasion of Id al Fitr, the special holiday concluding the fasting month of Ramadan, Mrs. Ford and I send our warmest greetings to our fellow Americans of the Islamic Faith.
The diversity of our religious legacy has been a sustaining source of inspiration and a positive influence on our society ever since our Founding Fathers established a system of government dedicated to the principle of religious freedom. Celebrating the reaffirmation of your Faith, this feast is a particularly happy occasion for you and a reminder to the rest of us of the vitality and strength of your heritage in our national life.
Your rededication to Islam's spirit of compassion and human dignity fortifies not just you and your families, but our nation. It is with this in mind that Mrs. Ford and I wish you a most joyous and memorable observance.
GERALD R. FORD
