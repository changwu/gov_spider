    Before I leave tonight, I wanted to say just a word about the shootings at the Jewish community center in Los Angeles.
Once again our Nation has been shaken and our hearts torn by an act of gun violence. To the victims and their families, like all Americans, I offer our thoughts and prayers.
I have been briefed on the situation on the ground. The Federal Government has offered all appropriate assistance to the local law enforcement officials who are working on this case. I wish I could say more conclusive now; we don't know much more than has been reported. I want you to know that I intend to continue to monitor the situation very closely tonight and tomorrow. But again, I say this is another senseless act of gun violence; a lot of shells were found on the scene. It calls on all of us not only to give our thoughts and prayers to the victims and their families but to intensify our resolve to make America a safer place.
Thank you very much.
