    Chicago, IL -- The Obama campaign announced the launch of a student steering committee composed of more than 100 current leaders of the College Democrats of America who will act as student advisors on college grassroots outreach. Senator Obama will speak at the Annual Convention of the College Democrats of America in Columbia, South Carolina this evening.
The Obama Campaign's College Democrat Steering Committee will focus on growing the connecting students with the tools to get involved with the campaign and growing the grassroots student movement from the bottom up. The committee of students will serve as grassroots advisors on outreach to college, university and high school students.
Founded in the summer of 2006, Students for Barack Obama began with a small number of students using Facebook to petition Senator Obama to run for President. The organization has now evolved into what it is today, the official student organization of Obama for America with over 450 student lead chapters nation-wide.
The students work directly with national campaign staff in Chicago and the early primary states on youth vote programs including a program for high school students in Iowa called "BarackStars", door-knocking in college communities, planning for fall voter registration pushes and recruiting for college democrat leaders on campuses in all fifty states.
There are hundreds of current and former members of College Democrats of America supporting Obama and this group will serve as representatives of the community.
