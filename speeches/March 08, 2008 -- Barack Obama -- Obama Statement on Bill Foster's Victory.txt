    Chicago, IL - Today Senator Obama released the following statement in response to Bill Foster's victory in the 14th District of Illinois:
"I want to congratulate my friend Bill Foster on winning his race for Congress. As a distinguished scientist and successful businessman, Congressman-elect Foster has demonstrated the kind of vision and leadership we need in Washington. And his victory today shows that change is sweeping this country. By electing him to a traditionally Republican seat - a seat that former Speaker Dennis Hastert held for 20 years - the people of Illinois have sent an unmistakable message that they're tired of business-as-usual in Washington. I look forward to fighting side-by-side with Congressman-elect Foster to end the Iraq war, to take immediate steps to strengthen our economy, and to bring about real change not just in Illinois, but all across America," said Senator Barack Obama.
