Lou Barletta was one of my first supporters. He is tough on Crime and Borders. Will be a great Senator from Pennsylvania. His opponent is WEAK on Crime ICE and Borders. We need Lou! https://t.co/dcMSi4CPfbRetweets: 16049Favorites: 61053

Countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to Washington to negotiate. This should have taken place many years ago butas the saying goes better late than never!Retweets: 21414Favorites: 100190

Tariffs are the greatest! Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal or it gets hit with Tariffs. It's as simple as that - and everybody's talking! Remember we are the 'piggy bank' that's being robbed. All will be Great!Retweets: 21582Favorites: 94195

I'm very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming Election. Based on the fact that no President has been tougher on Russia than me they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats. They definitely don't want Trump!Retweets: 24460Favorites: 104844
