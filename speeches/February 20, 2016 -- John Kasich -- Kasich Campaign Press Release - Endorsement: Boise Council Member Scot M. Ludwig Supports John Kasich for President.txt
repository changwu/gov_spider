    Boise, Idaho Council Member Scot M. Ludwig today announced his decision to support Ohio Gov. John Kasich for president and join the Kasich for America Idaho leadership team.
Said Ludwig, "Our country is sorely in need of a leader who can cut through all the divisive rhetoric and bring people together. Ohio Gov. John Kasich stands out to me as a candidate who has a record of working constructively across the aisle to solve problems and make a difference in people's lives. He's the kind of leader who is best-equipped to defend our country and put our economy on a better course. I'm proud to support John Kasich's candidacy."

Ludwig, who was appointed to serve on the Boise City Council in February 2015, is one of Idaho's most prominent attorneys in the areas of litigation and family law and co-founder of the Boise firm Ludwig Shoufler Miller Johnson, LLP. He also works as managing director of Broad Street Properties, LLC, a downtown development company.
Said Kasich, "Council Member Ludwig has an astute legal mind and deep roots in Boise that will serve our team well. I'm grateful for his support and expertise as we expand our national efforts to Idaho."
