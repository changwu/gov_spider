    By Registering at One and Two Percent in Three DNC-Qualifying Public Opinion Polls, Ryan Meets Criteria for Participation in the First Democratic Debate on June 26 and 27
YOUNGSTOWN, OH – Just three weeks after announcing his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States, Congressman Tim Ryan (D-OH) qualified for participation in the first Democratic presidential debate in Miami, Florida.
Pursuant to rules set by the Democratic National Committee (DNC), candidates earning at least one percent in three DNC-approved public opinion polls qualify for participation in the first 2020 Democratic presidential debate. Congressman Ryan surpassed that threshold in Monmouth University's first poll of Iowa Democratic voters of the 2020 cycle on April 11, as well as a University of New Hampshire poll released on Monday, April 22. He also registered in the Ipsos Public Affairs and Reuters public poll, released on Wednesday.
"Right out of the gate, Congressman Tim Ryan has been building momentum for his presidential campaign by focusing on healing the deep, painful divides that have ripped apart communities from Steel Country to families across America," said Tim Ryan for America Communications Director Julia Krieger. "There's no question that America is craving the pragmatic, progressive leadership Tim Ryan brings to the table – and he'll continue to champion the solutions we need to innovate our economy, fix our broken health care and education systems, and unite our country with opportunity that rebuilds the American Dream."
