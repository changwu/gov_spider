    "If you show weakness, if you show moral equivocation, then foreign policy adventurism among our adversaries will increase. We do not want a world climate where our adversaries are so tempted to test us and our allies are worried about trusting us. And that is unfortunately the path that we are on right now, and I really worry about that." â€” Paul Ryan

PAUL RYAN: "First of all, peace through strength works. That is -- it is very important that a president speak with a singular voice representing our principles and our values. We don't want people around the world wondering what our values are. We believe in individual rights, and particularly in the Middle East, we believe in women's rights. That's very important. We believe in plurality, tolerance, religious freedom. So it's important that people know who we are and what we believe in and the values we're going to stand up for. That's point number one. But point number two: If you show weakness, if you show moral equivocation, then foreign policy adventurism among our adversaries will increase. We do not want a world climate where our adversaries are so tempted to test us and our allies are worried about trusting us. And that is unfortunately the path that we are on right now, and I really worry about that."
