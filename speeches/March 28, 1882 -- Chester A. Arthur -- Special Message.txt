    To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a communication from the Secretary of the Navy, with accompanying papers, on the subject of purchasing from the American Wood Preserving Company the machinery which was erected by that company at the navy-yard, Boston, under contract with the Navy Department, for the purpose of fully testing the company's process of preserving timber for use in the Navy.
The attention of Congress is invited to the subject.
CHESTER A. ARTHUR
