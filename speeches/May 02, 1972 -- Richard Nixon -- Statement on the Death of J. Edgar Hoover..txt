    ALL Americans today mourn the death of J. Edgar Hoover. He served his Nation as Director of the FBI for 48 years under eight American Presidents with total loyalty, unparalleled ability, and supreme dedication.
It can truly be said of him that he was a legend in his own lifetime. For millions he was the symbol and embodiment of the values he cherished most: courage, patriotism, dedication to his country, and a granite-like honesty and integrity.
In times of controversy, Mr. Hoover was never a man to run from a fight. His magnificent contribution to making this a great and good Nation will be remembered by the American people long after the petty carpings and vicious criticisms of his detractors are forgotten.
The FBI he literally created and built is today universally regarded as the finest law enforcement agency in t-he world. The FBI is the eternal monument honoring this great American.
