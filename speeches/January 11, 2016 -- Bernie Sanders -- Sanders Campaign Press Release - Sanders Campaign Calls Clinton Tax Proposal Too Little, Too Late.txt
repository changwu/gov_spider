    DES MOINES, Iowa â€“ Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Bernie Sanders, issued the following statement on Monday regarding a tax proposal by Hillary Clinton:
"At a time of grotesque income and wealth inequality and when trillions of dollars have been transferred from the middle class to the top one-tenth of 1 percent over the last 30 years, Secretary Clinton's proposal is too little too late. In fact, it would raise less than half of what we need just to pay for paid family and medical leave. We need real tax reform which demands that Wall Street, corporate America and the top 2 percent start paying their fair share."
