    Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Rosh Hashana.
The High Holidays, a time of serious prayer and self-reflection, begin with Rosh Hashana. Signaling the start of a new year, Rosh Hashana asks Jews across the globe to reaffirm their relationship with God and to discover how they might better fulfill God's commandments. But Rosh Hashana is a time for celebration as well, as Jews commemorate the creation of the world and welcome the gift of a new year.
The ten days from Rosh Hashana to the Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur, provide an opportunity to acknowledge past transgressions and resolve to learn from them. As the shofar sounds its stirring notes again this year, I encourage all Americans to reflect on how we can help make our world a better place. As we rejoice in our many blessings, let us remember the ways that God's gifts can be used to fulfill our obligation to help others and to create a brighter future for ourselves, our families, and our fellow citizens.
Hillary joins me in sending best wishes for a memorable celebration, a meaningful period of reflection, and a new year sweet with the promise of peace, joy, and prosperity.
