    Our Nation's livestock producers are hurting. A severe drought in the Southwest has reduced available forage in pastures while raising the cost of cattle feed. Producers also have been hurt by low beef prices.
I am taking action today to help livestock producers weather these tough times. Specifically, I am declaring a State of Emergency in the Southwest and other areas, enabling the Secretary of Agriculture to release about $40 million in needed assistance to producers from the Feed Grain Disaster Reserve.
The Department of Agriculture will sell about 15 million bushels of grain from the Disaster Reserve, in order to make disaster assistance payments to livestock producers in the drought region. The Department will make the sales in a way that minimizes market disruptions.
Secretary Glickman and Deputy Secretary Rominger recently visited some of the areas hardest hit by the drought, and I have heard from Members of Congress and others about the situation there. I know how badly producers are suffering, and I am determined to do whatever I can to help.
