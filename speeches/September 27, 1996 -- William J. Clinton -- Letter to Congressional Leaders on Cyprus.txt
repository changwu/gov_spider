    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question. The previous submission covered progress through May 31, 1996. The current submission covers the period June 1, 1996, through July 31, 1996.
I was pleased to welcome President Clerides to the White House on June 17. His visit capped a series of personal consultations on Cyprus I have had with regional leaders, beginning with Turkish President Demirel this March. During the reporting period, I dispatched U.N. Ambassador Albright and my Cyprus emissary, Richard Beattie, to the region to explore opportunities for progress toward a comprehensive solution. Following their trip, Ambassador Albright and Mr. Beattie confirmed to me that, notwithstanding the many disagreements between the parties, the United States should stay actively engaged on Cyprus. I remain committed to doing all we can to support the parties' efforts to bring about a settlement.
Based on consultations with the U.N. force commander in Cyprus, Ambassador Albright and Mr. Beattie proposed during their trip that the military commanders on the island meet to discuss implementation of practical measures to reduce tensions along the U.N. Buffer Zone. We hope that the parties will overcome their disagreement over whom should participate in the meeting, which has prevented it from taking place. We believe the tragic events of August underscore the urgent need to move immediately to reduce the potential for violence along the Buffer Zone.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
