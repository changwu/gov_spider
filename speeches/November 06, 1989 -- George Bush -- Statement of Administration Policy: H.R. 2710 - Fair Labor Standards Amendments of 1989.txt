    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Murphy (D) PA and 40 others)
The President on October 31, 1989, announced agreement on a minimum wage package consistent with criteria that he set forth earlier this year. The minimum wage package would (1) increase the Federal hourly minimum wage to $4.25 effective April l, 1991, and (2) provide for a training wage for workers under the age of 20. Accordingly, the Administration supports enactment of H.R. 2710 as passed by the House. This minimum wage package gives relief to those with the greatest need in our workforce and also protects job opportunities for young workers.
