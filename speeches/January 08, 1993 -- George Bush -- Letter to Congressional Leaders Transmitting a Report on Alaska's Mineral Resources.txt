    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I transmit herewith the 1992 Annual Report on Alaska's Mineral Resources, as required by section 1011 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (Public Law 96 - 487; 16 U.S.C. 3151). This report contains pertinent public information relating to minerals in Alaska gathered by the U.S. Geological Survey, the Bureau of Mines, and other Federal agencies. This report is significant because of the importance of the mineral and energy resources of Alaska to the future well-being of the Nation.
Sincerely,
George Bush
