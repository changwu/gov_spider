The Very Rev. Randolph Marshall Hollerith, dean of the cathedral, welcomed the attendants by calling Senator Dole "one of the greatest of the greatest generation."
President Biden sat with first lady Jill Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff.
In his tribute to Sen. Dole, whom he served with in the Senate, President Biden began by talking of the senator's heroism during World War II and talked about his courage, goodness and grit.
"God, what courage Bob Dole had," Biden said.
Please check against transcript.
"I found Bob to be a man of principle. pragmatism and enormous integrity," he said.
Biden also discussed Dole's willingness to cross party lines on issues like Social Security and gave him credit for the Martin Luther King Jr. national holiday.
" He never forgot the people who sent him to Washington'" and "lived by a code of honor" and "was a man of his word," Biden said.
While Dole "could be partisan," Biden said, "he was a patriot."
"Taps is now sounding for this giant of our time," he said.
"I salute you, my friend."

He declined to comment on the Supreme Court Texas decision, saying he hadn't read it yet.

He said inflation was "a real bump in the road."

On BBB bill "It's reducing costs for ordinary Americans."
He said the rest of the economy was doing well, but with infllation, the focus was "all on the downside."
"Inflation is affecting people's lives."
He said it was a "supply chain problem" as COVID had an impact on producing products.

WH Pool Report 20 - more Biden comments 
Thanks to Geoff Earle and Otter, a partial recording of Biden's Q&A. It's not a full transcript because some words were indecipherable.
There was no good broadcast recording because as Biden started to take questions, music started blaring.
"Every other aspect of the economy is racing ahead, doing incredibly well. We've never had this kind of growth in 60 years."
"But inflation is affecting people's lives."
"What's inflation all about? They're paying more for things they need than they had to pay before. That's the bottom line."
Build Back Better will reduce costs of child care, health care costs.
"The reason why people think is going to, why economists think it's going to, in fact, diminish the impact on prices is because it's reducing costs for ordinary people."
"Downside is prices have gone up because of supply chain concerns."
Will see gas prices go down.
"It's a real bump in the road. It does affect families. You walk into a grocery store and you're paying more for whatever you're purchasing."
Government spending? "That's not the reason for inflation. The reason for inflation that we have a supply chain problem that is really severe."
Pool never heard a question that apparently was about Joe Manchin -- someone had drowned it out asking a question that was not answered -- but Biden said he would meet with him next week. That's what Jen Psaki said at the briefing today, referencing that exchange that we could not hear.
