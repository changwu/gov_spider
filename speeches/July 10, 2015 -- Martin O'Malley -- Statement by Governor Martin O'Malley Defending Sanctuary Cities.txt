    BALTIMORE, MDâ€”Today, Governor Martin O'Malley released the following statement defending sanctuary cities:
"It's lamentable that the senseless and tragic act of violence that occurred in San Francisco is prompting a rush to judgment and finger pointing: we can and should do better. Local governments should not be blamed for the Federal Government's inability to fix our broken immigration system nor should they be held responsible for doing the Federal Government's job."
