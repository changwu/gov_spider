    
All across the country, Marco volunteers are committing to Super Saturdays.
This past Saturday, our team in New Hampshire knocked on over 3,000 doors and made tons of phone calls in support of Marco.

So, what exactly is a Super Saturday?

The most effective way to help Marco on the groundSuper Saturdays are our "big pushes" on the phones and going door-to-door. Every voter contact will help spread Marco's vision for a New American Century.


A great way to meet other members of #TeamMarcoThe campaign never really stops, but Super Saturdays are a big deal, and you'll meet lots of other Rubio supporters if you come to help.

A big sign of momentum for Marco's campaignWhen you can bring together dozens or even hundreds of members of #TeamMarco on a single weekend, it reinforces all the progress we're making.
