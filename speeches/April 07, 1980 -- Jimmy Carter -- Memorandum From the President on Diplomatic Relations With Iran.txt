    Memorandum for the Secretary of the Treasury
In connection with my decision today to close Iranian diplomatic facilities in the United States, I am directing that the Uniformed Division of the Secret Service provide any assistance necessary to the Secretary of State and the Attorney General in order to make my decision effective, including control of movement of persons and property into and out of Iranian diplomatic facilities in the District of Columbia.
