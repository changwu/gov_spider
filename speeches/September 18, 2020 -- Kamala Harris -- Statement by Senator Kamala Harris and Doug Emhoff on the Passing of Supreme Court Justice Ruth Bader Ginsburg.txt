    Tonight we mourn, we honor, and we pray for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her family. Tomorrow we fight for her legacy.
For all who believe in the power of the law as a force for change, Justice Ginsburg was and will always be a titan. She was a relentless defender of justice in our country and a legal mind for the ages. She also remained, throughout her life, a proud daughter of Brooklyn, with immigrant roots and a fire lit from an early age as a champion for progress and equality.
Justice Ginsburg was known to pose the question, 'What is the difference between a bookkeeper in the Garment District and a Supreme Court justice?" Her answer: "One generation." She never forgot where she came from, or those who sacrificed to help her grow into the historic icon we all came to revere.
Even as we focus on the life that she led and process tonight's grief, her legacy and the future of the court to which she dedicated so much can't disappear from our effort to honor her. In some of her final moments with her family, she shared her fervent wish to "not be replaced until a new President is installed." We will honor that wish.
Justice Ginsburg used every ounce of life she was bestowed to urge our nation down a path toward equal justice. Doug and I send our heartfelt prayers to Jane and James, and the entire Ginsburg family, particularly on this holy day of Rosh Hashanah. According to Jewish tradition, on Rosh Hashanah we begin a period of reflection. Tonight, we reflect on the legacy of Justice Ginsburg and we honor her belief in creating a fair and just world by recommitting to fight for that justice.
