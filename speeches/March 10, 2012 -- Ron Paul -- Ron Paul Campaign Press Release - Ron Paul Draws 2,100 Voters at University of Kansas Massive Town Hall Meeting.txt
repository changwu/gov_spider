LENEXA, Kansas — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul drew a remarkable more than 2,100 voters to his University of Kansas Town Hall Meeting held tonight. Over 2,000 voters filled the KU Lied Center to see the 12-term Congressman from Texas speak and answer questions, with an additional more than 100 others filling public entryways.
Dr. Paul's KU Town Hall Meeting, co-sponsored by 'Youth for Ron Paul,' took place at 7:30 p.m. CST at the University of Kansas — Lied Center, located at 1600 Stewart Drive, Lawrence, KS 66045. Congressman Paul discussed shrinking the scale and scope of the federal government to bring it more in line with its constitutional limits, and outlined his path-breaking 'Plan to Restore America,' an oft-praised fiscal blueprint designed to put the nation's economy on track to rapid but sustainable growth.
