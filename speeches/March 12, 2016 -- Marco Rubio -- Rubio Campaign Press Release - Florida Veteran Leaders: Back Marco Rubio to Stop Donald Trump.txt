    Florida Veterans Are Backing Marco
 
March 12, 2016
Today, Team Marco announced a growing group of Florida veterans endorsing Marco for President. 
Ahead of the March 15 primary, veterans in Florida and across the nation know that Marco is the best choice for Florida's military community and the candidate most fit to serve as Commander-in-Chief.
Florida Veterans for Rubio Co-Chairs Lieutenant Colonel Chris Hart and The Honorable Rudi Gresham called on Florida veterans to unite behind Marco to stop Donald Trump:
Marco Rubio fought for veterans in the United States Senate and will do the same in the White House. Donald Trump, a man who dodged the draft by claiming 'bone spurs' prevented him from serving, has repeatedly denigrated the service of heroes like Colonel Leo Thorsness, POW and Medal of Honor recipient, who was among the many POWs Trump slurred when he said he 'like[s] the ones who weren't captured,' and called them losers.
Trump does not care about veterans unless there is something in it for him. Marco Rubio worked across the aisle to bring more accountability to the Veterans Administration. Most importantly, Marco understands the threats America faces around the world and has the proven judgment required to be Commander-in-Chief. We urge all our fellow Florida veterans to reject Donald Trump and vote for Marco Rubio for President.
Here's the full list of members of the Florida Veterans for Marco coalition:
