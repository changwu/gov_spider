    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Consistent with section 2103(c)(2) of the Trade Act of 2002, I ask that the Congress extend trade promotion authority procedures for 2 years, and I enclose a report prepared by my Administration on trade negotiations conducted under those procedures.
Trade promotion authority is essential to expanding opportunities for American businesses, workers, and farmers. Working with the Congress, my Administration has completed trade agreements with 12 nations on 5 continents that will open a combined market of 124 million consumers for America's farmers, manufacturers, and service providers.
We must continue to pursue bilateral and regional agreements to open new markets, and we must complete negotiations in the World Trade Organization to reduce global barriers to trade. We will continue to enforce vigorously the trade laws so that American businesses and workers are competing on a level playing field.
Free and fair trade creates jobs, raises living standards, and lowers prices for families here at home. Trade agreements also deepen our partnerships with countries that want to trade in freedom. I look forward to the continued close cooperation with the Congress in pursuing these objectives.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
