    I appreciate the bipartisan support in the United States Senate for the CAFTA-DR agreement, which is good for American workers, good for our farmers, and good for small businesses. When passed, it will eliminate trade barriers immediately on 80 percent of U.S.-made goods and the rest within a few years, which will help increase sales abroad and job creation at home. The agreement is also a strong boost for young democracies in our own hemisphere, whose success is important for America's national security and for reducing illegal immigration.
