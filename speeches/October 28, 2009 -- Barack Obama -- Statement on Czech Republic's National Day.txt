    On behalf of the American people, I extend my warmest wishes to those celebrating the Czech Republic's National Day. Whether they are Americans that trace their roots back to the Czech Republic, or those living there now, the United States and the Czech Republic are close allies and essential partners. Our nations share a history of struggle on behalf of liberty and democracy, and our people have forged a strong and lasting partnership that is grounded in these shared values. Czech Americans trace their roots back to before our country was founded, they have enriched our communities and our country, and they continue to play a key role in shaping the direction of our Nation.
