    With the release of today's NBC/WSJ poll showing John Kasich in 2nd in New York, it's clear Kasich is the strongest alternative candidate to Trump in upcoming primaries. The most recent polling shows Kasich is now running 2nd in the major upcoming primary states of New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland.

To take on the Clinton machine, Republicans require a nominee with the record and readiness to win in November and serve as a strong conservative president.
Meanwhile, the net favorability of both Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are at historic lows, particularly among the key voting blocs of women and Independents.

Only John Kasich is in position to defeat Hillary Clinton in November.
