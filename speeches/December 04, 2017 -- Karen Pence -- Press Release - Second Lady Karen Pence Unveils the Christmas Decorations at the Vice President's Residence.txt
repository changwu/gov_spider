    Washington, DC—Second Lady Karen Pence continues the tradition of decorating the Vice President's Residence for the Christmas season. This year's theme is "Make the Season Bright" with metallic ornaments, stars, and candles throughout the residence.  There are four Christmas trees on the main floor, donated by Hedlund Christmas Trees of Montesano, Washington. Thirty-six wreaths hang throughout the residence; nearly a mile of Christmas lights brighten the place; and 800 yards of ribbon adorn the Christmas trees.  Approximately 40 staff and volunteers helped to decorate the residence. In the foyer, there is a fireplace with stockings hanging on the mantel for all of the members of the Pence family, including their pets. Throughout the month of December, the Pence family will welcome more than 2,000 guests into the Vice President's Residence. The photos below provide a look at Christmas inside the Vice President's Residence.
