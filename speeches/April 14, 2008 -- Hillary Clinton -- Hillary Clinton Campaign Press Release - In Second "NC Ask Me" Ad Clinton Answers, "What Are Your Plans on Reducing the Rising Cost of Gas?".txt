    A week after she invited North Carolinians to ask her "anything and everything," Senator Hillary Clinton answers one of the nearly 10,000 questions submitted through the NCAskMe.com website in a new 60-second ad. Campaign staff and volunteers are calling back every person that submitted a question to make sure their voices are heard. Senator Clinton will continue to answer voters' questions over the coming weeks.
Tammie Bright, 40, of Cherryville submitted the first question selected. The mother of three, who makes truck parts for a living, asked Hillary, "What are your plans on reducing the rising cost of gas?"
Watch Hillary answer Tammie's question here.
Following is the complete script for the ad.
"Tammie"

Hillary Clinton: I told you I wanted to have a conversation, so I asked you to send me your questions and concerns and so many North Carolinians have done that.
Tammie from Cherryville asks, "We in North Carolina are feeling the crunch of rising gas prices. It's harder for working families even to afford to drive to work. What are your plans on reducing the rising cost of gas?"
Well, Tammie, I hear this everywhere. People like you and everyone else are paying way too much at the pump. We need to reach energy independence and the only way we'll do that is to stop buying oil from over there and start creating alternative renewable energy over here.
I'd invest $150 billion in research and development of new kinds of energy. Let's put more hybrid vehicles on the fast track. And when we create new clean energies and technologies, we'll be creating new jobs right here in North Carolina.
So there'll be plenty of work to drive to.
Thanks for keeping the questions coming. Just go to NCAskMe.com.
I'm Hillary Clinton and I approved this message.
