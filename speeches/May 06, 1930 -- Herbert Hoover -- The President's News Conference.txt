    LONDON NAVAL TREATY
THE PRESIDENT. I have one question this morning that I can reply to, but in the nature of things it must be background matter. It is as to whether I would care to say whether the ratification of the London treaty is a partisan matter or not. It certainly is not--broad foreign policies of the Nation and not partisan policies. When our delegation went to London they went as Americans and not as members of a political party, and there is no partisanship whatever in this treaty.
That is all I have got.
