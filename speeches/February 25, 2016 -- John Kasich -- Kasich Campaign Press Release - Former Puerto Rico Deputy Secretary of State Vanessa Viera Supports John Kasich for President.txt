    Today former Puerto Rico Deputy Secretary of State Vanessa Viera announced her support for Gov. John Kasich's presidential campaign and joined Kasich for America's leadership team in Puerto Rico.
Viera served in the administration of former Puerto Rico Governor Luis Fortu√±o (R) as Deputy Secretary of State from 2009 to 2012 and served on the Platform Committee of the 2012 Republican National Convention. An attorney by profession, Viera is dedicated to healthcare issues and is an advocate for women in conservative politics.
Said Viera, "Puerto Rico has no greater ally in this presidential race than John Kasich. He respects our right to self-determination and shares the desire to resolve our legal status as soon as possible. I'm confident that the nation will grow stronger and safer from his plans to cut taxes, balance the budget and strengthen our national defense. It's an honor to join the team, and I look forward to sharing Gov. Kasich's message of optimism and results in the weeks to come."

Viera joins Jorge L. San Miguel, Vice President of the Puerto Rico Republican Party, on Kasich for America's Puerto Rico leadership team.
Said Kasich, "Vanessa Viera is a dedicated public servant and a talented conservative activist. It's a real pleasure to welcome her to our Puerto Rico team. I have no doubt that our ground game will benefit immeasurably from her deep knowledge of the issues that matter to Puerto Rican voters."
