    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Glenn (D) Ohio and 42 others)
The Administration strongly supports S. 185. This balanced legislation gives Federal employees the opportunity to enjoy many of the constitutional rights exercised by their fellow citizens, while providing strong measures to protect these employees from political coercion.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
S. 185 could affect direct spending and receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA).
OMB's preliminary pay-as-you-go scoring estimates for this bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If s. 185 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within five days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending and receipts will be reported to Congress at the end of the congressional session, as required by OBRA.
