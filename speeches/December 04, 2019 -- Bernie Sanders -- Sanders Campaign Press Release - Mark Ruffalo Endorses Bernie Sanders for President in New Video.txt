    WASHINGTON â€“ In a new video released on Wednesday by Bernie 2020, actor and activist Mark Ruffalo announced his endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign for president. Ruffalo cites the senator's position on health care, refusing corporate and PAC money, support for a Green New Deal and free college education for all as reasons for his endorsement.
"We need a movement leader," Ruffalo says in the video. "We need a movement organizer. We need a leader who's actually one of us, and Bernie is one of us and he's always been one of us."
Ruffalo's endorsement comes days before the premiere of his film, Dark Waters, which tells the true story of an attorney who uncovers a secret hidden by one of the world's largest corporations connected to unexplained deaths in a community that had been exposed to deadly chemicals for decades. Sanders is outspoken on the campaign trail about the need to overhaul our nation's water infrastructure, including a visit to Denmark, SC in May to tour homes where a dangerous chemical was pumped into the community's water supply.
