    Mitt Romney today announced the support of additional Oklahoma leaders.
"I am pleased to have so much support from so many in Oklahoma," said Mitt Romney. "Their hard work will be necessary to defeat President Obama in November, put in place policies that work for the American people, and bring back economic prosperity to Oklahoma and the rest of the country."
Announcing his support, former Oklahoma Republican Party Chairman Steve Edwards said, "The top goals for conservatives in Oklahoma and across the country are to defeat President Obama and put in place a pro-growth agenda that will reverse the failed policies of the last three years. In Mitt Romney, we have a man with the leadership experience and bold economic plan to both defeat President Obama and put our country on the right track again. I am proud to announce my support and encourage all Oklahomans looking for a different direction in Washington to support Mitt Romney on Tuesday."
