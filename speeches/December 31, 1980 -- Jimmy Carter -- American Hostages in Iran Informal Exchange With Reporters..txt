    Q. Mr. President, do you think we're close to a deal on the hostages?
THE PRESIDENT. No, I can't predict that. But we've made a reasonable proposal through the Algerians, and I think that it would be to the advantage of the Iranians and, certainly, to the advantage of our imperiled hostages, if they would accept what we have proposed.
Q. But the latest statement from Iran, however, seemed to suggest they might want to look at this one; they might want to soften their opposition.
THE PRESIDENT. Any prediction of a favorable response from the Iranians has always been mistaken, but I hope they will go ahead and resolve this.
Q. What's your hunch?
THE PRESIDENT. Wait and see.
Q. How are you feeling?
THE PRESIDENT. Very good. I feel fine. It's just a strap on my shoulder. No problem.
