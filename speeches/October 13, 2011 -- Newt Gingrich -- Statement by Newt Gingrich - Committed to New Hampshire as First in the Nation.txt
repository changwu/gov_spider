    Atlanta, GA - Newt Gingrich released the following statement today regarding the scheduling of the First in the Nation New Hampshire Primary:
"As a citizen, I have always supported New Hampshire's First in the Nation Primary. Now, as a candidate for president, I am committed to competing in and maintaining the first in the nation status of the New Hampshire primary. Therefore, I will not compete in a state which holds its contest inside of one week of New Hampshire. I trust Governors Romney and Perry will join me in protecting the New Hampshire primary and campaigning in New Hampshire towards a January 10th primary contest."
