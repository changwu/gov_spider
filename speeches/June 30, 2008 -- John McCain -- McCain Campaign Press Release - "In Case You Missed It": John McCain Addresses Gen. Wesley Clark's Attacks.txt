Reporter: "What's your reaction to that line of criticism?"
John McCain: "I think that kind of thing is unnecessary. I'm proud of my record of service, and I have plenty of friends and leaders who will attest to that. The important thing is that if that's the kind of campaign that Senator Obama and his surrogates and his supporters want to wage, I understand that, but it doesn't reduce the price of a gallon of gas by one penny. It doesn't achieve our energy independence, make it come any closer. It doesn't help an American stay in their home who are at risk of losing it today. And it certainly doesn't do anything to address the challenges that Americans have in keeping their jobs, their homes and supporting their families. So, I intend to, in this campaign, to discuss the challenges we face, things like the Lexington Project and many other proposals and ideas and a plan of action I have to help the families of this nation. Kelly?"
Reporter: "Good afternoon. Do you believe that Senator Obama needs to specifically address the General Wesley Clark comment? Do you get any sense it's a part of a broader strategy?"
John McCain: "I know we've heard this many times in other comments that have been made, but no, that's certainly up to Senator Obama."
