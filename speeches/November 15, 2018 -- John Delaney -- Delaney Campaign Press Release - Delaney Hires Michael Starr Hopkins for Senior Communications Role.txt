    WASHINGTON – Presidential candidate Congressman John K Delaney has hired Michael Starr Hopkins as his National Press Secretary. Hopkins most recently was a senior communication strategist for CateComm, where he consulted on Andrew Gillum's campaign for governor – one of the most competitive races this year – and as Communications Director for Florida Attorney General candidate, Sean Shaw.
"Michael is a real talent and we are proud to have him on board. His insight into the media landscape and his relationships will help us break through the noise and communicate our message to the American people," said Congressman Delaney. "We've made tremendous progress on our campaign over the last year and adding Michael will help shine a light on our work and stand out in a likely crowded Democratic primary."
"I am excited to join Team Delaney and get this country working again. Americans know that there is no problem that we cannot solve if we focus on solutions rather than personalities. As President, I know that John Delaney will unite our country and focus on policies that will grow the middle class and expand opportunities for all."
Hopkins worked on Secretary Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and for President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign. Hopkins regularly appears on Fox News and MSNBC
