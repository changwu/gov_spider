    To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
I transmit herewith a letter from the Secretary of the Navy, containing one from Captain John Rodgers, president of the Naval Board, accompanied by a description of the inclined plane, dock, and fixtures for hauling up ships, and an estimate of the cost and materials and workmanship necessary for the completion of a dock and wharves, proposed to be connected with the inclined plane constructed at the navy-yard, Washington, and recommend the same to the attentive consideration of Congress.
It is confidently believed that this invention combines advantages so highly useful as to justify the appropriation required.
JAMES MONROE.
JANUARY 28, 1823.
