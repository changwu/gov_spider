    Local news outlets across the country are highlighting President Biden's actions to strengthen families' retirement savings, create good-paying jobs through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and honor extraordinary Americans who embody the soul of our nation.
Following his trip to Cleveland, Ohio, newspapers and broadcast outlets across the Buckeye state covered President Biden's announcement of the American Rescue Plan's Special Financial Assistance program. This initiative will protect two to three million workers and retirees from facing dramatic cuts to their pensions, and it will reverse previous cuts to their pensions.
Americans nationwide also witnessed President Biden present the Presidential Medal of Freedom – our Nation's highest civilian honor – to individuals who represent the best of America because of their exemplary contributions to the prosperity, values, or security of the United States and world.
And from Long Island to Los Angeles, travelers are reading about how President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is building better airports, investing nearly $1 billion across 85 airports to improve customer experiences, move more goods through the economy to lower prices, and enhance U.S. competitiveness.
