    "Joe Biden cannot be let off the hook after his campaign issued a weak statement from a mid-level staffer. We still haven't heard from Joe Biden himself on the radical 'Defund the Police' movement in the Democrat Party. It would have been the simplest thing in the world to stick his name on a statement, but he didn't even do that. We have previously seen the Biden campaign say one thing on an issue right before their candidate says another. Until Americans hear from Joe Biden himself, they have no way of knowing where he really stands. Joe Biden is the leader of his party and he could single-handedly step in and steer elected Democrats away from this terrible policy, which invites chaos in American communities, but he has remained secluded in his basement saying nothing. The 'Defund the Police' train has already left the Democrat station, and Joe Biden is merely a weak passenger."
