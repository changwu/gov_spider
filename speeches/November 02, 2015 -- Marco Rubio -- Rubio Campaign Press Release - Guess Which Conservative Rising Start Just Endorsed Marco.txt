Well, today I am proud to announce my endorsement of Marco Rubio to be the next President of the United States. Our country needs a new generation of leadership, and I believe that Marco Rubio presents this nation with the greatest possibilities and opportunities to meet the challenges of the next generation."
...
"After the debate in Colorado, I thought Marco did an excellent job framing what I believe to be what Colorado and this country wants. Somebody they can be excited about. Somebody who is looking forward toward the future, not looking back at the past. Somebody who understands that we're always looking at the next horizon and not trying to go backwards in policies that have failed. And, if you look at the policies, the campaigns of the Democrats — Hillary Clinton — they're just simply trying to argue about how much further left or how further deeper into socialism we can go, and I believe Marco Rubio presents us with the opportunity that Americans can be excited about, and that's generational opportunity, that generational choice for all of America."
Proud to support @marcorubio for a new generation of leadership. https://t.co/ltykzNJ3xV
