    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, pursuant to Section 123(d) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the text of the proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Colombia Concerning Civil Uses of Nuclear Energy and accompanying exchange of notes; my written approval, authorization and determination concerning the agreement; and the memorandum of the Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency with the Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement concerning the agreement. The joint memorandum submitted to me by the Secretaries of State and Energy, which includes a summary analysis of the provisions of the agreement, and the views and recommendations of the Members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency are also enclosed.
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of March 10, 1978 sets forth certain requirements for new or amended peaceful nuclear cooperation agreements with other countries. In my judgment, the proposed agreement for cooperation between the United States and Colombia, together with its accompanying exchange of notes, meets all statutory requirements.
The proposed bilateral agreement between us reflects the desire of the Government of the United States and the Government of Colombia to update the framework for peaceful nuclear cooperation between our two countries in a manner that recognizes both the shared nonproliferation objectives and the close relationship between the United States and Colombia in the peaceful application of nuclear energy. The proposed agreement will, in my view, further the non-proliferation and other foreign policy interests of the United States.
I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested agencies in reviewing the proposed agreement and have determined that its performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved the agreement and authorized its execution, and urge that the Congress give it favorable consideration.
