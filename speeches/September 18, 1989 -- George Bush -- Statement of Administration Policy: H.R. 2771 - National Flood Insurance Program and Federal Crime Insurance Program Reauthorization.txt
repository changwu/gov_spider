    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Erdreich (D) Alabama and 3 others)
The Administration does not object to House passage of H.R. 2771, but will seek amendments in the Senate to delete: (1) section 2, which would reauthorize the Federal Crime Insurance Program; and (2) the limitation on premium increases in the Flood Insurance Program, which could prevent the program from becoming actuarially sound. The Administration believes that the Crime Insurance Program does not address a national problem; the issue of crime insurance should be handled at the State level.
