    My dear Miss Lawrence:
I am asking an old friend, Basil O'Connor, president of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, to bring you a message tonight at the Victory Dinner so appropriately tendered to you at Town Hall Club in New York City.
Your courage and faith and determination in overcoming the after-effects of infantile paralysis and thereby restoring to the public the opportunity of enjoying your beautiful art—all result in a victory—your victory—which is an inspiration to everyone at any time.
But today when all we love and cherish is jeopardized by those who take their rules of life from the brutality of barbarism and preach and practice that all but the physically perfect should be summarily liquidated, your victory exposes with the light of truth the godlessness of the lie they teach.
In the days ahead, while we fight for life itself, those whose trials and sorrows may be many and heavy will courageously carry on in the spirit you have so nobly exhibited.
Mirrored in your great victory for many years to come, those beset with burdens and harassed with handicaps will see the glory and the satisfaction of the good fight—well won.
From an old veteran to a young recruit my message to you is "Carry on."
Cordially yours,
