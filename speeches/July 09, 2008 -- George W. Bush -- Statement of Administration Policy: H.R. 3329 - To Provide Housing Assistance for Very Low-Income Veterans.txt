(House)
(Rep. Al Green (D) TX and 51 cosponsors)
The Administration is deeply committed to providing veterans with housing assistance and supportive services. H.R. 3329, the Homes for Heroes Act, while well-intentioned, duplicates programs to assist veterans that are already in place and successfully administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). For instance, HUD already funds veteran-specific projects, provides permanent housing for low-income, homeless, and disabled veterans, and coordinates its programs closely with those administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). HUD and VA continue to make significant investments in the provision of housing and services for homeless veterans. Last year, HUD awarded more than $730 million to projects that serve and target, among others, homeless veterans. VA also expects to spend more than $300 million this year in programs to assist homeless veterans. Additionally, HUD and VA just implemented a supportive housing program that is providing thousands of rental vouchers and a variety of services for homeless veterans.
The Administration's major problem with H.R. 3329, however, is that the bill would apply the Davis-Bacon Act's prevailing wage requirements to the construction of units assisted with funds authorized under a new program. Therefore, the bill is contrary to the Administration's long-standing policy of opposing any statutory attempt to expand or contract the applicability of Davis-Bacon Act prevailing wage requirements. For this reason, if the bill were presented to the President in its current form, his Senior Advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.
