    CHARLESTON, S.C. â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign on Tuesday continued his push to ramp up outreach on African-American radio stations in South Carolina with the release of a new ad. The ad, "One Candidate," emphasizes Sanders' fight to "end institutional racism and reform our broken criminal justice system."
"Millions of lives are being wrecked, families are being torn apart and we are spending huge sums of taxpayer money locking people up," Sanders says in the 60-second spot that will air on stations in Charleston, Columbia, Florence, Myrtle Beach and Greenville for ten days.
The ad, narrated by "House of Cards" star Reg E. Cathey, also highlights Sanders' proposals to create 13 million new jobs by rebuilding America's crumbling infrastructure, Medicare-for-all and tuition-free public colleges and universities.
"Our third radio ad is part of a broader effort to engage with African-Americans in South Carolina and spread Sen. Sanders' grassroots message to local communities," said state director Chris Covert. "Sanders speaks honestly and consistently to the issues that directly impact South Carolinians and has a proven record of fighting on behalf of hardworking Americans struggling in our rigged economy."
