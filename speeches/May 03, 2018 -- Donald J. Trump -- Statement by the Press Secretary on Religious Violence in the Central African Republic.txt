    The United States is extremely concerned about recent attacks against civilian centers, including Tuesday's attack on a Christian church in the Fatima neighborhood of Bangui and the retaliatory attacks on Muslim community members. We urge Central African Republic (CAR) government officials to provide safety and security for all of its citizens, regardless of faith. CAR's security forces must be professional in the face of ongoing security challenges. We support the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission's rapid response to protect civilians and fulfill their mandate.
Most importantly, we call on CAR's citizens to reject incitement to violence and hatred, especially by armed groups looking to exploit the current situation for their own benefit. The United States supports the people of CAR and their elected government as they build toward better security, peace and prosperity.
