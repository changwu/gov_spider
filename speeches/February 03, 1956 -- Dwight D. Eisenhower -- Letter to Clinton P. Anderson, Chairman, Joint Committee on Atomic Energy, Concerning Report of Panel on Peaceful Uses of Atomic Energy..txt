Dear Senator Anderson:
I am very much obliged for your letter of January 30th forwarding a copy of the Report of the Panel of distinguished citizens, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Robert McKinney, who have studied the impact of peaceful use of atomic energy and the work of the Atomic Energy Commission.
The members of the Panel have performed a valuable public service and deserve the sincere thanks of the Government. Their work will be of special assistance to those bearing responsibility for developing and fostering the peaceful uses of atomic energy, both at home and abroad--in particular, the State Department and the Atomic Energy Commission--and careful attention will be given to the findings and recommendations of the Report.
The confirmation by the Panel that there is reason for pride in the Commission's accomplishments to date is a source of gratification to me, and of confidence that there will be continued and effective efforts toward an ever-widening peaceful use of atomic energy in the future.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
