    The President. Look, this meeting is about the super collider. And I just want to thank these most distinguished scientists for taking the strong scientific case up to Capitol Hill in support of this project. It is important not just for national pride; it's important to science generally that this be fully funded and that we stay out front, working, of course, with international partners the best we can, but that we remain out front. And I'm anxious to hear from you how you feel, sir, your testimony went. And thank you very much for going up there to the Senate. We've got to get in the Senate and get approved that which we failed to do in the House.
Dr. Schwitters. I think we had a chance to make the case for the SSC. We talked about the long-term value and need in the science and then the value of doing this kind of research for the country. We had a few critical questions, but I think that the team answered them well because we do have good answers.
The President. Well, what we've got to do is get it restored in the conference and get this under control. We're fighting for it, and we are committed to it. We have a handful of these major scientific projects that need support, even though we've got tough budgetary conditions. This is no time to cut the funding for this project. We will fight with you for it.
Dr. Schwitters. Thank you very much. We really appreciate that.
