    Community leaders and gun violence prevention advocates are applauding President Biden's new efforts to fight gun crime and keep our communities safe, which he unveiled yesterday with Attorney General Merrick Garland in New York City at NYPD Headquarters alongside Mayor Eric Adams and Governor Kathy Hochul.
The new measures being taken by the Biden Administration earned praise for addressing key issues driving gun violence, including the targeting of interstate gun trafficking, the launching of a National Ghost Gun Enforcement Initiative, and redoubling the White House's commitment to investing in putting more cops on the beat and in proven community violence intervention programs like the one the President toured in Queens.
This plan builds on the steps the President has taken since the beginning of his Administration to stop the flow of guns being used in crimes, bolster law enforcement, and increase funding for community-based solutions to make our neighborhoods safer – including through violence interruption programs, expanding economic opportunities, and reducing recidivism.
See what they're saying below:
New York City Mayor Eric Adams: "I want to take my hat off to the President. For far too long, we did not have a 9-11 approach to gun violence. What we did around terrorism when international terrorists came to destroy the peacefulness in our country, we responded accordingly. City, state, and federal agencies came together. We are not doing that with the terror that is playing out in cities across America including NYC. What I'm saying to the President today is we need funding for the ATF, $1.5 billion, to make sure they can do their jobs to stop the flow of guns. We need help with our crisis management team. He's going to announce the proposal of having Congress give them an additional $500 million, and then we need a combination of coming together to go after the flow of guns, ghost guns, and the other problems we are facing."

From creating a gun trafficking strike force here in New York City, to launching a National Ghost Gun Enforcement Initiative, to cracking down on the "Iron Pipeline," these efforts are essential to our intelligence-driven approach to eradicating gun violence on New York City streets. There is a need for all of us – law enforcement, elected officials, community leaders, clergy and the public – to join together to rebalance justice with fairness. The time for action is now to ensure a safe city for our children, neighbors and brave police officers." [Statement, 2/3/22]

Milwaukee County Executive David C. Crowley: "This is the kind of leadership needed to address the root causes of gun violence. The President is using the tools at his disposal to tackle the epidemic of gun violence by directing historic levels of funding to expand community policing & community violence interventions. These are neighborhood-based programs proven to combat gun violence. We should be investing more in them to deliver meaningful change on gun violence for families who have demanded action for years. While the President will continue doing everything in his power to make our communities safer, Congress also needs to do its part. It's long past time for Congress to pass universal background checks, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, close loopholes to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and repeal the liability shield for gun manufacturers."
