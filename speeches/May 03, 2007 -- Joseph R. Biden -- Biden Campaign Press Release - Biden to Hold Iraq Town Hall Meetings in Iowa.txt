    Will Make Campaign Stops in Central and Eastern Iowa
Wilmington, DE - This weekend, Sen. Joe Biden will hold a series of Iraq Town Hall meetings during a three-day campaign trip to Iowa. During the weekend swing, he will also address the Iowa Broadcast News Associations Spring Convention and be hosted at house parties in Hampton and Davenport.
One year ago this week, Sen. Biden, along with Leslie Gelb, President Emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, unveiled their comprehensive plan for Iraq. The plan recognizes that while leaving Iraq is necessary, it is not a plan for what happens next. We also need a plan for what we leave behind, so that America's interests and security are protected. Throughout the year, the Biden-Gelb plan has garnered significant support, both within Congress and among foreign policy experts.
Sen. Biden is the only candidate, in either party, to have offered a plan for dealing with the situation in Iraq. For more information on this plan, please go to: www.PlanforIraq.com.
