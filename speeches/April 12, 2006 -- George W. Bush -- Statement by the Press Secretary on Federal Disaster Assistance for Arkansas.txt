    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Arkansas and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms and tornadoes during the period of April 1-3, 2006.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in the counties of Conway, Cross, Fulton, Greene, Lawrence, Randolph, and White.
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures for Conway, Cross, Fulton, Greene, Lawrence, Randolph, and White Counties.
R. David Paulison, Acting Director, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Carlos Mitchell as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The Agency said that damage surveys are continuing in other areas, and additional counties may be designated for assistance after the assessments are completed. The Agency said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the State and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
The Agency said that residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance tomorrow by registering online at http://www.fema.gov or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA(3362) or 1-800-462-7585 (TTY) for the hearing and speech impaired.
