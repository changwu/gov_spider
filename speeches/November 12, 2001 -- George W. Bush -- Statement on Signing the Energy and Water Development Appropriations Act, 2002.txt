    Today I have signed into law H.R. 2311, the "Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 2002."
I appreciate the bipartisan effort that has gone into producing this Act. The bill abides by the agreed upon aggregate funding level for Fiscal Year 2002 of $686 billion. It provides funding for several important programs with significant national benefits including:

key research projects designed to develop new energy technologies and improve the efficiency of existing energy technologies, such as for solar and renewable energy production, as called for in the National Energy Policy report;
nonproliferation programs that seek to prevent nuclear materials and other weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of terrorists and rogue states;
stockpile stewardship, which is critical to maintaining the safety, reliability, and performance of our nuclear weapons stockpile; and
water resources development and management projects, and programs for commercial navigation, flood damage reduction, and environmental restoration and enhancement.

Section 303 of the bill purports to require congressional approval before executive branch execution of aspects of the bill. I will interpret such provisions to require notification only, since any other interpretation would contradict the Supreme Court ruling in INS v. Chadha. Provisions of H.R. 2311 that purport to remove my authority to oversee the activities of the Army Corps of Engineers will be construed consistent with my constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch.
My Administration appreciates that the Congress has worked expeditiously during this difficult and trying time in our Nation's history to consider the FY 2002 appropriations bills. Now, through a renewed sense of bipartisanship, the Congress and the Administration must work together to ensure the timely enactment of the remaining bills.
