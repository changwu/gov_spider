    This just proves what I've always said after a thousand banquets: There's nothing louder in a banquet room than a spoon on a glass.
I just wanted to say—no speeches or anything—just a word of welcome here to you. You are now back. Those of us who have been holding down the fort here, keeping the country running, are glad to have you back again.
There's been a certain amount of caustic criticism of me over supposed inaccuracies. And I was just saying to Speaker Rayburn here—[ laughter].—
Now that we're back, there's been a lot to talk about whether we're going to take up the social issues. Anytime you want to talk about new silver for the White House [laughter] -
Seriously, it does seem that this might be a nice thing for us to get together here—before we all really settle down to the year's work that's ahead of us—and break bread together. And I'm delighted to have you here and welcome you all. I know that we're going to be—hard as it is to believe tonight—we might find ourselves at times in disagreement during the year ahead. And I know that that might occasionally happen, and I just hope we'll be able to do that without being disagreeable.
So, welcome, and thank you all for coming.
