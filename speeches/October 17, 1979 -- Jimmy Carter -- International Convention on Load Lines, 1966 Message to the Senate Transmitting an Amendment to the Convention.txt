    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to acceptance, an amendment to the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966. The report of the Department of State is enclosed for the information of the Senate in connection with its consideration of the amendment.
The International Convention on Load lines establishes uniform international principles governing the safe loading of ships in all seasons and waters. the purpose of this amendment is to expedite the procedure for amending the technical annexes to the Convention.
I believe that the proposed amendment is highly desirable. The Convention's present amendment procedure has made it impossible to bring into force many technical improvements to the requirements of the Convention. The new procedure will greatly facilitate and accelerate the entry into force of these essential improvements.
I recommend that the Senate give consideration to this amendment and advice and consent to its acceptance.
