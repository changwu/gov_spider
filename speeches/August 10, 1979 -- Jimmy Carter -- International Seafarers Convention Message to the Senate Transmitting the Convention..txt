    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, with Annex, 1978 (the Convention), done at London, July 7, 1978. The report of the Department of State is enclosed for the information of the Senate in connection with its consideration of the Convention.
This Convention establishes improved and often new international requirements for training, certification and watchkeeping for masters, officers and certain crew members of "seagoing" merchant ships. These requirements should provide more highly qualified personnel on board ships and thereby reduce maritime casualties and promote safety of life at sea and protection of the marine environment. Such international requirements are responsive to proposals which were made by the United States in March 1977, following a series of tanker accidents in or near United States waters. I recommend that the Senate give prompt consideration to this Convention and advice and consent to its ratification.
