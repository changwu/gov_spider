    Just for the benefit of the news media, this is one of the great leaders in the free world.
Prime Minister Kishi was courageous enough to support a friendship with our own country at a time when it was not popular for him to do so.
He's been instrumental in some of the finest international efforts that related' to the well-being of humans throughout the world. And although he's had a lot of years on Earth and a lot of experience, he's still young at heart.
It's a great honor for us to have him here in the United States.
