    America's grandparents are truly a national treasure and a living resource. Most of us can remember having long talks with our grandparents and hearing stories of days gone by. They form a link to the past that is far more colorful and personal than what we read in history books. Their knowledge and wisdom come from experience-they are an invaluable source of advice to US.
The special attachment between grandparent and grandchild is one of love spanning two generations. A grandchild looks up to his grandparents with respect and admiration while grandparents view their grandchildren with great pride and rejoice at their every accomplishment.
Our grandparents encourage us in every way to have faith in ourselves, to work hard, and to achieve all that we can. We learn from their example, and we gain inspirations from their success.
In this modern, fast-paced society, it is important that we be mindful of the many contributions of our grandparents. They built our families, and they've helped build America. Because of their persistence and belief in themselves, our country has weathered the bad times as well as the good. Let us rededicate ourselves to preserving their legacy so that we can bequeath to our grandchildren an America blessed with the opportunities and freedoms we enjoy.
Congress has designated the first Sunday after Labor Day as National Grandparents Day. Nancy and I urge all Americans to take the time to honor our grandparents on September 11.
