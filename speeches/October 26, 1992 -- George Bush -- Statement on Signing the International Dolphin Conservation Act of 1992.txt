    Today I am signing into law H.R. 5419, the "International Dolphin Conservation Act of 1992." I strongly support this Act because it builds upon the efforts of my administration to protect dolphins.
I wish to make clear that the provisions in H.R. 5419 concerning the terms of international agreements to protect dolphins are advisory, and will not be interpreted to interfere with the President's constitutional responsibility to conduct this Nation's foreign affairs. In addition, nothing in this Act will be construed to preempt the President's authority to enter into other international agreements concerning the protection of dolphins.
George Bush
The White House,
October 26, 1992.
