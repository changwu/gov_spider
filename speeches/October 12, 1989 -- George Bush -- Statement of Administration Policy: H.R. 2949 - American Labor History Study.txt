    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(McNulty (D) NY and Vento (D) MN)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2949. The Secretary of the Interior already has adequate authority to conduct a National Historic Landmark theme study on American labor history. Such a study could be conducted more quickly and at less cost under current law than under H.R. 2949, which has several unnecessary requirements.
These include unnecessary requirements for the Secretary to:
(1) establish an advisory board to provide policy guidance and technical assistance for the study; (2) prepare a list of potential additions to the National Park System that are appropriate to the labor history theme; (3) study the feasibility and suitability of each such site as a new unit of the System; and (4) enter a cooperative agreement with labor organizations to conduct the theme study, when the National Park Service has experienced personnel who could perform the study more economically and more objectively.
