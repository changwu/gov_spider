    The Department of Housing and Urban Development's 2020 Management Reform Plan has changed the way that HUD does business for good. That's the verdict from a report issued today by the Public Strategies Group, a leader of the "reinventing Government" movement. The confirmed success of Secretary Cuomo's management reforms is great news for HUD, the administration, and most importantly, the millions of Americans served by HUD's programs.
When we first took office, Al Gore and I promised the American people that we would improve the way our Government serves them. We had no greater challenge than HUD, which was mired in bureaucracy and which Congress had targeted for elimination. That was then, but this is now. Today, we have a Department that has turned itself around and, as this report clearly states, can serve as a role model for all Federal agencies.
I want to congratulate Secretary Cuomo, his team at HUD, and all of the Department's 9,000 employees for this significant achievement. I have no doubt it will serve as a milestone in HUD's history and foreshadow the kind of service that the Department will offer the American people in the years to come.
