    President Bush Signs Implementing Legislation for Free Trade Agreement Between the United States and Jordan
Today President Bush signed legislation needed to implement the United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement (FTA). This agreement is a strong and tangible symbol of our support for Jordan, for its economic reforms, and for the King's leadership. It is the capstone of our expanding economic partnership. This is the first Free Trade Agreement between the United States and an Arab country.
The U.S.-Jordan FTA will create jobs and new investment in both countries. The agreement achieves significant liberalization across trade areas including electronic commerce, services, and intellectual property rights. It will eliminate tariffs between the United States and Jordan on virtually all industrial goods and agricultural products within ten years.
The United States and Jordan are committed to implementing the Agreement as quickly as possible.
