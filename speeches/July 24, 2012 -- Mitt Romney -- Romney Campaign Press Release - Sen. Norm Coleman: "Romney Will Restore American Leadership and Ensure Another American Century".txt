    Former Minnesota Senator Norm Coleman today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's speech to the VFW:
"American power abroad is rooted in our strength at home. Barack Obama has singularly failed to breathe life into the U.S. economy, and has set the U.S. military on a path toward budget cuts that his own Secretary of Defense has called 'devastating' to our national security.Mitt Romney's speech to the VFW shows that with the right leadership our country need not follow a path of decline, but instead a path of leadership. Governor Romney will restore American leadership and ensure another American Century. And Governor Romney would never tolerate a White House staff that leaks America's national-security secrets, as Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has found to be the practice under Barack Obama."
