    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
Revision(House)(Williams (D) Montana and Ford (D) Michigan)
The Administration objects to House passage of H.R. 3248, unless it is amended to delete the following objectionable provisions:
— expanding the scope of the Davis Bacon Act to cover grants for construction by the National Endowment for the Humanities (Section 107 (6)).
— requiring the National Endowment for the Humanities to transmit to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission each plan and each report required under any regulation or management directive issued by the Commission, thereby exceeding the original congressional intent of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission statute, and further requiring each such submission to be made within 30 days after the date of enactment (Section 107 (6)).
— reauthorizing the Institute of Museum Services (IMS), and all related amendments to provisions of the Museum Services Act. The IMS should not be extended because it is inappropriate for the Federal Government to provide general operating support for museums.
