    Today, the President will visit Stromberg Sheet Metal, a medium sized business in Beltsville, Maryland. He will tour the facilities and then deliver remarks to employees. Stromberg employs approximately 350 people and hopes to expand the workforce as revenues increase and additional projects come online in the coming year.
The President will discuss a new report issued today by the Department of the Treasury that details how his proposal to allow businesses and investors to deduct immediately the full cost of most investments will help businesses expand and hire. The report can be found HERE. Under the President's proposal, a business like Stromberg would be able to take advantage of this proposal to invest in new equipment this year or next year and deduct 100 percent of that investment immediately. For example, if a business bought an additional $1 million worth of equipment next year, they would be able to deduct the full $1 million up front, potentially accelerating hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax cuts. That's real money that businesses like Stromberg could use to expand or hire new workers right now, and provides a strong incentive to increase investment now, creating even more jobs.
