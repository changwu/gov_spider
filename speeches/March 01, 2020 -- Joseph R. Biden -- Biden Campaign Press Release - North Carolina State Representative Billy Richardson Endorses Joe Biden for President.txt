    Today, North Carolina State Representative Billy Richardson announced his endorsement of Joe Biden for President at a community event in Fayetteville, North Carolina with Congressman Jim Clyburn. He released the following statement:
"I am proud to announce my endorsement of Joe Biden. From his leadership in the Senate to his unwavering record as Vice President to President Obama it is clear — Joe gets it done. At a time when hate is consuming our White House, Joe brings much needed unity and compassion. North Carolina is a critical state and we need someone at the top of the ticket who can carry our Governor, State House, Congressional, and Senate races to victory. I believe Joe Biden is the only person who can do that — I am proud to support his candidacy."
Joe Biden has the support of all three Democratic U.S. House members in North Carolina — Congressman G. K. Butterfield, Congresswoman Alma Adams, and Congressman David Price. Biden has more endorsements in the Tar Heel State than any other Democratic candidate, which includes the support of 25 current and former elected officials in North Carolina, including mayors, state lawmakers, city, and county officials, candidates for office, and local activists. Earlier this month, Biden received the endorsement of Anthony Foxx, former Secretary of Transportation and mayor of Charlotte, and Paul Lowe, Chair of the North Carolina Legislative Black Caucus.
Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,400 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
