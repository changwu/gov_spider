    The President has decided that the United States will take immediate steps to establish diplomatic relations with Georgia. The United States had recognized Georgian independence on December 25, 1991. In recent weeks, the new Georgian Government has taken steps to restore civilian rule, begin a dialog on national reconciliation, and committed itself to holding parliamentary elections this year. On the basis of these actions and following communications between the leader of the Georgian State Council, Eduard Shevardnadze, and Secretary of State James Baker on the political, economic, and security principles of most importance to the United States, the President believes that U.S. interests will be best served by having diplomatic ties with the Georgian Government. The depth, extent, and richness of U.S. relations with Georgia will depend on the Georgian Government's commitment to these principles.
With this action, the United States now has diplomatic relations with all 12 of the new States of the former Soviet Union.
The United States will open an Embassy in Tbilisi as soon as possible. In addition, the United States will support Georgia's membership in relevant international organizations, including the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
