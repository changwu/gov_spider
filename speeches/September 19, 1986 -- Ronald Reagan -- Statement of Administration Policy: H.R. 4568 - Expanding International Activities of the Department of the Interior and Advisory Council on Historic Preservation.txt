    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Seiberling (D) Ohio and 21 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 4568, because:
— adequate authority already exists for the Department of the Interior to conduct appropriate international conservation programs, to cooperate with the Agency for International Development in providing assistance to developing countries, and, with the approval of.the Secretary of State, to participate in other international natural resource programs;
— the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has always been an entirely domestic agency without any international expertise or responsibility; and
— it would be detrimental to sound and coordinated management of foreign policy to grant Interior or the Advisory Council broad and duplicative international authority, especially without requiring specific approval of the State Department or AID as appropriate.
