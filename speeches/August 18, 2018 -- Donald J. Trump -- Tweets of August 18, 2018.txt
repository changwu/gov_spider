Social Media is totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices. Speaking loudly and clearly for the Trump Administration we won't let that happen. They are closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT while at the same time doing nothing to others.......Retweets: 36914Favorites: 114344

.....Censorship is a very dangerous thing & absolutely impossible to police. If you are weeding out Fake News there is nothing so Fake as CNN & MSNBC & yet I do not ask that their sick behavior be removed. I get used to it and watch with a grain of salt or don't watch at all..Retweets: 33662Favorites: 125370

Has anyone looked at the mistakes that John Brennan made while serving as CIA Director? He will go down as easily the WORST in history & since getting out he has become nothing less than a loudmouth partisan political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country!Retweets: 29516Favorites: 116017

The United States has ended the ridiculous 230 Million Dollar yearly development payment to Syria. Saudi Arabia and other rich countries in the Middle East will start making payments instead of the U.S. I want to develop the U.S. our military and countries that help us!Retweets: 39806Favorites: 158426
