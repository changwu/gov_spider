LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” The Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign announced today that Dr. Paul will visit Fargo, North Dakota to address attendees of a free-market policy forum that is hosted by a prominent conservative think tank.
Paul will give the keynote address at the dinner portion of the North Dakota Policy Council's (NDPC) 4th Annual Free Market Forum. The dinner will take place on Saturday, November 5th at 6:00 p.m. at the Fargo Civic Center, located at 207 4th Street North, Fargo, ND 58102-4817.
"This event will be an excellent opportunity for voters to hear Ron Paul speak. North Dakotans will further understand that Dr. Paul is the sole presidential candidate who has the proven record, wisdom, and conviction to lead America out of these tough economic times and restore our Republic," said Jared Hendrix, North Dakota State Director for the Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign.
"Ron Paul fights for greater government transparency, homeschooling parents' rights, the right to keep and bear arms, common sense spending cuts, natural resources exploration, and a strong national defense. And as a veteran, and a doctor who has delivered more than 4,000 babies, he understands the value of every human life," continued Mr. Hendrix.
Jack Hunter, the Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign's official blogger, will also attend the event as a special guest. Mr. Hunter will participate in his capacity as columnist, radio host and co-author of the U.S. Senator Rand Paul book The Tea Party Goes to Washington.
