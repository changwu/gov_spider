    This morning, John Brennan convened an inter-agency coordination call with Secretary Napolitano, DNI Clapper, NCTC Director Leiter, National Security Staff travelling with the President in Hawaii, and other representatives from the FBI, CIA, and the counterterrorism community. During the call, they reviewed our continued efforts to stay vigilant throughout the holiday season, and to coordinate with our foreign partners.
Later this morning, President Obama received a briefing on our ongoing counter-terrorism efforts from National Security Staff Senior Director for Counterterrorism Nick Rasmussen and Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications Ben Rhodes. The President was also briefed on the tragic traffic accident that took the lives of a number of American citizens in Egypt, and the U.S. governmentâ€™s ongoing efforts to support the victims and their families.
