    Los Angeles, CA—California First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom today announced her endorsement of Elizabeth Warren for president.
"I am proud to endorse Elizabeth Warren as the next President of the United States," said Siebel Newsom. "Now more than ever, women need a champion in the White House—someone who will stand up for working moms, fight for our seats at the tables of power, protect our health care and reproductive choice, and lift up the underappreciated and often invisible contributions that women make daily to society. There is no person better equipped to fight for us than Elizabeth."
Siebel Newsom is an award-winning filmmaker, advocate, and founder of the nonprofit organization The Representation Project, which inspires individuals and communities to challenge limiting gender stereotypes and shift norms.
"Women must have a seat at the tables of power, whether that's in government, business or anywhere in society," Elizabeth Warren said. "Jennifer's efforts to break the mold and reshape the First Partner's office to advocate for equal pay and women's representation will empower women and girls not just in California but around the country and the world. I am grateful for her support in this fight."
Siebel Newsom and her husband Governor Gavin Newsom are the proud parents to their four young children, Montana, Hunter, Brooklynn, and Dutch.
Elizabeth has proposed a host of plans that seek to empower women in government, in the workplace, and beyond. She has pledged to have at least half of Cabinet positions filled by women and non binary people. Elizabeth will also take a set of executive actions on day one of her administration to boost wages for women of color and open up new pathways to the leadership positions they deserve. And she has called on Congress to pass federal laws to protect reproductive care from right-wing ideologues in the states and has a plan to address the maternal mortality epidemic.
