In-Town Pool Report #8: Event begins
Some details as press waited for the event to start: Pool entered the East Room at 1:44pm. Loud music played and a crowd of people were spread throughout the room, some seated, others chatting and taking pictures. The room naturally got busier as we got closer to 2pm.
The podium is set up in one corner of the stage next to a red sign that says "Black History Month 2022." Nine chairs are located at the other end of the stage.
FLOTUS was spotted mingling in the crowd a little after 2pm, wearing a polka-dotted dress and a white mask with a flower on the side.
A man over the loudspeaker asked attendants to take their seats at 2:14pm. The room quieted down a few minutes later, and six of the individuals with designated seats on stage entered at 2:20pm to a round of applause.
We did not get any official two-minute warning. The VP and Second Gentleman entered the room at 2:22pm, also to a round of applause and some cheers.
POTUS and FLOTUS entered at 2:23pm (FLOTUS presumably left the room after mingling). They received cheers and applause as well.

Pool has been told that the briefing will begin when this event ends (so, soon). Remarks wrapped up at 2:59pm.
POTUS left at 3pm and responded to one question.
Q: Should Americans be worried about nuclear war?
Biden: "No"
Some details on the event:
FLOTUS said this is the "very first in person" Black History Month WH celebration. As she spoke, POTUS waved at a little boy in the front row and gave him a thumbs up.
FLOTUS called VP "a partner to Joe, especially on issues" like voting rights. She slipped up at the end, introducing the VP as "The president of the — the Vice President!" This prompted laughs in the crowd (and POTUS), to which FLOTUS told the crowd it was done "to make you laugh."
VP spoke next, calling the Congressional Black Caucus the "conscious … of our country." She mentioned Ukraine, saying "their bravery is a reminder … that justice, equality and freedom must never be taken for granted by any of us."
"We are clear: Black history is American history," VP said. She received a standing ovation upon mentioning POTUS"s SCOTUS pick. She called for "a swift confirmation, now."
Cateo Hilton, student and Junior Mentor of the Life Pieces to Masterpieces program in DC, spoke third. He noted that Black History Month "also celebrates the history we continue to make."
Hilton said he"s going to Delaware State in a few months, prompting another standing ovation. One person in the crowd yelled, "say it again!" He said he knows POTUS will be "happy to hear about" that.
POTUS rounded out the speeches, taking the podium at 2:42pm. He received a standing ovation and cheers.
"I keep talking about Delaware State," POTUS said, speaking in Hilton"s direction as he launched into a brief story about his connection there.
POTUS introduced those seated on the stage. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, U.S. Mission to the United Nations, received a standing ovation.
"My name is Joe Biden, I"m Jill Biden"s husband," he said, prompting laughs in the crowd.
"Black History Month is more than a celebration. It"s a powerful reminder that black history is American history…" POTUS said.
POTUS touted his SCOTUS pick as well as the American Rescue Plan. He called for Congress to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act (another standing ovation).
Upon concluding his speech at 2:59pm, POTUS put his mask back on. Pool ushered out at 3:02pm.
