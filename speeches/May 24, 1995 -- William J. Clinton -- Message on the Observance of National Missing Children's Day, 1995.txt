    Greetings to everyone observing National Missing Children's Day, 1995. I am pleased that so many Americans are joining together to improve safety and reduce crime in communities across the country.
In the wake of the tragedy in Oklahoma City, we have drawn strength from reaffirming our commitment to protecting our childrenâ€”making their well-being and security our highest national priority. Until we have done everything in our power to help young people lead happy, productive lives, we cannot say that our country is prepared for the great challenges that lie ahead.
The devastating effects of child abduction threaten our hopes for a brighter future. It is a tragedy that occurs daily and causes untold anguish to the families and children involved. I commend the many caring organizations who have dedicated their resources to raising public awareness of child abduction and to protecting young people from victimization. Your efforts are serving to return many children, safe and sound, to their families and homes.
Hillary and I join you in offering our prayers for all missing children and their families, and we wish you the best for a memorable day.
BILL CLINTON
