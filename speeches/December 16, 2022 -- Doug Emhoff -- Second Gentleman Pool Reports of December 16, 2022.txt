SGOTUS Pool Report #1 - 988 Call Center visit
Hello from the Community Crisis Services Center in Hyattsville, Md. where SGOTUS is drawing attention to the 988 mental health hotline.
Emhoff's event coincides with HHS announcement of $130M in grants for 988 suicide & crisis hotline - from the bipartisan gun legislation that passed over the summer
Emhoff: "Instead of calling 911 for emergency. We need to get everyone to know that it's 988 for any issue that revolve around mental health or suicidal ideation or those feelings of being alone."
"9-8-8" " It's pretty fast. 32 seconds is the average."
"I know that this work cannot be easy."
"the holidays are tough for a lot of us around the country and we all saw the tragic news about [Stephen] tWitch [Boss]."
"This is not a red state or blue state or a political issue. This issue of mental health and suicide affects everyone."
Also present:
HHS Deputy Secretary Andrea Palm
HHS Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use Miriam Delphin-Rittman
