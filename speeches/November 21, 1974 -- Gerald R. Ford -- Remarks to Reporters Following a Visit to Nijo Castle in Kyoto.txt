    Well, I do want to thank all of the people who have made this afternoon so interesting. It is an afternoon which has given us a special insight into the history and into the traditions of Japan.
And I want to thank the young ladies here and the others who have shown us the several castles.
The culture of Japan certainly is an inspiration. It is different. It is something that by its simplicity inspires you to see what can come from hard work and a feeling of making the most out of what you have available, which was the history of Japan in its early days, and then to see these beautiful instruments and fine playing by the young ladies--the beautiful costumes--I think it is a real inspiration for those of us who have had an opportunity to be here today in Kyoto, traditional capital of Japan.
I thank all of you and thank all of you for your thoughtfulness and your hospitality.
REPORTER. How is the trip going, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT. I think it has been a wonderful trip. It couldn't have been better, both substantively and otherwise.
Q. What have you enjoyed most, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT. The opportunity to see not only the Government officials but an opportunity to see a great deal of the Japanese history and people. It has been an inspiration as well as a very productive 3 days.Thank you very much.
