    I am deeply concerned by today's appeal to President Medvedev by Russia's Federation Council and Duma, the upper and lower houses of Russia's parliament, to recognize the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent countries. I call on Russia's leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions.
Georgia's territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nation's, including Russia's. Russia agreed, when President Medvedev signed the French-brokered cease-fire agreement, to the opening of international discussions on security and stability modalities in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. This represents an internationally endorsed approach to these issues, which recognition would undercut. Recognition would also be inconsistent with unanimously approved United Nations Security resolutions that Russia has consistently voted for in the past.
The United States will continue to stand with the people of Georgia and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
