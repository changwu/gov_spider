    THE STRONG VOTE by the citizens of the District of Columbia in favor of the home rule charter is a most welcome development. I am pleased that District voters have chosen to set the city firmly on the path toward local self-government. It is most appropriate as we approach our Nation's Bicentennial that the residents of the National Capital should again exercise their rights to elect their own local officials.
The new government will offer the means for greater decisionmaking responsibility and control at the local level, a goal for the Nation that this Administration has consistently sought.
As the District embarks on its new course, the Federal Government will take every appropriate action to insure that the transition to the new form of government is a smooth one. The transfer on July 1, 1974, of certain quasi-Federal agencies to the District will enhance the city's ability to deal with problems in planning, housing, community development, and manpower programs. We will also work closely with the city government in whatever way is needed to insure that this memorable step toward self-government is a success in the District of Columbia.
