    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Reps. Wilson (D), Bryant (D), and Barton (R) Texas)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2486 because the bill's land acquisition costs cannot be justified during these times of severe budgetary restraint, particularly when Federal acquisition of the land involved is not necessary. While the bill would allow two years for acquisition by land exchange — before purchase would be required — many of these privately owned tracts would be difficult to so acquire because there are multiple owners or the owners are not interested in a land exchange.
