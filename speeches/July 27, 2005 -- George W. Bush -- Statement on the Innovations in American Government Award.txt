    I am pleased that my administration's Office of Management and Budget has received the Kennedy School's Innovation in American Government Award for its Program Assessment Rating Tool. I congratulate the hard-working employees at OMB for winning this award and implementing our management agenda. Taxpayer money should be spent wisely or not at all, and I am proud of the progress we have made to improve management and focus on results. We are changing the way the Federal Government thinks about program management and budgeting. We still have work to do, and improving the effectiveness of Government and providing good value to taxpayers will continue to be a top priority of my administration.
