    MANCHESTER, NH â€” Michael Bennet released the following statement after House Democrats announced articles of impeachment for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress:
"We have to follow due process and the rule of law, but if the evidence of the President's wrongdoing and abuse of power continues to remain consistent with what we've seen, it's likely I will vote to impeach. The President has made it very difficult for Congress to do the oversight that the Constitution requires and that the American people demand. He's obstructed and stonewalled at every step of the way, and today's announcement reflects that. This is exactly what the founders were worried about. We don't elect kings in this country, and nobody is above the law."
