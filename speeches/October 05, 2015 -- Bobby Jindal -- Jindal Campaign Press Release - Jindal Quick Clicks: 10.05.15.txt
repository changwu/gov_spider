    National Review: Can Bobby Jindal Catch Fire from Iowa?
It is two and a half hours after his town hall started, and he has finally finished chatting with the very last of the attendees who hung around to meet him one-on-one. Jindal is talking to National Review when they cut the lights, and he seems in no hurry to be on his way. We move the conversation into the parking lot.

Jindal's bump in the poll isn't just because he was in the state often. He was also on the offensive. Jindal clearly doesn't like or respect the GOP frontrunner, Donald Trump, but he also critiqued Scott Walker before Walker got out of the race. Jindal has also been a vocal critic of Republican leaders in Washington. Still, perhaps the most meaningful thing Jindal has done in Iowa that shouldn't go over-looked is Jindal's willingness to reach out to Governor Terry Branstad and offer to help him take the necessary steps to defund Planned Parenthood in Iowa.
