    To the Congress of the United States:
I herewith propose three rescissions and report twenty-seven deferrals in accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The rescission proposals total $123.7 million and the deferrals total $2,729.4 million for a total of $2,853.0 million in fiscal year 1976 budget authority.
Funds for two highway programs, one duplicating an existing system and one that could be funded through Federal-aid highway funds now available to the States, are proposed for rescission. The third rescission proposal reflects a recent Congressionally-approved change in program needs by requesting reduced funding for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. The deferrals are primarily routine in nature and do not affect program levels. The details of each rescission proposal and deferral are contained in the attached reports.
I urge the Congress to act promptly on the proposed rescissions.
