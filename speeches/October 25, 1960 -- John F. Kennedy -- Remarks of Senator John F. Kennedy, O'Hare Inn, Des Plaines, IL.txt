    Senator KENNEDY. I want to express my thanks to Tyler, and I hope that he is going to be elected the Congressman from this district, and I want to also say it is a pleasure to be here with Otto Kerner, who is going to be the Governor of the State of Illinois. [Applause.] And Senator Paul Douglas, who is going to continue to represent Illinois and the Nation in the United States Senate. [Applause.] You met my sister, Eunice. [Applause.]
Let me say that Mr. Nixon and I have one thing in common and that is that he just campaigns in Republican districts. I looked at his schedule in Pennsylvania, and he goes where all the Republicans live. That is what we are going to do; we are campaigning where the Republicans live. [Response.] I can't believe that any Democrats live in Lake Zurich - do they? Or Barrington, or Milldale? What about West Dundee? [Response from the audience.] Well, we are going to take the Democratic message out to West Dundee and Libertyville, because this election ought to be won in these areas surrounding the great cities, the suburbs, suburbia, or whatever you may call it, people who make an independent judgment on what is best for their State, their families, their country, the cause of freedom. Those are the issues they must decide upon. Where can they get a government, a President, a Congress, which will be responsible, progressive, which will strength the United States, strengthen our influence around the world, strike a blow for the cause of freedom, build this country until it is stronger? That is the issue in this campaign and I think it ought to be heard not merely in the great Democratic cities, but out in Dundee and all the rest. So that is where we are going today. Thank you very much. [Applause.]
