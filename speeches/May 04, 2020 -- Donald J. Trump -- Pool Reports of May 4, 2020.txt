In-town pool report #1
Good morning from the White House.
It's a perfect 66 degrees today in Washington, and the president currently has no events on his schedule, public or private.
I will advise if anything changes, and as always, please feel free to reach out to me directly via text or email.

In-town pool report #3 — response to NYT's CDC story
Passing along from Judd Deere
In response to the New York Times report on an internal CDC document:
"This is not a White House document nor has it been presented to the Coronavirus Task Force or gone through interagency vetting. This data is not reflective of any of the modeling done by the task force or data that the task force has analyzed. The President's phased guidelines to open up America again are a scientific driven approach that the top health and infectious disease experts in the federal government agreed with. The health of the American people remains President Trump's top priority and that will continue as we monitor the efforts by states to ease restrictions." Judd Deere
