If Shifty Adam Schiff who is a corrupt politician who fraudulently made up what I said on the 'call' is allowed to release transcripts of the Never Trumpers & others that are & were interviewed he will change the words that were said to suit the Dems purposes. Republicans...Retweets: 19134Favorites: 75709

....should give their own transcripts of the interviews to contrast with Schiff's manipulated propaganda. House Republicans must have nothing to do with Shifty's rendition of those interviews. He is a proven liar leaker & freak who is really the one who should be impeached!Retweets: 14107Favorites: 55807

False stories are being reported that a few Republican Senators are saying that President Trump may have done a quid pro quo but it doesn't matter there is nothing wrong with that it is not an impeachable event. Perhaps so but read the transcript there is no quid pro quo!Retweets: 21950Favorites: 96976

Mark Levin a great lawyer and scholar said last night on his @marklevinshow that all you have to do is read the transcript of the call you do not need Never Trumpers or other witnesses to say what it means or says. It is plainly and very well stated for all to see. Witch HuntRetweets: 18090Favorites: 69190

What I said on the phone call with the Ukrainian President is 'perfectly' stated. There is no reason to call witnesses to analyze my words and meaning. This is just another Democrat Hoax that I have had to live with from the day I got elected (and before!). Disgraceful!Retweets: 21533Favorites: 92508
