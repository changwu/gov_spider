    Well, first let me salute all that are there at that wonderful Army-Navy contest. I understand you have a great ballgame underway.
Over my shoulder, perhaps you can see the picture of Arizona where the war started, World War II, on December 7th, 50 years ago. And now I'm talking to you also from the deck of the Missouri where the war ended on September 2d, 1945. And I must tell you this has been a very emotional day for the survivors of Pearl Harbor. It's an emotional day for those of us who served in World War II, and it's an emotional day for our entire country.
I think it is not a day for hatred. I think it is not a day for rancor. I think it is a day for healing and looking forward. And because of the sacrifice of the people here at Pearl Harbor and others that followed, yesterday's enemies are now our friends. Yesterday's hatred has now given way to feelings of goodwill, partnership, friendly competition. And so it has been a moving day at Pearl Harbor. And I, as Commander in Chief of the forces, have been very proud to be here.
Let me wish all of you at that wonderful football game now the very best. And may I say to the men and women of the U.S. Naval Academy and the Army of the West Point, thank you for your service to this, the greatest country on the face of the Earth. May God bless each and every one of you who served the United States of America. It is a special day, and all of you helped make it a special day.
Thank you so much.
