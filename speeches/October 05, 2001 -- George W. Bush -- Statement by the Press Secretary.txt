    The President noted with sadness the death of former Senate Majority Leader and Ambassador to Japan, Mike Mansfield. Mike Mansfield's life of service to the country began when he served in China as a young Marine and spanned almost a century of American engagement in the Pacific. He will be sorely missed, but his legacy of service to the United States will continue.
