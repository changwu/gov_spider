Verona, PA - For weeks, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney has attacked Rick Santorum for previously supporting earmarks - even though Governor Romney himself has a long history of lobbying for earmarks and paying others to lobby for earmarks on his behalf.
This morning on Good Morning America, Jonathan Karl showed exclusive video of Governor Romney touting his Washington-Insider connections to get federal earmarks.
Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said: "Mitt Romney lobbied for earmarks, boasted that he got more earmarks than anyone in history, but then attacks others for earmarks.Â  Mitt Romney bragged about using his great Washington-Insider establishment connections to get record-setting amounts of earmarks - but then attacks others for being insiders. There's a word we use to describe someone who does something and then attacks others for doing the same thing - hypocrite."
