    At the last debate, I mentioned how I was looking forward to taking the red eye home to see my three year old daughter Bella since she had surgery earlier that day.
Following that debate, Karen and I got numerous emails and calls from supporters asking how she was doing. We were touched by the tremendous outpouring of support we received for our sweet Bella.
She's doing great and is back to her joyful, smiley self. Since so many of you were asking about her, we wanted to share this video to introduce her to you.
We hope you'll enjoy this video.
