    President Joe Biden looks forward to welcoming President Ursula von der Leyen of the European Commission to the White House on Friday, March 10, 2023. The leaders will review the strong cooperation between the United States and the European Union to support Ukraine as it defends its sovereignty and democracy and to impose costs on Russia for its aggression. They will also discuss U.S.-EU coordination to combat the climate crisis through investing in clean technology based on secure supply chains. The leaders will take stock of the joint Task Force on Europe's Energy Security that they established one year ago, which has helped the EU reduce its dependence on Russian fossil fuels and accelerate its green transition. They will also discuss other international security challenges, including our work together to address the challenges posed by the People's Republic of China.
