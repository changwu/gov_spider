    Hillary Clinton issued the following statement on newly released IRS data that shows widening income inequality:
"Today's IRS data shows that while the typical tax filer's real income fell 2% between 2000 and 2005, the share of national income going to the wealthiest 1% of Americans grew to 21%--a level not seen since the Gilded Age. This is an indictment of President Bush's economic policies. America's families need a new approach to the economy.
"This week, I have proposed an economic blueprint for the 21st century that is focused on creating high-paying jobs, restoring fairness to our tax code, and renewing the basic bargain that if you work hard you will have the tools and support to get ahead. I believe we need to rebuild the middle class, and I will focus on that as President.
"I have given speeches all week laying out my plan for restoring the middle class, the engine of our nation's economic growth. My plan includes: providing quality, affordable health care to all Americans; bolstering retirement security by promoting savings and investment; creating good-paying jobs; making college more affordable; and returning to fiscal responsibility."
