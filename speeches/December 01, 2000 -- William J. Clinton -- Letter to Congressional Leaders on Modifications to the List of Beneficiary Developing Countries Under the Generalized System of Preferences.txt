    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I hereby notify you of my intent to modify the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), which offers duty-free access to the U.S. market for eligible products imported from designated beneficiary developing countries. Specifically, I intend to change the designation of "Western Samoa" to "Samoa," to reflect this nation's current name, in the list of beneficiary developing countries and to designate Samoa as a least-developed beneficiary developing country under the GSP. I have carefully considered the criteria in sections 501 and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974 and have determined that it is appropriate to designate Samoa as such.
This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(f) of the Trade Act of 1974.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
