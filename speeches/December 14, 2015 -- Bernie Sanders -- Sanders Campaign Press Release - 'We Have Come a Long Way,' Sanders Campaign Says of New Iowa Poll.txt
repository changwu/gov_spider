    MANCHESTER, N.H. â€“ Ahead here in New Hampshire, Sen. Bernie Sanders is gaining ground on Hillary Clinton in Iowa, according to a new Iowa Poll released Monday by Bloomberg Politics and The Des Moines Register.
"We have come a long way in Iowa since we were at 5 percent in the same poll last January and very few people knew who Bernie Sanders was or what he stood for. This poll shows there is a very clear path to victory in Iowa," said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager.
"With big leads among young people and voters who would be first-time caucus-goers, our job is to do all that we can to make certain that voter turnout is high among less traditional voters. Clearly we have also got to make certain that seniors in Iowa understand that no one in Congress has fought harder to defend Social Security and Medicare and that, as president, Bernie will take on the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug prices," Weaver said.
In Iowa, 80 percent of likely caucus-goers have a favorable opinion of Sanders and he fared best among young voters and first-time caucus goers. He also had the backing of those who said he cares about the middle class and would do more to rein in Wall Street. Overall, Clinton led with 48 percent to Sanders' 39 percent.
"Bernie Sanders has proven to be a worthy adversary," J. Ann Selzer, founder of the firm that conducted the poll, told Bloomberg. "He's attracting people who, as a coalition, together, can be a force to be reckoned with, if he can turn them out."
