McLean, VA - Citing his "100 percent pro-life voting record" and "common sense conservative principles," the Thompson for President campaign unveiled its latest 60-second television commercial that will air between 6:25 and 6:30 p.m. on Thursday evening across nearly every major broadcast channel and market in South Carolina.
The spot, titled "Consistent Conservative," highlights the Senator's consistent conservative values. This is the fourth advertisement that the Thompson campaign has aired in South Carolina. The new ad can be viewed at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7yLds0G5eU
Below is the text of the ad:
Fred Thompson: I'm Fred Thompson and I approve this message.
I've been a conservative all my life.
I grew up in a little hometown just like this.
Started the first Young Republican Club in Lawerenceburg, Tennessee.
In eight years in the United States Senate, I fought for tax cuts, and for conservative judges.
And I'm proud to have had a 100 percent pro-life voting record.
Common sense conservative principles. Free people and free markets and a government that doesn't tax and regulate us to death, but defends us and protects our borders.
In a country where, if you play by the rules, you've got a fair chance to live the American dream.
My friends, we must remember that our basic rights come from God and not from government.
And if we stick to our basic conservative principles, we will win next November and the United States of America will be better for it.
Announcer: Strength, Conviction, Honesty.
Fred Thompson, President.
