    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ On Saturday, April 21st, 2007, Senator John Edwards will discuss Don Imus' recent comments and the need for tolerance, justice and equality in our country on his "Saturday Morning E-Cast." Edwards' third E-Cast is a podcast of his speech at the Reverend Al Sharpton's National Action Network Convention on Wednesday, April 18th, 2007.
During his speech, Edwards condemned Imus' remarks and called on all Americans to speak out against this kind of bigotry. Edwards also discussed how intolerance contributes to the growing disparity between the haves and have-nots in our country. Americans who are separated from the opportunities of our country are often the same people who are the targets of bigotry. Edwards believes that as long as our country allows intolerance to continue, it will be easy for politicians in Washington to ignore the problems and not make the changes we need to end poverty and ensure equal opportunity for every American.
In his "Saturday Morning E-Cast" series, Edwards discusses the challenges facing our nation and his plans to meet those challenges and bring about bold change in our country. In previous E-Casts, Edwards has discussed his "Form 1" plan to overhaul the tax filing system, and his plan to halt global warming and create a new energy economy in our country.
