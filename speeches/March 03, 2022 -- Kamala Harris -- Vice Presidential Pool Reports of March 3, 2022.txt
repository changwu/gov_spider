VP Pool Report 4 - quotes 
VP gave highlights of the administration's first year in office, including 6 million jobs, getting people back to work, the bipartisan infrastructure bill, a diverse judiciary, and putting more Black women on the bench than any other president.
One of them was Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court.
"Now we will fight to ensure she receives a swift confirmation," Harris said.
She discussed the need for voting rights, noting that she would be in Selma this weekend to observe the anniversary of Bloody Sunday.
She said "there is a lot at stake" during the midterm elections. "Protecting our majority is critical."
Between now and then, she said the administration would focus on bringing down costs, creating jobs, defending democratic principles and voting rights, and fighting climate change.
"What we do between now and November will determine the future of our nation," she said.
She said the Democratic National Committee was investing in organizing and strengthening state parties, and that the DNC was sending $15 million to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
I've asked for figures on the attendance and how much was raised if any, and will send out another report if I get that.
