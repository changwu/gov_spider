Chalk up another loss for Donald Trump: A New York court just slapped down his lawyers' efforts to dismiss the lawsuit against his fake low-rent "university."
The suit, brought by the state of New York on behalf of victims of Trump's "university" scam, is now moving forward:
An appeals court denied a request from Donald Trump to dump a New York fraud lawsuit against Trump University today, taking the $40 million case against the presidential front runner a step closer to the courtroom.
The suit, brought by state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, alleges that Trump University "intentionally misled" thousands of people across the country with its pitch for the business mogul's real estate courses. Schneiderman sued in 2013 for money to repay former students.
"We look forward to demonstrating in a court of law that Donald Trump and his sham for-profit college defrauded more than 5,000 consumers out of millions of dollars," Schneiderman said in a statement.
That brings Trump one step closer to having to testify in a fraud trial while trying to carry on a presidential campaign.
Trump "University" was designed to convince struggling Americans to drop tens of thousands of dollars into worthless seminars, often getting them to go into credit card debt to do so.Trump's a con artist â€” he should never be president.
