    Yesterday, President Obama called Governor Jerry Brown to receive an update on the fires in California, including the Rim fire that is impacting families, communities, and businesses, as well as Yosemite National Park. The President expressed his gratitude for the brave men and women working tirelessly to combat this devastating fire. The President reiterated his commitment to providing needed federal resources to support the ongoing state and local response.
The administration will continue to keep in contact with the local officials and coordinate with all of our partners across the federal government. Over 3,400 men and women are working to combat the Rim fire, and thousands more are responding across the west. A National Wildland Fire Type 1 Incident Management Team has also been deployed to assist with the response in California. On August 23, FEMA approved a Fire Management Assistance Grant for the Rim fire, providing federal assistance on a cost share basis.
The President encourages all local residents to follow the instructions of the state and local officials, including evacuation orders.
