    President Bush will welcome President Roh Moo-hyun of the Republic of Korea to the White House on September 14, 2006. The alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea is deeply rooted in common values and common interests. Together, the two countries have stood against common threats and worked for the promotion of democracy, free markets, and universal human rights. President Bush looks forward to reviewing with President Roh progress in relations since their last bilateral meeting in Gyeongju on issues including our Free Trade Agreement negotiations and the Six Party Talks. The two leaders will also discuss critical regional and global issues, including winning the war on terror, stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and promoting an open international economic order.
