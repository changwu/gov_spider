ABC/Washington Post Poll was the worst and most inaccurate poll of any taken prior to the 2016 Election. When my lawyers protested they took a 12 point down and brought it to almost even by Election Day. It was a Fake Poll by two very bad and dangerous media outlets. Sad!Retweets: 11703Favorites: 53146

One of the greatest and most powerful weapons used by the Fake and Corrupt News Media is the phony Polling Information they put out. Many of these polls are fixed or worked in such a way that a certain candidate will look good or bad. Internal polling looks great the best ever!Retweets: 17860Favorites: 73017
