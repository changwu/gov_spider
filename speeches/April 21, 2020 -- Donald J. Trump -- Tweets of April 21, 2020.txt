Watched the first 5 minutes of poorly rated Morning Psycho on MSDNC just to see if he is as "nuts" as people are saying. He's worse. Such hatred and contempt! I used to do his show all the time before the 2016 election, then cut him off. Wasn't worth the effort, his mind is shot!Retweets: 24175Favorites: 117811

It is amazing that I became President of the United States with such a totally corrupt and dishonest Lamestream Media going after me all day, and all night. Either I'm really good, far better than the Fake News wants to admit, or they don't have nearly the power as once thought!Retweets: 62830Favorites: 340067

I've had great "ratings" my whole life, there's nothing unusual about that for me. The White House News Conference ratings are "through the roof"(Monday Night Football, Bachelor Finale , @nytimes) but I don't care about that. I care about going around the Fake News to the PEOPLE!Retweets: 30137Favorites: 149421
