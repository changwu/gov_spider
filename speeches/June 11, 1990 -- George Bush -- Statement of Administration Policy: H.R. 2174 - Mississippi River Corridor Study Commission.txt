    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Espy (D) Mississippi and 56 others)
The Administration opposes the enactment of H.R. 2174 which would establish the Mississippi River Corridor Study Commission. Several existing commissions have already made considerable expenditures to evaluate and protect scenic and historic resources along the Mississippi River. H.R. 2174 would add another layer of bureaucracy to the five Federal commissions and associations currently concerned with conserving such resources. Existing agencies with jurisdiction over various aspects of the Mississippi River corridor should continue to have primary responsibility for assessing and planning appropriate uses of these resources.
