    Today, as Vice President Mike Pence travels to Luzerne County, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield released the following statement:
"It's deeply cynical that Mike Pence is choosing to brand this event as one for 'workers,' considering the Trump-Pence Administration has been one of the most anti-worker and anti-union administrations in modern history.
"Northeastern Pennsylvanians know that at every opportunity - from the 2017 tax bill to COVID-19 relief - the Trump-Pence White House has actively chosen to pad the pockets of wealthy Republican donors and rich CEOs while neglecting working Pennsylvanians. Pennsylvanians deserve a champion for working families as their President, and Scranton-native Joe Biden will be that President."
