Alcee Hastings asserted that last night the Director of National Intelligence had accepted a House Democratic proposal on FISA modernization but the White House made him turn it down. That is flatly untrue. The DNI reviewed the legislation himself and determined that it would not provide the tools he needs to protect the country, and therefore he would not be able to look the President in the eye and say that the legislation should be signed. The Administration is working in good faith with the Congress to get this critical national security legislation passed before they depart for the rest of August."
