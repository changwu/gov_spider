  A Proclamation

One of the great blessings of life is to be able to move at will from place to place unhampered by fear for one's personal safety. For those who are blind, the white cane helps to make such freedom of movement possible. It enables the blind to use our streets and public facilities with maximum safety and thereby know the joys of self-reliance and independence and experience a more fulfilling life.
All Americans should be aware of the significance of the white cane and extend every courtesy and consideration to the men and women who carry it. In this way, we respect the privacy of the visually disabled and contribute to enlarging their mobility and independence.
In recognition of the significance of the white cane, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved October 6, 1964 (78 Stat. 1003), has authorized and requested the President to proclaim October 15 of each year as White Cane Safety Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 1983, as White Cane Safety Day. I urge all Americans to mark this occasion by giving greater consideration to the special needs of the visually disabled, and, particularly, to observe White Cane Safety Day with activities that contribute to maximum independent use of our streets and public facilities by our visually handicapped.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 6th day of Sept., in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightythree, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.

RONALD REAGAN
