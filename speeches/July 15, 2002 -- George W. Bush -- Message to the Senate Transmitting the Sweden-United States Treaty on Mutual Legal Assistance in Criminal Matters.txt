    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, signed at Stockholm on December 17, 2001. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.
The Treaty is one of a series of modern mutual legal assistance treaties being negotiated by the United States in order to counter criminal activities more effectively. The Treaty should be an effective tool to assist in the prosecution of a wide variety of crimes, including terrorism, drug trafficking, and fraud and other white-collar offenses. The Treaty is self-executing.
The Treaty provides for a broad range of cooperation in criminal matters. Mutual assistance available under the Treaty includes: locating or identifying persons or items; serving documents; taking the testimony or statements of persons; transferring persons in custody for testimony or other purposes; providing documents, records, and items; executing requests for searches and seizures; assisting in proceedings related to immobilization and forfeiture of assets and restitution; initiating criminal proceedings in the Requested State; and any other form of assistance consistent with the purposes of this Treaty and not prohibited by the laws of the State from whom the assistance is requested.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
