    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today unveiled its District of Columbia Leadership Team, which will lead Mayor Giuliani's campaign efforts in the nation's capital.
The team, made up of District Co-Chairs James R. Lowe Jr., Charles L. Grizzle, and Carl E. Schmid II, will work to communicate the Mayor's record of real results and build support for the Mayor in D.C.
"Rudy Giuliani clearly has the record of real results and the vision to bring a new spirit to Washington," said Co-Chair Lowe. "I'm honored to support the Mayor and to continue building support for him in D.C."
"The Republican Party deserves a true nationwide election and Rudy Giuliani is the only candidate who can compete head-to-head with a Democrat," Co-Chair Grizzle said.
Co-Chair Schmid added: "As Mayor of New York, Rudy Giuliani cut taxes, cut crime, and got hundreds of thousands of people off the welfare rolls and back to work all while working with a heavily Democratic City Council. That's the kind of strong leadership we need in the White House."
