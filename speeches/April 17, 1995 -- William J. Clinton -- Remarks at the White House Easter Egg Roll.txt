    The President. Thank you. First let me welcome all the children here and all the people like me who feel like children when they're at the Egg Roll.
I want to thank all of you who helped to make this event possible and remind you that this has been going on here at the White House now for more than 115 years. This is one of the most important traditions we have at the White House. It's really a day for children; it's a day for joy; it's a day for gratitude. And we're all very, very happy and proud to have you here.
Now, I don't want to delay the roll any further, so I think—Bernie is supposed to come up and give me the whistle after the rabbit gives me the jellybean carrot. [Laughter] I want you kids to eat your real carrots, too. [Laughter]
This is—this gentleman that's giving me the whistle, he's been doing this for 9 years now. Let's give him a big hand. This is Bernie Fairbanks. [Applause]
Where are they? Down there? Can you hear? Are you ready? You count to 3 for me.
Audience members. One, two, three!
