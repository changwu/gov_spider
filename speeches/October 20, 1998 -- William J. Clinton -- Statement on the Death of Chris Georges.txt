    Chris Georges was a reporter's reporter. Whether he was writing about the budget, Medicare, or welfare, Chris' journalistic integrity, attention to detail, and focus on the human side of policy earned him the respect of both his fellow reporters and those who work in the Congress and the White House. It was only fitting that his nomination for a Pulitzer Prize was for a story about welfare and HIV-positive children. Chris' friends and colleagues most remember his decency, integrity, wit, and sense of fairness. He will be deeply missed by his parents, sisters, and many friends.
