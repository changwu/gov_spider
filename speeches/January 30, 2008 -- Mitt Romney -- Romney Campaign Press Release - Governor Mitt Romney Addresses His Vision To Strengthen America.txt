Simi Valley, CA â€“ Tonight, Romney for President Communications Director Matt Rhoades released the following statement on the California Republican Presidential debate:
"Since the Republican candidates first met to debate at the Reagan Presidential Library in May, two diverging visions for this nation have emerged. One is steeped in Washington and places a higher premium on misleading attacks. Tonight, Governor Romney spoke to another vision that believes Washington is broken and in need of fundamental change. As President, Mitt Romney will bring conservative change that lowers taxes, controls spending and streamlines government. In less than a week, Americans from across this country will head to their primary or caucus location. To change Washington, we need someone from outside Washington."
