    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Russian Federation Amending and Extending the Agreement on Mutual Fisheries Relations of May 31, 1988. The agreement, which was effected by an exchange of notes at Washington on March 11 and September 15, 1993, extends the 1988 agreement through December 31, 1998. This agreement also amends the 1988 agreement by simplifying the provisions relating to the issuance of licenses by each Party to vessels of the other Party that wish to conduct operations in its 200-mile zone and by adding the requirement that the Parties exchange data relating to such fishing operations. The exchange of notes together with the present agreement constitute a governing international fishery agreement within the meaning of section 201(c) of the Act.
The agreement provides opportunities for nationals and vessels from each country to continue to conduct fisheries activities on a reciprocal basis in the other country's waters. The agreement also continues a framework for cooperation between the two countries on other fisheries issues of mutual concern. Since the 1988 agreement expired October 28, 1993, and U.S. fishermen are conducting operations in Russian waters, I strongly recommend that the Congress consider issuance of a joint resolution to bring this agreement into force at an early date.
