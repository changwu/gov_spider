    President Signs the Instrument of Ratification for the Third Additional Protocol and H.R. 6338 to Protect Red Crystal and Red Crescent Emblems
Today, the President signed into law H.R. 6338, the "Geneva Distinctive Emblem Protection Act of 2006," and signed the instrument of ratification for the Third Additional Protocol to the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Consistent with the Third Additional Protocol, the Act will provide protections in the United States for the Red Crystal and Red Crescent emblems.
The President applauds the Senate for giving its advice and consent to ratification of the Third Additional Protocol to the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the Congress for working expeditiously in a bipartisan manner to pass the implementing legislation for the Third Protocol. The Protocol created the Red Crystal as a new emblem for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement that can be used by governments and national societies that face challenges adopting the cross or crescent symbols. By creating the Red Crystal, the Protocol also paved the way for Israel's Magen David Adom to join the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, now more than 50 years after it became Israel's national society. U.S. leadership and significant international cooperation overcame longstanding obstacles to achieve this humanitarian success.
Ratification and implementation of this Protocol promotes the humanitarian objectives of the United States and advances the longstanding and historic leadership of the United States in the law of armed conflict. It reflects the commitment of the United States to international law, including the Geneva Conventions.
