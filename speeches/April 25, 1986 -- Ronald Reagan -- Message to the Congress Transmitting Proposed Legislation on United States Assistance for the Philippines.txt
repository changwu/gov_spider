    To the Congress of the United States:
I hereby transmit for the consideration of the Congress proposed legislation, entitled "Philippines Assistance Act of 1986," which authorizes supplemental economic and military assistance for the Philippines.
The bill authorizes a total of $150 million in supplemental assistance for the Philippines, of which $100 million is to be used for Economic Support Fund activities and $50 million is to be used for the Military Assistance Program. A supplemental appropriation request for fiscal year 1986 is concurrently being transmitted to the Congress.
Through the inauguration of President Aquino, the Philippines has been offered an historic opportunity to effect significant structural and institutional reforms that will bring the benefits of peace and prosperity to all of its citizens. The special relationship that the people of the United States share with the people of the Philippines strongly warrants our renewed commitment in support of these efforts. I urge the Congress to act without delay on this legislation.
