    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 11/3/93)(House)(Brooks (D) Texas and 3 others)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 3351 and believes that programs providing alternative punishment for young offenders will be most effective if designed and implemented in coordination with existing substance abuse treatment programs and aftercare services for young people funded by the Department of Health and Human Services.
