    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICYThis Statement Has Been Coordinated by OMB with the Appropriate Agencies
(House)(Everett (R) AL and 13 cosponsors)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3373, but will work in the Senate to delete provisions related to insurance counseling requirements and VA's educational assistance program.
Scoring for Purposes of Pay-As-You-Go
H.R. 3373 would affect direct spending and receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is zero.
