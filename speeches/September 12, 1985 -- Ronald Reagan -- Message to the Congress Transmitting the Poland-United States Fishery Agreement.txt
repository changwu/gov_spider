    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), (the Act), I transmit herewith the text of the Governing International Fishery Agreement between the Government of the United States and the Government of the Polish People's Republic, which was signed at Washington on August 1, 1985.
This agreement is one of a series negotiated in accordance with the Act. It is a renegotiated agreement that will allow the fisheries relationship between the United States and the Polish People's Republic to continue when the agreement currently in force expires on December 31, 1985. It incorporates the 1984 amendments to the Act that clearly establish the relationship between a foreign nation's allocations requests and its contributions to the development of the U.S. fishery in which it is requesting allocations. This agreement will further the objectives of the Act and will permit the fishing industries of the United States and the Polish People's Republic to continue without interruption the cooperative fishery arrangements that have developed since the first such agreement was signed with the Polish People's Republic in 1977.
I recommend that the Congress give favorable consideration to this agreement at an early date.
