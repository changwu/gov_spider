    Peterson Becomes 54th Member of Congress to Support Biden
On the eve of Super Tuesday, Minnesota Congressman Collin Peterson, the chairman of the U.S. House Agriculture Committee, released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"We need a strong voice for rural America in the White House, and Joe Biden has demonstrated that he cares about agriculture, our rural communities and economy. I believe Joe will focus on rural health care, strengthen education and job training opportunities and he's the right candidate with the broad coalition, the experience of achieving results, and the ability to unite our country to get it done. I'm proud to support Joe Biden for president because I believe he will be good for rural America."
Congressman Peterson is the 54th member of the U.S. House of Representatives to support Biden. Biden leads the field in congressional endorsements with support from 54 U.S. Representatives and seven U.S. Senators, including the most endorsements from members of both the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus. The support reflects the broad and diverse coalition Biden has been building to ensure we unite the party, unite the country, and beat Trump.
Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. Senators and Representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
