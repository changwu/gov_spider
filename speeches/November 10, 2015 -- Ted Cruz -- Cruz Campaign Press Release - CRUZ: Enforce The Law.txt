"Now, I want to go back to the discussion we had a minute ago, because, you know, what was said was right — the Democrats are laughing, because if Republicans join Democrats as the party of amnesty, we will lose. And you know, I understand when the mainstream media covers immigration, it doesn't often see it as an economic issue, but I can and tell you for millions of Americans watching this, it is a very personal economic issue. And I will say, the politics of it would be very, very different if a bunch of bankers or lawyers were crossing the Rio Grande, or if a bunch of people with journalism degrees were coming and driving down the wages press. Then we would see stories about the economic calamity that is befalling our nation.
"And I will say, for those of us who believe people ought to come to this country legally, we should enforce the law, we're tired of being told it's anti-immigrant, it's offensive. I am the son of an immigrant who came to this country legally from Cuba to seek the American Dream, and we can embrace legal immigration while believing in the rule of law. And I would note, try going illegally to another country, try going to China or Japan or try going to Mexico, see what they do. Every sovereign nation secures their borders, and it is not compassionate to say we're going to enforce the laws and drive down the wages for millions of men and women. That is abandoning them."
