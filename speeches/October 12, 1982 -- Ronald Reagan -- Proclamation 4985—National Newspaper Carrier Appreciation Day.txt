  A Proclamation

Every day nearly 100 million Americans read a newspaper that has been delivered to their homes by a newspaper carrier. The estimated one million newspaper carriers in our Nation, the great majority of whom are 18 years of age or younger, perform an essential service in the dissemination of information that is so vital to the functioning of a free society.
In all kinds of weather, and often in hours of darkness, these young people make their appointed rounds. Most of them are engaged in their first venture in American enterprise, their initiative and devoted efforts enhancing the quality of life in our Nation.
In recognition of the contribution of newspaper carriers in our society, the Congress of the United States has, by Senate Joint Resolution 239, designated October 16, 1982, as National Newspaper Carrier Appreciation Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate October 16, 1982, as National Newspaper Carrier Appreciation Day.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 12th day of Oct. in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.

RONALD REAGAN
