    Inslee campaign crosses fundraising milestone
Seattle - Governor Jay Inslee today announced that his 2020 presidential campaign has raised over $1 million in contributions. Inslee, who entered the race on Friday morning, made the announcement tonight during an interview on The Rachel Maddow Show.
Inslee launched his candidacy for president on Friday, saying "this is our moment" to defeat climate change. Inslee has received donations from all 50 states in his climate-focused campaign, as he builds a movement of supporters calling for climate action now.
"This is a major sign of the grassroots support behind our climate mission," said Inslee campaign manager Aisling Kerins. "In all 50 states, Americans are calling for a president who will put climate change first on the national agenda - and that's why they're supporting Gov. Jay Inslee's campaign for president."
Inslee made a series of media appearances on Sunday and Monday, appearing on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos, ABC's The View, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show.
Gov. Inslee is traveling to Iowa on Tuesday to kick off his "Climate Mission Tour." He will be in Nevada and California later in the week.
