    Strong second, leads field in Independent vote
LAKE JACKSON, Texas â€” A NewsMax/Insider Advantage poll released yesterday shows 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul in second place in the state of Iowa, solidifying his position at the top of the field and remaining a serious threat to take the Iowa Caucuses in January. Paul won 13 percent of likely caucus-goers in the poll and an impressive 30 percent of independent voters, leading the rest of the field. In addition, Paul won 47 percent of voters between 18 and 29 years old.
"The latest poll results clearly prove Ron Paul's status as a top contender, and confirms that our campaign is continuing to surge in early states," said Ron Paul 2012 Presidential Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton. "The American people are ready for real change in Washington and Dr. Paul is the only candidate who has a plan to cut $1 trillion in spending, balance the budget, and restore prosperity to the American people."
This latest poll comes on the heels of a number of recent polls placing Paul among the top three in key early states. According to a recent American Research Group poll, Paul takes third among likely Republican caucus-goers in Iowa. He also scores third place in New Hampshire, according to a recent WMUR/University of New Hampshire poll. And the most recent Suffolk University/7 News poll has Paul holding steady in second place with 14 percent among likely New Hampshire primary voters.
In addition, a late October CNN/Time poll showed the Texas congressman in the top three in the key Republican primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina.
