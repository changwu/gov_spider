    Hillary for America senior policy advisor Jacob Leibenluft responded today to Trump's latest iteration of his economic plan:
"It is astounding that Donald Trump doubled down on his tax plan benefiting billionaires while he continues to refuse to release his own tax returns that would reveal just how much he'd be impacted by his own plan. Trump's latest revision of his economic plan would benefit Trump at the expense of millions of hardworking folks across our country who deserve the opportunity at a better future. The bottom line after this do-over is the same: Trump has run on tax plans that will give himself and his family billions of dollars in tax cuts. He would give these tax cuts to wealthy families while offering new cuts in crucial supports that help working families, kids going to college, medical research, and more."
