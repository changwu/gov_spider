    The President today announced his intention to nominate W. Beverly Carter, Jr., to be Ambassador at Large to head a new State Department Office for Liaison with State and Local Governments. Carter, 57, of Philadelphia, Pa., is Ambassador to the Republic of Liberia.
As head of the Office for Liaison with State and Local Governments, Carter will report directly to the Secretary of State, and will also work closely with Jack Watson, Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs.
The responsibilities of the new office will include facilitating State and local governments' priority international interests; arranging briefings and other communications for Governors and key local government leaders on international issues of special interest to them, and conveying their views on such issues to the President and the Secretary of State; assisting senior State and local government officials in planning their official overseas travel and the visits of foreign officials; coordinating assignments with State and local governments for Foreign Service officers; and developing the State Department's capabilities to identify and to report to State and local governments on how other societies at the national or subnational level understand and resolve common problems of major importance.
Prior to his present assignment in Liberia, Carter served as Ambassador to Tanzania (1972-1975) and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs (1969-1972). A career Foreign Service information officer, he has served in public affairs and area positions in both the former USIA and the State Department.
David H. Shinn has been selected as deputy to Ambassador Carter and will be in charge of the new Office until Carter's return in mid-January. Shinn, a career Foreign Service officer, was most recently detailed to the mayor's office in Seattle under the Pearson Amendment domestic assignment program.
