    To The Congress of The United States:
In accordance with section 523A of the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act, 1992, I transmit herewith a report specifying my determination of the uniform percentage necessary to reduce outlays for travel, transportation, and subsistence by $15.7 million. As required by law, this reduction will be applied to all accounts within this appropriations act in FY 1992 with the exception of the Committee for Purchase from the Blind and Other Severely Handicapped. Federal agencies covered by this appropriations act have been instructed to make the required reductions.
George Bush
