    Warm greetings to everyone observing the Lunar New Year.
This annual festival, rooted in the ancient religious and cultural traditions of Asia, is a joyous celebration of family and community, of hope and new beginnings. Each year during the first month of the lunar calendar, millions of families across America and around the world gather to welcome the imminent arrival of spring by honoring their ancestors, visiting friends, sharing delicious food, and enjoying a profusion of fireworks, colorful decorations, parades, music, and dancing.
The celebration of the Lunar New Year is also a reminder of how much our national life has been enriched by the customs, culture, and achievements of Asian Americans. In every field of endeavor, from business to the arts, from government to academia, Asian Americans are making vital contributions to our country's progress and prosperity.
Hillary joins me in extending best wishes to all for a wonderful celebration and for a new year of health, happiness, and peace.
BILL CLINTON
