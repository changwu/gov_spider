    I am signing into law today H.R. 6900, the Emergency Compensation and Special Unemployment Assistance Extension Act of 1975. This act will ensure continued unemployment compensation benefits to Americans whose benefits would have expired on July 1.
The unemployment compensation system is our most important means of assistance for those Americans whose jobs have been lost as a result of economic recession.
Fortunately, we are now seeing signs in the economy that the worst of the downturn is over and that recovery has already begun. But we do know from past experience that it will take time before the effects of the overall improvement in the economy are reflected in substantial reductions in the unemployment rate.
We must, therefore, continue to provide support for those out of work as they seek jobs. That is the purpose and the promise of the legislation I am signing today.
In April, I proposed a bill to extend the availability of unemployment benefits. Since then, the close coordination and cooperation between the Congress and the Administration have resulted in the bill now before me.
I am gratified that as a result of this cooperative spirit, we will be able to ensure that additional unemployment compensation benefits will continue to be available to help ease the burden of the unemployed until they are back at work again. I pledge the continued efforts of this Administration to speed that day's arrival.
