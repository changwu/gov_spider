The Unemployment Rate Is Falling Faster Than Experts Predicted
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Projected That The Unemployment Rate For 2021 Would Be 10.1 Percent, And That It Would Only Decrease To 9.5 Percent By The End Of 2021. "The labor market is expected to improve after the third quarter, with a rebound in hiring and a significant reduction in furloughs as the degree of social distancing diminishes—leading to an increase in business activity and an increase in the demand for workers. In particular, the unemployment rate is projected to decline to 9.5 percent by the end of 2021. Under that projection, the unemployment rate at the end of 2021 would be about 6 percentage points higher than the rate in CBO's economic projection produced in January 2020, and the labor force would have about 6 million fewer people."

JPMorgan Projected That The Unemployment Rate Would Only Fall To 10.9 Percent By The End Of 2020. "Economists at the bank now peg their base-case scenario for unemployment at the end of 2020 at 10.9%, up from a prediction of 6.6% when it reported first-quarter earnings. That dimmed outlook comes as earlier-than-expected rehiring during May and June still left 20 million out of work, and as business reopenings are being rolled back in some regions."

JPMorgan Predicted Unemployment Would Still Hover Around 8 Percent At The End Of 2021. "More interesting is where JPMorgan sees the U.S. economy at the end of 2021. Unemployment will still hover around 8%, the bank says, and GDP will still contract—a call that contrasts with many other Wall Street firms expecting a return to growth next year." (Lisa Bellfuss, "What JPMorgan's Earnings Outlook Says About The U.S. Economy. Hint: It's Not Great," Barron's, 7/15/20)

Goldman Sachs Projected The Unemployment Rate Would Only Fall To 10 Percent At The End Of 2020 And Stay Above 8 Percent Through 2021. "Goldman Sachs expects the unemployment rate to stand around 10% at the end of 2020. For context, that matches the worst levels of the Great Recession. And even by the end of 2021, Goldman Sachs sees unemployment above 8%." (Matt Egan, "Goldman Sachs Issues Warning About US Unemployment," CNN, 5/13/20)
The Federal Reserve Projected Unemployment Would Only Fall To 9.3 Percent By The End Of 2020. "Federal Reserve leaders predict a slow recovery for the U.S. economy, with unemployment falling to 9.3 percent by the end of this year and to 6.5 percent by the end of 2021, after tens of millions of Americans lost their jobs in the stunning recession caused by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus."
