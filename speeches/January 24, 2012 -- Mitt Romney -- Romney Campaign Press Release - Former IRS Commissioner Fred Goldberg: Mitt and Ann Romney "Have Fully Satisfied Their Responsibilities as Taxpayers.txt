    Former Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service Fred Goldberg released the following statement on Mitt Romney's tax returns:
"I have reviewed Governor and Mrs. Romney's joint tax return for 2010, including returns for the Ann and Mitt Romney Family Trust, the Ann D. Romney Blind Trust, and the W. Mitt Romney Blind Trust. I have also reviewed the return in process for 2011. These returns reflect the complexity of our tax laws and the types of investment activity that I would anticipate for persons in their circumstances."
"There is no indication or suggestion of any tax-motivated or aggressive tax planning activities. In my judgment, they have fully satisfied their responsibilities as taxpayers. They have done so by relying on a highly reputable return preparer and other advisors, who have in turn relied primarily on information provided by third parties to them and to the IRS. The end result of that process has been returns that include a multitude of schedules, IRS forms and accompanying statements that provide appropriate transparency and the proper payment of taxes that Governor and Mrs. Romney owe under current law."
