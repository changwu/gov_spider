    Ahead of a planned vote by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee on a resolution on "the Old City of Jerusalem and its walls," Hillary Clinton issued the following statement:
"It is disappointing and wrong to see that UNESCO's World Heritage Committee is considering a resolution on Jerusalem that fails to recognize and respect the deep and historic ties of the Jewish people to Jerusalem and its holy sites.
Tomorrow'sÂ planned vote follows an outrageous UNESCO vote last week on a similar resolution. I have always stood with Israel to reject these biased actions at the United Nations, and I always will."
