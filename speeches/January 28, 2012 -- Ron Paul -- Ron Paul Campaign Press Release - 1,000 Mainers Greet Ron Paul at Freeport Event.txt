FALMOUTH, Maine — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul drew a crowd of 1,000 supporters in Freeport, Maine today, demonstrating his popularity among voters in the crucial Pine Tree State. The crowd gathered expressly for the 12-term Congressman from Texas as he spoke from the balcony of Linda Bean's Maine Kitchen & Topside Tavern at 1:30 p.m. EST.
Most notably, the crowd left the comfort of their homes, braving near-freezing temperatures to hear Dr. Paul's message. This contrasts with less inspiring candidates struggling with diminished interest including crowd size in balmy Florida. Event organizers noted that Dr. Paul touted provisions of his path-breaking 'Plan to Restore America' and conversed supporters and undecided Maine voters.
