    "Today's underwhelming job numbers report demonstrates President Obama's failure to address the tough challenges we face as a nation. We need a leader to stand up and make the difficult choices essential to spur economic growth and create new jobs. It's clear that serious changes must be implemented to get our economy back on the right track, and I would not shy away from the challenge. By owning up to the hard truths we face, addressing them, and then enacting an aggressive growth plan, we can create jobs and secure a brighter future for America."
