Out-of-town pool report #7: beach
POTUS and the first lady are sitting on the beach with what looks like three other people.
Pool is holding about 100 yards back. POTUS's bare head can be seen about his blue beach chair, and he faces away from him.
The White House tells us they are with long time friends ambassador to the EU Mark Gitenstein and his wife Libby.
That may leave one person unaccounted for
Check when pictures drop but there is a brown bag on the sand with them - suggesting possible picnic activity.
There are other families and couples dotted along the beach beneath umbrellas.

FLOTUS appeared from the beach path at 1900. She kissed farewell a companion goodbye and climbed into a waiting SUV.
POTUS appeared a minute later with the EU ambassador with whom they had been enjoying the beach. They said their farewells.
POTUS stopped when he heard a question asking 'any comment on the rising death toll in Maui.'
He appeared to say 'no ... No comment' according to lip readers in the pool but could not be heard.
He climbed into the SUV which then left in the motorcade for the short journey up his street.
And lid at 19:05.
Thanks to all co-poolers for lip reading, photo interpretation and insect repellent today.
