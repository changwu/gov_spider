    At the ABC News Presidential Debate at Drake University, Newt said he stands with President Reagan and will tell the truth.
"I think sometimes it is helpful to have a president of the United States with the courage to tell the truth. Just as it was Reagan who went around his entire national security apparatus to call the Soviet Union an 'evil empire.' Reagan believed the power of truth restated the world and reframed the world. I'm a Reaganite. I'm proud to be a Reaganite. I will tell the truth, even if it causes some confusion sometimes with the timid."
