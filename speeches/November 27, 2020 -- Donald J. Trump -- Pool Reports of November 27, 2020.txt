 In-town pool report #1 - gathering for departure 
Good morning. Members of the pool have been covid tested and we are gathering at 9:50 a.m. for departure.
We have no official updates on the president's schedule today. He's expected to travel to Camp David later this afternoon.

 In-town pool report #2 - WH departure 
?Motorcade is rolling from the White House at 10:18 a.m. to TBD destination on this Black Friday. The weather is a lovely 56 degrees with some clouds but hardly a breeze. Golfing is probably a good bet.
Your pooler briefly spotted a red-capped president getting into the motorcade.

 In-town pool report #3 — golf club 
?Motorcade pulled into the president's Virginia golf club at 10:59 a.m.
There's 2 men holding signs outside the entrance — one that said "God Bless America and Trump." The other man's sign was hard to make out but it showed a map of the US with blue and red states shaded in.
Pool vans are peeling off and headed to hold at Lucia's restaurant.
POTUS has been tweeting on the drive over.

 In-town pool report #4 - pool departure and arrival 
I have no official word at the moment on the president's location. He was set to arrive at Camp David around 3, per his public schedule, but I'm awaiting an update.
Pool loaded back in the vans at 2:00 p.m. and we went back to the club entrance, where there were now about two dozen Trump supporters with flags, some American flags and some blue Trump flags.
Guy from this morning is still here with sign reading "God Bless America + Trump." Another man has a series of posters that read, "why isn't the media reporting ... Trump won ... media coverup voter fraud."
We held at the entrance for about 15-20 minutes and left to head back to Washington at 2:23 p.m. We did not see or hear Marine One lift from our position.
At the intersection near the Lucia's shopping center, there were two masked protesters, one with a sign that said "#DiaperDon" with a drawing of Trump, and the other with poster that said "Lame duck a l'orange."
Pool arrived back at the White House at 3:05 p.m.

 In-town pool report #5 - lid 
The White House informed your pooler at 3:19 p.m. that POTUS departed the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling at 2:13 p.m. via Marine One, and landed at Camp David at 2:38 p.m.
We have a travel/photo lid at 3:20 p.m.
I've asked but not heard from the WH about what the president was doing at his club today, who he golfed with, or what his plans are at Camp David this weekend. I will share that info if I get an update.
Have a great weekend ~
