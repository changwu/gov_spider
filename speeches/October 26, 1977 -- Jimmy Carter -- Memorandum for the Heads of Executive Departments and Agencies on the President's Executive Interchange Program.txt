    Memorandum for the Heads GI Executive Departments and Agencies
To improve understanding between the Federal government and the private sector, I ask for your support of the President's Executive Interchange Program. It is designed to give executives from the Federal government and the private sector the opportunity of working in responsible positions in the opposite sector for a one-year period. Only those with a record of significant managerial accomplishments and potential for advancement to senior positions are chosen to participate.
This exchange of talent and expertise can help us use our human resources in the most effective way. This Program has my complete endorsement, and I urge all Federal Departments and Agencies to support it in two ways: by seeking out nominees from the career employees of your department for assignment in the private sector, and by accepting on assignment an appropriate executive from outside government.
The Executive Director of the President's Commission on Personnel Interchange, which administers the Program, will contact your office to follow up on this request.
