    Welcome to the people's house. Here we are in week one. I hope you're as enthused about your job as I am about mine. I, first, look forward to saying hello to each of you, and I know the Vice President does, as well.
We've begun a series of policy initiatives. First is education. I've been meeting with mostly the senior Members of the House and Senate—although a few freshmen have shown up in the meetings—to hear about a vision that I think is so important for America, and that is, every child get educated and a way to do so.
There will be other issues that we'll be talking about—military preparedness, Medicare and health care, Social Security reform, tax relief—and I look forward to working with you all. I come to Washington with a positive spirit of the possible, that I refuse to let any bitterness that may be lingering around inhibit us from rising above the expectations of the American people.
The people—some people—take a look at the election and say, "Well, gosh, the country is too divided. Nothing will happen." Our mission is to prove them wrong. It's to not only restore faith in Government by results, positive results for the people, but also to restore faith in Government by how we behave, by how we conduct the people's business. I know we can do it.
I'm honored you all are here. Congratulations on your elections. We look forward to working with you, and God bless.
