    The President announced today his nomination of Marshall McCallie to be Ambassador to Namibia, and his intention to nominate John Schmidt to the rank of Ambassador during his tenure of service as the Uruguay Round Coordinator. In that position, Mr. Schmidt will be the chief U.S. negotiator for the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. "These are two key appointments," said the President. "The Uruguay round of the GATT talks is vital to our hopes for freer and fairer trade in the world. Likewise, our relationship with Namibia is key as we seek to promote democracy in southern Africa. I am very happy with the choices of John Schmidt and Marshall McCallie to fill those roles."
