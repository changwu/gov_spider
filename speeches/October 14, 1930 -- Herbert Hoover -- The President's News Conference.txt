    SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR
THE PRESIDENT. I have a few questions that I can answer this morning. The first is that Dr. [Ray Lyman] Wilbur will remain in the Cabinet. The [Stanford] University will gladly extend his leave as long as it is necessary, and he is too valuable a man to lose out of the Federal service. Being one of the trustees of that institution myself, I can speak with more authority than the student daily.
BOULDER DAM
Second, the Boulder Dam construction will proceed as rapidly as possible. The determination of the points of law raised by the State of Arizona will be expedited so far as the Government is concerned, and in the meantime, I am in hopes that the States may be able to get together and compose their difficulties. They are not so far apart as to make such a settlement at all infeasible.
THE PRESIDENT'S TRAVEL PLANS
Third, I do not expect to leave Washington until Congress reconvenes unless I find an opportunity to attend a football game. Otherwise, I shall remain with you. That is all I have.
