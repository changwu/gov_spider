    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Aitkins (D) Massachusetts and 51 others)
The Administration wholeheartedly agrees with the objectives of H.J. Res. 602 â€” an end to the Vietnam occupation of Cambodia and effective guarantees against the Khmer Rouge ever again taking control -- and, therefore, has no objection to House passage of the resolution. We will work in the Senate, however, to delete the tenth resolved clause that deals with an immediate cutoff of all military support to the Khmer Rouge because, as worded, that clause would undermine our ability to work with key governments to achieve these very objectives.
