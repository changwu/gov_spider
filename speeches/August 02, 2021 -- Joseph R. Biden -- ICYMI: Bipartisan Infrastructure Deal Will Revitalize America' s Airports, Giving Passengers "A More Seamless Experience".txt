    Yesterday, Vox reported on funding in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal designated to repairing and modernizing airports across the country.
The reporting states that the $1 trillion investment in the nation's infrastructure includes $25 billion for airports to "increase efficiency during check-in, security screenings, and boarding; make air travel a little greener; and to ensure that airports…meet the needs of 21st-century travel."
Earlier this year, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) gave America's aviation system a D+, citing "basic inefficiencies and lack of space" and resulting issues.
"…The current plan focuses on addressing repair backlogs and investing in emission-reduction technologies. So far, it seems travelers can be optimistic about seeing some improvements — lawmakers in particular seem dedicated to terminal upgrades, which ASCE identified as the top investment need."
Greg Pecoraro, the president of the National Association of State Aviation Officials, said that should Congress pass the deal, "People can hopefully expect a more seamless experience. When they check in, they have an easier time going through security, an easier time checking their baggage and picking up their baggage on the other end. They have easy access to a flight that will arrive and take off in a timely manner because of an improved aviation management system. The route that the aircraft takes will be more direct to its destination, which means lower fuel costs, which means ticket prices remain as low as possible. When people arrive at their destination airport, there's a gate waiting for them, so that the aircraft pulls right up to the gate."
