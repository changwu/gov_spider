    PORTSMOUTH, NH-- New Mexico Governor and Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Richardson today released the following statement on the Dorgan-Grassley Amendment to the farm bill:
"I have been talking about my position on subsidy caps for months now. There must be a hard cap of $250,000 on payments to individual farmers and their spouses, and we must close every loophole. It is essential that the Senate vote yes and pass the Dorgan-Grassley Amendment. Excessive subsidies are just another form of Washington corporate welfare. They must stop.
"Excessive farm payment subsidies are bad for small family farmers. They are bad for American taxpayers. They are bad for just about everyone except for the giant agricultural corporations that they support. I strongly urge the Senate to do the right thing and cap these subsidies."
