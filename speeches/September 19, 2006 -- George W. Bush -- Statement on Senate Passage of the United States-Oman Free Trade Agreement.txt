    I commend the Senate for passing the U.S.-Oman free trade agreement, which will deliver benefits to both America and Oman. This agreement will level the playing field for U.S. workers and businesses, provide additional market access for U.S. goods, help Oman's leaders develop long-term opportunities for their people, and advance our shared goal of building a Middle East free trade area.
By strengthening our relations with a strategic friend and ally in the Middle East, this important agreement will also help protect America's national security interests.
I look forward to signing this legislation into law.
