    My dear Mr. Senator:
As to our conversation this morning, I am glad to confirm at once that the proposed additional drought relief measure was suggested for the purpose of real aid to the weakened credit situation in the drought area and that in the administration of it the Secretary of Agriculture assures me he has no other intention and that he will interpret it fairly and sympathetically.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[The Honorable Joseph T. Robinson, United States Senate, Washington, D.C.]
