    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Senators Chiles (D) and Graham (D) Florida)
The Administration opposes enactment of S. 90 as ordered reported by the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, unless it is amended to authorize Federal land acquisition only by means of land exchange as proposed by the Department of the Interior. Unless the bill is so amended, the President's senior advisors would recommend that it be vetoed.
Accordingly, the Administration urges that S. 90 not be considered under suspension of the rules, but that it be amended to incorporate Interior's land exchange proposal, which would eliminate the bill's land acquisition costs of some $40 to $60 million.
