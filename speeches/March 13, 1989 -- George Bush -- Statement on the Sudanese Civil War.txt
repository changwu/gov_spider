    Sunday, March 12, was the National Day of Concern for Sudan. It was organized by groups of Americans who are deeply distressed about the continuing human tragedy in Sudan. I want to add my support to this demonstration of concern for the Sudanese victims of war and starvation.
A month ago, Secretary of State Baker appealed to the warring parties to adopt a cease-fire, facilitate delivery of relief to those in need, and move the conflict to the negotiating table. The United States remains strongly committed to these goals.
All friends of Sudan, of which I am one, urge those responsible for the continuation of this war to agree to an early cease-fire, to place peace above military and political considerations, and to negotiate peace. I hope that the most recent political events in Sudan will enable the various donors to help those in that country who desperately require humanitarian assistance.
