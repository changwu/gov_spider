    President Obama spoke with British Prime Minister David Cameron today as part of his ongoing consultations with coalition allies and partners on Libya. The President and Prime Minister agreed that United Nations Security Council resolutions on Libya must be fully implemented. In addition to increasing military pressure and protecting civilians through the coalition operation that NATO is leading, the leaders discussed the importance of increasing diplomatic and economic pressure on the Qadhafi regime to cease attacks on civilians and comply with UN Security Council resolutions. The two leaders noted the international consensus achieved at last week's Contact Group meeting in Doha and the NATO Foreign Ministerial in Berlin, both of which emphasized the need for Qadhafi to leave power.
