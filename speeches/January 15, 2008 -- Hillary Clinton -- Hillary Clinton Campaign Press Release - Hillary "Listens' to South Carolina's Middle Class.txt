    (COLUMBIA) On the night of the Nevada debate, Hillary Clinton launched a new TV ad in South Carolina highlighting her commitment to Americans feeling the pressure of rising healthcare costs, mortgage rates, gasoline and college tuition. Hillary pledged to take their voices with her 35 year record of experience to the White House.
"Through her 35 years of service, Hillary has shown she hears the challenges we face and will take your voice with you as she stands up for middle-class Americans," State Director Kelly Adams said.
Senator Clinton has been a national voice for modernizing our healthcare technology infrastructure, reducing cost and improving quality, and she has the strength and passion to fix the healthcare crisis in America. Instead of sending billions of dollars to the Middle East for their oil, Hillary's proposal for creating a Strategic Energy Fund will create a new clean energy industry in America and create tens of thousands of jobs here. Hillary has fought to increase the maximum Pell Grant, reduce interest rates on student loans, increase campus-based aid through programs like federal work-study, and to expand the federal Direct Loan program. As President, Hillary has a plan to preserve the American dream of home ownership that would crack down on unscrupulous brokers, curb mortgage lending abuses, assist families facing foreclosure and expand affordable housing options.

Clinton:
"In this troubled economy how can so man millions of people simply not be heard?

Well I hear you.

You're asking for healthcare that covers everyone. Protection from losing your home. You'd like to fill your tank without draining your wallet. And give your kids the future they deserve.

If I'm your president I will bring more that my 35 years of experience to the White House, I'll bring your voice."

"I'm Hillary Clinton and I approved this message."
