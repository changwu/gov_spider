    Americans are getting back to work in every corner of the country in record numbers. Right now 17 States are at or tied with the lowest unemployment rate they've ever had, and 20 States have jobless rates below 3 percent. Over the last year, the unemployment rate dropped in every State and many States have reached historic lows. These aren't just numbers on a page: These are millions of Americans back at work and able to support themselves and their families with good-paying jobs and enjoy the dignity a job provides.
This wasn't an accident: this was the direct result of my economic plan to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out. There's still more work to do to build on this recovery and bring down costs for working families—and my administration is working on that every day—but we can't lose sight of how far, and how quickly, we've come.
