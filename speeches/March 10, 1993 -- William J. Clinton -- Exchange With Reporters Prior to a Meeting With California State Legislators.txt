    Health Care Task Force
Q. Mr. President, can your health care task force proceed in public?
The President. Well, I understand we got a good ruling from the judge today.
Q. The judge ruled that the meetings have to be open.
The President. He's ruled that they had to have some open meetings, but the briefing I got was that he ruled that some of the assertions that were made were absolutely unconstitutional. The briefing that I got was that we got a very good ruling from the judge today.
Military Base Closings
Q. Are the bases going to close in California, sir?
The President. I don't know. We don't know what's going to happen. I don't know what-you all have published lists. I've not seen the lists. You know how it works: The base closing commission has to make a recommendation. Then they give it to me, and I have to evaluate whether I think it's right or not. And then, after that, after those two things are reconciled, the Congress gets to vote up or down on it. So I don't know what's going to happen.
