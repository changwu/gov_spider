    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with The Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (P.L. 94-265; 16 USC 1801), I transmit herewith a governing international fishery agreement between the United States and Mexico, signed at Washington on August 26, 1977.
This Agreement is significant because it is one of a series to be negotiated in accordance with that legislation. It is also significant in the context of the warm and close relationship which the United States has had with Mexico for many years. I, therefore, urge that the Congress give favorable consideration to this Agreement at an early date.
