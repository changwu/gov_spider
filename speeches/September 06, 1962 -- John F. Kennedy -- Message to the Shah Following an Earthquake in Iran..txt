I HAVE been profoundly shocked to learn of the great natural catastrophe which has struck Iran. The hearts of the American people go out to those who have lost families or friends or seen their homes destroyed. Iran has suffered adversity many times before in its 2500 years of recorded history. But it has always triumphed. I know the people of Iran under your leadership will rise above this tragedy as well. The American Government and people are prepared to help in this effort. I have instructed our Ambassador to render any help he and U.S. Government agencies can provide which will alleviate the suffering and loss created by this disaster.
