'Apparently the DOJ put a Spy in the Trump Campaign. This has never been done before and by any means necessary they are out to frame Donald Trump for crimes he didn't commit.' David Asman @LouDobbs @GreggJarrett Really bad stuff!Retweets: 21466Favorites: 75730

Fake News Media had me calling Immigrants or Illegal Immigrants 'Animals.' Wrong! They were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories. I referred to MS 13 Gang Members as 'Animals' a big difference - and so true. Fake News got it purposely wrong as usual!Retweets: 43408Favorites: 160867

Why isn't disgraced FBI official Andrew McCabe being investigated for the $700000 Crooked Hillary Democrats in Virginia led by Clinton best friend Terry M (under FBI investigation that they killed) gave to McCabe's wife in her run for office? Then dropped case on Clinton!Retweets: 24058Favorites: 88886

Reports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted for political purposes into my campaign for president. It took place very early on and long before the phony Russia Hoax became a 'hot' Fake News story. If true - all time biggest political scandal!Retweets: 27122Favorites: 89902

Just met with UN Secretary-General Ant'nio Guterres who is working hard to 'Make the United Nations Great Again.' When the UN does more to solve conflicts around the world it means the U.S. has less to do and we save money. @NikkiHaley is doing a fantastic job! https://t.co/pqUv6cyH2zRetweets: 10937Favorites: 52364

California finally deserves a great Governor one who understands borders crime and lowering taxes. John Cox is the man - he'll be the best Governor you've ever had. I fully endorse John Cox for Governor and look forward to working with him to Make California Great Again!Retweets: 25000Favorites: 102430
