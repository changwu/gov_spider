    Chapel Hill, North Carolina – As part of his efforts to combat global warming, Senator John Edwards announced today that he will make his campaign "carbon neutral." Edwards believes global warming is one of the great challenges facing America and the world and that we can all take immediate action to decrease the amount of carbon we produce. By conserving energy and purchasing carbon offsets, the Edwards campaign will offset the carbon emitted by Edwards and his staff's campaign travel, and the energy used in his campaign headquarters and field offices.
"Global warming is an emergency and we can't wait until the next president is elected to take action," said Edwards. "Each of us can take responsibility in small ways to make a big difference. I encourage all Americans to conserve energy in their own homes and workplaces and help fight global warming."
In February, Governor Tom Vilsack announced he would be the first presidential candidate to plan a carbon neutral campaign. Edwards shares his commitment to protecting our environment and reducing our carbon footprint. The campaign and its landlord have taken the following steps to conserve energy:


Organizing a One Corps National Day of Energy Action in January to get supporters involved in the fight against global warming by working on community service activities including weatherizing homes and distributing energy-efficient compact fluorescent bulbs.
Using timers and motion detectors to control lights and shut down office equipment when not in use and turning off computers, televisions, and lights when not in use.
Online monitoring and management of heating and air conditioning to conserve energy.
Buying 100 percent post-consumer recycled paper and other recycled paper products.
Recycling paper, plastic, glass, cardboard, and other products.
Encouraging staff to adopt energy efficient practices in their office and homes. About a quarter of John Edwards for President headquarters employees walk to work.

After conserving energy, the campaign will purchase carbon offsets to make it carbon neutral. Carbon offsets allow one party to pay another to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide. Edwards will also financially support renewable energy projects to make them commercially viable and reduce the need for carbon-based energy.

A Carbon Neutral Campaign for the White House
"Global warming is an emergency. It requires international action to solve it, but we can't wait for the next president to get started. Everyone can take responsibility in big ways and small to reduce their impact on global warming." – John Edwards
Man-made greenhouse gas pollution has already made the planet 1.5 degrees hotter and the planet's temperature is rising faster and faster. Political campaigns—like other forms of modern life—contribute to global warming by using carbon-based energy in their travel, heating, and electricity.
John Edwards believes that the U.S. should take immediate action to halt global warming. However, American families and communities can act while their government fails to act. Today, Edwards announced that he will make his campaign "carbon neutral," eliminating its impact on global warming, by taking energy efficiency steps and supporting renewable energy.
CONSERVING ENERGY:
Global warming affects everyone and we all have to take responsibility to stop the crisis. There are easy, simple steps everyone can take in their homes and offices to use energy more efficiently. The John Edwards for President campaign and its landlord are conserving energy by:


Using timers and motion detectors to control lights and shut down office equipment when not in use and turning off computers, televisions, and lights when possible.
Online monitoring and management of heating and air conditioning to conserve energy.
Buying 100 percent post-consumer recycled paper and other recycled paper products.
Recycling paper, plastic, glass, cardboard, and other products.
Encouraging staff to adopt energy efficient practices in their office and homes. About a quarter of John Edwards for President headquarters employees walk to work.

Edwards has also encouraged his community of supporters to get involved in the fight against global warming. On January 27th, 2007, the campaign and its volunteers organized a One Corps National Day of Energy Action. Hundreds of local One Corps chapters worked together on community service activities including weatherizing homes and distributing energy-efficient compact fluorescent bulbs.
ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY:
After conserving energy, the Edwards campaign will purchase carbon offsets to make it carbon neutral. Edwards' support will help make new renewable energy projects commercially viable, reducing the need for carbon-based energy. He will offset the carbon emissions emitted by his and his staff's campaign travel and the energy used in his campaign headquarters and field offices.
Edwards will work with NativeEnergy to calculate the carbon impact of his campaign activities and purchase carbon offsets. Governor Tom Vilsack—the first presidential candidate to plan a carbon neutral campaign—also worked with NativeEnergy. The company supports renewable energy projects, including wind and family farm methane projects. The result is sustainable economic benefits and lower greenhouse gas emissions.
