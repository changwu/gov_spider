    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revision)(House)(Oakar (D) OH and 14 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4060 as inconsistent with the President's budget proposal to forego the 1987 cost-of-living adjustment for Federal retirees, a regrettable but necessary action in light of the deficit crisis facing the Nation.
Moreover, H.R. 4060 would exempt these programs from a sequester under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, thereby increasing the amount that would be sequestered under non-exempt programs.
The Administration believes that, if Gramm-Rudman-Hollings is to have its intended effect of forcing fiscal discipline, the number of programs subject to sequester should not be reduced.
