    On behalf of the American people, I offer my sincere condolences to the Argentine people and to President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner upon the death of Nestor Kirchner, former President of Argentina and Secretary General of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR). Nestor Kirchner played a significant role in the political life of Argentina and had embarked upon an important new chapter with UNASUR.
Michelle's and my thoughts and prayers are with President Fernandez de Kirchner and their children.
