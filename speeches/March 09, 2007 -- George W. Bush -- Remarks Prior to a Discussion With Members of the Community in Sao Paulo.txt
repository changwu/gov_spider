    Well, first I'd like to thank Flavio for his hospitality. Laura and I are so thrilled to be in Brazil. We love your beautiful country, but I also love the fact that there are people who are deeply concerned about the plight of the least of us. And I am very proud of my country's contribution to helping social entrepreneurs helping people help others. I believe you can change society one heart at a time; that's what I believe. But I know in order to do so, it requires people who are willing to make sacrifice.
Flavio is aâ€”runs a place of love and compassion, all aimed at being a part of that social fabric that helps heal the broken heart and provides hope for the future.
And so I thank you all for joining Laura and me. I'm really looking forward to hearing about what you have done, how others can help. But the main reason I'm here is to thank you. We're all members of God's family, and when one of us hurts, we all should hurt. And there are a lot of hurting people in the world, a lot of hurting people in Brazil. And the people in the United States care.
So I'm honored to be with you. I look forward to the roundtable. Flavio, I guess this is your place, so you start, right?
