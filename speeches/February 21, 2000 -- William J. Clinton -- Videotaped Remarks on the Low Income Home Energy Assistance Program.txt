    Rising oil prices have brought hardship to many families struggling to pay heating bills. I've released $295 million in emergency funds to help low income families cope with home heating cost. But many struggling families aren't aware they qualify for aid. That's why I've asked States to help make sure they reach as many eligible families as possible. To find out if you're eligible for help with heating bills, contact your State government or call 1-800-735-8004.
