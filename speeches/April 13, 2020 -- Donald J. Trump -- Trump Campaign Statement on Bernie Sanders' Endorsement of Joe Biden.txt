Biden had to adopt most of Bernie's agenda to be successful in the Democrat primaries. One thing that is missing is enthusiasm, however, as almost no one is excited about a Biden candidacy. And while Biden is the Democrat establishment's candidate, President Trump remains the disruptor candidate who has brought change to Washington. President Trump's supporters will run through a brick wall to vote for him. Nobody is running through a brick wall for Joe Biden."
- Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager
