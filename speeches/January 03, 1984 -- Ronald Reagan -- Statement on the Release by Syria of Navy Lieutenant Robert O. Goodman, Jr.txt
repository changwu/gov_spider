    All Americans must be pleased that the Government of Syria has told our Ambassador that they have agreed to release Lieutenant Goodman as a result of the efforts of the Reverend Jesse Jackson. We are delighted that this brave young man will soon be united with his family and that his ordeal is over.
We hope the Syrian Government will continue to work for peace in Lebanon so that all foreign forces—Syrian, Israeli, and the multinational force—can come home and allow that country to be united, independent, and sovereign once more.
