    Nancy and I join Jim Brady's family and many friends in wishing him a happy 41st birthday. We continue to pray for his full and speedy recovery.
Jim Brady is a talented and dedicated public servant. He is my friend, and I am proud to have him as my Press Secretary. Nancy and I salute "The Bear" and Sarah today, and we look forward to celebrating his next birthday in his office at the White House.
