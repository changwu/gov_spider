    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, the Convention signed at Washington on October 28, 1975, between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income.
There is no convention on this subject presently in force between the United States and Egypt.
The Convention is similar in most essential respects to other recent United States income tax treaties.
I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
Conventions such as this one are an important element in promoting closer economic cooperation between the United States and other countries. I urge the Senate to act favorably on this Convention at an early date and to give its advice
and consent to ratification.
