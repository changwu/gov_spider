    Like so many here in Washington and across the country, Michelle and I were deeply saddened to hear about the passing of a true giant of journalism, David Broder. David filed his first story from our Nation's Capital before starting as a junior political writer on the 1960 Presidential election. In the decades that followed, he built a well-deserved reputation as the most respected and incisive political commentator of his generation, winning a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of Watergate and earning the affectionate title of "Dean" of the Washington press corps. Through all his success, David remained an eminently kind and gracious person, and someone we will dearly miss. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends in this difficult time.
