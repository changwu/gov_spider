    Hillary Clinton released the following statement after earning the endorsement of the American Nurses Association:
"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of the American Nurses Association, which represents the interests of America's 3.4 million registered nurses.
"Across the country, nurses provide vital medical care to countless Americans every year. They care for our families and friends, they comfort us in times of uncertainty and grief, and they maintain continuously high standards of medical practice. You won't find a harder-working, more dedicated, and more trusted group of professionals anywhere.
"As President, I will always stand with America's nurses in the fight to finally achieve universal, affordable health care and fight against any efforts to roll back the protections and coverage of the Affordable Care Act. I will always stand with American workers to protect their rights and safety on the job. And I will fight to ensure that patients get the very best care, including by addressing the looming nursing shortage, investing substantially in tackling America's substance use disorder crisis, and finally taking mental health as seriously as we do physical health."
