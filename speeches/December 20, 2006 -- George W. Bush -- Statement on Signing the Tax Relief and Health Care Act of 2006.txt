    Today I have signed into law H.R. 6111, the "Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006." The Act prevents tax increases that would have taken effect in the absence of the Act, facilitates effective use of health savings accounts, makes available natural resources of the outer continental shelf, and strengthens American laws in support of free trade.
The executive branch shall construe provisions of the Act, including section 406(c)(2) in Division A and section 203(b) in Division B, that call for executive branch officials to submit legislative recommendations to the Congress, in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President to supervise the unitary executive branch and to recommend for congressional consideration such measures as the President shall judge necessary and expedient.
The executive branch shall construe as advisory provisions of the Act that purport to require concurrence of State officials as a precondition to execution of the laws, including section 415(b) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 as amended by section 207 in Division C and section 311(d) in Division C, as is consistent with the Constitution's vesting in the President of the executive power and the duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.
The executive branch shall construe provisions of the Act, including section 4005(b) in Division D and section 213A(f) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act as amended by section 5002 in Division D, that purport to make consultation with committees of Congress a precondition to execution of the law, to call for but not mandate such consultation, as is consistent with the Constitution's provisions concerning the separate powers of the Congress to legislate and the President to execute the laws.
