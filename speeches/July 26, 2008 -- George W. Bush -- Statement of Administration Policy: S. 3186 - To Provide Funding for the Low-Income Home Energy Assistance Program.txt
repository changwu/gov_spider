(Senate)
(Sen. Sanders (I) VT and 33 cosponsors)
The Administration is committed to helping eligible low-income families with energy assistance through the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and already has released $2.47 billion in LIHEAP funding this year. There is a remaining balance of $100 million in the LIHEAP contingency fund to address future emergencies through September 2008. However, the Administration strongly opposes S. 3186 because it unnecessarily makes available an additional $1.265 billion in each of the base and contingency funds for a total increase of $2.53 billion for LIHEAP to be used through September of this year. If S. 3186 were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.
The funding increase in S. 3186 is unnecessary because LIHEAP is largely a heating assistance program and many States end their heating programs by the Spring. Also, neither the base nor the contingency funding is offset and it would therefore further increase the deficit. The Administration urges Congress to pass and send to the President twelve fiscally responsible annual appropriations bills in order to consider the annual appropriation for LIHEAP along with every other item in the FY 2009 Budget.
