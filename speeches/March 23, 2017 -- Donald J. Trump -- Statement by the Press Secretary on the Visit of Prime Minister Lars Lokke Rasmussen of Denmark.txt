    President Donald J. Trump looks forward to welcoming Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen of Denmark to the White House on Thursday, March 30. The Prime Minister's visit will occur on the eve of the 100th anniversary of Denmark formally ceding the U.S. Virgin Islands to the United States. During their meeting, the President and Prime Minister will discuss our strong bilateral relationship and how we can progress on our shared priorities, including deepening already robust economic ties, defeating ISIS, and strengthening our defense and security relationship, both bilaterally and through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
