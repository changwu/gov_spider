    Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Buck McKeon made the following statement on tonight's third presidential debate:
"This evening's debate presented two very different conceptions of America's role and responsibilities in the world. President Obama defended his strategy of leading from behind and his record of compromising our interests and ideals alike. He promised to double down on the same policies and continue down the same course. But the fact of the matter is that we cannot afford four more years of the kind of leadership that betrays our friends like Israel, encourages our adversaries like Iran to defy us, and jeopardizes our security through devastating cuts to our defense. The President's approach of fecklessness and flexibility has projected weakness abroad, and the signs of disorder are hard to miss. Mitt Romney will lead our country in a new direction that is consistent with sound principles and strong leadership."
