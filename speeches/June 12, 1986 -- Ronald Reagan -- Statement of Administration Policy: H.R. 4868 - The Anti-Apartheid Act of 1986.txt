    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. Grey (D) Pennsylvania and 106 others)
The Administration strongly opposes enactment of H.R. 4868 because the measures it calls for would impede rather than advance the goal of promoting further change in South Africa.
The Administration shares the view of the bill's sponsors that the United States should remain in South Africa and work for change. However, it believes that this bill, if passed, will unintentionally erode efforts to break down apartheid, strengthen radical elements on both sides, and penalize the people and the economy of South Africa. Measures in the bill would also cause serious deleterious economic effects to the people of neighboring black African states that rely extensively on South African trade and transportation links.
The Administration supports a joint effort by the United States and its allies to hasten negotiations between black leaders and the South African government. If the measures called for in H.R. 4868 are enacted, this could heighten the intransigence on both sides, as well as seriously impair the President's ability to promote collective action with our allies.
For these reasons, the bill is unacceptable.
