Good morning, your pool is on the move with the Potus motorcade just crossing into Northern Virginia. Destination unknown but it is sunny and pleasant. We will advise upon arrival. ICYMI, Potus has been tweeting this morning.

 In Town travel pool #2/golf 
Surprise! The presidents motorcade arrived at Trump National in Sterling at 10:15 a.m. after an uneventful commute. Pool did not have eyes on Potus. A handful of protesters lined one side of the entrance with a row of faux tomb stones and a person dressed as the Grim Reaper wearing a sign reading, "183k dead." Another waved a Biden campaign flag and another had a sign reading "no, Donald, this is what it is" apparently referring to the tomb stones. On the pro-Trump side there were flags reading "Build the wall!" and "Finish the wall." One woman have the motorcade the middle finger and one man gave it the thumbs down side. So, anyway, happy Sunday morning.
Anyhow the pool peeled off and arrived at a nearby restaurant where we are holding. Sinatra's "Fly me time the moon" is playing on the speakers.

 In town pool report #3/Pool moving 
At 2:03 p.m., the pool packed up from our holding spot at Lucia's restaurant (good food, lovely service, with social distancing in place and masks required) in Sterling and returned to the vans, apparently signaling that Potus is wrapping up his Sunday visit to his golf resort. A five-minute drive has the pool back at the entrance of Trump National, holding here in the vans. The number of Trump supporters and protesters have grown since this morning.

 In town pool report #6/WH return and lid 
Motorcade returned to WH grounds at 3:52 pm
After uneventful trip during which your pooler struggled to type out a story on his laptop while seated on the rear of a press van hurtling down Rt 66 which appears to be awaiting a resurfacing. Not recommended. Anyhow, WH has called a travel photo lid. Enjoy your Sunday afternoon.

 In town pool #7/Abe call 
The White House put this out at 10:50 pm:
President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan spoke at length tonight and reflected on the last four years. The two leaders remarked that their relationship is extraordinary; the President called Prime Minister Abe the greatest prime minister in Japan's history. The President said that Prime Minister Abe has done a fantastic job and that the relationship between the United States and Japan is better today than it has ever been. Although Prime Minister Abe will be leaving his position soon, the President noted that he will undoubtedly keep playing a big role in the future of Japan. The two leaders said they look forward to continuing their wonderful friendship for years to come!
