    Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker made the following statement on Mitt Romney's plan for real change:
"In times of crisis, what people want more than anything is leadership. Mitt Romney will win Wisconsin because he is a proven reformer with a plan to get 12 million people back on the job. When Mitt Romney is president, he will change the nation's course, get us to a balanced budget, create jobs and deliver more take-home pay. Under Mitt Romney, real change will begin on Day One."
