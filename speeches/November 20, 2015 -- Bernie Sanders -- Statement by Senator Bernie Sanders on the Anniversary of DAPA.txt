    LAS VEGAS â€“ Today marks the one-year anniversary of President Obama's announcement of the Deferred Action for Parental Accountability and the expansion of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit recently blocked implementation of part of the plan. The Obama administration indicated it will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Arturo Carmona, Sen. Bernie Sanders' national Latino outreach director, said there is consensus in the legal community that the deferred action initiatives are on solid legal ground.
"I applaud the president for taking some action last year to ameliorate our broken immigration system. We are a nation of immigrants and it is unacceptable that millions of families are living in the shadows," Carmona said. "While Sen. Sanders has worked in Congress to modernize our outdated immigration system, he is committed to taking strong executive action including dismantling the inhumane deportation programs and private prisons."
