    We are disappointed that the House of Representatives did not vote to keep pressure on the Sandinistas during the peace process. We thank our many supporters in Congress who worked so hard on behalf of this issue. We will continue consultations with these congressional supporters and others concerning the future of the resistance and the peace process.
