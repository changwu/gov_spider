    Chicago, IL -- In a major policy address tomorrow in Bettendorf, IA, Barack Obama will announce his plan to change Washington and reclaim the American Dream for working families across the country. At a time when costs are rising and Americans are working harder just to keep up, Obama's comprehensive plan will provide relief for the middle class and support for working people. Obama has fought for working Americans his entire public life, and he will discuss how he will stand up to special interests and bring America together to reclaim the American dream.
