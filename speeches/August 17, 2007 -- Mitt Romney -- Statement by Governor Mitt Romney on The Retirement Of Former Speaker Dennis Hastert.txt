Boston, MA – Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement on former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives J. Dennis Hastert's announcement of his retirement:
"Today's announcement is the culmination of a long and distinguished career that has taken Speaker Hastert from the classroom at Yorkville High School to the halls of Congress. When Dennis Hastert was elected Speaker in 1999, he ushered in an era of principled leadership advancing our common belief that America's strength lies in the American people. As the longest serving Republican Speaker, he led the Congress to achieve great things for the American people – bipartisan education reform, the most significant tax relief in a generation and new measures to protect our country.
"Leaving the Congress after 20 years of service, Speaker Hastert built a record of accomplishment that has improved the lives of the American people. His leadership will be missed by all. Ann and I wish him the best during his remaining time in Congress and in his future endeavors."
