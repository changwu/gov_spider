    In signing this appropriation legislation, which includes funding for the Multilateral Development Banks, I would like to clarify one point. While I firmly believe that we must continue the valuable and productive unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan, and I strongly support efforts to ensure their continued participation in the Asian Development Bank, certain terminology used in the amendment to the bill concerning this issue is not consistent with United States Government policy, which recognizes the People's Republic of China as the sole, legal Government of China. I want to make clear that my signing of this bill does not reflect any change in the position of four successive Presidents with respect to China, nor should it be interpreted as any shift in the United States Government's recognition policy.
