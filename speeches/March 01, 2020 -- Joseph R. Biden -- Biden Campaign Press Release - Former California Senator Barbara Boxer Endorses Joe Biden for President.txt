"Like all of us, Joe has been knocked down. Hard. He always gets up and he always finds the beauty, the promise and the hope that lives in every corner of this country we all love. His record proves he understands the values of America.
"Getting the jobs bill done which got us out of the recession? Joe was our leader.

"Joe wants to continue to make life better for all of us and he knows how to stand up to bullies. Because of that he can win a broad election victory including in the swing states we must win.
"I invite you to join me in supporting Joe Biden for President."
