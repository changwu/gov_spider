Democrats can't impeach a Republican President for crimes committed by Democrats. The facts are 'pouring' in. The Greatest Witch Hunt in American History! Congress go back to work and help us at the Border with Drug Prices and on Infrastructure.Retweets: 29701Favorites: 108682

Hearing word that Russia Syria and to a lesser extent Iran are bombing the hell out of Idlib Province in Syria and indiscriminately killing many innocent civilians. The World is watching this butchery. What is the purpose what will it get you? STOP!Retweets: 23268Favorites: 92245

Kevin Hassett who has done such a great job for me and the Administration will be leaving shortly. His very talented replacement will be named as soon as I get back to the U.S. I want to thank Kevin for all he has done - he is a true friend!Retweets: 12354Favorites: 70756

.@SadiqKhan who by all accounts has done a terrible job as Mayor of London has been foolishly 'nasty' to the visiting President of the United States by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom.

....Kahn reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC de Blasio who has also done a terrible job - only half his height. In any event I look forward to being a great friend to the United Kingdom and am looking very much forward to my visit. Landing now!Retweets: 31415Favorites: 151155

China is subsidizing its product in order that it can continue to be sold in the USA. Many firms are leaving China for other countries including the United States in order to avoid paying the Tariffs. No visible increase in costs or inflation but U.S. is taking Billions!Retweets: 16997Favorites: 74134

Just arrived in the United Kingdom. The only problem is that @CNN is the primary source of news available from the U.S. After watching it for a short while I turned it off. All negative & so much Fake News very bad for U.S. Big ratings drop. Why doesn't owner @ATT do something?Retweets: 27168Favorites: 114027

I believe that if people stoped using or subscribing to @ATT they would be forced to make big changes at @CNN which is dying in the ratings anyway. It is so unfair with such bad Fake News! Why wouldn't they act. When the World watches @CNN it gets a false picture of USA. Sad!Retweets: 24604Favorites: 99546
