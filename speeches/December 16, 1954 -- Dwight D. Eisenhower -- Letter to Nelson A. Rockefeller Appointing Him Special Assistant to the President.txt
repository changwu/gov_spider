Dear Mr. Rockefeller:
An outstanding characteristic of our nation, I believe, is a constant endeavor to insure each citizen the fullest possible opportunity to develop himself spiritually, socially and economically. Faith in the individual, in his dignity and in his capacity for achievement is a basic principle of our system. The history of America is the story of men and women who came to these shores from all parts of the world and who have made full use of their opportunities, not only for themselves but in order that others might benefit. Of such is our strength.
It is my conviction that all the peoples of the world share the same human cravings for freedom and for opportunities to win economic and social advancement. In keeping with our heritage we seek to join with all peoples in a common effort to achieve and sustain the basic essentials of human dignity.
It is time for all of us to renew our faith in ourselves and in our fellow men. The whole world has been far too preoccupied with fears. It is time for people throughout the world to think again of hopes, of the progress that is within reach.
So that these matters may have the increased degree of attention they deserve, not only in the Departments and agencies but especially within my immediate staff, I hereby appoint you as Special Assistant to the President. I shall look to you for advice and assistance in the development of increased understanding and cooperation among all peoples. I shall also look to you for assistance in reviewing and developing methods and programs by which the various Departments and agencies of the government may effectively contribute to such cooperation and understanding.
You are requested to attend the meetings of the Cabinet, the National Security Council, the Council on Foreign Economic Policy, and the Operations Coordinating Board.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
