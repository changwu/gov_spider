    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Mitchell (D) ME)
If S.J. Res. 44 were presented to the President, the President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto it. While the Administration's economic assumptions include two consecutive quarters of negative real economic growth, the Office of Management and Budget, the Congressional Budget Office, and most private sector forecasts project that the economy should begin to recover in the second quarter this year with the pace of growth accelerating into 1992. Suspension of the Federal budget discipline enacted at the close of the 101st Congress would be effective for all of fiscal year 1991 and fiscal year 1992, long after economic growth is expected to resume. The prospect of such a suspension of discipline could prove counter-productive with respect to the economy.
