    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today officially opened its Florida campaign office. The Florida headquarters, located in the city of Winter Park in the Orlando area, will house Rudy's Florida staff and serve as the base of operations for volunteer activities in the state.
Florida Campaign Chairman and State Attorney General Bill McCollum and National Campaign Manager Michael DuHaime were on hand for the opening.
"Our office opening demonstrates Rudy's continued commitment to winning Florida's primary and general elections. We're building the team it takes to spread the Mayor's positive vision and look forward to continuing an aggressive campaign in the state," DuHaime said.
Today's opening follows the recent endorsements of former Florida Governor Bob Martinez and Chip LaMarca, Chairman of the Broward County Republican Party, and the announcement of 32 county chairs and co-chairs.
