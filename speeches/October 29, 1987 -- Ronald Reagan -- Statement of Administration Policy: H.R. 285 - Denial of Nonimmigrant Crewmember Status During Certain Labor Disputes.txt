    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Roukema (R) New Jersey and 40 others)
The administration opposes H.R. 285, which would prohibit the admission into the United States of nonimmigrant alien crewmembers serving on international airline and shipping routes of American carriers during a strike or lockout involving their American employer.
The administration would not object, however, to H.R. 285 if amended to extend permanently section 315(d) of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-603), which will expire, on November 5, 1987. Section 315(d) is similar to H.R. 285, but does not (1) prohibit foreign crewmembers hired prior to a strike from entering the United States as crewmembers, and (2) restrict the Attorney General's use of parole authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Therefore, the administration urges that H.R. 285 not be considered under suspension of the rules and that it be amended accordingly.
