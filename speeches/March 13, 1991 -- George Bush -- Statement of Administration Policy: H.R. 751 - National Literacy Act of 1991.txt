    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Sawyer (D) OH and 47 others)
The Administration strongly supports the goal of increasing literacy in America and is implementing a number of initiatives to further that goal. In this regard, the Administration is working with Congress to fashion an effective literacy initiative. H.R. 751 is the current product of that cooperation and represents an improvement over earlier literacy proposals. The Administration will continue to seek needed improvements to H.R. 751 in the Senate, such as elimination of authority for another literacy institute that would duplicate currently funded authorities. However, the Administration does not object to House passage of the bill.
