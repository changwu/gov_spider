    To the Congress of the United States:
I have reviewed the activities of the United States Government departments and agencies during calendar year 1989 related to preventing nuclear proliferation, and I am pleased to submit my annual report pursuant to section 601(a) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95 - 242, 22 U.S.C. 3281(a)).
As the report demonstrates, the United States continued its efforts during 1989 to prevent the spread of nuclear explosives to additional countries. This is an important element of our overall national security policy, which seeks to reduce the risk of war and increase international stability. I want to build on the positive achievements cited in this report and to work with the Congress toward our common goal: a safer and more secure future for all mankind.
George Bush
