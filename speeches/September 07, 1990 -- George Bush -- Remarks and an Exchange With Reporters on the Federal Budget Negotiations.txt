    The President. I just wanted to say a quick word on the budget. We're going out now with Dick Darman and with Scowcroft. We're going to try to insist that -- working with the leaders of Congress on both sides of the aisle to get these budget talks moving. I'm pleased with what Dick Darman told me about the cooperative attitude that exists up there now. I think there's a new opportunity to do what this country desperately needs, and that is to have a budget agreement that will get these deficits under control.
And I am very hopeful that this spirit of cooperation that I'm told by Dick exists across both sides of the aisle will be the catalyst in getting a budget agreement which, in my view, is long overdue and is absolutely essential in terms of the well-being of our economy. So, that's what this trip is about. Then we'll head on back.
Q. Why are you taking Scowcroft? Does that mean the Gulf is going to have a part of this -- --
The President. Well, it means that the defense component and the domestic component are together as far as the administration goes. That's why Brent's going out. I've got to run.
