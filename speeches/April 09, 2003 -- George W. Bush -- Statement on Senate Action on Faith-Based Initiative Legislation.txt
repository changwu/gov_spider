    I commend the Senate for acting in a bipartisan way to pass legislation that will help us meet our shared goal of better serving Americans in need. This legislation contains key elements of the Faith-Based Initiative that I proposed more than 2 years ago to encourage more charitable giving and rally the armies of compassion that exist in communities all across America.
America's charities face tough times, and we can do more to support their efforts. I look forward to continuing to work with Congress to improve the CARE Act legislation, and I continue to urge Congress to take additional steps to end discrimination against faith-based organizations that have a proven record of helping people in need realize a better life.
