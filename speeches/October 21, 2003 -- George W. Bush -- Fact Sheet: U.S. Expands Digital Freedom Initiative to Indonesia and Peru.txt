Today, President Bush announced the expansion of the U.S. Digital Freedom Initiative to two APEC economies: Indonesia and Peru.
Digital Freedom Initiative (DFI): The United States is committed to helping countries bridge the digital divide and generate economic growth and opportunity. DFI promotes transfer of information and communication technology (ICT) to benefit entrepreneurs and small businesses in developing countries. It also aims to help countries create a pro-competitive policy and regulatory environment. The program is a public-private partnership and is supported by USA Freedom Corps' Volunteers for Prosperity initiative.
Expansion to Indonesia and Peru: President Bush welcomed Indonesia and Peru as DFI partner countries. The activities to be pursued in these countries cover a range of possibilities, including:

Placing U.S. private and public sector volunteers in small and medium-sized businesses to share ICT expertise;
Supporting development of a national cyber-security program to facilitate computerization and e-business;
Providing easier access to credit for small and medium-sized businesses; and
Applying U.S. expertise in areas such as distance learning, tele-health and e-government.
