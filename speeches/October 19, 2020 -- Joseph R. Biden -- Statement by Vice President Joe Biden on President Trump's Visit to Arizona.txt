    President Trump is spending the final days of his campaign trying to sow division and distract the American people from his failure to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. He wants to sell Arizona families more of the same reckless leadership that has devastated the state's economy, shuttered thousands of small businesses, and threatens protections for the 2.8 million Arizonans living with a preexisting condition. He's insulted our heroes like my friend Senator John McCain by calling them "losers" and "suckers." Every day he's tearing at the fabric of who we are as a country.
Arizonans deserve a president who is going to unite the country and be a president for all Americans. I'm going to lead our nation out of the pandemic so that we all can build back better — by ensuring everyone has access to quality, affordable health care and creating millions of good-paying jobs. Arizona — right now, the power to move our country forward is in your hands. Vote early.
