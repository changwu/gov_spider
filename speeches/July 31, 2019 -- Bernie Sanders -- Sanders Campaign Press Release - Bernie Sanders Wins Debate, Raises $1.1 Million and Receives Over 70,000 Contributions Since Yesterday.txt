    DETROIT â€“ In addition to a commanding debate performance, Bernie Sanders' campaign raised $1.1 million and received more than 70,000 contributions from small-dollar donors since yesterday, marking a strong and growing grassroots movement.
"Bernie Sanders commanded the debate, his vision and ideas dominated the stage, and he left absolutely no doubt that he is the best candidate ready to take this fight to Donald Trump and finally bring the change we need to America," said Campaign Manager Faiz Shakir. "Bernie Sanders stood out as a champion of working people and marginalized communities."
Much of yesterday's debate centered on Sanders' signature policy, Medicare for All. Bernie's plan to provide all people with comprehensive health care won out over other candidates' push to continue providing billions to the big pharma and for-profit health insurers.
Earlier this month, Sanders made the "No Health Insurance and Pharma Money" pledge and called on fellow presidential candidates to reject campaign donations from health insurance and pharmaceutical industry executives, lobbyists and PACs. To date, only one other contender has committed to the pledge while the rest of the field continues to accept donations from industry executives who drive the current dysfunctional, for-profit health care system.
Since launching the campaign, Bernie 2020 has received over 2 million individual contributions. He is the only Democratic candidate to have more individual contributions than Donald Trump. In the second quarter, the most frequent donations by occupation and employer came from teachers and Walmart workers. Of the 70,000 contributions since yesterday, the top employers were Starbucks, USPS, Amazon and WalMart, with Los Angeles Unified School District Teachers rounding out the top ten.
