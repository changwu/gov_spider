    President Donald J. Trump's re-election campaign today issued the following statement regarding the endorsement of the Public Safety Alliance of Nevada, which represents over 100 law enforcement organizations and nearly 10,000 officers throughout Nevada:
"By turning their backs on our nation's law enforcement officers, Joe Biden and the radical left are making every American less safe. Joe Biden has endorsed cutting police funding, proving he is too weak to stand up to the extreme, anti-police leftists in control of his party, and siding with rioters against the police and law-abiding citizens. President Trump stands with law enforcement officers to protect the Thin Blue Line and sides with people who want safe communities. Joe Biden consistently makes excuses for the rioters and defends the mob, and police organizations across the country have noticed. We celebrate the endorsement of the Public Safety Alliance of Nevada because they represent the very best heroes in America."
- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
