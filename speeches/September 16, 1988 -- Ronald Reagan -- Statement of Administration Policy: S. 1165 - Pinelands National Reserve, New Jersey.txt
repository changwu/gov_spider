    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Bradley (D) New Jersey and Lautenberg (D) New Jersey)
The Administration opposes enactment of S. 1165. The State of New Jersey should assume the responsibility for developing and implementing educational programs and acquiring additional land at Pinelands National Reserve instead of authorizing $18 million of Federal appropriations for these low priority activities.
