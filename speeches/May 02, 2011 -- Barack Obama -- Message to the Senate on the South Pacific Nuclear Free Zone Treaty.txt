    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith Protocols 1, 2, and 3 to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty ("the Treaty"), signed on behalf of the United States at Suva on March 25, 1996. I also transmit for the information of the Senate the Treaty to which these Protocols relate and the Department of State's Overview of the Protocols, which includes a detailed article-by-article analysis of both the Protocols and the Treaty.
Ratification of Protocols 1, 2, and 3 to the Treaty would fully support U.S. nonproliferation policy and goals, and I am convinced that it is in the best interest of the United States to ratify these Protocols. This step will strengthen our relations with our South Pacific friends and allies and enhance U.S. security by furthering our global nonproliferation and arms control objectives. As the Overview of the Department of State explains, entry into force of Protocols 1, 2, and 3 for the United States would require no changes in U.S. law, policy, or practice.
I recommend that the Senate give favorable consideration to Protocols 1, 2, and 3 to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty and give its advice and consent to their ratification, subject to the statements described in the Overview of the Department of State.
