    The President has announced his intention to appoint four public members to the Supplemental Health Insurance Panel. The Panel was created by Congress in June 1980 to evaluate State regulatory programs regarding Medicare supplemental health insurance policies.
The Panel is composed of five ex-officio members, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and four State insurance commissioners, who are public members, appointed by the President.
The four public members are:
JOSEPH C. MIKE, of Hartford, Conn., who has served as State insurance commissioner since 1977 and was deputy insurance commissioner prior to that time. He also serves on the Connecticut Commission on Hospitals and Health Care and is a member of the executive committee of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
SUSAN MITCHELL, of Madison, Wis., who was appointed commissioner of insurance in 1979. Prior to her appointment, she headed the department of regulation and licensing. She is the only female State insurance commissioner in the country.
WILLIAM WOODYARD, of Little Rock, Ark., who was appointed insurance commissioner in 1976 and served as deputy insurance commissioner and chief counsel prior to his appointment. He is president-elect of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
ROGER DAY, of Salt Lake City, Utah, who was appointed insurance commissioner in 1977. Previously, he served as administrative assistant to the executive director of the Utah Group Health Plan. He represents the western States on the executive committee of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
