    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of former New York Mayor David N. Dinkins.
"Hillary Clinton has devoted her life to helping others," Dinkins said. "From healthcare to education to caring for our veterans, she has been a champion for the millions of Americans who have been invisible to this administration. Her depth of experience and her strength of character make her uniquely suited to be President."
Dinkins, New York City's first African-American Mayor, served as the 106th Mayor of the City of New York from 1990 to 1994. Among his many accomplishments was the institution of the widely praised "Safe Streets, Safe City" program, which hired thousands of new police officers and began the decline of crime rates in New York City. He established a system of after-school youth centers, Beacon Schools, and opened several Community Health Centers. Dinkins also led the fight to divest the City's $500 million dollars in pension funds invested in companies that did business with apartheid South Africa and worked to create an all civilian Police Oversight Board to review misconduct complaints.
Mayor Dinkins graduated from Howard University and began his public service career as a New York State Assemblyman. He served as President of the N.Y.C. Board of Elections and as City Clerk before winning election as Manhattan Borough President. Dinkins currently teaches at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, hosts a radio show, practices law and serves on various not-for-profit boards as an advocate for children and compassionate urban policy.
"Mayor Dinkins has been a leading voice for social justice in New York and across the country, and I'm honored to have his support," Clinton said.
