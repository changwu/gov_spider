    The new spot preemptively fact-checks the upcoming State of the Union Address
NEW YORK — In a new TV ad launching today, Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg takes aim at President Trump ahead of his State of the Union Address. While Trump is expected to tout his successes as president, the ad, entitled "The Real State of the Union," argues that our country is "a nation divided by an angry, out of control president," with a White House that is "beset by lies, chaos, and corruption" under Trump's leadership.
"Even before his speech, it's easy to predict that President Trump will lie about his record and the negative impact his presidency has had on the American people," said Mike Bloomberg 2020 national press secretary Julie Wood. "This new ad fact-checks and contrasts him with Mike Bloomberg — the strongest candidate to beat Trump in November."
The new TV ad will run nationally on cable, including MSNBC, FOX and CNN, and on YouTube connected platforms. Mike will continue to highlight Trump's incompetence as a leader in the coming months, as he has in other TV and digital ads.
