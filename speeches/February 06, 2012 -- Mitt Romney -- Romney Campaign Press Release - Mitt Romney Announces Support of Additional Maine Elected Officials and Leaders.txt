    Mitt Romney today announced additional Maine elected officials supporting his campaign.
"I am proud to have such a strong backing by elected officials and leaders from across the state of Maine," said Mitt Romney. "Their support proves that my pro-growth message is breaking through and that Maine voters want someone with real world economic experience in the White House."
Announcing his endorsement of Mitt Romney, Maine Senate President Kevin Raye said, "In order for the economy to rebound, Washington needs to stop erecting roadblocks for job creators. Mitt Romney understands the importance of strengthening small business and American manufacturing. As President, he will lead the way to rein in the federal debt, reverse the explosive growth of government, and reduce the regulatory burden on America's businesses to foster an environment that is favorable for job creation. That is why I support Mitt Romney, and why so many other Maine leaders are endorsing his campaign."
