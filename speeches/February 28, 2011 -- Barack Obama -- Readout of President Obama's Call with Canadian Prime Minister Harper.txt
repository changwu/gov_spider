    The President spoke with Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada today and underscored their common purpose in responding to the situation in Libya. They agreed on the need to deter additional acts of violence by the Qadhafi regime, protect those who might be the targets of such violence, establish accountability for human rights violations, and provide humanitarian assistance to those in need. The President expressed appreciation for Canada's joining the United States in imposing tough unilateral sanctions against the Libyan government. The leaders agreed to coordinate closely in expanding the humanitarian effort in cooperation with the United Nations and other partners, and in consideration of other options should they become necessary. The Leaders also expressed a commitment to work together to help Egypt and Tunisia achieve successful, peaceful democratic transitions, and to work with other countries in the region to achieve meaningful reform.
