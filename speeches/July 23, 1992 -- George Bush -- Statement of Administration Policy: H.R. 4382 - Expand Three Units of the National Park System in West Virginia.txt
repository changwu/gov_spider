    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 7/24/92)(House)(Rahall (D) WV)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4382. The National Park Service has not fully studied the proposed additions to the three National Park Service units. Furthermore, the immediate designation of new park boundaries would subvert the statutory requirement to evaluate proposed boundary adjustments according to established criteria.
