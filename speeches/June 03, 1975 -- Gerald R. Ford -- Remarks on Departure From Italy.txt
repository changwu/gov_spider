    President Leone, Mr. Prime Minister, Your Excellencies:
Upon our departure from Italy, Mrs. Ford and I wish to express our profound gratitude to President and Mrs. Leone, to Prime Minister and Mrs. Moro, and to the Italian Government and the Italian people for the wonderful reception accorded us on this occasion and this visit.
The warmth with which we have been received, the cordial and productive discussions that I have had with your highest leaders, and the friendship and good will expressed everywhere for the' United States have made this a memorable experience for all of us.
For over a quarter of a century, Italy and the United States have had a remarkable identity of purpose in working as democracies with shared ideals toward the goals of an enduring peace and prosperity for our people.
We have worked together as allies in NATO to preserve peace and to insure stability in Europe and in the Mediterranean. We can take satisfaction in the successes we have achieved.
As a result of my many meetings here in Rome, I am confident that the United States and Italy together, as partners in the Atlantic Alliance, will enjoy similar success in meeting the complex and difficult challenges before us.
In this way, we can contribute to the prospects of a peaceful and prosperous life for the people throughout the world.
On behalf of Mrs. Ford and myself, you have our sincere thanks, our deepest appreciation for the hospitality and the many kindnesses extended to us at all levels during every moment of our stay.
As we prepare to leave this beautiful country, I am reminded of the saying that fond memories spare departures for final sorrow. Thus, we cannot leave Italy in sorrow, for we carry far too many warm memories of a very special day with gracious friends.
I thank you.
