    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Feinstein (D) CA and 47 others)
The Administration strongly supports Senate enactment of S. 21. The Administration looks forward to working with the Senate and the House during further congressional consideration to resolve outstanding issues and ensure, proper protection of these important public lands and national parks.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
S. 21 would reduce receipts that offset direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990.
OMB's preliminary PAYGO scoring estimates of this bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If S. 21 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within 5 days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending and receipts will be reported to Congress at the end of the congressional session, as required by OBRA.
