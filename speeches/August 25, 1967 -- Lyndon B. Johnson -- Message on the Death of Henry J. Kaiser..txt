    THE ENTIRE NATION joins with you in mourning the loss of a great American. Henry J. Kaiser embodied in his own career all that is best in our country's traditions.
His own energy, imagination, and determination gave him greatness--and he used that greatness unflaggingly for the betterment of his country and his fellow man.
May the memory of his long and creative lift--and the knowledge of his lasting achievements--help to console you and your family in this sad moment of loss.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Mr. Edgar F. Kaiser, Honolulu, Hawaii]
