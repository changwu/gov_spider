    Jeb earned the nickname Veto Corleone because as governor, he vetoed over 2,500 separate line items in the budget. No one was safe from Jeb's veto power. If a piece of the legislation was not in the best interest of the people of Florida, it was cut.
It's time to revive Veto Corleone. Overspending is a problem that requires a president to assert the national interest, even when no one else will. The president should be able to eliminate wasteful and irresponsible spending through a constitutionally sound line-item veto.
