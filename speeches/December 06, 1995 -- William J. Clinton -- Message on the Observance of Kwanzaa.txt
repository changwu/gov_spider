    Warm greetings to everyone who is observing the festival of Kwanzaa.
Across America and around the globe, Kwanzaa is a vibrant celebration of African culture, encouraging us to gain a deeper appreciation of our families and the many blessings we enjoy. Kwanzaa's seven basic principles—unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith—stir our imagination, stimulate thought and reflection, and bring new purpose to our daily lives.
Transcending international boundaries and embracing the rich cultural traditions of Africa, this joyous festival links diverse individuals in a unique celebration of a dynamic heritage. Renewing hope and restoring faith, Kwanzaa uplifts the human spirit, helping us to revitalize the bonds of family and the spirit of community.
As millions of my fellow Americans commemorate Kwanzaa, I am delighted to send best wishes for a wonderful festival and a very happy new year.
