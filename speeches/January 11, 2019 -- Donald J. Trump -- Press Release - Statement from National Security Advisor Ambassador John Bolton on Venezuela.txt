    The United States does not recognize Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro's illegitimate claim to power. His "election" in May 2018 was viewed internationally as not free, fair or credible.
Today, the people of Venezuela are speaking out against Maduro's illegitimate claim. The Trump Administration resolutely supports the Venezuelan National Assembly, the only legitimate branch of government duly elected by the Venezuelan people. In particular, we support the courageous decision of the National Assembly President, Juan Guaido, to invoke protections under Venezuela's constitution and declare that Maduro does not legitimately hold the country's presidency.
We hold the illegitimate Maduro regime directly responsible for the safety of all Venezuelans who cry out demanding to freely choose their leaders. We will continue to use the full weight of United States economic and diplomatic power to press for the restoration of a Venezuelan democracy that reverses the current constitutional crisis.
