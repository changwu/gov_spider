    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94 - 265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith the Agreement between the Governments of the United States of America and the Republic of Poland Amending and Extending the Agreement of August 1, 1985, Concerning Fisheries off the Coasts of the United States. The agreement which was effected by exchange of notes at Washington on January 24 and June 12, 1991, copies of which are attached, extends the 1985 agreement for an additional 2 years and 6 months, from July 1, 1991, to December 31, 1993. The exchange of notes together with the 1985 agreement constitute a governing international fishery agreement within the requirements of section 201(c) of the Act. The exchange of notes also amends the 1985 agreement to incorporate the latest changes in U.S. law and policy into the agreement.
I urge that the Congress give favorable consideration to this agreement at an early date.
George Bush
The White House,
July 26, 1991.
