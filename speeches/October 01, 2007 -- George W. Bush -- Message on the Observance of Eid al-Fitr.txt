    I send greetings to Muslims in the United States and around the world celebrating Eid al-Fitr, the Festival of Breaking the Fast.
The great faith of Islam has enhanced our society and brought comfort and strength to generations in America and around the world. The three day festival of Eid al-Fitr marks the end of the month-long fast of Ramadan and is a time to look forward with a spirit of renewal and hope, and celebrate the rich Islamic tradition of charity and giving. During this holiday, Muslims gather with family and friends to share in traditional food, thank God for His blessings, and reach out to the less fortunate.
Our Nation is proud to be a land of many beliefs, and our society is enriched by our Muslim citizens. On the first day of Shawwal, the tenth month of the Islamic calendar, may people of all faiths reflect on the values we hold in common, including love of family, the importance of community, and gratitude to God.
Laura and I send our best wishes for a joyful celebration. Eid Mubarak.
