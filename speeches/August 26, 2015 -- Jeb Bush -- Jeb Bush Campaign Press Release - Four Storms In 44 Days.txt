Say the word and we're in SWF, Orlando, Daytona — where ever you want us to go first. Mobile One Stop is ready at daylight.
I've spoken with folks in Port Charlotte, Cape Coral, Fort Myers and Naples — lots of water and wind damage.

I just had to say how proud I am of the remarkable job you
all are doing re: Hurrican Charely. It seems nothing short of miraculous. I already gave to the Red Cross but will give to the Hurricane Charley Relief Effort too. I only wish I could be there to work and give aid and comfort in person.

From: Debby Sanderson
Pete and I are fortunate to be safely at our home in the mountains of NC, but we've been watching the coverage closely throughout the past few days.
I'm very proud of the way you have handled yourself on TV during Charley, and now Frances. I watched you yesterday and again this morning on FOX. You came across in a very reassuring, cautiously optomistist, and a warm and complimentary manner regarding the grit and spirit of Floridians. Throwing in the comment about the football games was perfect, and it helped break the tension in the air. It was great!
It's hard to believe we have been under seige with back to back horrific storms, and now bracing for possibly a third to hit us!!!
It was so good of the President to come down and tour the destruction with you during Charley. The feedback I heard was extremely possitive from our Republican and Democrat friends.
My heart goes out to you and the good people of Florida. There will be so many challenges to help put their lives back into some semblance of order.
Thank you, Jeb, way to go!! please get some rest tonight.

Subject: PRAYERS!!!!!!!!!!!

From: Kip Liles
I just want to say, as one native Floridian. that my prayers are with you during this time of devastation to our State and its many residents.
You look so weary on televisions, and I know you are — you certainly have every right to be!!!!!!! You must be completely drained emotionally; physically; and mentally. I wish I could offer more help than prayers; but we know that OUR God does answer prayers. May HE keep you safe in HIS hands, and give you the strength that you need in the massive job you have on your hands (and heart)!!!!!

Subject: Hurricane Jeanne
Friday, September 17, 2004 11:44 a.m.
From: Audrey Davis
Looking at the path of Jeanne, I found myself wondering if you are asking yourself, "When is enough enough?"
Anyway, just wanted to let you know we finally go our power back here in Palm Beach Gardens and I couldn't be happier with lights and air conditioning again. However, while the power was off in our neighborhood I did notice that the children were outside playing in their yards, neighbors were talking to each other (which normally did not happen) and neighbors were helping neighbors cut trees and clean yards. It was a little like what I remember from my childhood. Now with the power on, life is getting back to the old pattern. We drive home, open the garage door and go into our homes to the TV and air conditioning. Some of us have decided not to let the communication die. We are planning a block party or some other kind of get together.
There is also a radio program down here where the disc jockeys are trying to match people in need with people who may have something they can do without or a service they could donate. Surprisingly, not too many people are calling to gouge the system and the program is a huge hit.
What I guess I am trying to say, as hard as these hurricanes have been on you and Florida, there is some good coming out of it.
Thanks for being a strong leader in a time of need and I will continue to try to be a strong constituent.
A loyal democrat but supporter of Jeb Bush.

Thank you Audrey. I really appreciate your kind email. This has been a test for our state and by and large, we have responded. I am so proud of the acts of compassion and courage that is done below the radar. We will get through this and be stronger than we can ever imagine.

From: Don Quinn
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW I AN VERY PROUD TO BE A FLORIDIAN IN THE WAKE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH CHARLEY, FRANCES AND IVAN. I BELIEVE EVERYTHING WAS DONE TO WARN THE CITIZENS OF THE DANGER AND HOW TO BE PREPARED.
THE AFTERMATH WAS ALSO HANDLED VERY PROFESSIONALY.
PLEASE CONVEY MY APPRECIATION TO YOUR GREAT TEAM.
ON OCTOBER 31 MY CHURCH, RIMA RIDGE BAPTIST IN ORMOND BEACH, IS HAVING "INVITE A FRIEND TO CHURCH" SUNDAY. SO I THOUGHT I WOULD INVITE YOU AS MY FRIEND. I FIGURE YOU WOULD BE OUT AND ABOUT GETTING SUPPORT FOR YOUR BROTHER SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD NOT HURT TO ASK.
WE CONTINUE TO PRAY FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.
GOD BLESS

This hurricane season is incredulous! I hate that this one has my name. Have they ever had a Hurricane Jeb?
I heard you were in Bartow today. I would have loved to hear you speak but I had to work.
Keep up the good work. You are appreciated.

From: Barbara Czipri
I have to be perfectly honest and tell you upfront that I have never been a great fan of yours, but your leadership during this hurricane season has been EXACTLY what Floridians need. Every day when I see you at the 9 a.m. conference on TV, I wish that I could reach through the screen to give you a BIG hug. I'm sure you could use a lot of them about now. One thing that we have very much in common is our love for this state and the wonderful people who live here.
Yes, we will get through this. Above all, regardless of our political views, we are Floridians first. I pray that one positive outcome of the summer of 2004 will be that the upcoming legislative session will be free of the partisianship of recent years. We all need each other and we all need to work together in the best interests of our state. I hope that you will use your "bully pulpit" to help ensure that this happens.
In the meantime, please eat your veggies, get as much rest as you can, and get as many hugs as you can. We'll all pray together, and we WILL get through this—hopefully as stronger human beings than before, and more united as Floridians than before. Thanks for the great job that you're doing.

thank you so much for your kind words. I really, really appreciate the sentiments expressed. This has been an emotional time for all of us. I have been truly inspired by people's patience, courage and resolve and I have been so saddened by the suffering of so many. Again, I appreciate the virtual hug.

From: Grace Nicole
I just wanted to take a minute to say thank you for all of your hard work and effort through these last weeks. I never do these things so I hope this doesn't sound silly. You have just been doing a great job and I am so glad that you are my Governor. There is no other way to say it. I want you to know that there are everyday people throughout the state who have been comforted by your sincerity and presence in the media.
I have found myself nervous and fearful as I watched the news and within minutes of watching you on a news brief have been calmed. I can't even explain it. You just seem to make so much sense and frankly your more to the point comments have often caused me to laugh right out loud. Only moments before I had been scared and upset and then you've got me laughing. Don't get me wrong, I knew that you were being as serious as you could be, but somehow I was amused right through my fear by how much sense you make and how straight you say it.
As I sit here waiting for yet another Hurricane (Jeanne), I just wanted to thank you. I also want to thank you for everything else you have been doing that I don't get to see. I can't imagine how hard you have been working. I want you to know that you are appreciated. I am grateful for you and I am grateful for the great men and women in your family.

thank you Grace for your very kind and overly generous email. I really appreciate your taking the time to write.
It has been a joy to be in service to the state I love. I have been inspired by the courage and compassion shown by so many. I am saddened by the suffering as well.
Hang in there and stay safe!

Tuesday, September 28, 2004 11:48 a.m.
From: Robert Olsen
My daughter Emily was watching the press conferences with me prior
to hurricane Jeanne making landfall and she was asking typical three year old questions. Is there another storm coming, Daddy? Why is it coming? I fielded all of these questions as well as I could, waiting for you to address the State. When you stepped up to the podium, my daughter looked at me and asked, "Is that the Storm Governor, Daddy?"
I laughed and said, "Honey, I think he feels that way."
Just thought you might appreciate this story.
