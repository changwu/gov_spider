Fox News' Steve Doocy: "We had Steve Forbes on just about an hour ago, and I know ... he's one of your guys in your presidential posse. Anyway, he said that, quote, 'Obama's tax plan will destroy America' because he's pretty sure he's going to raise taxes on almost everybody, and Steve Forbes quoted the resolution where he would have jacked up the tax rate on people earning as little as $32,000 a year."
John McCain: "Well, he voted for a budget resolution twice ... that would have raised people's taxes everywhere, and right now he wants to raise the Social Security tax, capital gains tax, the tax on the, quote, wealthy. By the way, that's you guys, watch out. So it's a fundamental difference that Senator Obama and I have. And you couple that with protectionism, his opposition to free trade, then I think you have a very potent mixture there, and we're going to be drawing out those differences throughout the campaign."
