    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act, as amended by the Social Security Amendments of 1977 (P.L. 95-216, 42 USC 433(e)(1)), I transmit herewith the Agreement between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Sweden on Social Security which consists of two separate instruments. The Agreement was signed at Stockholm on May 27, 1985.
The U.S.-Sweden agreement is similar in objective to the social security agreements already in force with Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany, Switzerland, Canada, Belgium, Norway, and the United Kingdom. Such bilateral agreements, which are generally known as totalization agreements, provide for limited coordination between the United States and foreign social security systems to overcome the problems of gaps in protection and of dual coverage and taxation for workers who move from one country to the other.
I also transmit for the information of the Congress a comprehensive report prepared by the Department of Health and Human Services, which explains the provisions of the Agreement and provides data on the number of persons affected by the Agreement and the effect on social security financing as required by the same provision of the Social Security Act.
The Department of State and the Department of Health and Human Services join with me in commending the U.S.-Sweden Social Security Agreement and related documents.
