    House Majority Leader Eric Cantor today made the following statement on the Obama administration's refusal to say whether Jerusalem is the capital of Israel:
"For thousands of years, Jerusalem has been the eternal capital of the Jewish people, but this Administration refuses to say if Jerusalem is the true capital. At a moment when Israel is facing so many perils, the United States should be standing by our ally, not quibbling or quarreling about its capital city."
