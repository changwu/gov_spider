I gave a long news conference today after wishing the military a Happy Thanksgiving, & realized once again that the Fake News Media coordinates so that the real message of such a conference never gets out. Primary point made was that the 2020 Election was RIGGED, and that I WON!Retweets: 59077Favorites: 274247

Twitter is sending out totally false Trends that have absolutely nothing to do with what is really trending in the world. They make it up, and only negative stuff. Same thing will happen to Twitter as is happening to @FoxNews daytime. Also, big Conservative discrimination!Retweets: 56539Favorites: 267630

REPORT: Biden's Thanksgiving Day Address gets just 1000 views online, a record low. Observers say a candidate with 80,000,000 votes would get many more online viewers. Numbers don't lie, or add up! @OANNRetweets: 53039Favorites: 252891

Wow! Twitter bans highly respected Pennsylvania State Senator Doug Mastriano after he did a great job of leading a hearing on the 2020 Election fraud. They and the Fake News, working together, want to SILENCE THE TRUTH. Can't let that happen. This is what Communist countries do!Retweets: 73437Favorites: 277136

No, the 2020 Election was a total scam, we won by a lot (and will hopefully turn over the fraudulent result), but we must get out and help David and Kelly, two GREAT people. Otherwise we are playing right into the hands of some very sick people. I will be in Georgia on Saturday!  https://t.co/1ziqFq9S6O Retweets: 33998Favorites: 139741

Biden can only enter the White House as President if he can prove that his ridiculous 80,000,000 votes were not fraudulently or illegally obtained. When you see what happened in Detroit, Atlanta, Philadelphia & Milwaukee, massive voter fraud, he's got a big unsolvable problem!Retweets: 91739Favorites: 386189

Biden did poorly in big cities (Politico), except those of Detroit (more votes than people!), Philadelphia, Atlanta and Milwaukee, which he had to win. Not surprisingly, they are all located in the most important swing states, and are long known for being politically corrupt!Retweets: 57003Favorites: 258923
