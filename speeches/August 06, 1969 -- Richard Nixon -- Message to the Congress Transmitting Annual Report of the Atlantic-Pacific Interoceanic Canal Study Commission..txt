    To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting the fifth annual report of the Atlantic-Pacific Interoceanic Canal Study Commission. The report covers the period July 1, 1968 to June 30, 1969â€¢
The Commission has now completed its data collection activities on all of the five sea-level canal routes under investigation. Field operations have been terminated, and all facilities and equipment not removed from the routes have been turned over to host-country governments under the terms of the survey agreements.
Within the United States the office and laboratory evaluations of route data are well-advanced, as are the Commission's studies of the diplomatic, economic, and military considerations that bear on the feasibility of a new, sea-level canal constructed by conventional or nuclear excavation. The Commission will render its final report not later than December 1, 1970, pursuant to its authorizing legislation.
During the year the Atomic Energy Commission conducted the third of its planned series of nuclear excavation experiments in support of the canal investigation. Although all the now planned nuclear cratering experiments will not be completed soon enough for full evaluation by the Commission, it is expected that the Commission will be able to reach general conclusions as to the feasibility of employment of nuclear explosives for canal excavation.
This anniversary sees the canal investigation entering its final phase, and I take great pleasure in forwarding the Commission's fifth annual report to the Congress.
