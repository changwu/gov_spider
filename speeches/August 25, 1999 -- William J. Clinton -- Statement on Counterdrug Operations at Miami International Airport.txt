    I want to congratulate law enforcement officials for the successful counterdrug operations that resulted today in numerous indictments for violations of our Federal drug laws. This joint initiative required the hard work of the DEA, U.S. Customs Service, ATF, and local law enforcement agencies. It is a product of our shared determination to shield American borders from the drug threat. The efforts of this team show that by working together, we can reduce the flow of drugs into our Nation and fight drugrelated crime and violence. From the recent decline in youth drug use, to the law enforcement success of today's investigations, our balanced and comprehensive national antidrug strategy is producing real results for the American people.
