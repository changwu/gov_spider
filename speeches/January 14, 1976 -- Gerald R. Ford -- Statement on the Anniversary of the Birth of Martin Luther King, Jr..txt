    ON THE occasion of the 47th anniversary of the birth of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the Nation is once again reminded of his eloquent commitment to the cause of civil rights and of his forceful leadership in that cause.
As we observe this anniversary, our thoughts are with his family. We also pledge our renewed dedication to the struggle for equality and well-being for all our citizens, to which Dr. King so courageously devoted his life.
