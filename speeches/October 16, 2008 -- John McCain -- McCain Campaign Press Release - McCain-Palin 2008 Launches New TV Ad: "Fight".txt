Script For "Fight" (TV :60) 
ANNCR: The last eight years haven't worked very well, have they?
I'll make the next four better.
Your savings, your job and your financial security are under siege.
Washington is making it worse - bankrupting us with their spending.
Telling us paying higher taxes is "patriotic"?
And saying we need to "spread the wealth around"?
They refuse common sense solutions for energy independence.
So every day we send billions to the Middle East.
We need a new direction and I have a plan.
Your savings. We'll rebuild them.
Your investments. They'll grow again.
Energy. We'll drill here and we'll create a renewable energy economy.
Lower taxes and less spending will protect your job and create new ones.
That'll restore our country.
Stand up with me, let's fight for America. 
JOHN MCCAIN: I'm John McCain and I approve this message.
