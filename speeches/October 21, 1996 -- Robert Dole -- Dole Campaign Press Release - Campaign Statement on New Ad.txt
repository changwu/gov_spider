    Dole/Kemp Deputy Press Secretary Christina Martin released the following statement today on the new Clinton ad "Desperate:"
"This ad is a weak attempt to distract the American people from the sordid tale of corruption and influence-peddling that's unfolding in Bill Clinton's White House.
"Let's look the fact: Bill Clinton's top foreign fundraiser brought in up to $5 million in questionable and illegal campaign contributions -- including $450,000 from an Indonesian gardener with a green card, up to $140,000 laundered through parishioners at a Buddhist temple, an illegal $250,000 contribution from a South Korean company, and more than $300,000 from a Gandhi namesake. In return for those massive illicit contributions, foreign donors got top-level access to the President, private meetings with administration officials, and an active voice in U.S. foreign policy.
"Now that the truth has started to come out, the White House has become a bunker -- fighting every disclosure, concealing every contribution, and hiding every witness. Just today, DNC Chairman Chris Dodd broke a promise he made on national television yesterday to make the DNC's foreign fundraiser available for media interview.
There's nothing desperate about the truth. Stop hiding your foreign fundraiser from the the media, Mr. President, and come clean with the American people."
