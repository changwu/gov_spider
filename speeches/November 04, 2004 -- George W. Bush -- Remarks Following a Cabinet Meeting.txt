    I just met with my Cabinet. I am proud of every person here. They've done a great job for the country. I reminded them that even though our election just ended, we've still got work to do. I talked about an agenda that we will complete and an agenda that we will take forward.
I made it clear to them I was glad the election was over and reminded them that we're here for a reason. And to a person, they understand that it's such an honor to serve America, it's a privilege to sit around this table, and that we will all continue to do the people's business.
But anyway, I want to thank them all for their hard work. I amâ€”when I told the people that I put together a fantastic group of men and women, I meant every word of that, and I want to thank them all for their service.
Thank you.
