    I am deeply disturbed by reports of violence in the western part of the Republic of Georgia, where heavily armed opposition forces seized hostages and clashed with Government troops today.
The United States strongly supports the democratically elected Government of Georgia, headed by President Eduard Shevardnadze, and the stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Georgia.
We are glad that the opposition forces decided late today to release their hostages, and we call on the opposition forces to resolve their differences with the Government through peaceful and democratic means rather than by armed confrontation.
