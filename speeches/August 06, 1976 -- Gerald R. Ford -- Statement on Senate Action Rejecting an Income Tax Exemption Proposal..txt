    THE CONGRESS has been working on tax reform for over 3 years. The Senate is presently considering a 1,600-page document filled with hundreds of provisions and scores of amendments, some of which are good, but many of which would benefit special interests.
This afternoon the Senate tabled a simple, straightforward proposal, offered by Senator Dole, to raise the personal income tax exemption from $750 to $1,000 a year. The vote was 57-29.
This proposed amendment would reduce the total tax liabilities of Americans by $10.2 billion annually. This represents a tax saving of $193 a year for a family of four earning $14,000.
I regret that the Senate has rejected this amendment which would benefit all taxpayers and would promote real equity in the tax system.
