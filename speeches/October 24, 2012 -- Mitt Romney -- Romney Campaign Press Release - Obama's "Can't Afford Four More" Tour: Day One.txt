But instead of a positive vision for a second term, the President is only offering voters four more years like the last four years, with $2 trillion in higher taxes, over 700,000 fewer jobs, and $716 billion in Medicare cuts. Americans deserve better. As president, Mitt Romney will cut taxes for the middle class, create 12 million new jobs, and preserve and strengthen Medicare for today's seniors and the next generation." â€” Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
