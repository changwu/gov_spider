    After Donald Trump's press eventÂ today, Hillary for America Campaign Manager Robby Mook released the following statement:
"Trump's actions today were disgraceful. After five years of pushing a racist conspiracy theory into the mainstream, it was appalling to watch Trump appoint himself the judge of whether the President of the United States is American. This sickening display shows more than ever why Donald Trump is totally unfit be president."
