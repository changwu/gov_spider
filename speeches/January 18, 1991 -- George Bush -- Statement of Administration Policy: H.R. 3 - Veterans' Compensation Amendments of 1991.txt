    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Montgomery (D) MS and 252 others)
The Administration strongly supports enactment of H.R. 3. The bill authorizes annual increases in the rates of compensation for service-disabled veterans and the survivors of (1) servicepersons who die in service and (2) veterans who die as a result of service-connected conditions.
For FY 1991, the office of Management and Budget estimates outlays for the increases in the rates of compensation in H.R. 3 to be $412 million. However, these costs are already included in the budget baseline. Since the pay-as-you-go requirements are measured against the baseline, the increases in the rates of compensation in H.R. 3 would be scored as zero under the pay-as- you-go limits.
