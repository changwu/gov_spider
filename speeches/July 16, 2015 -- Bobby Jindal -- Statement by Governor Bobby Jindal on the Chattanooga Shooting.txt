    Today, Governor Jindal issued the following statement on the shooting in Chattanooga:
Gov. Jindal said, "This apparent act of terrorism has taken the lives of four American heroes, and our hearts and prayers are with their families. While it's too early to know for sure what happened, it certainly looks like an act of terrorism. We must pursue justice on their behalf and stop at nothing to hunt down and kill these evildoers abroad before more of them come here to kill our people.
"This shooting underscores the grave reality of the threat posed to us by Radical Islamic terrorism every single day. It's time for the White House to wake up and tell the truth...and the truth is that Radical Islam is at war with us, and we must start by being honest about that.
"There have been many bad things that have happened under President Obama. One that stands out to me was the horrible shooting at Ft. Hood...which was clearly an act of terrorism by a Radical Islamist. Yet the White House labeled that horrible act as 'workplace violence.'
"This is grotesque. You cannot defeat evil until you admit that it exists."
