    The President is pleased to announce that the Federal Government has reached in principle agreement with the State of Florida to restore a major portion of the lower Kissimmee Basin. The project envisioned would restore 66 miles of river and 29,000 acres of wetlands. It will help benefit over 300 species and create jobs in the process. We are prepared to agree to a plan which will implement this project in partnership with the State, with many of the costs shared fifty-fifty. Tomorrow, Assistant Secretary of the Army Nancy P. Dorn will meet with Governor Chiles to iron out the details. But we are ready to move forward with a project that is good for Florida's environment and good for its economy, too.
