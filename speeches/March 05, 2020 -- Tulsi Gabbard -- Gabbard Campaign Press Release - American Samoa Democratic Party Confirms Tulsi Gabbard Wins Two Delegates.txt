    WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” Presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard (U.S. Rep, Hawaii) received confirmation today that she won two delegates during the Super Tuesday election in American Samoa after a strong second place finish there.
"Our campaign has been in touch with the American Samoa Democratic Party, and it has been confirmed to us that Tulsi received two pledged delegates, not one as has been previously reported," said campaign spokesperson Cullen Tiernan.
The Gabbard campaign is requesting all media outlets correct their delegate counters to reflect this confirmation.
Tulsi remains focused on bringing her campaign message directly to the American people. This Saturday, she will attend a town hall in Las Vegas moderated by NORML. There, she will discuss criminal justice reform, and she will continue to share her vision for ending our engagement in costly regime change wars, the new Cold War and arms race, and investing US resources in serving the needs of the American people.
