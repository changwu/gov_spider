    Last spring in Quebec, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and I appointed Special Envoys to study the subject of acid rainâ€”Drew Lewis of the United States and William Davis of Canada. This morning I received their report from Drew Lewis. I am pleased that Drew and Bill have completed this important step forward. They have worked long and hard to study the serious concern of acid rain. Their efforts represent a very positive development in U.S.-Canadian cooperation.
This report represents an earnest effort by the United States and Canada to address an important environmental issue and exemplifies what can be accomplished in the spirit of Canadian-American cooperation. We will be carefully reviewing the report and its recommendations. I look forward to discussing the matter further in my meeting with Prime Minister Mulroney here in March, as we continue to address together this topic which is of such great interest to both of our countries.
