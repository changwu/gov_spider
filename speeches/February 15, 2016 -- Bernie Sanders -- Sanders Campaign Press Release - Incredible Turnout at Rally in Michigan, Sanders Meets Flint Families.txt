    YPSILANTI, Mich. â€“ Bernie Sanders received a rousing ovation on Monday from a capacity crowd of about 9,400 supporters at Eastern Michigan University's Convocation Center. "What an incredible turnout," Sanders said.
The Democratic Party presidential candidate laid out detailed proposals to create jobs, make college affordable, reform the country's criminal justice system and address climate change.
He also spoke about the need to repair the nation's crumbling roads, bridges, railroads and public water systems. He has introduced legislation in the U.S. Senate to invest $1 trillion in infrastructure upgrades. 
Sanders addressed the rally after a private meeting with families from Flint, Michigan, which is reeling from a public health emergency resulting from lead-tainted tap water.
Sanders recently called for the resignation of Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder for the state's inadequate response to the public health troubles which have been traced to a 2014 decision to switch the source of the city's tap water supply to the Flint River. After repeated assurances that the water was safe, Flint residents were warned last fall about lead poisoning concerns. 
Sanders and Erin Brockovich wrote a column in Sunday's Detroit Free Press which called Flint "a wake-up call" to problems affecting public water supplies nationwide. "The situation in Flint is what happens when public officials who, in their reckless zeal to slash government spending, jeopardize the health and well-being of the residents they are entrusted with keeping safe," they wrote.
