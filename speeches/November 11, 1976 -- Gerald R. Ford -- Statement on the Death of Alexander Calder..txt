    IT WAS with the deepest regret that I learned of the death of Alexander Calder, whose universally recognized creativity in art brought joy to millions.
Mr. Calder's sculpture and innovative art forms helped evolve an entirely new state of consciousness and demonstrated what American improvisation could achieve.
I am proud that a magnificent Calder is on display in my hometown, Grand Rapids. It has won a place in the hearts of Michiganders, just as the Calder artistry has enriched a world that became Calder's universe.
Art has lost a genius, and the United States has lost a great American who contributed much to the civilization of the 20th century.
Mrs. Ford joins me in sending our condolences to Mrs. Calder and the family.
