    Today, President Donald J. Trump awarded the Legion of Merit, Degree Chief Commander, to His Majesty Mohammed VI, King of Morocco.
The Legion of Merit, Degree Chief Commander, is a rarely-awarded, prestigious decoration that can only be bestowed by the President, typically to chiefs of state or heads of government of other countries. Over his more than two decades of leadership, King Mohammed VI has advanced the deep and enduring partnership between the Kingdom of Morocco and the United States across all domains. His vision and personal courage—including his decision to resume ties with the State of Israel—have positively reshaped the landscape of the Middle East and North Africa and ushered in a new era of security and prosperity for both our countries and the world.
Morocco's Ambassador to the United States, Her Highness Princess Lalla Joumala, accepted the award on behalf of the King in a private ceremony.
