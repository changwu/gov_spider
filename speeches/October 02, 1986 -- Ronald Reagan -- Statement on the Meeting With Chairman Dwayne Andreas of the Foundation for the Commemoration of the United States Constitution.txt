    Two weeks ago, on the 199th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution, I urged all Americans to support the work of the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution. Today I had the pleasure of meeting with Dwayne Andreas, a private citizen who has heeded that call and decided to take an active personal role in assisting the Bicentennial Commission in planning, implementing, and financing activities designed to celebrate the Constitution over the next 3 years. At the request of retired Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, the Commission's Chairman, Mr. Andreas has agreed to head the Foundation for the Commemoration of the United States Constitution. The foundation will be a fundamental link between the Commission and the private sector. It is a nongovernmental, nonprofit corporation working alongside the Commission with the same worthy goal of honoring the Constitution in the manner the Nation deserves.
Mr. Andreas has long been involved in sparking the private sector's initiative to share in the responsibility for projects of great importance to the community and the Nation. He served as Chairman of my Task Force on International Private Enterprise from 1983 to 1984. I am delighted that he has once again volunteered his services for an important enterprise that will benefit the country. I encourage other private citizens and organizations to join in the celebration of our constitutional heritage by supporting the Bicentennial Commission and the Foundation for the Commemoration of the United States Constitution in their efforts to plan a fitting and exciting tribute to our Constitution.
