    HOUSTON, Texas - Today, Wisconsin Congressman Reid Ribble endorsed Ted Cruz for President. Ribble is a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and has represented the 8th district in Wisconsin since 2011. He is a third generation Wisconsinite who owned and operated his family's small business for over 30 years.


"We are at a very critical time in our nation," said Rep. Ribble. "Americans need a strong, principled leader to help turn this country around. Ted Cruz is the leader we need in the White House. Ted has stood up and fought for conservative principles and the American people his entire life. He has the proven record of fighting for the issues that matter most to Americans. I am confident that Ted will continue to work to restore this country back to the principles that made this country great. I encourage all Republicans to join Governor Walker and me in voting for Ted Cruz on Tuesday."
"Reid is a strong, principled conservative," said Cruz. "He is a leader in the Badger State and has spent his time in Congress fighting for the people of Wisconsin and all Americans. Reid has advocated for a smaller federal government and worked to rein in reckless spending. I am thrilled to have his support for our campaign."
