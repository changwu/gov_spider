    Good morning, everybody. I am delighted to announce this morning the appointment of Jeanne Holm as the President's Assistant for Women in the White House. She is taking the place of Pat Lindh, who is leaving to go to the State Department.
I am delighted to have you, Jeanne, over here to carry on the very important functions that relate the White House to women throughout the country.
Jeanne, as all of you know, has had a wonderful career in the military. She was the first major general, I think, in the Department of Defense as a woman. She was director of the Air Force activities relating to women from 1968 till 1973, as I recall, retired a year or so ago with great recognition.
She received a Ladies Home Journal award for the Outstanding Woman in Diplomacy in Government. She has been very, very active in a lot of activities concerning the rising, emerging role of women in government. So, we are very, very pleased, Jeanne, to have you on board and to carry on the fine job Pat Lindh has done.
With Pat going over to the State Department and you coming here, we're going to have a first class team, and I am delighted to have you on board.
Major GENERAL HOLM. Thank you, Mr. President. I certainly feel honored and pleased to be here and to be able to work with you. I'm very impressed with the record that you have made in support of the women's issues and certainly with the magnificent appointments that you've made in the last several months-Carla Hills and Anne Armstrong--and your stand on the ERA, an argument involving women for some time.
I assure you I have a personal commitment and an emotional commitment to it. And it's nice to fed that you are going to be working for someone who also has that commitment, and I have a feeling you do.
THE PRESIDENT. We're delighted to have you on board. I think that you will find the job challenging; you'll find it interesting, and you can rest assured I will back you 100 percent.
MAJOR GENERAL HOLM. Thank you, Mr. President.
