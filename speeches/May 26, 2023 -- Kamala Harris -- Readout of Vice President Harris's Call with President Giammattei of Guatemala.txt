    Vice President Kamala Harris spoke today with President Alejandro Giammattei of Guatemala. The Vice President and President Giammattei discussed joint efforts to manage migration in a humane and orderly fashion, including by creating new opportunities for legal pathways and putting in place robust border security measures. The Vice President noted progress made to address the drivers of migration through the implementation of the U.S. Strategy to Address the Root Causes of Migration from Central America, which she leads. The implementation of the Strategy includes today's announcement of $44.5 million in U.S. Government funding to combat gender-based violence in the region. The Vice President updated President Giammattei on efforts to create economic opportunities in Guatemala through the partnership she has led with the private sector that has generated more than $4.2 billion in private sector investments in northern Central America, which is creating jobs, connecting people to the internet, and bringing them into the formal financial system. In advance of Guatemala's June 25th general elections, the Vice President re-affirmed the Biden-Harris Administration's support for free, fair, inclusive and peaceful elections and a transparent electoral process.
