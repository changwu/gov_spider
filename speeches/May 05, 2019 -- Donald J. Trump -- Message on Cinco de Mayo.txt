    I send my greetings and best wishes to all those celebrating Cinco de Mayo. On this day 157 years ago, the Mexican people valiantly defended their freedom and prevailed in the Battle of Puebla. Facing a French army equipped with more men and better weapons, the tenacious Mexican forces, under the command of General Ignacio Zaragoza, rose to the daunting challenge and emerged victorious on May 5, 1862.
As we honor the anniversary of this historic victory, we celebrate the courage and patriotism the Mexican soldiers exemplified in defeating the invading army of Napoleon III. We also acknowledge the remarkable achievements of Mexican Americans and the many contributions they have made, and continue to make, to our Nation.
Melania and I hope those who are celebrating enjoy today's festivities. Feliz Cinco de Mayo!
