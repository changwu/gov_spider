    Today I was pleased to learn from Secretary of Defense Austin that he has granted Cameron Kinley's request to pursue a playing career in the National Football League prior to his service as a naval officer.
I am confident that Cameron will represent the Navy well in the NFL, just as he did as a standout athlete and class president at the Naval Academy. After his NFL career is over, he will continue to make us proud as an officer in the United States Navy.
