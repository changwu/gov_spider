    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement today criticizing President Bush's veto of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act.
"President Bush had a simple choice today: direct the full force of American scientific ingenuity towards responsible, life-saving medical research or pander to a narrow segment of his political base. With his veto, he made the wrong choice, pushing medical breakthroughs that could help millions of Americans further away. We need a president who will embrace science-driven policy, rather than politically-biased science."
