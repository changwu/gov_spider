    I COMMEND the attention of all Americans to National Handicapped Awareness Week. It is an observance which should remind us of our need to eliminate architectural barriers which still stand in the way of handicapped citizens and our need to build a system of public transportation which brings new mobility to those who are handicapped.
Our success in heeding the message of this observance can result in more jobs--and a greater variety of jobs--in more businesses and industries. It can bring closer the day when all our citizens have full access to public facilities and when all Americans can more fully exercise their inherent rights.
The message of National Handicapped Awareness Week should remain with us as a continuing commitment to enable handicapped Americans to achieve greater personal self-fulfillment and meaningful contribution to our society.
