    During his 25 years in the Marine Corps and more than a decade in Congress, John Kline has served his country and his constituents with honor and distinction. He's the proud husband of an Army nurse and the proud father of two children, including a son who has served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. John's never been afraid to stand up for what he believes in, and as the Chairman of the House Education Committee, he's shown a willingness to work together with anybody—Republican or Democrat—who has the best interests of our students at heart. I look forward to continuing to work with John in the coming months, especially as we continue our efforts to give every child in America the fair shot in life they deserve, and I wish him and Vicky well in whatever their future holds.
