    Nebraska Senator Mike Johanns today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's vision for a vibrant rural America:
"The loss of a family member should not be a taxable event, and Americans should not be forced to sell the family farm, ranch or business just to pay the tax. I am astonished that President Obama supports returning the death tax to 55% with a $1 million exemption. Governor Romney understands the potentially devastating implications for agriculture and supports full repeal of the unfair death tax. It is time for America's farm and ranch families to stand with the candidate who will stand up for them against unfair taxation and over regulation. That person is Mitt Romney and he has my full support."
