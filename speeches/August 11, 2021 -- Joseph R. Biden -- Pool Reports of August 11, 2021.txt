Some quotes but please check against transcript/livestream:
"Jobs are up and monthly price increases have come down. Economic growth is up, the fastest in 40 years, and unemployment is coming down," Biden said. But still too many are "feeling the pinch," including on gas prices, he said. "We're taking action to address gas prices as well," he said, and repeated a promise not to raise gas prices.
He said his National Economic Council had asked the Federal Trade Commission chair "to use every available tool to monitor the US gasoline market and address any illegal conduct that might be connected, might be contributing to price increases at the pump."
Biden said his community college plan should be viewed as a tax cut for families. "I should say tax cut, not credit," he said.
"The investments I'm proposing will be fully paid for," Biden said. "My Build Back Better agenda is fiscally responsible."
Biden finished speaking at 1:58 pm and exited at 1:59 pm.
