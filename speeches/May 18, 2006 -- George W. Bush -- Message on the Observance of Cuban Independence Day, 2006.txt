    I send greetings to those celebrating the 104th anniversary of Cuban Independence.
The hope of freedom is found in every heart, and it is the future of every land. The United States is committed to advancing the values that sustain liberty and helping establish a just and peaceful government in Cuba. On this anniversary of Cuba's independence, we look forward to the day when Cuba embraces democracy and human rights for all her people.
This anniversary also is an opportunity to recognize the generations of Cuban Americans who have contributed to the vitality, success, and prosperity of our great Nation. Through their devotion to faith, family, and freedom, they have helped make our country stronger and better.
Laura and I send our best wishes. May God bless the people of Cuba.
GEORGE W. BUSH
