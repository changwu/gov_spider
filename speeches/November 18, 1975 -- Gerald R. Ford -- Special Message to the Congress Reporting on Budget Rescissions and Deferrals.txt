    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith propose six new rescissions totalling $1,289.1 million in budget authority. In addition, I am reporting three new deferrals totalling $15.2 million in budget authority and two supplementary reports to deferrals previously transmitted that increase the amount deferred by $4 million.
The six proposed rescissions are for education programs of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The rescissions would reduce Federal spending for programs that are responsibilities of State and local jurisdictions, fail to effectively focus on the persons in need of assistance, or are not justifiable on programmatic grounds.
Approval of the rescissions will reduce spending by $182 million this year, by $61 million in the transition quarter, by $839 million in 1977, and by $208 million in later years. I reiterate my firm belief that the American people want to avoid excessive Federal spending. Agreement by the Congress with these rescission proposals is an important step in avoiding unnecessary increases in Federal expenditures.
The deferrals reported are all routine in nature. Two of the deferrals are for programs of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Another deferral is for a program of the Department of State. Two more deferrals concern administration of the general revenue sharing program in the Department of the Treasury.
The details of each rescission proposal and deferral are contained in the attached reports.
