    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I have reviewed the activities of the United States Government departments and agencies during calendar year 1990 related to preventing nuclear proliferation, and I am pleased to submit my annual report pursuant to section 601(a) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95 - 242, 22 U.S.C. 3281(a)).
As the report demonstrates, the United States continued its efforts during 1990 to prevent the spread of nuclear explosives to additional countries. The events of the past year underline the importance of these efforts to preserving our national security by reducing the risk of war and increasing international stability. I am determined to build on the achievements cited in this report and to work with the Congress toward our common goal: a safer and more secure future for all humankind.
Sincerely,
George Bush
