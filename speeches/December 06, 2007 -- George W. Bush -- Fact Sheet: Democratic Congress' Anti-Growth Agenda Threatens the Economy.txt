    Our economy continues to grow but the President doesn't take that growth for granted. That's why it is critical for Congress to adopt his pro-economy policies. Instead, the Democratic Congress has repeatedly advanced its anti-growth agenda – like higher taxes and excessive government spending – which threatens our economy and exacerbates uncertainty about future economic performance. The Congress' record of failure and inaction has consequences for taxpayers and our economy.
