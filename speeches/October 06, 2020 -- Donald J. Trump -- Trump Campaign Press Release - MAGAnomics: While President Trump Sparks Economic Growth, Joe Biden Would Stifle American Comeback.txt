    Following the first presidential debate and the impressive September jobs report, two things remain clear: Joe Biden would destroy the economy while President Trump is the only leader capable to lead the Great American Comeback. While President Trump has delivered a record-breaking number of jobs for the American people, Joe Biden oversaw the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression and has promised to impose a $4 trillion tax hike coupled with radical policies. Stephen Moore, economist and author of Trumponomics, and Anton and Stephanie Austin, owners of AustinBach Beauty Salon, discussed all this and more on tonight's 'MAGAnomics' broadcast, hosted by Steve Cortes, Trump 2020 Senior Advisor.

"Even while battling through coronavirus, President Trump prioritizes the American people and continues to lead our economic recovery," said Steve Cortes, Trump 2020 Senior Advisor. "President Trump's pro-growth, pro-America policies delivered yet another spectacular jobs report, making the choice between Joe Biden's disastrous career and President Trump's record of success even more clear."
"Throughout his first term, President Trump created the greatest economy we have ever seen, and has proven he will do it again despite the artificial interruption of coronavirus," said Stephen Moore, economist and author of Trumponomics. "The President's America First approach completely transformed the stagnant economy the Obama-Biden administration left him with, and has unleashed American economic opportunity and growth."
"As entrepreneurs, we know firsthand President Trump's policies have enabled small businesses to flourish, and his decisive action throughout the pandemic allowed our business to survive the temporary shutdown ," said Anton and Stephanie Austin, owners of AustinBach Beauty Salon. "This November, we will be voting for four more years of President Trump's America First agenda that has benefitted us and all Americans."
