Out of town pool report #2 - Bike ride
POTUS rode by the pool's location at 11:21 am. FLOTUS was with him. They zipped by and didn't stop.
Both wore long black pants, short sleeved black t-shirts and bike helmets.
There was a small crowd of people behind a rope line who cheered as they rode by. POTUS didn't respond to a shouted question on China malware.
Their bike convoy included three lead vehicles, agents on bicycles and a few trailing golf carts.
Before POTUS came by some riders getting on to the trail and people walking their dogs got wanded by security.
