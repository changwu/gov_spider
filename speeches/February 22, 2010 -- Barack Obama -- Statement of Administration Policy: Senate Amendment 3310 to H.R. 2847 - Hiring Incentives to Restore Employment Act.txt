(Senate)
(Sen. Reid, D-Nevada)
The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of the Reid Amendment to H.R. 2847 as one important step forward in the ongoing effort to help put Americans back to work. The amendment includes several of the Administration's top priorities for job creation, including a tax incentive to encourage businesses to hire, a tax cut to make it easier for small businesses to invest and expand, and further measures to keep people at work improving the Nation's roads, bridges, and public transportation infrastructure. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on additional job creation measures, including increased access to credit for small businesses.
