"We're excited to bring Ron Paul back to Louisiana, where he kicked off 'Youth for Ron Paul' at LSU last September before presiding over the grand opening ceremony of his Louisiana state headquarters in Baton Rouge. Since then, thousands more people have joined the youth effort, and the energy around his campaign continues to grow. Young people and true conservatives know he's the only candidate who will bring real change to Washington, balance the budget, and boost our economy," said Edward King, National Youth Director for the Ron Paul 2012 Presidential Campaign.
Since 'Youth for Ron Paul' launched in September 2011, students nationwide have organized 588 chapters and recruited more than 50,000 people. To learn more about 'Youth for Ron Paul' including how to sign-up and establish a local chapter, visit the YFP website by clicking here.
Both campus town hall meetings will be followed by an open press opportunity. Members of the local and major print, broadcast, and online media with particular needs should contact Assistant Press Secretary Arick Stall at aricks@ronpaul2012.com. Please, no exceptions.
