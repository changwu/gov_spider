    To the Congress of the United States:
On September 30, 1990, in light of the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.), I issued Executive Order No. 12730, declaring a national emergency and continuing the system of export regulation, including antiboycott provisions, under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701, et seq.). Under section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), the national emergency terminates on the anniversary date of its declaration unless I publish in the Federal Register and transmit to the Congress notice of its continuation.
I am hereby advising the Congress that I have extended the national emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12730. Attached is a copy of the notice of extension.
George Bush
The White House,
September 26, 1991.
