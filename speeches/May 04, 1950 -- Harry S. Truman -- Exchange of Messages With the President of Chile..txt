PLEASE ACCEPT my sincere thanks for the kind message you have sent me upon your departure from New Orleans. It was indeed a great pleasure for me and for Mrs. Truman to welcome you and your lovely wife to the United States, and to share with you in such genial circumstances a demonstration of the traditional friendship of our two peoples devoted as they are to common principles of democratic government.
I am glad that you have enjoyed your visit and congratulate you upon its success.
The kind invitation you have extended to me to visit your beautiful country is deeply appreciated. I should indeed be happy to return your visit if the pressure of business permits me to do so some day in the future.
On behalf of the people of the United States I send you best wishes for health and happiness and for the welfare of your great nation.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[His Excellency, Gabriel Gonzalez Videla, President of the Republic of Chile, Santiago, Chile]
