    Hillary Clinton released the below statement after earning the endorsement of the American Federation of Government Employees. With the endorsement of the AFGE, which represents 670,000 federal workers in 1,100 locals, Clinton now has the support of nearly 12 million union members across 18 different national unions and labor alliances that have endorsed her campaign.
"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of the American Federation of Government Employees and their 670,000 members.
"AFGE members make America run—protecting our national security, keeping our families healthy through food inspections, and serving our military in civilian support roles. And for decades, AFGE members have helped build the American middle class by fighting for higher wages, safer working conditions, and the right to organize and bargain collectively.
"As President, I will always stand up for workers' rights, fight to keep workers safe on the job, and protect retirement security, including defined benefit plans and Social Security. I'm proud to stand with federal workers, including the men and women of AFGE, to continue making progress and build a better future for working families. Because when workers are strong, families are strong—and when families are strong, America is strong."
