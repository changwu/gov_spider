    Presidential Determination No. 96-47
Memorandum for the United States Trade Representative
Subject: Reconfirmation of Findings With Respect to the Trade Agreement With Armenia
Since April 7, 1992, the United States of America and Armenia have had in effect a bilateral Agreement on Trade Relations, in relation to which, pursuant to my authority under subsection 405(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2435(b)(1)), I reconfirm that a satisfactory balance of concessions in trade and services has been maintained during the life of the Agreement and that actual or foreseeable reductions in United States tariffs and nontariff barriers to trade resulting from multilateral negotiations are, and continuously have been, satisfactorily reciprocated by Armenia.
You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
