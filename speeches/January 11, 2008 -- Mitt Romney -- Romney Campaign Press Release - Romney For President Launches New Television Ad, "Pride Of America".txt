AD FACTS: Script For "Pride Of America" (TV:30):
Grand Rapids Press: "We Stand At A Critical Moment, Bearing On Our Backs A Worst-In-The-Nation Unemployment Rate, Staring At An Uncertain Future." "Many issues will confront the nation in the next four years, from the ongoing threat of terrorism to the need to find a sensible immigration policy. For Michigan, however, one challenge dominates: the economy. We stand at a critical moment, bearing on our backs a worst-in-the-nation unemployment rate, staring at an uncertain future." (Editorial, "Press Editorial Board Endorses Romney," Grand Rapids Press, 1/11/08)
Oakland Press: "'Favorite Son' Romney Is Best GOP Choice In Primary." "We urge Republican Party faithfuls to stand up and vote for Mitt Romney. ... Equally critical, Romney knows how to get a state out of debt and, being from Michigan, he certainly has an empathy for the state that the other candidates, both GOP and Democratic, don't have. With Michigan's horrible economy and other problems, we need as much clout in Washington as possible and Romney promises to give us that." (Editorial, "'Favorite Son' Romney Is Best GOP Choice In Primary," Oakland Press, 1/11/08)
Grand Rapids Press: "...Mitt Romney Has Our Vote In The Republican Presidential Primary." "Among Republicans on the ballot in Tuesday's presidential primary, two candidates would offer solid leadership, Arizona Sen. John McCain and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. However, when it comes to Michigan's challenges and needs, the passion and knowledge of Mr. Romney tip the scales in his favor. During a visit with Press editors this week, Mr. Romney vowed, 'I will not sleep until Michigan is strong and active and vibrant again.' Because of that focus, MITT ROMNEY has our vote in the Republican presidential primary." (Editorial, "Press Editorial Board Endorses Romney," Grand Rapids Press, 1/11/08)
