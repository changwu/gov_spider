    Today's decision in the D.C. Circuit Court to permit President Trump's reckless expansion of short-term, limited-duration insurance plans, also known as junk plans, is disappointing for the millions of families struggling during this public health crisis.
These plans are called junk for a reason — they don't comply with the Affordable Care Act's vital protections to ensure insurance companies offer quality, affordable coverage. These junk plans can deny individuals for pre-existing conditions or charge women higher premiums just because they are women. These junk plans can deny coverage retroactively, meaning people go to the doctor believing they are covered, but then the insurer cancels coverage once the claim is filed.
It's wrong that during this global health crisis, Trump's administration is propping up low-quality health care instead of devoting more resources to getting the virus under control and making sure everyone can access care and treatment. This is yet another example of Trump's obsession with destroying Obamacare. Americans deserve a president who will fight to expand their access to quality, affordable health care — not take it away.
