Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall. Mexico which has a massive crime problem is doing little to help!Retweets: 19564Favorites: 81112

NBC NEWS is wrong again! They cite 'sources' which are constantly wrong. Problem is like so many others the sources probably don't exist they are fabricated fiction! NBC my former home with the Apprentice is now as bad as Fake News CNN. Sad!Retweets: 20942Favorites: 87371

Democrats and liberals in Congress want to disarm law-abiding Americans at the same time they are releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets. Politicians who put criminal aliens before American Citizens should be voted out of office!Retweets: 36132Favorites: 130728
