    HOUSTON, Texas â€“ Today, Congressman Tom McClintock of California endorsed Ted Cruz for President. McClintock has spent his time in Congress fighting for conservative principles like working to limit the size of the federal government, reign in Obama's lawlessness, repealing Obamacare and protecting the Constitution.
"This election is too important to leave to chance," said Rep. McClintock. "Ted Cruz is the only top tier candidate we can be absolutely certain will govern conservatively and constitutionally; who will stand his ground no matter what the pressure and articulate our positions boldly and convincingly to the American people. After nearly three decades of disappointments, our next president needs to come from the Republican wing of the Republican Party."
"Tom is an unwavering leader in working to reduce government spending, reign in our debt and work for conservative reforms," said Cruz. "He has consistently fought against the Washington Cartel. We need more leaders like Tom in Washington to protect conservative principles. I am thrilled to have Tom's support in working together to restore the principles America was founded on."
