    Laura and I are deeply saddened that at least two Americans were killed and others injured in Wednesday's horrific attack in Mumbai. We also mourn the great loss of life suffered by so many people from several other countries, and we have the wounded in our thoughts and prayers.
My administration has been working with the Indian Government and the international community as Indian authorities work to ensure the safety of those still under threat. We will continue to cooperate against these extremists who offer nothing but violence and hopelessness.
