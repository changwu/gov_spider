    New ad reminds America to remember the less fortunate this holiday season
Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ As the holiday season enters full swing, today the John Edwards for President campaign announced a special holiday television ad, "Season."
In the 30-second ad, which will begin airing on Sunday in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, Edwards asks us to remember that one out of every four homeless people on our streets is a veteran and 37 million people in our country live in poverty. He challenges Americans to promise that never again will we forget those without a voice, because "in America, the chance to build a better life is a promise made to each of us, and the obligation to keep it rests with us all."

Full Transcript of "Season:"
One out of every four homeless people on our streets is a veteran.
Thirty-seven million Americans live in poverty.
Who speaks for them? We do.
This is the season of miracles, of faith and love.
So let us promise together: you will never be forgotten again.
We see you, we hear you, and we will speak for you.
In America, the chance to build a better life is a promise made to each of us, and the obligation to keep it rests with us all.
I'm John Edwards and I approved this message.
