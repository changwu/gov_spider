    MINNEAPOLIS, MN â€” Following the New Hampshire debate, Senator Amy Klobuchar has now raised over $2 million. This is the campaign's best fundraising haul for any Democratic debate.
"With proven grassroots support, Amy continues to outperform expectations and punch above her weight," said Campaign Manager Justin Buoen. "Following her debate performance, we've raised $2 million and have seen an outpouring of donations from all 50 states which will allow us to compete in New Hampshire and beyond."
Klobuchar continues to barnstorm the Granite State leading up to the First In The Nation primary on Tuesday.
