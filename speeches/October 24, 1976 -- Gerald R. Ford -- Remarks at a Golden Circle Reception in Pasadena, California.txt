    Thank you very much, Paul. I can't express adequately my deep appreciation to all of you who have supported the party and supported our efforts with your Golden Circle participation. It's wonderful to be in California after a hard day yesterday in Virginia, where we got a wonderful reception; in North Carolina, where the enthusiasm was really spectacular; and where the results in South Carolina were far beyond our expectations.
I might just give you one poll that is somewhat indicative. I went to the Notre Dame-South Carolina football game, the last half of it. And I went to the right half because in that half, South Carolina outscored Notre Dame-[laughter]---even though they didn't win the ball game. But anyhow, we went to the State Fair, and they have a big poll like you see for the community chest and the like. And 10 days ago, we were behind on a ratio of 3 to 2. Yesterday, we had roughly 10,500 votes and my opponent had 7,300.
What I'm really saying is that we're making substantial inroads in those areas where my opponent thought he had a free ride. He doesn't, and the net result is we're going to do very well in many parts of the country where a month ago it didn't look very optimistic. But when you get to the bottom line, for us to win this election and to keep the direction that this country is on-which I think is a solid, a very optimistic future--it's critical that we win California.
California is a State that we must win. And all of you coming here early on a Sunday morning, and your long support for the party and the principles that we stand for, is indicative of the concern you have. So, if you can just double, redouble, quadruple your efforts between now and November 2 and we win California, we'll keep America going in the right direction.
Thank you very, very much.
