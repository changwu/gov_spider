    Actress Teri Hatcher and actor Dane DeHaan have endorsed Andrew Yang for President. Hatcher is best known for her roles in television series such as Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman and Desperate Housewives. DeHaan is known for his roles in films like The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Chronicle.
"As the Iowa Caucus nears, I wanted to weigh in. From the first debate, even given little opportunity to speak, every thought Andrew Yang expressed resonated with me. His logic and knowledge are impressive. He's a smart guy with a kind heart, talking real statistics on complicated issues in a way no one else does or can... It is time to Make America Think Harder. He wants to solve the problems that got us here in a new forward thinking way. I think he can beat Trump and I believe he will be better for America," said Hatcher.
"Andrew Yang is the only candidate for president who is not just progressive, but original and cutting edge. I'm confident he will help Americans transition into a changing future and that is why I am endorsing him for President of the United States," said DeHaan.
Hatcher and DeHaan's endorsements come as Andrew Yang continues to campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire, making his case in the early contests of the Democratic primaries. The endorsements also come on the heels of the campaign's $16.5 million fundraising quarter, the campaign's highest quarter haul which solidifies its top-tier status. Other recent prominent endorsers include Steven Yeun, Ken Jeong, and Donald Glover.
