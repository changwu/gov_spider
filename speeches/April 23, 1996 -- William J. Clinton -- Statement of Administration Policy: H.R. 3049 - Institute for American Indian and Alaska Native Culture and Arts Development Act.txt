The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 3049 because the bill raises serious constitutional concerns under the Appointments Clause. If H.R. 3049 is presented to the President, the Department of Justice would recommend that he veto the bill. H.R. 3049 would permit individuals, who the President has not nominated, to become members of the Institute's Board of Trustees. This appointment scheme would intrude upon the President's authority to appoint officers of the United States, and vest the Institute's policy making and administrative authority in individuals who have neither been appointed nor confirmed.
