    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced the leadership team for South Carolina Business Leaders for Rudy. These businessmen and women from across the state will help promote Rudy's commitment to cutting wasteful government spending, restoring fiscal discipline and cutting taxes.
"These business leaders are supporting Rudy because they know he is a strong fiscal conservative who will encourage economic growth," said Barry Wynn, Giuliani's South Carolina State Chairman and CEO of the Colonial Group in Spartanburg. "His commitment to looking after American taxpayers is backed up by his remarkable fiscal record as Mayor of New York City."
During his eight years as the Mayor of New York City, Giuliani helped stimulate the local economy by cutting taxes 23 times and turning a $2.3 billion deficit into a multi-billion dollar surplus. As part of Rudy's 12 Commitments to the American People, Mayor Giuliani pledges to restore fiscal discipline to Washington, while cutting wasteful spending and taxes.
