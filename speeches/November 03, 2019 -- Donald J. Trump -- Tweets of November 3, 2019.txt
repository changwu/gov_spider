The Governor of California @GavinNewsom has done a terrible job of forest management. I told him from the first day we met that he must 'clean' his forest floors regardless of what his bosses the environmentalists DEMAND of him. Must also do burns and cut fire stoppers.....Retweets: 22685Favorites: 83597

..Every year as the fire's rage & California burns it is the same thing-and then he comes to the Federal Government for $$$ help. No more. Get your act together Governor. You don't see close to the level of burn in other states...But our teams are working well together in.....Retweets: 13816Favorites: 54396

....putting these massive and many fires out. Great firefighters! Also open up the ridiculously closed water lanes coming down from the North. Don't pour it out into the Pacific Ocean. Should be done immediately. California desperately needs water and you can have it now!Retweets: 14378Favorites: 56319

The Whistleblower got it sooo wrong that HE must come forward. The Fake News Media knows who he is but being an arm of the Democrat Party don't want to reveal him because there would be hell to pay. Reveal the Whistleblower and end the Impeachment Hoax!Retweets: 27437Favorites: 109990

Walking into Madison Square Garden last night with @danawhite for the big @UFC Championship fight was a little bit like walking into a Trump Rally. Plenty of MAGA & KAG present. Great energy. Fantastic job Dana! Heading to D.C. and then to Kentucky for a big @MattBevin Rally...Retweets: 14755Favorites: 68501

Thank you to @OANN for the absolutely incredible Special Report narrated by @PearsonSharp. Seldom do the American people get to see journalistic work of this quality. Now it would be great if the legitimate sections of law enforcement would study your SMEARS SPIES AND LIES....Retweets: 15072Favorites: 52250

....and FEDERAL CONTRACTOR SPIES stories. The finest law enforcement on the planet could not have shown a ROADMAP like that which was produced by you. @OANN should be VERY proud of this great work. I wish more people were seeking the facts and the truth. Keep it up!Retweets: 11365Favorites: 40750

Many people listened to my phone call with the Ukrainian President while it was being made. I never heard any complaints. The reason is that it was totally appropriate I say perfect.

The Democrats are Fixers and they are working overtime to FIX the Impeachment 'Process' in order to hurt the Republican Party and me. Nancy Pelosi should instead Fix her broken District and Corrupt Adam should clean up & manage the California forests which are always burning!Retweets: 21314Favorites: 78138
