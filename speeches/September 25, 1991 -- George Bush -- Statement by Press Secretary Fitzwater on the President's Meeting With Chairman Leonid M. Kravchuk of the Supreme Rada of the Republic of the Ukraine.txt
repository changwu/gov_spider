    The President met with Ukrainian Supreme Rada Chairman Leonid Kravchuk today in the Oval Office and Cabinet Room for 45 minutes. The two leaders discussed developments in Ukraine since the President's visit to Kiev on August 1 and the current situation in the Soviet Union.
The President reaffirmed to Chairman Kravchuk the administration's firm support for the efforts underway in the Soviet Union to build democracy, market economic reform, and the rule of law. The President also outlined U.S. steps to promote economic reform in Ukraine, including consideration of a Peace Corps program and the provision of technical assistance. The President said the United States would continue its medical assistance to Ukraine begun last spring and would attempt to increase U.S. trade by sending an OPIC/EXIM and Commodity Credit Corporation team to discuss this issue. "Ukraine has a special place in the hearts of Americans," the President said. "There is a vibrant Ukrainian community in this country."
The President also told Chairman Kravchuk that the United States would accept his invitation to send a Presidential delegation of distinguished Americans to the Babi Yar commemoration next week.
The President invited Chairman Kravchuk to return to the White House at 5 p.m. to continue his discussions with administration officials headed by Ed Hewett, Special Assistant to the President for Soviet Affairs.
