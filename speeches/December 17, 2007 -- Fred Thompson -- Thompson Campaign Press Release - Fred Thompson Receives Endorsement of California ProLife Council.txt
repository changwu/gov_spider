McLean, VA - Today Senator Fred Thompson received the endorsement of the California ProLife Council.
"There are so many pro-life candidates in the race," said Lawrence Lehr, PAC Chairman. "But Fred Thompson is clearly the one, consistently pro-life candidate with the ability to win in November. It is important that pro-life voters rally around a candidate that can make a difference."
The California ProLife Council is the state affiliate of the National Right to Life Committee. CPLC is a non-profit, non-partisan, non-sectarian grassroots organization dedicated to the cessation of the perceived need for abortion, euthanasia and infanticide. California ProLife Council believes this goal will be accomplished on two fronts: (1) working within the law to change the law and (2) changing public opinion through education.
"I'm blessed and honored to have the endorsement of California ProLife Council for President of the United States," said Senator Thompson. "From the heartland of America, and now coast to coast, right to life organizations have voted to endorse my candidacy because they know I have stood with them yesterday, I stand with them today, and will stand with them tomorrow. They know I have the ability to win this election. They know I believe in the sanctity of life and as President I will do all that I can to do to protect life."
Fred Thompson is pro-life. He believes in the sanctity of human life and that every life is worthy of respect. He had a 100% pro-life voting record in the Senate and believes Roe v. Wade was a bad decision that ought to be overturned. He consistently opposed federal funding to promote or pay for abortion and supported the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, the Child Custody Protection Act, and President Reagan's Mexico City policy. While Fred Thompson supports adult stem cell research, he opposes embryonic stem cell research. He also opposes human cloning.
