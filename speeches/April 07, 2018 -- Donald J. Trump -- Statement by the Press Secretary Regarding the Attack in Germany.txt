    President Donald J. Trump has been briefed on the horrific vehicle attack in MÃ¼nster, Germany, where a car drove into a crowd of people, killing and injuring scores of people before the driver killed himself. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of those killed and we wish a full recovery to those injured. While the German authorities have not yet announced a motive for this cowardly attack on innocent people, we condemn it regardless, and pledge any support from the United States Government that Germany may need.
