The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3760. This legislation drives campaign financing in the wrong direction by encouraging a dramatic increase in campaign spending and enhancing the role of wealthy individuals and special interests in Federal elections. Increased campaign contribution limits for individuals and political action committees when they give to State and national parties will result in increased influence for a special few at the expense of the vast majority of the American public.
Additionally, the bill does not address the real problems with the Nation's campaign finance system, such as the rising cost of campaigns, the influence of special interests, the costs of television and radio broadcast time, or ending the "soft money" system. To the contrary, H.R. 3760 would increase the cost of elections, give special interests an even greater voice in the political process, discourage real competition in races across the Nation, and tip the scales further in favor of incumbents.
