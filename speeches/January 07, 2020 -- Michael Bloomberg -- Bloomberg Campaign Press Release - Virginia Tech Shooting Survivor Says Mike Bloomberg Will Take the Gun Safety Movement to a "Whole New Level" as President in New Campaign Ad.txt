    Bloomberg Started a National Gun Safety Movement that Saved Lives and Changed Laws
NEW YORK, NEW YORK — In a new campaign ad released today, Virginia Tech shooting survivor Colin Goddard says Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg is a leader in the national gun safety movement and will take on the NRA when he gets to the White House. Goddard survived the 2007 shooting in which a gunman killed 32 people on Virginia Tech's campus in Blacksburg, Virginia.
"Having a fighter like Mike in the White House on gun violence, particularly that can take on the NRA and is not afraid to do that, will take the movement for gun safety to a whole new level," Goddard said in the ad airing on TV in Virginia.
Bloomberg co-founded Everytown for Gun Safety, the biggest coalition of Americans fighting for common-sense gun safety laws. He has spent millions to elect candidates who will fight for gun safety legislation in Congress and state legislatures across the country.
"Mike understands the reality of this issue because he's had to be at those hospital bedsides — making those calls, trying to console the families and say there's something better we can do," Goddard said.
Bloomberg is visiting Richmond, Virginia, today, marking his third trip to the Commonwealth State since launching his national campaign to defeat Trump. Virginia will hold its primary on Super Tuesday.
During the 2019 Virginia state election, Bloomberg backed 16 successful Democratic candidates who championed gun safety, and he helped Democrats win control of the Virginia Legislature for the first time in 26 years.
