    Today former U.S. ambassador and well-known political advisor Tom C. Korologos endorsed Ohio Gov. John Kasich for president.
Said Korologos, "I've been around long enough to spot presidential potential, and John Kasich is the full package. He is the candidate I trust to conduct himself on the world stage with the gravitas and strength befitting a great nation. He is the candidate who will make the hard choices necessary to balance our budget and return our economy to a sustainable path. John Kasich absolutely has what it takes to lead our country, and I look forward to supporting him in that endeavor."

Korologos served as the U.S. ambassador to Belgium from 2004 to 2007. A veteran of the Nixon and Ford admininistrations, he has also advised President Reagan, President George H.W. Bush and President George W. Bush. Earlier in his career, he worked as a journalist and congressional staffer.
Said Kasich, "Very few people in public service can match Tom Korologos' level of political expertise and experience. His relationship with no fewer than five Republican presidents in our lifetime has given him an intimate knowledge of what the job entails, so to receive his endorsement is a tremendous honor for me."
