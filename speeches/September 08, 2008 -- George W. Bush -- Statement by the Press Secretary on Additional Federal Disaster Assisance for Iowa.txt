    The President today made additional disaster assistance available to the State of Iowa impacted by severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding during the period of May 25 to August 13, 2008, by authorizing an increase in the level of Federal funding for Public Assistance projects.
The President's major disaster declaration issued for the State on May 27, 2008, initially authorized Individual Assistance, Public Assistance, and Hazard Mitigation, and any other forms of assistance under the Stafford Act, subject to the completion of joint Federal, State, and local Preliminary Damage Assessments. Public Assistance, Hazard Mitigation, and Other Needs Assistance under Section 408 were authorized at 75 percent Federal funding of total eligible costs.
On June 30, 2008, the President amended his declaration of May 27, 2008, and increased the Federal funding for emergency protective measures, including direct Federal assistance, under the Public Assistance program to 90 percent. This adjustment was effective until August 8, 2008, at which time the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service River Forecast Center reported that the rivers in the State of Iowa, which had experienced historical flooding, fell below flood stage.
Under the President's order today, the Federal share for Public Assistance for this disaster has been increased to 90 percent of the total eligible costs.
The cost-share adjustment is retroactive to the date of the President's major disaster declaration for the State of Iowa.
