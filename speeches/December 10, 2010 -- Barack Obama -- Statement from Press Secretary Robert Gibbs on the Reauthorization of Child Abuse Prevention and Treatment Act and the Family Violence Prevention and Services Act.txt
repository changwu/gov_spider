    The President is pleased that today Congress passed S. 3817 reauthorizing the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act and the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act. This important legislation will strengthen child protective services and continue life-saving programs for victims of domestic violence. The President thanks Chairman Harkin and Chairman Miller for their great work, and he particularly thanks Senator Dodd for his leadership. This legislative achievement is a fitting tribute to his many years of effort in the Senate to protect the most vulnerable of our citizens.
