    I was saddened to learn of the passing of my friend Kam Kuwata. Kam's brilliance as a political strategist was matched by his passion for our country and the process by which we govern ourselves. I'll never forget the critical contribution Kam made to our efforts in 2008, planning an open, vibrant convention that really captured the spirit of our campaign. Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to Kam's extended family of friends and to so many in California who mourn his passing.
