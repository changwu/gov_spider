    When President Donald J. Trump began his campaign, he promised to institute pro-growth economic policies that will provide much needed financial relief to all Americans.  With the release of today's conference report on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, President Trump is on the precipice of fulfilling that promise.  By lowering tax rates, simplifying the rigged and burdensome tax code, and repealing the failed tax on lower- and middle-income households known as the Obamacare individual mandate, this legislation will grow our economy, raise wages, and promote economic competitiveness.  The President applauds the House and Senate conferees on coming to an agreement on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and looks forward to fulfilling the promise he made to the American people to give them a tax cut by the end of the year.
