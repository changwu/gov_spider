    NAM speech, retail stop and town hall meeting round out one-day trip
ANKENY, Iowa â€” The Iowa component of the Ron Paul 2012 Presidential Campaign announced today that Dr. Paul will again visit Iowa. This latest visit will occur on Tuesday, November 1st.
The visit takes place three short days after his October 29th scheduled trip to Des Moines for the National Federation of Republican Assemblies (NFRA), and his Carroll Town Hall Meeting in West Central Iowa.
On November 1st, Ron Paul will visit with members of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) in south east Iowa. U.S. loss of manufacturing dramatically affects unemployment in America and has contributed to stubborn joblessness. Congressman Paul, in remarks reflecting the proper role of government, will share his long-term vision for how to reverse the decline in U.S. competitiveness.
Following the visit with NAM members, Dr. Paul will greet voters at Smokey Row Coffee House in Oskaloosa and hold a town hall meeting in Ottumwa.
