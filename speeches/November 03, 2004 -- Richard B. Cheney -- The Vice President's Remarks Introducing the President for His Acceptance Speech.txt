THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you all. (Applause.) It's an honor for me to be here, along with Lynne and our whole family, on this very special afternoon. This was an historic election ?- and once again, I have delivered the state of Wyoming for the Bush-Cheney ticket. (Laughter and applause.)
This campaign has been a tremendously uplifting experience. We have carried the President's message of hope and optimism across this continent ?- even to the Aloha State. (Applause.) We have worked hard and gained many new friends, and the result is now clear: A record voter turnout, and a broad, nationwide victory. (Applause.)
We are deeply grateful to every person who joined in the effort. Thanks to you, we have gained seats in the House of Representatives. (Applause.) Thanks to you, I will be presiding over a larger Republican majority in the United States Senate. (Applause.) Thanks to you, President George W. Bush won the greatest number of popular votes of any presidential candidate in history. (Applause.)
This has been a consequential presidency – which has revitalized our economy and reasserted a confident American role in the world. Yet in the election of 2004, we did more than campaign on a record. President Bush ran forthrightly on a clear agenda for this nation's future, and the nation responded by giving him a mandate. Now -- (Applause.) Now we move forward to serve and to guard the country we love.
It has been my special privilege to serve as Vice President alongside this exceptional American. He's a man of deep conviction, and personal kindness. His leadership is wise, and firm, and fearless. Those are qualities that Americans like in a President – and those are the qualities we will need for the next four years. If ever a man met his moment as leader of this country, that man is George W. Bush. (Applause.)
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the President of the United States.
