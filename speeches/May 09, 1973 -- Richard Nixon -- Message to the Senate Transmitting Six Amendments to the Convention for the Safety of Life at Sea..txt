    To the Senate of the United States:
I herewith transmit for the advice and consent of the Senate six amendments to the Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1960.
These amendments were adopted at London on October 12, 1971 by the Assembly of the Inter-governmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO) and are the outcome of recommendations of the Maritime Safety Committee of IMCO directed toward improvement of safety of navigation. The regulations as amended would provide for improved radio-telephone watch procedures, more modern radio-telephonic devices, and more detailed procedures for operation of such devices. In addition, the insertion of a new regulation on routing specifies an increased role for IMCO in establishing and coordinating routes and increased enforcement responsibility for the contracting governments.
For the information of the Senate, I am also transmitting the report of the Department of State with respect to the amendments.
I recommend that the Senate give swift and favorable consideration to all of these amendments.
