    Eighty years ago, the Ukrainian people were subjected to unimaginable suffering as a result of the deliberate policies of the regime of Joseph Stalin. Ukrainian men, women, and children died of starvation as the product of their labor was seized in an effort to break the will of a proud people. On November 23, the American people will solemnly join with Ukrainians around the world, including so many Ukrainian-Americans, in remembering the millions who died senselessly as a result of this man-made catastrophe.
Though the Holodomor was an example of the worst in mankind, the tremendous resilience and courage demonstrated by the Ukrainian people in the face of such cruelty is testament to an indomitable national spirit. Even during the worst days of the famine, the people of Ukraine never gave up hope that their homeland would one day become independent and free.
This sad occasion is an opportunity to reflect on the evil that man can do. As we remember and honor the victims of the Holodomor, we reiterate our call for the respect of universal human rights, and we renew our commitment to preventing similar atrocities from ever happening again.
