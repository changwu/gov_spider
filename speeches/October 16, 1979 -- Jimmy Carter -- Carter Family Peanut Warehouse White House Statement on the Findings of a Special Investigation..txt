    We are, of course, carefully studying the report and will have further comment on it later.
We said from the beginning of the investigation that no moneys were diverted from the Carter warehouse into the Jimmy Carter Presidential campaign or from the campaign into the warehouse, and the report shows our statements were absolutely correct. We also said from the beginning that we would cooperate fully with the investigation, and the report shows we did exactly that.
We are very pleased by the special counsel's findings.
