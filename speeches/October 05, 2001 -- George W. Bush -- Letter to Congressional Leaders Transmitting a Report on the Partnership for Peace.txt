    Dear __________:
Pursuant to section 514 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 (Public Law 103-236), and section 205 of the NATO Participation Act of 1994 (title II of Public Law 103-447), I hereby transmit to you this report concerning Partnership for Peace (PFP) developments through July 15, 2001.
The PFP continues to build on the record of success it has compiled since its inception in 1994. Partners have continued to use the PFP actively and effectively to build stronger ties with the Alliance and develop closer cooperation with their neighbors. The PFP and its political component, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC), have greatly facilitated the incorporation of Partners into NATO operations in Bosnia and Kosovo. The PFP support of the Membership Action Plan, initiated in 1999, continues to help those partners that want to join NATO to implement reforms. Continued enhancements to PFP have provided an improved mechanism for Partners to develop interoperability with NATO, which will be necessary for future NATO-led Alliance/Partner missions.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
