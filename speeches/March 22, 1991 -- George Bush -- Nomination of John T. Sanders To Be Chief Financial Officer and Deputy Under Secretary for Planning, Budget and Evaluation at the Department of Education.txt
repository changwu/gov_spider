    The President today announced his intention to nominate Dr. John Theodore Sanders, of Illinois, to be Chief Financial Officer and Deputy Under Secretary for Planning, Budget and Evaluation. He would succeed Charles Edward Mealey Kolb. The President indicated that he will ask the Congress to combine those roles into one position with the title of Under Secretary and Chief Financial Officer of the Department of Education.
Dr. Sanders, a Texas native, was nominated by President Bush as Under Secretary of Education on March 10, 1989, and was confirmed by the Senate on April 19, 1989. He became Deputy Secretary on November 5, 1990, when President Bush signed legislation elevating his position to that level.
An activist in education, Dr. Sanders formerly served as president of the Council of Chief State School Officers. He served as Nevada's superintendent of public instruction and before coming to the Department of Education in 1989, as State superintendent of education in Illinois.
Dr. Sanders graduated from Wayland Baptist University (B.S., 1964); Washington State University (M.A.T., 1970); and from the University of Nevada, Reno, (Ed.D., 1987). He is married, has four children, two grandchildren, and resides in Springfield, IL.
