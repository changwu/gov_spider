    Dear Mr. Chairman:
On March 28, 1998, I sent a letter to the Leadership addressing my concerns regarding H.R. 2400, the Building Efficient Surface Transportation and Equity Act of 1998. As the House prepares to consider this bill, it is my hope that the Lowey-Canady .08 provision be adopted.
As the crime rate continues to drop nationwide, we still lose an American to drunk driving every thirty minutesâ€”every half hour a family is shattered and a child, parent or neighbor is lost forever. Setting a uniform limit for impaired driving at .08 blood alcohol content will help us crack down on the drunk driving epidemic and put a stop to these needless deaths. In addition, a uniform standard will still allow adults to drink responsibly.
This should not be a partisan issue, but rather an opportunity for the House to act in a bipartisan fashion to save lives and serve America. I look forward to continuing to work together to make the .08 standard a reality.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
