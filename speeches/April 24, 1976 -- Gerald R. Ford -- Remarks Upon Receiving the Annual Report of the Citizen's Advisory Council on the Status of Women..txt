    THANK YOU very, very much, Senator Saiki. I have had an opportunity to scan this and I certainly want to congratulate you and all of the other ladies for the contributions that have been made in the analysis of the progress that's been made, both educational, economic, as well as legal, in the status of women.
We have got a lot more to do, but the Citizens Advisory Committee has made a great contribution, and I am sure in the months ahead those contributions will be multiplied many, many times.
I regret very much that Mrs. Gutwillig could not be here, but I understand that her husband is ill, and we certainly wish to her, as well as to her husband, a rapid and full recovery.
I did notice one thing that bothered me--not what you all have done, but a problem that you raise--a problem of a variation in the handling of pension problems in the various Federal agencies. This is something that I think must be clarified. I think it's a problem that must be resolved, and I strongly hope that your group will make specific recommendations. I have asked the appropriate agency in the Federal Government to get into it, to study it and to make recommendations to me. It's a matter that must be resolved in order to provide equality and I think equity as far as women are concerned.
I hope and trust that when we get this report next year that it will show increased progress--the kind that has been made over the last 5 years. It's significant, but we have to do better. I thank all of you for the fine job that you have done.
