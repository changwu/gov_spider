    Today, President Donald J. Trump announced his intent to nominate the following individual to a key position in his Administration:
John Gibbs, of Michigan, to be Director of the Office of Personnel Management for a term of four years.
John Gibbs has been an appointee at the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for more than three years, and currently serves as Acting Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, where he oversees an annual budget of $8 billion for programs addressing homelessness, community development, and disaster relief. He recently led the successful deployment of more than $9 billion in CARES Act funds in response to coronavirus.
Prior to his service at HUD, Mr. Gibbs led non-profit teams in Japan. Using his fluency in Japanese, he trained non-profits on how to reach the vulnerable using technology, and deployed homeless outreach strategies for Japanese churches.
Before that, Mr. Gibbs was a software engineer in Silicon Valley, where he worked for Symantec, Palm, and Apple, playing a key role in the development of landmark technology products including industry-leading intrusion detection software, and the very first version of the iPhone.
Mr. Gibbs hails from Lansing, Michigan, and is a published author, having written academically on the application of Behavioral Economics to policymaking. He holds a B.S. in Computer Science from Stanford University, and a Master in Public Administration from the Harvard University Kennedy School of Government.
