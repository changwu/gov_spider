    TODAY marks the 40th anniversary of the National Labor Relations Act, acclaimed as labor's "Bill of Rights."
This landmark act of Congress helped pave the way for millions of American workers to share more fully in the fruits of their own labor and to unite with one another in the strong bond of common interest and purpose. It provided the basis for the resolution of disputes over union organization and the means for settling union-management disputes.
Since the passage of this law on July 5, 1935, our Nation has moved from confrontation to cooperation between management and labor and from protracted unrest to effective partnership. This partnership has fostered great economic strength and progress which is unique among nations of the world.
For American workers, better pay, job security, pensions, and a system for the orderly resolution of day-to-day disputes have been the legacy of the National Labor Relations Act and its collective bargaining guarantees; for management, a more certain and stable industrial relations era.
On this special day, I salute the working men and women of America for the outstanding contributions they have made and will continue to make through honest, productive, and fairly rewarded labor.
