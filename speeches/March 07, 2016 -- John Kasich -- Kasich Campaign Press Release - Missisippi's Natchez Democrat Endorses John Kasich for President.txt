Tuesday, Mississippians will head to the polls to choose either a Democratic or a Republican candidate. My hope is that many of the state's Democrats will realize the power they stand to wield by crossing party lines and voting for the best Republican option on the ticket — and the only adult on the stage at Thursday's debate — Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
He's the only person running who seems to have the brains, the experience, the character and the temperament to be our nation's leader.
The others are either shams, socialists or politicians who seem to lie to get by or just nasty-spirited people.
Our country should not be ruled by an angry mob, but by sound, logical men who understand the threats our world faces — at home and abroad.
Three guys who are yelling and screaming at each other don't seem to fit and, to me, neither do the two on the blue side of the ticket either.
Kasich appears to be a civil adult, which is what America is lacking at the moment — and what is sorely needed in leadership.
