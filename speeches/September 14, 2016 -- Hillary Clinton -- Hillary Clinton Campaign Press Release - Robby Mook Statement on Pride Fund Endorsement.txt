    Robby Mook released the following statement in response to Hillary Clinton receiving the endorsement of the Pride Fund to End Gun Violence: 
"This year, the Orlando community suffered from the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. This was an act of hate. The gunman attacked an LGBT nightclub during Pride Month and devastated Orlando's Puerto Rican community. Our country mourns for the 49 victims lost that night, and we mourn for the 33,000 Americans killed by guns each year.
"It's time for action. That's why Hillary Clinton is honored to receive the endorsement of the Pride Fund - and looks forward to working with them to fight for common sense gun laws and to secure equality for LGBT Americans."
