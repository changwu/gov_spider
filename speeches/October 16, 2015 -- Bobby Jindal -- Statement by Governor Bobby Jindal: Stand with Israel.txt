    Over the past week, Israel has faced a wave of terrorist attacks from radical, violent Palestinians. The Obama Administration is unable to determine who is right and wrong between Palestinian terrorists killing innocent Israelis and the Israeli government protecting its' citizens. Just this week, a State Department spokesman said "I would say certainly individuals on both sides of this divide are â€“ have proven capable of and in our view guilty of acts of terror."
That is despicable.
And unfortunately, this is just another incident in a pattern of anti-Israel behavior and rhetoric by the Obama administration.
It has to stop. The United States must have a President who will once again say clearly to the world that Israel is our friend, and we stand firmly with them.
When Hillary Clinton calls for "dialogue" as the solution to end the terrorist attacks against Israel, she implies that Israelis are responsible for terrorists attacking them. In fairness to Hillary, she probably actually believes that, but it is flat out wrong.
Israel shouldn't engage in "dialogue" with terrorists. Israel should destroy terrorists - and the United States should stand with Israel when it does so.
