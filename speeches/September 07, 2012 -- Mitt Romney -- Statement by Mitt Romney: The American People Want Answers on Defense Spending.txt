    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on President Obama's failure to tell the American people how he would implement defense cuts:
"A year ago, Barack Obama set in motion the sequestration process that is leading to imminent disastrous cuts in our military might. The President is required by law to tell the American people how he would implement these cuts. But he has chosen to ignore the deadline for doing so. The American people have had enough of evasion and enough of finger pointing. They just want answers. Secretary of Defense Panetta has said these cuts will be devastating to our national security and our economy. It's time the President stops stonewalling, stops dismantling our military, and starts providing answers."
