    Dear Francis:
In accepting your resignation, I desire to express my appreciation of the patriotic services which you have rendered to your country during the war and during the days when we were preparing for the war.
I shall always look back with pleasure upon my association with you while I was in the Senate as well as during the past months.
I hope that you will have continued happiness and success in your future work, and I trust that I may have the privilege of consulting you in the future whenever occasion arises.
I am making your resignation effective July 1, 1945.
Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
