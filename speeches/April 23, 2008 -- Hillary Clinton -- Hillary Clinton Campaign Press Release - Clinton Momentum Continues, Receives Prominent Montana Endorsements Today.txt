    Helena, MT - Montana for Hillary today announced the endorsements of more Montana legislators, leaders and Democratic activists, demonstrating Clinton's growing support throughout Montana.
Last night Sen. Clinton decisively won the Pennsylvania primary, an important turning point in the Democratic primary against Barack Obama.
"In Montana, we can't just rely on hope; it takes a plan to get things done. Hillary has a plan to make positive change in our communities, and I believe she will help address the issues facing rural Montana," Rep. Julie French of Scobey said.
"I am grateful for the overwhelming support I've received from distinguished leaders under the Big Sky," Hillary said. "These local leaders see that a poor economy and failing health care system is taking a toll on their communities. They know I'm the candidate who will deliver real solutions to the problems facing Montanans."

State Sen. Ken Hansen, Harlem
Rep. Norma Bixby, Lame Deer
Rep. Julie French, Scobey
Rep. Veronica Smalls Eastman, Lodge Grass
