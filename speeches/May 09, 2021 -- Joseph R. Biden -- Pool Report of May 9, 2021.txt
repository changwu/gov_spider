In-town pool report #1 - arrival and lid
Marine One touched down on the Ellipse at 8:42 on a beautiful spring evening in D.C.
Moments later, POTUS, wearing a dark suit and dark mask, exited and headed toward his motorcade. A reporter shouting questions was drowned out by the noise of Marine One's still-going propeller.
POTUS then entered motorcade, which departed the Ellipse at 8:45.
The White House called a travel-photo lid at 8:46. Have a good night!
