    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Senators Boschwitz (R) and Durenberger (R) Minn.)
The Administration objects to the enactment of S. 1396.
The claims to be settled are by heirs of individual Indian allottees, many of whom are not members of the White Earth Band.
The White Earth Band has no established claim against the United States, yet this bill provides a wholly unwarranted $6.6 million Federal payment to the Band as a condition necessary to the settlement of the individual claims. Further, the bill would impose a complex administrative burden on the Department of the Interior in determining and locating the heirs. The Administration proposed making the heirs responsible for coming forward to file claims and imposing a statute of limitations for filing.
