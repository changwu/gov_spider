    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Sen. Cornyn, R-TX, and 21 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of S. 4003, the bipartisan Law Enforcement De-Escalation Training Act of 2022. This legislation would authorize $34 million over four years for the Department of Justice's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services to support the establishment, certification, and implementation of training for law enforcement officers and mental health professionals on crisis intervention teams. This training would include: (1) de-escalation tactics and alternatives to the use of force; (2) approaches to safely respond to people with disabilities or people in crisis; (3) strategies for participating successfully on crisis intervention teams; and (4) referrals to community-based supportive services, including housing, public benefits, and behavioral health. The legislation would further authorize $90 million over two years for the Department's Byrne Justice Assistance Grant program to support related training programs and continuing education for law enforcement and mental health professionals and to cover costs associated with participation in the National Use-of-Force Data Collection. Because advancing effective, accountable policing builds public trust and strengthens public safety, the Administration calls for swift passage of this common-sense bipartisan legislation.
