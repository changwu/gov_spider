    CHARLESTON, South Carolina — The Asa for America campaign released the following statement today in regard to the indictment of former President Donald J. Trump. This statement can be attributed to Governor Asa Hutchinson:
"With the news that Donald Trump has been indicted for the second time, our country finds itself in a position that weakens our democracy. Donald Trump's actions—from his willful disregard for the Constitution to his disrespect for the rule of law—should not define our nation or the Republican Party. This is a sad day for our country. While Donald Trump is entitled to the presumption of innocence, the ongoing criminal proceedings will be a major distraction. This reaffirms the need for Donald Trump to respect the office and end his campaign." — Gov. Asa Hutchinson, the 46th Governor of Arkansas and a current Republican candidate for President
