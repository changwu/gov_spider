    Nearly 7 in 10 Support President Biden's Made in America Tax Plan to Pay for American Jobs Plan
Today, Small Business for America's Future released a national survey showing most small business owners support President Biden's American Jobs Plan and his corporate tax proposals, and overall "feel strongly that the American Jobs Plan will be good for Main Street and the economy as a whole."
Small Business for America's Future Co-Chair Anne Zimmerman said, "Main Street small business owners clearly want an infrastructure plan that will propel them forward as they recover from the pandemic, and a tax code that works for them, not large corporations. Not only does the American Jobs Plan leave the vast majority of small business taxes unchanged, it leaves corporate taxes lower than they were just three years ago. Small business owners see this plan as a big win."
The results show:

8 in 10 small business owners are in favor of the American Jobs Plan
76% of small business owners think the American Jobs Plan will help boost the economy as a whole
72% believe the American Jobs Plan will help small businesses specifically
67% said they support increasing taxes on corporations to pay for the American Jobs Plan
76% said small businesses are harmed when large businesses or corporations use loopholes to avoid paying taxes
