    We strongly disagree with the district court's decision to impose a nationwide injunction against the President's policy on a preliminary, emergency basis over the weekend without even affording the government an opportunity to provide a written defense. Once again, a nationwide injunction is permitting a single judge to thwart the President's policy judgment on a matter where Congress expressly gave the President authority. Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act plainly states that, "[w]henever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens would be detrimental to the interests of the United States," he may "impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate." As the Supreme Court held in a recent landmark case, this statute "exudes deference to the President in every clause." It is wrong and unfair for a single district court judge to thwart the policies that the President determined would best protect the United States healthcare system â€” and for the United States taxpayers to suffer the grave consequences of the immense strain inflicted on the healthcare system from subsidizing uncompensated care for those seeking admission. The Administration looks forward to the opportunity to make its defense in court, and it will continue to vigorously defend the President's policies to protect the interests of the American people.
