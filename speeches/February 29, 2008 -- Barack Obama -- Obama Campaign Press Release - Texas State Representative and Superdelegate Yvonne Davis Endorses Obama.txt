    Austin, TX - The Obama Campaign announced that State Representative and Democratic National Committee Superdelegate Yvonne Davis (D-Dallas) endorsed Senator Obama's grassroots campaign for change.
State Representative Davis today said, "As State Representative for District 111, I have the distinct honor to represent more than 145,000 individuals in the Texas House of Representatives. As an at-large member of the Democratic National Committee from Texas, and a 'super-delegate,' I know politics is serious business, but I believe that politics has to be about the people!
When I look at the sad state of affairs in our community and across the nation -- I know we can do better. That is why today I am endorsing Senator Barack Obama for President of the United States of America. Senator Obama sets himself apart because he is able to bring Americans together to finally overcome the great challenges we face.
Senator Obama offers leadership and vision for what this country can achieve when we put aside our differences and come together behind our common purpose. Only if we work together can we create the change we believe in.
It is up to each of us to accept our responsibility and join with Senator Obama as we reclaim America."
