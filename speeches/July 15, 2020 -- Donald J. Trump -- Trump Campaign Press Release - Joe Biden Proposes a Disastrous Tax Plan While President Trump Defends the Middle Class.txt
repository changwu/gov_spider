    Following the release of Joe Biden's economic proposals, it is clear Biden has become completely beholden to Bernie Sanders and his socialist base. Biden's "unity platform" - crafted by the radical left - includes massive tax hikes on 80% of all Americans, costing individuals $1.9 trillion and businesses $2.1 trillion. While President Trump stands up for workers and small business owners, Joe Biden is perfectly willing to sacrifice the American middle class to appease the far-left.
Earlier today, Donald J. Trump for President Inc. hosted a Tax Day press briefing call with Vice President Mike Pence to examine the differences between the Trump Administration's unprecedented economic accomplishments and Joe Biden's catastrophic scheme to raise taxes by $4 trillion. As the Vice President confirmed, only President Trump has the experience and proposals needed to ensure prosperity for all Americans, while Joe Biden's misguided plans would only serve to weaken our nation's economic advancement.
"I think Bernie Sanders said not long ago that Joe Biden, after they published their agenda, could be the most – in his words – 'most progressive president since FDR.' And working closely with allies like AOC and other radical leftists in the House of Representatives, frankly, their policy agenda looks more and more like Bernie won," said Vice President Mike Pence. "You look at the left-wing agenda: big government, more taxes, more regulations agenda. It is clear that Joe Biden's policies are being driven by the radical left in his party, and would be a death knell on the American recovery that is just now beginning in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic."
