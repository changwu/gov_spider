    Milwaukee, Wis. -- Gov. Scott Walker issued the following statement on the three-year anniversary of the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya.
"On this day we honor the memory of Ambassador Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, and Glen Doherty â€“ four brave Americans whose service we will never forget. We mourn their loss and keep their families in our thoughts and prayers. As we mark the anniversary of yet another deadly, coordinated attack on Americans by radical Islamists, it serves as a painful reminder of what's at stake in the battle against radical Islamic terrorism and the vital importance of remaining steadfast in this fight. Until we prevail in this struggle, we must always remain vigilant."
