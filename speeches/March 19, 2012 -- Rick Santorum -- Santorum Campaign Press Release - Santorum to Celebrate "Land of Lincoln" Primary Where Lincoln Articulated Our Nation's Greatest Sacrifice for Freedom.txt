    Verona, PA - Republican Presidential Candidate Rick Santorum will hold an election night party in Gettysburg, PA - site of the largest battle ever held in the Western Hemisphere and where President Abraham Lincoln gave his most poignant and passionate defense of our Founder's vision of freedom.
Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said: "Tomorrow marks the Republican Primary in the 'Land of Lincoln.' Rick Santorum has chosen to celebrate the evening at the very place President Lincoln gave his most poignant and passionate defense of freedom and the American spirit - Gettysburg, PA. This week marks the two year anniversary of the passage of ObamaCare - and we are again fighting for freedom. But this time we are not asking the American people to put on the uniform of their country, but stand up as citizens - to stand up to the freedom infringement of this Administration and for a candidate and a message focused on empowering the American people. This night will mark an important turn toward the second half of this primary season, with a renewed focus on freedom, empowerment, and nominating a candidate who can draw clear contrasts with President Obama. Rick Santorum is the one candidate who can do that and he will proudly make that declaration of freedom in the tiny Pennsylvania town where so many gave their 'last full measure' in defense of those freedoms."
