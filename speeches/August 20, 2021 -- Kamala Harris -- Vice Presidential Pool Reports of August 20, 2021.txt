VP Travel Pool #1 JBA Harris remarks/wheels up 
Hi -- I'll be your co-print pooler (along with NYT's Zolan Kanno-Youngs) for VP Harris's Asia trip.
Marine Two landed at JBA at 9:05 pm. Harris, wearing a dark suit, stopped to talk to pool for a few minutes. She didn't take questions and boarded immediately after.
It was very hard to hear but she said evacuating Americans and Afghans who helped Americans is of the highest priority. She said her trip to SE Asia will show the U.S.'s role as a global leader. She mentioned the importance of working with Singapore and Vietnam on supply chain issues.
She didn't respond to shouted questions.
AF2 wheels up soon for the very long journey to Singapore (with refueling stops in Anchorage and Tokyo).
