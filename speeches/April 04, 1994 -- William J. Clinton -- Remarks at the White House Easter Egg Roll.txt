    The President. Good morning.
Audience members. Good morning.
The President. I am so glad to see all of you here. I woke up before dawn this morning, and when I got out just at dawn I already saw the Easter Bunnies out here walking around, plotting their strategies for the day and getting ready.
I want to thank everyone who has worked so hard on this and all the people who helped to sponsor it. But mostly, I just want to welcome all the boys and girls here, all the families here, and to thank all of you for being a part of this wonderful American tradition. I hope you have a terrific time today. I assure you that we're having a terrific time having you here. And I think we ought to start. Are you ready to start?
Audience members. Yes!
The President. Now we've got to get everybody lined up. Line them up for the first roll.
Now everybody, let me just say, everybody who is here, all the children who are here, not every adult, all the children who are here will get a souvenir egg. Okay? And some of them were signed not just by the First Lady and me, some were signed by Socks. They're more valuable.
Are we ready?
Audience members. Yes!
The President. All right, when I blow the whistle, we're all going to start. Okay? So when I blow the whistle, all of you cheer the kids on who are over there in the roll. Have we got a deal?
Audience members. Yes!
The President. All right, let's go. One, two, three, go!
