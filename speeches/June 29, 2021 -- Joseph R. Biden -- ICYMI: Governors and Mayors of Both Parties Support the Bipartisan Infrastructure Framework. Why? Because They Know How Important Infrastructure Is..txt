    Governors and Mayors are on the frontlines in their communities. Every day they see firsthand how important 21st century infrastructure is to their communities, and how bold investment ? like outlined in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Agreement ? is needed now more than ever. But not only will this plan fix our roads and bridges, it will also create good paying jobs, grow local economies, and deliver real results to the American people. That's why mayors and governors ? of both parties ? are praising the bipartisan deal and urging Congress to pass it.
Statement by National Governors Association Chairman New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and Vice Chairman Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson"Governors are encouraged by yesterday's announcement from the White House, establishing a bipartisan framework for historic, new investments in American infrastructure. As Governors have shown, infrastructure is one of the few truly bipartisan issues and this framework recognizes the importance of federal partnership in investment. From the Erie Canal to the Transcontinental Railroad to the Interstate Highway System, big, transformative projects have driven economic growth and innovation. For the past four decades, however, the overall condition of U.S. infrastructure has continued to deteriorate. As Congress prepares to write the major infrastructure investment package based on this framework, Governors will work in a bipartisan manner to ensure state and territory needs are addressed, such as investing to modernize and make more resilient our transportation system; supporting innovation to make our energy system more efficient; and addressing the significant backlog in critical water infrastructure projects. To do this properly, Congress must ensure states are responsible for directing how state-level investments are made. We look forward to working with the White House and Congress in a bipartisan manner to advance these and other critical priorities on behalf of the nation's Governors."
Statement by U.S. Conference of Mayors on Bipartisan Infrastructure Plan (usmayors.org)Washington, DC?Below is a statement by U.S. Conference of Mayors President Dayton (OH) Mayor Nan Whaley on the bipartisan infrastructure framework announced by President Biden today:
"The nation's mayors are grateful to President Biden and his Administration for their sustained commitment to making a once-in-a-lifetime investment in the nation's infrastructure. We also commend the Senators for their bipartisan efforts to advance increased investment in these vital public assets, which underpin our daily lives and our economic recovery.
"We recognize that there is much still to be done to fulfill our vision for a better future. We look forward to reviewing the details of this agreement and know that further negotiations are needed on policy to modernize our infrastructure, move toward a less carbon intensive economy, build a workforce for the future and help our families and businesses prosper. Mayors are calling on Congressional and Administration leaders to keep working on these most pressing challenges, especially investing in more vigorous actions to address our climate challenges and building a more just and fair economy.
"As these priorities move forward, mayors again call on our federal leaders to continue to empower local decision-makers in investing federal resources to help us build stronger communities and lift up the many that have suffered so much during this pandemic. By committing to more localism, we can invest directly in our cities through existing and proven delivery systems, such as Community Development Block Grants, Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants and Surface Transportation Block Grants to local areas. These are the tools that will really help us build back better, and these are the commitments the nation's mayors want to see as these negotiations go forward."
