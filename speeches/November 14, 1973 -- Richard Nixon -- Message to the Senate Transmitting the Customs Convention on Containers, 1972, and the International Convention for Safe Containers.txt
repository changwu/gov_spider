    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification (1) the Customs Convention on Containers, 1972, and (2) the International Convention for Safe Containers, both signed at Geneva on December 5, 1972. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Secretary of State with respect to the Conventions.
The Customs Convention on Containers, 1972, is designed to supersede and update the Customs Convention on Containers of 1956. The new Convention provides for the temporary importation of containers free of import duties and taxes and free of import prohibitions and restrictions. It also harmonizes and unifies technical provisions applicable to containers used for transport of merchandise under Customs seal and provides for the use of temporarily imported containers in internal transport operations under specified conditions. This Convention is important because it will insure United States-owned containers the same treatment in the territories of States parties to this Convention as that afforded in the United States to foreign-owned containers.
The International Convention for Safe Containers specifies structural requirements for certain transport containers to assure their safe operation. The need for an international convention on this topic became apparent with the threat of proliferation of individual State safety requirements which would be applicable to all containers transiting their respective borders. The safety record of the containerization movement has been excellent and the present Convention is based on existing safety standards.
The Customs Convention on Containers, 1972, and the International Convention for Safe Containers will make a significant contribution to efforts to establish uniform international regulations regarding containers.
