    Memorandum for the Secretary of Commerce
Would you please assure that the Department of Commerce takes steps to permit the public inspection and copying of boycott-related reports to be filed in the future with the Department of Commerce. Only business proprietary information regarding such things as quantity and type of goods exported, the release of which could place reporting firms at a competitive disadvantage, should not be made available to the public.
During the past year, there has been a growing interest in and awareness of the impact of the Arab Boycott on American business. Disclosure of boycott-related reports will enable the American public to assess for itself the nature and impact of the Arab Boycott and to monitor the conduct of American companies.
I have concluded that this public disclosure will strengthen existing policy against the Arab Boycott of Israel without jeopardizing our vital interests in the Middle East. The action I am directing today should serve as a reaffirmation of our national policy of opposition to boycott actions against nations friendly to us.
