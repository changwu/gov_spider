    MIAMI, FL – Presidential Candidate Ted Cruz announced today the endorsement of former Republican Presidential Candidate Carly Fiorina during a rally in Miami, Florida.
"Carly Fiorina is a strong, principled leader and woman of faith," said Cruz. "Our campaign is stronger with her leadership and her voice. Her story embodies the promise that in America anyone can start as a secretary and become a Fortune 50 CEO. Carly speaks the truth with courage, doesn't back down to the Washington powerbrokers, and terrifies Hillary and the Democrats. We are blessed to have her support, and together I am confident we will continue to unite conservatives so that every American has the opportunity to achieve the unimaginable."
"Ted Cruz is a fearless fighter for our constitutional rights. He has spent his life protecting Americans' God-given liberties, and he has always stood by his word. Unlike the status-quo political class in D.C., Ted Cruz didn't cower when he got to Washington – he stood unequivocally for the American people. I know Ted, and he'll do the same as president," said Carly Fiorina.
Fiorina was formerly the CEO of Hewlett Packard (HP) where her successful efforts led to doubling revenues, tripling innovation, and quadrupling growth. Prior to her top position at HP, Fiorina worked her way up at AT&T and eventually was named Head of North American Field Operations at AT&T. She also led the Lucent IPO, the largest IPO in US history at the time.
