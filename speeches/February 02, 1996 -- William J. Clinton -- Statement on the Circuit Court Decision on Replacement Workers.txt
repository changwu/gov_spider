    The right of workers to strike has long been one of America's envied freedoms. Last year, I signed an Executive order prohibiting Federal contractors from permanently replacing workers who exercise their legitimate and historic right to strike.
This Executive order—which furthers the economic and efficient administration of Federal contracts—signals the kind of productive labormanagement relationships that are needed in today's economy.
I regret today's decision by the DC Circuit Court overturning this order. I strongly believe that this Executive order is economically sound, fair, and legal, and accordingly I am instructing my Justice Department to take all appropriate steps to have this decision overturned.
