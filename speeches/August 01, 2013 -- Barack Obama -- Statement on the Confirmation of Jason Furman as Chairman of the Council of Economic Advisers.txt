    For several years - from the very darkest days of the financial crisis to today - Jason has been an essential member of my team working every single day to promote policies to strengthen our economy and help the middle class. From helping craft the Recovery Act that helped prevent a second Great Depression to working with me to pass a tax deal that made permanent tax cuts for middle class families and those working to get in the middle class, Jason has put American families and the strength of the American economy front and center. He's devoted his career to this, and for that I'm very grateful. I look forward to continuing to work with Jason in this very important new role on my team.
