In accordance with section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), you are authorized to consult with the appropriate committees of the Congress concerning refugee admissions as follows:
1. The authorization of 78,000 refugee admissions during FY 1999, which would be allocated by specific region as follows: 12,000 for Africa; 9,000 for East Asia (including Amerasians); 3,000 for Latin America and the Caribbean; 4,000 for the Near East and South Asia; 48,000 for Europe; and 2,000 for the Unallocated Reserve. The recommended level of funded admissions is equal to the level assumed in the FY 1999 budget request.

3. The designation, pursuant to section 101(a)(42)(B) of the INA, of persons in Cuba, Vietnam, and the former Soviet Union, who if they otherwise qualify for admission as refugees, may be considered refugees under the INA even though they are still within their country of nationality or habitual residence.
