In-town pool report 1: Good morning 
Good morning on a characteristically muggy July day in Washington.
The pool has been swabbed for COVID testing and is awaiting a scheduled 9:30 a.m. departure by the President for his trip to Florida.
If you have questions you would like me to shout, feel free to send, and we'll see how many we get in.

In-town pool report 2: Kellyanne gaggle 
Kellyanne Conway gaggled in the driveway for 5 minutes after a TV hit.
Newsiest part was her being asked about talk of a Roger Stone pardon and whether that was a politically smart move.
“I'll let the president make any announcements that he has on any type of pardon or commutation of sentence for anyone,” she said.
As for the politics:“I don't know that most voters are paying attention to that particular issue,” she said, saying it's not what moves people to the ballot box.
(I'm not transcribing the rest because it should be available by C-SPAN and we are gathering for the departure soon. But I can share a recording if anyone else is in desperate need:)
Asked why they are going to Miami today given the rising coronavirus cases and taxed resources, she said it was for two important reasons: Highlighting the results of Operation Surge in combatting drug trafficking, and standing with the Venezuelan people against Maduro. She attacked Biden for joking about Maduro's hair.
Asked if there's a strategy change in the campaign against Biden, she said any changes were Biden's, with a critique of his performance this week. She accused him of “plagiarizing” Bernie Sanders with his unity report and then “plagiarizing” Donald Trump for his economic speech yesterday.

In town pool report 3: Departure Qs 
Trump took two questions
On Biden:
“he plagiarized from me but he can never pull it off”
On Stone: Roger Stone was very unfairly treated and others while Comey is walking around.
More shortly.

In town pool report 3a: Departure contd 
POTUS walked out of the White House at 9:41 am wearing a red tie and navy suit.
He said he was going to Miami and took two questions.
Full quotes to come, but adding that on Stone he said he was still looking at a possible pardon. It was hard to hear so I will likely have to review the TV feed for exact quotes.
Marine One took off at 9:47.
He was accompanied by Kellyanne Conway, Dan Scavino and Robert O'Brien.
A small group of what appeared to be interns, guests and staff were outside watching the departure, taking pictures. Most were not wearing masks, though the pool was.
National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien was spotted briefly chatting with some in the group watching.
Handing over to out of town pool.

In-town pool report 3b: Full departure quotes 
Noting that Trump was not wearing a mask as he walked to the helicopter, and that he stopped at the pool camera specifically to answer questions.
Basically full comments, as always check against transcript:
Said he's going to Miami and Florida today with a lot of “very good stops”
On the tropical storm:“Tropical Storm Fay is probably going to be hitting a place called New Jersey, a good place, pretty soon.”“We are fully prepared … in case it's bad, shouldn't be too bad, but you never know, you never know. But at this moment it's looking like it's going to be hitting New Jersey fairly soon and we are fully prepared.”
On Biden's economic speech:“He plagiarized from me but he can never pull it off. He likes plagiarizing. It's a plan that is very radical left but he says the right things because he's copying what I've done. But the difference is he can't do it, and he knows he's not doing that.”
“He can't do the same because he's raising taxes way too much, he's raising everybody's taxes. He's also putting tremendous amounts of regulations back on, and those two things are two primary reasons that I created the greatest economy we've ever had and now we're creating it again”
On Roger Stone pardon talk:“I'll be looking at it. I think Roger Stone was very unfairly treated, as were many people, and in the meantime Comey and all these guys are walking around, including Biden and Obama, because we caught them spying on my campaign. Who would have believed that one?”
Thanks to TV for the feed.

In-town pool report 4: DACA statement 
>From Judd Deere:
“As the President announced today, he is working on an executive order to establish a merit-based immigration system to further protect U.S. workers. Furthermore, the President has long said he is willing to work with Congress on a negotiated legislative solution to DACA, one that could include citizenship, along with strong border security and permanent merit-based reforms. This does not include amnesty. Unfortunately, Democrats have continually refused these offers as they are opposed to anything other than totally open borders.”



July 10, 202021:34

In-town pool report 5: arrival /lid 
Marine One touched down on the South Lawn at 9:28 p.m.
About a minute later, Trump exited, saluted the Marine and waved at the pool as he walked toward the residence.
He did not respond to a shouted question (repeated a few times) about whether he spoke to Roger Stone tonight.
The President walked into the White House residence at 9:30 p.m.
Travel/photo lid is called.
Good night all. Have a nice weekend.
