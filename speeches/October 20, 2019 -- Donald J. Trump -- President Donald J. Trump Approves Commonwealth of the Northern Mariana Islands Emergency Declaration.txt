    Today, President Donald J. Trump declared that an emergency exists in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and ordered Federal assistance to supplement Commonwealth and local response efforts due to the emergency conditions resulting from Typhoon Bualoi beginning on October 20, 2019, and continuing.
The President's action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, and to provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures, authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act, to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in the municipalities of Rota, Saipan, Tinian, and the Northern Islands.
Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide at its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. Emergency protective measures, limited to direct Federal assistance, will be provided at 75 percent Federal funding.
Pete Gaynor, Acting Administrator, FEMA, Department of Homeland Security, named Teresa Serata as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas.
