    President George W. Bush today announced his intention to nominate Stephen Brauer to be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to Belgium.
"Stephen is a successful business and community leader in St. Louis. His substantial experience with the Belgian people through his work as Honorary Consul of Belgium for Eastern Missouri makes him an excellent choice for ambassador," said the President.
Mr. Brauer is currently Chairman and CEO of Hunter Engineering Company. He has served as the Honorary Consul of Belgium for eastern Missouri since 1993 and is a trustee of Washington University. He has been involved in the St. Louis Area Council of Boy Scouts, the St. Louis Art Museum and the Missouri Botanical Gardens.
