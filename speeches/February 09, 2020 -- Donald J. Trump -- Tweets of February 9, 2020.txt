Can't say I mind the fact that the great people of West Virginia are furious at their puppet Democrat Senator, Joe Manchin. They will never forget his phony vote on the Impeachment Hoax. All he had to do is read the Transcripts, sadly, which he wouldn't understand anyway.....Retweets: 20712Favorites: 93414

...But, just like the people of West Virginia will no longer look at weak & pathetic Joe Manchin the same (I got the Pension Bill approved, Manchin couldn't do it), the wonderful people of Utah will never look at "grandstander" Mitt Romney with anything but contempt & disgust!Retweets: 14026Favorites: 60481

Thank you to everyone for all of the great reviews I have gotten on my State of the Union Speech. It was an immense honor for me to have presented it to you and the citizens of our very strong and wonderful Country!Retweets: 40384Favorites: 263579

Leading also in New Hampshire and most states. The Fake News hates to report this, but you will see on November 3rd. https://t.co/IKPmbOyDZ8Retweets: 12872Favorites: 53849

The Dems are crazed, they will do anything. Honesty & truth don't matter to them. They are badly wounded. Iowa vote count was a disaster for them! https://t.co/HhhazMKEk3Retweets: 15149Favorites: 57630

I grew up in New York City and, over many years, got to watch how GREAT NYC's "Finest" are. Now, because of weak leadership at Governor & Mayor, stand away (water thrown at them) regulations, and lack of support, our wonderful NYC police are under assault. Stop this now!Retweets: 32058Favorites: 131064

DeFace the Nation will tell @LindseyGrahamSC that he must start up Judiciary and not stop until the job is done. Clean up D.C. now, last chance! https://t.co/lKy9u6t7eNRetweets: 10992Favorites: 37814

Romney hurt some very good Republican Senators, and he was wrong about the Impeachment Hoax. No clue! https://t.co/J6rtaZYYxDRetweets: 11821Favorites: 43588

They are really mad at Senator Joe Munchkin in West Virginia. He couldn't understand the Transcripts. Romney could, but didn't want to!Retweets: 18305Favorites: 82272

"They (Conservatives) thought the merits of the Impeachment case were weak, and therefore his (Romney's) judgement is questioned." @MZHemingway @HowardKurtz @FoxNewsRetweets: 12229Favorites: 51284

.@LarrySabato is much better at giving you the answer after everything is finished and the final result is in, than he is at telling you what is going to happen because, in fact, he doesn't have a clue! https://t.co/MDqczWxl8CRetweets: 9850Favorites: 39157

So good to see that Republicans will be winning the Great State of Alabama Senate Seat back, now that lightweight Senator @DougJones cast a partisan vote for the Impeachment Hoax. Thought his boss, Cryin' Chuck, would have forced him to vote against the Hoax. A Do Nothing Stiff!Retweets: 17684Favorites: 72944

FBI Director Christopher Wray just admitted that the FISA Warrants and Survailence of my campaign were illegal. So was the Fake Dossier. THEREFORE, THE WHOLE SCAM INVESTIGATION, THE MUELLER REPORT AND EVERYTHING ELSE FOR THREE YEARS, WAS A FIXED HOAX. WHO PAYS THE PRICE?....Retweets: 57028Favorites: 190369


 February 09, 2020  19:52:34 
....This is the biggest political crime in American History, by far. SIMPLY PUT, THE PARTY IN POWER ILLEGALLY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN, BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE ELECTION, IN ORDER TO CHANGE OR NULLIFY THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION. IT CONTINUED ON WITH THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX. Terrible!Retweets: 34411Favorites: 109349
