    Senator Barack Obama to Attend Kickoff Event in Des Moines
Des Moines, IA -- Today, Saturday, October 13th, thousands of Obama supporters nationwide will go door-to-door to share Senator Obama's vision to turn the page in Iraq during a nationwide "Canvass for Change." In Iowa, participants will gather in cities across the state to build a movement to change the way Washington works and to end the failed policies in Iraq.

These canvasses come less than two weeks after thousands of Obama supporters paid tribute to Senator Obama's judgment opposing the Iraq War in 2002 at Rallies for Change around the country. Participants will urge Iowans to call on Senator Charles Grassley, Congressman Tom Latham, and Congressman Steve King to join Obama's bipartisan coalition to end the war in Iraq and bring our troops home now.
"A grassroots movement across the country is rallying behind Senator Obama who, as the only candidate who opposed the Iraq War five years ago, has the right judgment to end the war in Iraq," said Obama Iowa Communications Director Josh Earnest. "Iowans in 46 communities are taking to the streets to let their neighbors know that together we can protect America and restore our standing in the world by electing Barack Obama as our next Commander-in-Chief."
Below are details on our canvasses across the state followed by Senator Obama's schedule for the rest of the weekend:
