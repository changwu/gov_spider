    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Smith (R) NJ and 15 cosponsors)
The Administration supports reauthorization of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) and commends the International Relations and Judiciary Committees for addressing this important issue. TVPA legislation is aimed at strengthening U.S. efforts to combat trafficking in persons, which America considers both a human rights violation and a transnational crime. H.R. 2620 makes a number of improvements to the TVPA, including facilitating the prosecution of the crime of sex trafficking through jurisdictional improvements to Federal criminal law, authorizing programs to increase public awareness of this problem, and facilitating family reunification with minors who are trafficking victims.
The Administration is committed to abolishing trafficking in persons and has undertaken a number of initiatives to fight trafficking, some of which are similar to initiatives contained in H.R. 2620. Most recently, the President, during his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on September 23, announced a $50 million initiative to support the work of organizations that are rescuing women and children from exploitation and giving them shelter and medical treatment.
Although the Administration has not completed a review of the manager's amendment, we understand that it addresses a number of our concerns with the reported bill. We look forward to continuing to work with Congress to address any remaining issues as the legislation moves forward.
