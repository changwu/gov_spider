Just a few minutes ago at Liberty Park in New Jersey, with my family looking on, I declared my candidacy for President of the United States.
I enter this race with a different perspective than others. I've recently had the honor of serving as U.S. Ambassador to China. That view of America from 10,000 miles away is a picture of liberty, opportunity and justice; people secure in their rights and in love with their freedom, who've done more good for more people than any other nation in history.
Perhaps our strength at home has waned, but that perspective from afar has helped me see a path back to greatness.
This morning I spoke about that new direction. I discussed the tough choices we must make to restore fiscal discipline and reignite our economic engine.
We did these things in Utah when I was governor. We balanced budgets, maintained our AAA bond rating and by many accounts became the best state for business and the best managed state in the nation. You will hear more about my record in Utah and my plan for America in the coming weeks and months.
I spoke today in the shadow of Lady Liberty, our nation's most famous symbol of freedom. It was in that same spot that Ronald Reagan, in a time of great crisis and worry, launched his campaign to restore the promise of America. Three decades later, this nation once again finds itself at a crossroads and in need of a new vision, a new path forward, and new leadership that knows we need more than hope - we need answers.
Please join our effort. Our campaign is different. Our ideas are different. Our results will bring America back to the top.Â
