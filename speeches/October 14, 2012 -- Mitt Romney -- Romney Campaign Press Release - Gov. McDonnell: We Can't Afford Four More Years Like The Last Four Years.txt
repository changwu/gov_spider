GOV. BOB MCDONNELL: "Well, let me first say Joe Biden is authentic. And last week he said two things that are really important. Every independent voter or undecided voter sure remembered. One, that the middle class has been buried during the last four years. Of course, he's been in charge the last four years. Number two, that absolutely Obama and Biden are going to raise your taxes about $2 trillion over the next four years. So what I would say is what we learned about Paul Ryan is he is thoughtful, he understands the budget better than anybody else, and that the top issue facing the country isn't Bain Capital, it isn't Mitt Romney's tax returns, it isn't Big Bird, it's how do we get the greatest country on earth out of debt and back to work. And when you look at 23 million Americans unemployed, $16 trillion in debt, doubling gas prices, no coherent energy strategy, it's clear to me that the Romney-Ryan ticket had the only blueprint to get us out of this mess. We're not going to -- four more years of the same policies is going to get us four more years of the same results."
