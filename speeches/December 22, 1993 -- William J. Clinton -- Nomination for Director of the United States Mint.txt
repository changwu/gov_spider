    The President announced today that he intends to nominate Phillip N. Diehl, until recently the Chief of Staff at the Department of the Treasury, to be the Director of the U.S. Mint.
"As a senior member of Secretary Bentsen's staff, both in the Senate and at the Treasury, and during his service in Texas' State Government, Phil Diehl has distinguished himself as a public servant of high quality," said the President. "He has the skills and experience that it takes to be an effective manager of the U.S. Mint."
