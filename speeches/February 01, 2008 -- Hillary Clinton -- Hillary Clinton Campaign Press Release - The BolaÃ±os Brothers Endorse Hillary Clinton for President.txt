    Rick, Louis, Ben and Bill will travel to New Mexico and Arizona to campaign for Hillary
The Clinton campaign announced today the endorsement of Rick, Louis, Ben and Bill BolaÃ±os, and named them National Co-Chairs of Veterans and Military Retirees for Hillary.
The BolaÃ±os family is the only family in the United States to ever have four brothers serve in Vietnam at the same time. In 1966, Rick BolaÃ±os joined his brothers Louis, Ben, and Bill in volunteering for military service in Vietnam.
"If you want to know what kind of President Hillary will be, just look at what she's done," said Rick BolaÃ±os. "Our next President will inherit the most difficult challenges in our nation's history. And she has the strength and the experience to rebuild America's role in the world beginning her first day in the White House, he added.
"Senator Clinton has been a champion for our troops. She believes that once our soldiers have fulfilled their obligation to our country, our country must fulfill its obligation to them and their families," said Louis BolaÃ±os. "As president I know she'll fight on our behalf to ensure that all the uninsured veterans in this country have access to quality, affordable health care," he added.
Born in Texas to immigrant parents, the brothers were taught from the beginning the importance of service to their country. Each brother joined a different branch of the Armed Forces: Louis, the Navy; Ben, the Marine Corps; Bill, the Army Green Berets; and Rick, the Army. The BolaÃ±os brothers were cited for their patriotism by President Lyndon Johnson, and in 2004, the Texas Legislature passed a resolution honoring their military service and their valiant heroism.
"I'm honored to have the support of BolaÃ±os brothers," said Clinton. "With their help, we will continue to bring our message of change across the country," she added.
