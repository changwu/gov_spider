    Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) announced that his campaign for president has been endorsed by the New Hampshire Veteran Awareness Coalition (VAC).
Paul Roy, Jr., VAC Co-Founder, said: "VAC is proud to endorse Rick Santorum for President. Senator Santorum has shown a true commitment to our men and women in the Armed Forces, both while serving on active duty and veterans. Senator Santorum's work on the Senate Armed Services Committee, his recognition of the threats facing our nation, and his devotion to ensure our nation's veterans receive the care they deserve made him the runaway choice for our endorsement."
Senator Santorum said: "I am honored to receive VAC's endorsement today. As a child I grew up on VA grounds and my parents worked with veterans returning from Vietnam. I saw first-hand the scars our veterans carry with them, a testament to their devotion to our country. To have VAC's support today is a true honor and their vote of confidence today is not something I will take lightly nor forget."
The Veterans Awareness Coalition is a non-partisan organization dedicated to providing veterans and their families with every resource possible to deal with post-war issues and access other fellow veterans in order to create the possibility of successful reintegration and participation in life. VAC aims to provide facilities for veterans and their families to gather without the pressures of conventional therapy centers. Issues targeted by VAC are PTSD, unemployment, homelessness and VA Claims.
