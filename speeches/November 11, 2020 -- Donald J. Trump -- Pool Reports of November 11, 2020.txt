 In-town pool report #1 — tested 
Good morning and happy Veterans Day. Pool has been tested ahead of the scheduled 10:45am departure for Arlington National Cemetery. It's raining steadily, with no end in sight.
The 11:00am "National Day of Observance" wreath laying ceremony is the only public event on POTUS' schedule for today. I'll send an alert on any potential updates as soon as they're received. As always, feel free to reach out to me directly with questions.

 In-town pool report #4 — arrival at Arlington 
Pool arrived at the cemetery at 11:06am. Numerous camera crews filmed the motorcade as it passed, and several pedestrians waved from just inside the gates. Gun/cannon salutes sounded as motorcade drove toward the Tomb.
The rain has slowed to a slight drizzle, and pool has been informed we'll be running out of the vans to setup ahead of the ceremony.

 In-town pool report #5 — in position/ambulance and stretcher 
The rain has picked up again. While pool got into position, an ambulance was brought to the rear of the amphitheater. A man who appeared to have hit his head (the marble is very wet and slick) was escorted off via stretcher. Pool did not recognize the man and is pinging WH for details
Here's the scene as of now: https://twitter.com/tocradio/status/1326559114810552322?s=21
