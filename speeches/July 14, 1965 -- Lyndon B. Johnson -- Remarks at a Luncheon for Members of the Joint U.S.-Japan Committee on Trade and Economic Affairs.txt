    Distinguished guests, gentlemen:
We are deeply grateful for the time that the Ministers of the Cabinet of Japan have given to this visit to our country. We have found our discussions to be both pleasant and productive.
It seems that it is very difficult to avoid some tragedy in meetings of this kind, because I remember almost 20 months ago when members of the American Cabinet were en route to Tokyo for discussions that we first learned of the death of our beloved President John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
A few moments before this luncheon began today, I received word that the great and good man, Adlai Stevenson, had died in London.
Of course, my immediate reaction was to cancel this luncheon meeting. But after talking to some of the members of my own Cabinet and some of his friends, we all realized that Adlai Stevenson would not have had us do any such thing. He would want us to continue, because he was first, and he was foremost, concerned that the works of peace and the works of progress and, most important, the works of understanding, which have prevailed and predominated throughout this meeting, must go on.
So this, then, is our legacy from Adlai Stevenson--a charge to continue the quest for a decent world, for a better world order, for a life for man that is free of war and destruction and the oppression of his spirit.
So, this is our pledge to the memory of this great man who is really, as all of you here know, a true citizen of the world--a pledge to devote our energies and our talents and our resources and our wills to the cause for which he died.
We realize that America lost its foremost advocate and its most eloquent spirit and one of its finest voices for peace in the world. The world of freedom has lost, I think, perhaps its most dedicated champion.
So, I would like to ask each of you to stand with me in a moment of silent tribute to this great lover of peace, this great statesman, Adlai E. Stevenson.
[At this point there was a moment of silence.]
