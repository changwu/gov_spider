    Chicago, IL - "I understand that Japanese Prime Minister Fukuda has offered his resignation today. Japan is our leading ally in Asia and a vibrant democracy. I want to express to the Prime Minister my appreciation, which I believe is shared by the American people, for his leadership on climate change and the support that Japan's Self Defense Forces have offered U.S. operations in Afghanistan. Our alliance with Japan is based on common values and interests, and I look forward to the opportunity to work with Prime Minister Fukuda's successor in the months and years ahead to strengthen and deepen cooperation between our two nations and to create a truly global partnership."
