    Our anthem calls America "the home of the brave." But we don't realize that the lyrics first pose it as a question.
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
It asks, "Will brave win?" Well, it hasn't always. And it isn't right now.
Brave doesn't pit people against each other. Brave doesn't put money over lives. Brave doesn't spread hate. Cloud truth. Build a wall. That's what fear does.
We need to remember what if feels like to be brave. We launched ourselves into space and landed on the moon.
If we can do that, we can definitely achieve universal health care. We can provide paid family leave for all, end gun violence, pass a Green New Deal, get money out of politics and take back our democracy. None of this is impossible.
Americans are brave, everyday: The father risking his job to fight for his family. The mom taking on 6am shifts and 6pm classes. The formerly well-behaved women speaking up. The neighbors linking arms.
They're making a choice. And it's these brave choices that inspire me to take on the fights others won't.
When I voted against the Wall Street bailout while both parties threw billions at the banks, when I took on the Pentagon to end to sexual assault in the military, when I turned a red district blue against all odds, when I challenged Congress by making my meetings, finances and taxes public. So people could see I was working for them.
I took your lead. I chose brave too.
We need a leader who makes big, bold, brave choices. Someone who isn't afraid of progress.
That's why I'm running for president. And it's why I'm asking you for your support.
Our anthem asks a question, forcing every generation to make a choice. Will brave win?
Let's answer for ours.
