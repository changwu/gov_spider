    The President has been advised by Chancellor Schmidt of the measures that the German cabinet will propose to the legislature for 1979 tax cuts and added expenditures totaling 12.2 billion deutsche marks, in order to fulfill the German summit commitment "to propose to the legislative bodies additional and quantitatively substantial measures up to 1 p.c. of GNP, designed to achieve a significant strengthening of demand and higher rate of growth." The President was pleased to learn of these German decisions. They should provide a substantial and welcome impetus to demand and growth.
Building a healthy world economy will be a long process involving many countries; these decisions point us in the right direction. The President believes that the test of the summit is effective followup on its decisions. The German proposals indicate that good progress is being made to this end.
