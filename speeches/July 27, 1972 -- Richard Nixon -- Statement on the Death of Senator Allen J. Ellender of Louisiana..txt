    SENATOR Ellender was a good friend, a fine Senator, and a splendid American. His elevation to the chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee and the presidency pro tem of the Senate capped a long and distinguished career. In the course of his 35 years of service in the Senate, he left a deep imprint on the legislative history of this century--and he proved himself a representative not only of Louisiana but of the Nation, determined to do what he considered was right for America.
I often had the benefit of his counsel, and I valued the opportunity to talk with him before my recent visit to the Soviet Union about his own travels in that country.
Mrs. Nixon joins with me and with his many other official and unofficial friends in expressing our profound sorrow at his death and our sympathy to his family.
