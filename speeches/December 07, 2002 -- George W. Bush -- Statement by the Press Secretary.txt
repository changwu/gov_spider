    The Iraqi regime today submitted to the United Nations Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) what it claims is a declaration of its programs to develop chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, and other delivery systems. A "currently accurate, full and complete declaration" is required by United Nations Security Council resolution 1441. The U.S. Government will analyze this declaration with respect to its credibility and compliance with UNSCR 1441. We will continue to work with other countries to achieve the ultimate goal of protecting the peace by ending Saddam Hussein's pursuit and accumulation of weapons of mass destruction.
