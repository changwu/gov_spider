    To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting herewith the second report to the Congress covering activities through December 31, 1957, in furtherance of the purposes of the Joint Resolution to Promote Peace and Stability in the Middle East. This report supplements the first one forwarded to the Congress on July 31, 1957 concerning activities through June 30, 1957.
The Resolution continues to be an important element in United States foreign policy relating to the Middle East. Communist opposition to it is clearly revealed by the fact that over the past six months Communist propaganda and its adherents in the Middle East have intensified their efforts to distort the purposes of the Resolution and to depreciate the contribution it has made to the creation of more stable conditions in this important part of the world. I am convinced that we must continue to devote major attention in our Middle East policy to assisting the states of the area, on a cooperative basis, in maintaining their independence and integrity. The Resolution forcefully embodies the purpose of promoting these means of achieving international peace and stability in the Middle East.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
