    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Kostmayer (D) PA and 2 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5001 because the bill is unnecessary and duplicative, and could jeopardize existing "river assessment" programs.
H.R. 5001 would require the Secretary of the Interior to develop and update a "State of the Nation's River Systems Report." The Secretary would also be required to establish a central repository for information relating to river and riparian resources. However, the relevant Federal agencies are currently engaged, using existing statutory authority, in maintaining and updating inventories and assessments of river systems throughout the Nation. Given these efforts, there is little justification to impose and overlay yet another river assessment program on these agencies, particularly at a time of severe budget stress.
