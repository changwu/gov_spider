    The President today announced the appointment of five merit selection panels to recommend nominees for United States circuit court judgeships.
The five panels are the first of 13 to be named by President Carter in accordance with an Executive order he signed on February 15. The Executive order calls for one panel for each judicial circuit and two panels each for the geographically large fifth and ninth circuits.
Each panel has 11 members. They will submit, within 60 days, five names from which the President may select a nominee.
The panels announced today will fill one vacancy each in the first and the eastern and western fifth circuits and two vacancies each in the sixth and southern ninth circuits. (The only other current vacancies are in the tenth and fourth circuits.)
Letters have been sent by President Carter to the five panels announced today specifying the States or other areas from which the President wishes the panel to select candidates. The President's choice of States was based on tradition, population, and share of the circuit's workload.
The vacancies for which the panels will recommend nominees, and the areas from which they will choose, are as follows:
In the first circuit, for the vacancy created by the retirement of Edward W. McEntee, candidates to be chosen from New Hampshire and Puerto Rico;
In the eastern fifth circuit, for the vacancy created by the retirement of Walter P. Gewin, candidates to be chosen from Alabama;
In the western fifth circuit, for the vacancy created by the retirement of John Minor Wisdom, candidates to be chosen from Louisiana;
In the sixth circuit, for the vacancy created by the death of William E. Miller, candidates to be chosen from Tennessee; and for the vacancy created by the retirement of Wade H. McCree, candidates to be chosen from Michigan;
In the southern ninth circuit, for the vacancy created by the retirement of Ben C. Duniway, candidates to be chosen from Nevada; and for the vacancy created by the retirement of Richard H. Chambers, candidates to be chosen from Arizona.
