"I commend Governor Pataki for signing the Taxpayer Protection Pledge to the hard working taxpayers of this country," said Grover Norquist, President of Americans for Tax Reform. "Governor Pataki understands that government should be reformed so that it takes and spends less of the taxpayers' money, and will oppose tax increases that paper over and continue the failures of the past."
