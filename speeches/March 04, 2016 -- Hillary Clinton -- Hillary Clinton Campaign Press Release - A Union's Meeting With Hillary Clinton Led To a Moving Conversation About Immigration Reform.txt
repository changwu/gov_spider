In 1965, after years of exploitation and unsafe working conditions, farm workers from across the country came together to organize for immigrant rights, higher wages, Latino rights, and dignity.
The group that came together then is now known as the United Farm Workers. Started and built by C?sar Chavez, Dolores Huerta, and Larry Itliong, the union fights on behalf of the men and women who do some of the most back-breaking labor in the country.
Yesterday, they endorsed Hillary Clinton for president.
But before they did, Hillary met with UFW members to hear directly from them—and a mother shared the very personal reason she's standing with Hillary.



Hillary—who has been a fierce advocate for workers' rights and comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship—thanked her for sharing her story.
Watch the full exchange:


  " I can't wait to get to work for you."—Hillary Clinton
