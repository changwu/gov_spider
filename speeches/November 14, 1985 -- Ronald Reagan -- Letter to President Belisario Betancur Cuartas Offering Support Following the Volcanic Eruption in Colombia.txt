    Dear Mr. President:
I was stunned to learn of the devastation following the eruption of the volcano Nevado Del Ruiz. The loss of life and the destruction have caused sorrow to us all. Our prayers are with you and all those who are working to rescue those who have been affected. Colombia is a great friend and ally of the United States. I want you to know in this hour of need, that we want to work with your government and be of help.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
