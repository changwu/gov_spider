    With the death of Samuel I. Newhouse, this country has lost a dedicated and enterprising publisher whose work in the business of news spanned most of his 84 years.
He was born in a tenement to parents who were immigrants to this country, .but created one of the largest publishing and communications organizations in the United States. He exemplified those qualities which make this country great.
Rosalynn and I extend our sympathies to his wife and the other members of his family.
