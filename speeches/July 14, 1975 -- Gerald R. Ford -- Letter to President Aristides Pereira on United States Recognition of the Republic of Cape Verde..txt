Dear Mr. President:
The American people join me in extending congratulations and best wishes to you and the people of the Republic of Cape Verde on the occasion of your independence. In this regard, I am pleased to inform you that the United States Government extends recognition to Cape Verde.
I am aware of the serious drought which has affected the islands for the past eight years. I know that this situation must be a matter of great concern as your government assumes the responsibilities for the well-being of your people. I am hopeful that the steps already taken by the United States to provide humanitarian aid and technical assistance to Cape Verde will help alleviate the current hardship and provide a base for economic development and future prosperity.
As the historic ties of friendship and cooperation between the peoples of the United States and Cape Verde grow and strengthen, I look forward to the opportunity for our two nations to work together in the cause of peace, freedom and the welfare of mankind.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
