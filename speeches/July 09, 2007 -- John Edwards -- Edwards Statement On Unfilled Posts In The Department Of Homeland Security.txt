    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement about today's Congressional report that the Bush Administration has not filled about 25 percent of the top positions in the Department of Homeland Security.
"Today's Congressional report that the Bush Administration has failed to fill about 25 percent of the top posts at the Department of Homeland Security is very troubling. This report is a stark reminder that we must hold the president accountable for homeland security at every turn. No task is more critical than recruiting and hiring the best people to help keep Americans safe from attack. The president should immediately expedite the staffing of these posts with skilled professionals -- rather than the political cronies he has usually relied on at the expense of competent governance. If he fails to act, Congress should take strong measures to hold the Administration accountable."
