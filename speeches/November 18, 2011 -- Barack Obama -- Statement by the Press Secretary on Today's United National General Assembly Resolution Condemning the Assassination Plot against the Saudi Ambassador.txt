    The United States welcomes today's strong vote by the United Nations General Assembly on a resolution deploring the assassination plot against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to the United States. The widespread support for this resolution, which was co-sponsored by UN members from all regions of the world, sends a strong message to the Iranian government that the international community will not tolerate the targeting of diplomats. We will continue to work closely with our allies and partners around the world to ensure that Iran understands that such outrageous acts only deepen Iran's isolation.
