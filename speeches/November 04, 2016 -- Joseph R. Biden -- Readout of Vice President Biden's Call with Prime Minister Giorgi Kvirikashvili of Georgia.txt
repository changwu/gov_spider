    Vice President Joe Biden spoke today with Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili of Georgia to congratulate him on his party's victory in Georgia's parliamentary elections. The Vice President commended Georgia's democratic leadership in the region. He also reiterated U.S. support for Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders and condemned Russia's ratification of a "treaty" with Abkhazia on setting up a joint armed force. The leaders agreed that Georgian Dream's strong majority imposes a great responsibility on the government to lead inclusively and reach out to all pro-reform forces as it crafts its policies. The Vice President encouraged the Prime Minister to use the election results to continue Georgia's democratic and economic reforms that will further Georgia's integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions.
