    Mitt Romney today announced the support of Ohio Congressman Mike Turner.
"I am honored to have Congressman Turner on my team," said Mitt Romney. "He is a committed public servant who has stood up for fiscal responsibility in Washington while also keeping a watchful eye on our national security. Ohio will be an important state in this upcoming election. I look forward to working with Congressman Turner as I campaign across the country to grow the economy and create jobs."
Announcing his support, Congressman Mike Turner said, "I am proud to support Mitt Romney in his campaign for president. As a businessman, he understands how to get Americans back to work. President Obama's ineffective leadership continues to hurt the prospects of Ohioans and citizens across the country. His failed policies have burdened the next generation with trillions of dollars of debt, and that is a future we simply cannot afford. As his record clearly shows, Mitt Romney is the leader that our economy needs to restore growth, that our party needs to defeat President Obama in 2012, and that our country needs to get back on track."
