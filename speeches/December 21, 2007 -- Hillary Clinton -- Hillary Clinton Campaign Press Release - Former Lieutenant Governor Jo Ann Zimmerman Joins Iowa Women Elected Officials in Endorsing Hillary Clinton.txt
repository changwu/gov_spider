    DES MOINES, IA – Iowans for Hillary today announced the endorsement of former Iowa Lieutenant Governor Jo Ann Zimmerman, the first woman elected as Lieutenant Governor and President of the Senate in the state. In a strong display of momentum, Zimmerman joins over 100 Iowa women elected officials who support Hillary, including former Lieutenant Governor Sally Pederson, former Attorney General Bonnie Campbell, and former Secretary of State Elaine Baxter
"Hillary's bold American Health Choices Plan for universal health care truly speaks to the needs of working Americans," said former Lieutenant Governor Zimmerman. "Her plan will lower costs, maximize flexibility and not leave a single American without coverage. As an agent of change, Hillary Clinton has the experience to make universal health care a reality and I am proud to support her candidacy."
Zimmerman was elected Lieutenant Governor and President of the Senate in 1987 after serving on the Waukee School Board and in the House of Representatives, where she was the first nurse elected to this office. She served in the Iowa State House from 1982 to 1986. A Democrat, she was elected by popular vote to serve alongside Republican Governor Terry Branstad. As a registered nurse, Zimmerman has been a strong advocate for improving Iowa's health care system, and also focuses much of her energy encouraging women to run for public office.
"I admire Lieutenant Governor Zimmerman for her strong advocacy on behalf of women and health care," Clinton said. "I am honored and delighted to have the support of women elected officials in Iowa."
