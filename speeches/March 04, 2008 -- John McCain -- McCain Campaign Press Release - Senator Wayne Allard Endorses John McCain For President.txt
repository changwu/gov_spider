    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced that Senator Wayne Allard (R-CO) has endorsed John McCain for president.
"John McCain is the right person at the right time to lead our nation as commander in chief," said Senator Allard. "The taxpayer will have no better friend in the White House than John McCain. He will use his veto pen to ensure the taxpayer is protected from wasteful pork barrel spending."
John McCain thanked Senator Allard for his support, stating, "I have always been able to count on Wayne's support in cutting pork barrel spending in the Senate and I am honored to have his support in my campaign for president."
Senator Wayne Allard was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990, where he served until being elected to the United States Senate in 1996. As a firm believer that elected officials should be citizen legislators, Senator Allard spends a majority of his time in Colorado. Since 1991, he has conducted more than 700 town meetings across Colorado, while maintaining a better than 99 percent voting record in the Senate. He also has led by example by being the most frugal member of the Colorado delegation and has returned more than $4.2 million in unspent office funds to the U.S. Treasury since being elected to Congress.
