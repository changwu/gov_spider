Larry Kudlow gaggled after Fox News and Fox Business News appearances late in the morning. He talked about a "sea change" in how people perceive China because of COVID 19 and dismay over Hong Kong.

In Town Pool Report #5 
From Judd Deere:
Today, President Donald J. Trump will lead a roundtable discussion with several Americans whose lives were helped, and in some cases saved, by law enforcement. He will also welcome individuals making selfless contributions to support police officers in their communities. Their accounts demonstrate the courageous, live-saving actions law enforcement officers take every day, and underscore the dangerous effect that defunding the police would have on the lives of everyday Americans.
The following individuals are expected to attend:
The White HousePresident Donald J. TrumpVice President Mike PenceWilliam Barr, United States Attorney GeneralBrooke Rollins, Assistant to the President and Director of the Domestic Policy CouncilJa'Ron Smith, Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and Deputy Director of the Office of American InnovationTim Pataki, Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of Public LiaisonWilliam Crozer, Special Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of Intergovernmental Affairs
