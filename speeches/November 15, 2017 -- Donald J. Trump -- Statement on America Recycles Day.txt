    On America Recycles Day, we recognize the importance of minimizing waste by reusing and recycling. Recycling supports American manufacturing and conserves valuable resources, protecting our Nation's economic and environmental health.
Today, on the 20th anniversary of America Recycles Day, we celebrate Americans whose recycling habits help maintain our global leadership and competitiveness. The rate of recycling in the United States has grown from less than 7 percent in 1960 to more than 34 percent in 2014. Still, materials worth $9 billion are thrown away each year. Rather than throwing away valuable resources, we should return them back into our economy, to rebuild our Nation's infrastructure and create innovative new products.
My Administration is committed to expanding our thriving economy by creating better jobs and promoting products made in Americaâ€”recycling supports these efforts. In 2007, recycling and reuse activities accounted for 757,000 American jobs and produced $36.6 billion in wages. By reusing and recycling, individuals and communities across our country can do their part to keep our lands beautiful, while also growing American jobs and strengthening our economy.
Together, we will unleash American manufacturing and inspire even greater American ingenuity.
