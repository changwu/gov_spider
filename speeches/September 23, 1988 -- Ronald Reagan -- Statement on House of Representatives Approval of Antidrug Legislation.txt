    Yesterday the House of Representatives passed the bipartisan Omnibus Drug Initiative Act of 1988 by a vote of 375 to 30. The overwhelming vote in favor of the legislation reflects the strong commitment of the American people to ridding our society of illegal drugs. We urge the Senate to act swiftly on the legislation.
The House bill contains provisions that will strengthen substantially our ability to detect, try, and punish those who are engaged in drug trafficking and related criminal conduct. Under the House bill, drug kingpins and those who are responsible for drug-related deaths will themselves face the death penalty. The bill will also significantly improve the search for truth in the criminal justice system by revising the so-called exclusionary rule that in some circumstances keeps evidence seized in good faith by police officers from being used in court against criminals such as drug offenders. Among the bill's most important provisions are those holding drug users accountable for their drug abuse. The American people have zero tolerance for illegal drugs.
If the Senate will act swiftly on the drug bill, we can enact this year a bill that will give us the tools to achieve the drug-free America we all seek.
