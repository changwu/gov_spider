    The President announced today that he intends to appoint seven administration officials to be Government members of the Board of Governors of the American Red Cross. The seven are:
Secretary of Defense Les Aspin
Export-Import Bank Chairman Kenneth Brody
Secretary of State Warren Christopher
Secretary of Education Richard Riley
Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala
Federal Emergency Management Agency Director James Lee Witt
Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

"I have long admired and sought to support the ongoing work of the American Red Cross to bring aid to those in need both around the world and here in our own communities," said the President. "As I recently saw firsthand during the Midwest flooding this summer, their workers and volunteers are true lifesavers. I am appointing this senior group of officials to serve on their board because I want to be sure that my administration does everything that we can to support the Red Cross' important work."
