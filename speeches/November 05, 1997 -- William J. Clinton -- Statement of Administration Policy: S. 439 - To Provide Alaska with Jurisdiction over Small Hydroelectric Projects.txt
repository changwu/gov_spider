    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Murkowski (R) AK and three others)
The Administration opposes S. 439. The bill would erode the uniformity of the Federal Power Act's licensing process for hydroelectric projects in the United States by allowing individual States to exercise jurisdiction over licensing. This would result in a patchwork of regulatory programs and related environmental review and enforcement requirements, which would impair the Federal Government's ability to adequately protect federally-managed resources.
Although the reported bill is an improvement over the bill as introduced, it would provide a lesser level of protection than current law. It would fail to adequately protect areas of critical environmental concern, as well as Alaska Native lands.
