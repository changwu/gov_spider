    This 2000-page, $1.1 trillion budget deal is a disgusting mess and Republicans got nothing. It's a handout to potential terrorists, illegal immigrants, Planned Parenthood, ObamaCare beneficiaries, lobbyists and liberals. Congress is stabbing the American people in the back, yet some Republicans have the nerve to call it a back massage.
Why would Republicans vote to fund amnesty, Obama's refugee program and the nuclear deal with Iran? Why would Republicans support a $1.6 billion earmark to resettle illegal immigrants and increase funding for the IRS by $250 million? Why would Republicans increase the foreign worker visa program by 400 percent, steal blue collar jobs from Americans, and drive American wages lower than the Dead Sea?
You'd think our government would put Americans first, but Washington is putting Americans last.
