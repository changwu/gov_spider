    Barbara and I are deeply saddened by the death of our friend Sam Walton. It was my honor and privilege to award Sam with the Presidential Medal of Freedom just a month ago. Sam Walton was an American original who embodied the entrepreneurial spirit and epitomized the American dream. His commitment to family and selfless giving to others is an example to us all. Sam Walton will be greatly missed, and our prayers and sincere condolences go out to his wife, Helen, the other members of the Walton family, and the entire Wal-Mart community.
