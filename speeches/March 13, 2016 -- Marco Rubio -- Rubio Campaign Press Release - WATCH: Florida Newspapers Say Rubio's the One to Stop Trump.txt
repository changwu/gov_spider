March 13, 2016
Team Marco released a new video today featuring what Florida papers have been saying about the contrast between Marco and Donald Trump.

There's a reason why the Florida papers are urging Floridians to rally behind Marco to defeat Donald Trump. 
As the Orlando Sentinel noted, Marco is the "last, best hope" for the party to stop Trump:
Florida's March 15 winner-take-all primary could be the last chance for party voters to throw up a roadblock in billionaire businessman Donald Trump's march to the GOP nomination.

Florida, Tuesday's your chance to send a message â€” the choice couldn't be clearer.
