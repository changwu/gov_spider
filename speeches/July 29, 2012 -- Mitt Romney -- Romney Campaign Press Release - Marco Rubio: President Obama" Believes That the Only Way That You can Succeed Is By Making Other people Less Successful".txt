    "[President Obama] believes that the only way that you can succeed is by making other people less successful. He believes that if you are successful at building a business it isn't because you were successful, it's because you got lucky and you owe it to the government and everybody else so you need to share your success."  —Senator Marco Rubio

MARISSA MIKE, KSNV-TV: "It was a homecoming Saturday for rising star in the Republican Party, Florida Senator Marco Rubio — who, by the way, used to live right here in southern Nevada. As News 3's Rob Munoz tells us, Rubio was in town stumping for presidential hopeful Mitt Romney."
SPEAKER: "Put your hands together and welcome Senator Marco Rubio."
ROB MUNOZ, KSNV-TV: "He was back in town at his one-time elementary school now stumping for GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney. Florida Senator Marco Rubio has become a darling of the Republican Party and now he's back in town, this time toeing the party line in Las Vegas."
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: "But our economic liberties are just as important and our economic liberties are real because it's said that you should have the freedom to pursue happiness."
MUNOZ: "A crowd of at least 800 came out to C.C. Ronnow Elementary to hear him stump, and the possible Republican pick for the vice president on the Romney ticket spared no time saying the President does not understand a free enterprise economy."
SEN. RUBIO: "He believes that the only way that you can succeed is by making other people less successful. He believes that if you are successful at building a business it isn't because you were successful, it's because you got lucky and you owe it to the government and everybody else so you need to share your success."
