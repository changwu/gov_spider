    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Sen. Allard (R) Colorado and 18 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports passage of S.J.Res. 40. Marriage has been the foundation of our society and of societies and cultures throughout history -- and it has always been defined as the union between a man and a woman. Yet today a few activist judges and local officials have made an aggressive effort to redefine the fundamental meaning of marriage. Without a constitutional amendment, these judges and local officials can continue to attempt to force States to accept same-sex marriages against the wishes of their own citizens. Such judges could even strike down the Defense of Marriage Act, which was passed by an overwhelming bipartisan margin, and declare that all marriages recognized in one State must be recognized as marriages everywhere else. When some judges insist on redefining the fundamental institution of marriage for their states or the entire country, the only alternative left for the people's voice to be heard is an amendment to the Constitution - the only law a court cannot overturn. The future of marriage in America should be decided through the democratic process, rather than by the court orders of a few. The Administration urges members of the House and Senate to promptly pass, and to send to the States for ratification, an amendment to protect marriage.
