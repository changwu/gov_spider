    Harvey Rosen has served with distinction on the Council of Economic Advisers. He has been a vital and trusted member of my economic team, and his sound counsel helped lay the foundation for economic growth and job creation. I appreciate Harvey's hard work and dedication, and I wish him and Marsha all the best.
