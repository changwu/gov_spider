    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Brown (D) California and 3 others)
The Administration opposes H.R. 3795, which would create a third court location, the Eastern Division, for the Central Judicial District of California. Another judicial division is not needed in the District. The benefits to the residents closest to the new location would not outweigh its costs. The District already has enough courtrooms.
