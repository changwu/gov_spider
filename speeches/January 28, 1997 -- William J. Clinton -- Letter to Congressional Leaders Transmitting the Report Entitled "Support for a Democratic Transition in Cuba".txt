    Dear Mr. Chairman:
Pursuant to section 202(g) of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-114), I hereby transmit to you a report concerning assistance to a free and independent Cuba, entitled "Support for a Democratic Transition in Cuba."
The report includes an addendum of indicative roles for various agencies of the United States Government. This is for internal United States Government use and is not intended for publication. The remainder of the report will be translated into Spanish to be communicated to the Cuban people pursuant to section 202(f) of the Act.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
