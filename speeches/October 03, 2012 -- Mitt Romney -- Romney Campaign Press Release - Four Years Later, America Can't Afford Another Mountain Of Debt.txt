President Obama's failed policies have added over $5 trillion in new debt and run up four straight trillion-dollar deficits — and he's promising trillions in new debt if he's re-elected. Mitt Romney will implement immediate spending cuts and put our debt on a sustainable course to stop passing our bills on to the next generation." — Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
