SGOTUS Pool Report #1 MA 
Pool report 1: Greetings from Milford, Mass. It is 11:40 a.m. and the Second Gentleman has arrived with Rep. Jake Auchincloss at Mother Hubbard Pre-School Center.
They are greeted by Dorothy Vecchiolla, who founded the preschool in 1961, and Pamelia White, the center's director of 40 years. The preschool provides care for 50 three- and four-year-olds and 18 toddlers and infants, and still occupies its original building.
After introductions the Second Gentleman will read The Very Hungry Caterpillar (by longtime Massachusetts resident and author Eric Carle) to a group of kids and then serve lunch.

SGOTUS Pool Report #2 MA 
Pool report 2: Second Gentlemen reads The Very Hungry Caterpillar, by Massachusetts' own Eric Carle. He introduces himself, saying "I'm married to the Vice President of the United States, and her name is Kamala Harris. And my name is Doug." During the reading, kids respond to the SG, finishing some lines of the book with "â€¦But he was still hungry!"
Afterward the kids show the SG some of the arts and crafts around the classroom. One young boy's Patriots sweatshirt elicits a "Good game yesterday" from the SG. On to lunch.
