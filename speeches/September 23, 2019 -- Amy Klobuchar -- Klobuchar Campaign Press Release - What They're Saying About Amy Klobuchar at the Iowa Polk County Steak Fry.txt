    'All Beer, No Foam': Klobuchar Impresses at Steak Fry
DES MOINES, IA — Team Amy for Iowa was out before dawn - some even camped out the night before - to get ready for U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar's visit to the Polk County Democrats' Steak Fry. Klobuchar, along with Iowa Campaign Chair Dr. Andy McGuire, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and U.S. Senator Tina Smith, rallied supporters and spoke to a crowd of thousands about her optimistic economic agenda and her plan to defeat Donald Trump in 2020.
Klobuchar also opened two more field offices during her latest swing through the Hawkeye state, spoke at the LGBTQ+ forum in Cedar Rapids, toured Southeastern Community College in Burlington, and visited her 49th county since announcing her candidacy for president.
Iowa Starting Line:• Hammers sounded as members of Amy Klobuchar's staff placed rows and rows of staked blue 'Amy' signs around their campsite. The senator had been traveling around the country this week on a 'blue wall' tour to win back states like Michigan and Wisconsin that went red in the 2016 election, so Klobuchar's Steak Fry decoration was, in fact, a 'blue wall' that compiled signs helped create.
• While most of Klobuchar's staff created the wall at the campsite, other supporters roamed the Steak Fry grounds. "It's time. It's time. It's time for a woman in the White House," Klobuchar's staff and supporters chanted as the picketed around, also chanting "I believe that she will win," and "Amy for America," among other phrases.
• The campsite steadily filled as supporters anticipated Klobuchar's arrival and speeches from Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith during the senator's pre-rally.
Des Moines Register• ...Lizzo and Prince blared through the speakers at a gathering for U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.
• Klobuchar was applauded for going after Trump. "We have a guy that would rather lie than lead," she said. "... He gloats about an economy he didn't create ... then, when anything goes wrong from his own making — from his trade war, from his ethanol waivers, from how he handles the farm economy — what does he do? He whines."
Storm Lake Times• Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who is rising in the polls, understands Iowa better than anyone, is a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and is gaining traction in surveys. Klobuchar spoke outside to a sizable crowd on a scorching day in Storm Lake during State Fair Week, and many walked away impressed with her wit, understanding of the issues, and pragmatism. The polls are starting to reflect her appeal to voters who understand that the next election, like the last one, was decided in Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan — all states that Klobuchar can win handily.
Burlington Hawk Eye• Klobuchar... listened more than spoke and, unlike a number of prominent politicians, never interrupted, giving her undistracted attention to each speaker.
• As Klobuchar prepared to move on to the next stop on her Burlington tour, the dedication of the opening of a Klobuchar field office on Roosevelt Avenue in Burlington, the candidate told the students she loved their stories. "This is one of the best meetings I've had," she said. "Your stories show that not just the people with money have opportunities."
• "She's very engaging," [Southeastern Community College's Director of PACE/GAP Programs Jared] Reed said afterward. The students polled by The Hawk Eye all agreed with Reed.
