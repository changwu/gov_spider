    To those who actually believe Obama's idea of gun control is something that could keep us safer, I have --- at the risk of sounding like Clint Eastwood --- one question:
Do you feel lucky?
Do you feel lucky when Obama's deadly combination of loose immigration and tight limitations on self-defense makes violence more likely?
Do you feel lucky when Obama takes aim at law abiding gun owners, guns & the Second Amendment rather than the real problems: mental health, open borders, homeland terrorism, and the breakdown of families and communities?
Do you feel lucky when you know that gun laws apply only to the ones who abide by the law already and NOT criminals who couldn't care less?
Do you feel lucky when Obama insists on dividing Americans into two groups: 1) the powerful gun lobby, and 2) the rest of us, presumably on his side? Plenty of us are just law-abiding citizens who don't agree with him and who would like to be able defend our homes and family and exercise the Constitutional right of owning a gun.
Do you feel lucky when Obama says it's "insane" that people on the no-fly list can buy guns, when we know the problem is with the mistake-ridden no-fly list?
Do you feel lucky when California has in place the kind of gun control provisions Obama wants in every state, yet they failed to stop terrorism in San Bernardino?
So, do you feel lucky? With Obama still in the White House, terrorism is growingâ€¦and we need all the guns we can get. We can't stop him from using executive orders during his waning presidency to implement his futile ideas, but we can, figuratively speaking, give those ideas both barrels, shoot them full of holes and, with the next election, stop them in their tracks and attack the problem of gun violence in a way that makes sense.
