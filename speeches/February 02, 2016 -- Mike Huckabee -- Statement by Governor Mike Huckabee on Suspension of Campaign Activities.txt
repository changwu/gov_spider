    Dear loyal friends and supporters:
We live in the greatest country on earth and I ran for President because I wanted to make it better for my 5 grandkids. I have no regrets about the effort because it's never our responsibility to determine the results, but to be faithful to the task before us. I have suspended my campaign, but not my desire to see America protect all human life, reward those who work hard, and give our veterans and seniors what they have paid the price to earn.
I am blessed with an incredibly supportive wife and family who never wavered in their confidence in me. Our campaign staff was amazingâ€”they gave it their all with competence, compassion, and a spirit of teamwork that I will forever cherish. Our effort didn't fall short due to lack of effort and expertise from our team. And our volunteers every day were stunning and beyond belief in their efforts. On days when I was exhausted and getting hammered by polls, idiotic media questions, or long car rides, I would read a post on FB from one of our supporters or get a letter from a donor that gave me fresh energy and determination.
While I truly wish the results were different, I would rather lose with honor than win without it. Thank you so much for your prayers, your sacrifices of time and money, and your tireless efforts for our campaign.
Rumors abound that I'm getting ready to endorse someone, but those rumors are totally untrue. While I may eventually support one of the candidates, right now I have a lot of things to do in wrapping up the loose ends of the campaign, trying to figure out my next chapter of life, and spending some time with my dogs who probably wonder if I had abandoned them. (I haven't!)
I love you guys, and want to stay in touch. I am eternally grateful for you!
With gratitude and great respect,
Mike Huckabee
