LAKE JACKSON, Texas — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul easily won an Arizona state Republican Party straw poll, besting his rivals in a presidential preference survey. Paul won first place garnering 256 votes, or 85 percent of the 301 votes cast.
The 12-term Congressman from Texas's nearest competitor Newt Gingrich placed a distant second with 6.6 percent, or just 20 votes, and Mitt Romney placed third with 5.6 percent, earning a mere 17 votes. For his part, Rick Santorum fared poorly in fourth with 2.6 percent, attracting eight lonely votes.
Voting was required to be done in person at the Arizona GOP straw poll on January 28th at the party's 2012 State Mandatory Meeting, though electronic receipts were available for use a proxy votes by fellow GOPers representing those unable to cast in-person votes. Straw poll ballots were available for purchase for $10. The Arizona Republican Party's State Mandatory Meetings are held once a year. State Committeemen, of which there are about 1,000, from all over the state assemble to attend to official party business.
"Straw poll victories like the Arizona blowout today are commonplace because more Republicans are viewing Ron Paul as the only authentic conservative vying for the nomination. These contests demonstrate organizational strength, growing support, and the realization that we have entered a lengthy 50-state campaign," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton.
The Arizona primary will be held on Tuesday, February 28th. Early voting for the Grand Canyon State will commence on Thursday, February 2nd, days after the Florida primary and days before the first-in-the-west Nevada caucus.
