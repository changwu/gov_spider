Situation in the Middle East/Visit to Harley-Davidson
Q. Sir, there were some comments on the Sunday chat shows yesterday that you're disconnected in the Middle East peace process. Do you have any response to that?
The President. Every time I talk to you all, you ask me about the Middle East. Nothing has changed. We're very much engaged, trying to break the cycle of violence. I spoke to Ariel Sharon the other day. The Secretary of State is in constant dialog with the parties in the Middle East. In order to get to a peace process or discussions of peace, we must end the violence, and it requires two parties. It requires the desires of both parties to do that.
Thank you. Anything else?
It's great to be here in one of the worldclass manufacturing companies, a company that not only is good at making a product, a company that is fabulous at marketing a product. The Harley-Davidson is a great example of the American entrepreneurial spirit. I look forward to having lunch with the workers and thank them for putting out such a quality product.
