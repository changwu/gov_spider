    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of New Jersey Congressman Albio Sires.
"I've seen firsthand Hillary Clinton's tireless efforts to help the people of New York affected by the attacks of 9/11," Sires said. "It's just one example of her strength and leadership that make her uniquely suited to be President."
Sires was elected to Congress in 2006 after serving as the first Hispanic Speaker of New Jersey's General Assembly from 2002-2006.
As Speaker, Sires was instrumental in raising the state minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.15 and creating college tuition scholarships for thousands of students. He also led the fight to increase funding for public education by $760 million and establish new standards for homeland security measures and emergency preparedness.
Sires also served 12 years as mayor of West New York, creating more affordable housing units than any other municipality in Hudson County by fostering public-private partnerships and the use of targeted tax incentives. Mayor Sires earned the "Community That Works" award from the State of New Jersey for his efforts at "providing innovative and cost-effective services through regionalization."
"Congressman Sires has been a tireless advocate of initiatives that make a real difference in the lives of working families, like increasing the minimum wage and building more affordable housing," Clinton said. "I am honored to have his support, and I look forward to working together as we take our message of change across the nation."
