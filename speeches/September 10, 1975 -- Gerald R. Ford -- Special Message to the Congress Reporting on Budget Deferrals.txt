    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report three new deferrals totalling $50.3 million in 1976 budget authority. In addition, I am transmitting two supplementary reports revising information provided in earlier deferrals. Only one of these supplementary reports reflects an increase-$19.2 million--to the amount of outlays previously deferred. The five reports involve the Departments of Agriculture, Treasury, and Health, Education, and Welfare.
All of the items contained in this message are routine in nature and do not significantly affect program levels. The details of each deferral are contained in the attached reports.
GERALD R. FORD
THE WHITE HOUSE,
September 10, 1975.
