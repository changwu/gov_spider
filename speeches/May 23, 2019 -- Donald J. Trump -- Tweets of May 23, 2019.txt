In a letter to her House colleagues Nancy Pelosi said: 'President Trump had a temper tantrum for us all to see.' This is not true. I was purposely very polite and calm much as I was minutes later with the press in the Rose Garden. Can be easily proven. It is all such a lie!Retweets: 29371Favorites: 131386

Zero is getting done with the Democrats in charge of the House. All they want to do is put the Mueller Report behind them and start all over again. No Do-Overs!Retweets: 20937Favorites: 89597

Democrats don't want to fix the loopholes at the Border. They don't want to do anything. Open Borders and crime!Retweets: 18829Favorites: 75099

The Democrats are getting nothing done in Congress. All of their effort is about a Re-Do of the Mueller Report which didn't turn out the way they wanted. It is not possible for them to investigate and legislate at the same time. Their heart is not into Infrastructure lower.....Retweets: 21730Favorites: 95999

....drug prices pre-existing conditions and our great Vets. All they are geared up to do six committees is squander time day after day trying to find anything which will be bad for me. A pure fishing expedition like this never happened before & it should never happen again!Retweets: 18454Favorites: 84466

Rex Tillerson a man who is 'dumb as a rock' and totally ill prepared and ill equipped to be Secretary of State made up a story (he got fired) that I was out-prepared by Vladimir Putin at a meeting in Hamburg Germany. I don't think Putin would agree. Look how the U.S. is doing!Retweets: 16815Favorites: 76268

I was extremely calm yesterday with my meeting with Pelosi and Schumer knowing that they would say I was raging which they always do along with their partner the Fake News Media. Well so many stories about the meeting use the Rage narrative anyway - Fake & Corrupt Press!Retweets: 24863Favorites: 105446

When the Democrats in Congress refinish for the 5th time their Fake work on their very disappointing Mueller Report finding they will have the time to get the REAL work of the people done. Move quickly!Retweets: 18712Favorites: 78424
