Here's what Marco had to say in his moving closing statement:
As we near the end of this year, we enter one of the most important elections in a generation. For what's at stake in this election is not simply what party's going to be in charge, but our very identity as a people and as a nation.
For over 200 years this has been a special country — unique place where anyone from anywhere can achieve anything. But now millions of Americans feel like they're being left behind, insecure in their future and unsafe in the face of terrorism. This election is about electing a president that will restore our economic vibrancy so that the American Dream can expand to reach more people and change more lives than ever before, and rebuild our Military and our intelligence programs so that we can remain the strongest nation on earth.
Tonight I ask you for your vote.
If you do this, we will rebuild this country, and together we will usher in a new American century — the greatest era in the history of this great land.
