Fair Trade is now to be called Fool Trade if it is not Reciprocal. According to a Canada release they make almost 100 Billion Dollars in Trade with U.S. (guess they were bragging and got caught!). Minimum is 17B. Tax Dairy from us at 270%. Then Justin acts hurt when called out!Retweets: 26861Favorites: 105242

Why should I as President of the United States allow countries to continue to make Massive Trade Surpluses as they have for decades while our Farmers Workers & Taxpayers have such a big and unfair price to pay? Not fair to the PEOPLE of America! $800 Billion Trade Deficit...Retweets: 33611Favorites: 142661

....And add to that the fact that the U.S. pays close to the entire cost of NATO-protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on Trade (they pay only a fraction of the cost-and laugh!). The European Union had a $151 Billion Surplus-should pay much more for Military!Retweets: 25234Favorites: 105194

....Germany pays 1% (slowly) of GDP towards NATO while we pay 4% of a MUCH larger GDP. Does anybody believe that makes sense? We protect Europe (which is good) at great financial loss and then get unfairly clobbered on Trade. Change is coming!Retweets: 33307Favorites: 139303

Meetings between staffs and representatives are going well and quickly....but in the end that doesn't matter. We will all know soon whether or not a real deal unlike those of the past can happen!Retweets: 21180Favorites: 105025

Stock Market up almost 40% since the Election with 7 Trillion Dollars of U.S. value built throughout the economy. Lowest unemployment rate in many decades with Black & Hispanic unemployment lowest in History and Female unemployment lowest in 21 years. Highest confidence ever!Retweets: 32153Favorites: 139239

The fact that I am having a meeting is a major loss for the U.S. say the haters & losers. We have our hostages testing research and all missle launches have stoped and these pundits who have called me wrong from the beginning have nothing else they can say! We will be fine!Retweets: 33959Favorites: 150303
