    President Donald J. Trump called President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan to convey his deepest condolences to the families and friends of those killed and injured in the murderous attack that took place this morning near the diplomatic zone in Kabul.
He condemned the attack, which occurred during the holy month of Ramadan, underscoring the barbaric nature of the terrorists who are enemies of all civilized peoples. President Trump commended the bravery of Afghan first responders, who worked quickly to support the wounded.
He also commended Afghan security forces for their steadfast efforts to defend the Afghan people from enemies who would seek to deny them the security and prosperity they so richly deserve. The United States Embassy is working with our Afghan and Coalition partners to assist the victims and help the National Unity Government pursue those responsible for this criminal attack.
