  A Proclamation

Despite substantial educational and labeling efforts, the problem of accidental poisoning—particularly among children—still remains a matter of public concern.
Efforts by private and public groups, and voluntary actions on the part of manufacturers, have contributed to a continuing and encouraging decrease in accidental poisoning tragedies.
Our progress should intensify with the special packaging required under the provisions of the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970.
But, as of today, the incidents of accidental poisonings are still higher than any advanced society should permit. The natural curiosity of children, and their inclination to taste whatever they can reach, is not easily circumvented by safety measures.
The general dangers involved were recognized by a joint resolution approved September 26, 1961 (75 Stat. 681), in which the Congress requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating the third week in March as National Poison Prevention Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning March 19, 1972 as National Poison Prevention Week.
I direct all appropriate agencies of the Federal Government to participate actively on programs designed to promote maximum protection of our people against accidental poisonings, particularly our children. Further, I invite all State and local governments and private organizations and individuals to share in this national effort.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.

RICHARD NIXON
