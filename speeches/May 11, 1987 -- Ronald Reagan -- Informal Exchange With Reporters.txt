    Reporter. Mr. President, have you heard any of McFarlane's testimony today?
The President. No, and I'm not going to make any comments, Helen [Helen Thomas, United Press International]â€”
Q. Well, we want to be sure that you're denying that there was any solicitation that you knew of by the White House of countries or individuals.
The President. Helen, as I say, I can't get into taking questions on that. We're here on a matter of the debt ceiling. It's all important. And I have made answers to those particular questions over and over again and I still stick with them.
Q. Sir, do you think that Mr. Meese should stay on the job while an independent counsel investigates him?
The President. I've issued a statement on that matter with regard to my trust and confidence in him.
Q. How did you like the Vice President's speech on ethics and morality?
The President. I like anything he does. [Laughter]
The Vice President. Get that down, Helen. [Laughter]
Q. It's all down here. It will enhance my story. [Laughter]
