    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Souder (R) Indiana and 12 others)
The Administration supports the preservation of historic lighthouses and the goals of H.R. 4613. Although the Administration does not object to House passage of H.R. 4613, there are concerns with this bill.
H.R. 4613 could result in the conveyance of either: (1) the land surrounding a historic lighthouse that, under current law, should be transferred to another federal agency; or (2) a lighthouse that should remain under the jurisdiction of the United States. The Administration, therefore, urges Congress to take up S. 2805, an Administration proposal that would accomplish the objectives of H.R. 4613 within the statutory framework of the Property Act and address these concerns. In addition, S. 2805 would preserve the current statutory framework that provides for the conveyance of lighthouses on National Forest System lands and the right of other federal agencies to obtain these properties if needed for federal purposes.
