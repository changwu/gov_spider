    Memorandum for the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Interior, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Transportation, the Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission, the Administrator, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Director, National Science Foundation, the Administrator, Agency for International Development
On several occasions I have pledged the full participation of the United States in the development of a World Weather Watch in cooperation with other nations of the world.
This program, sponsored by the World Meteorological Organization, constitutes one of the largest and most complex scientific and technological undertakings ever attempted as an international effort.
Now the Congress, through Senate Concurrent Resolution 67, approved on May 29, 1968,1 has expressed its support for this program and has urged me to cooperate with other nations in it. This action by the Congress is important and timely.
The time has come to pursue a vigorous international effort to broaden man's knowledge of the science of meteorology to:
--provide a better understanding of the global atmosphere,
--provide earlier and better warnings of severe storms, and other weather hazards,
--further the safety and efficiency of air and sea travel in all parts of the globe,
--benefit industry, commerce and agriculture, and
--improve land and water management.
In accordance with the Concurrent Resolution, I am asking the Secretary of Commerce to continue to coordinate our national efforts in this program by:
--providing a forum for consultation and coordination among the interested Federal departments and agencies and with the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering.
--developing annually in cooperation with the participating agencies a coordinated plan setting forth the proposed participation by Federal agencies in the World Weather Program for the following fiscal year. This plan should be prepared in time to permit its submission to the Congress by March 1 of each year.
The World Weather Program will require extensive collaboration among the nations of the world. Its benefits will flow to the people of all nations. I am therefore asking the Secretary of State to promote, with the assistance of the participating agencies, the development of appropriate bilateral and multilateral arrangements to further international participation and cooperation in this program.
The success of this program will depend on the creative efforts of each of the participating agencies. I call upon them to cooperate fully with the Secretaries of Commerce and State in this important work.
