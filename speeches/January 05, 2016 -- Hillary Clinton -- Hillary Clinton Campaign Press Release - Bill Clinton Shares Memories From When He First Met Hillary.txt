When President Clinton hit the trail to campaign for Hillary for the first time, he shared memories from when he and Hillary first met, almost 45 years ago.
The two met for the first time while attending Yale Law School. "Unlike now," he said, "where more than half the law students in America are women, then they were a distinct minority." 
"And there she was at Yale Law School. She could have written her ticket to go anywhere she wanted ..." 
"When we got out, she could have gone to work at a big law firm, get a fancy clerkship," President Clinton said. But instead of taking a high-paying legal job, Hillary went to work for the most vulnerable communities. 
"There was a nice story in the press you may have seen in the last several days, talking about a trip she took to Alabama to see if these so-called tax exempt private schools were really just segregation academies and therefore not entitled to the tax exemption.
"I valued even more a trip she took to South Carolina to see why so many African American children were being held in adult prisons. It's hard to remember 40 years ago what things were like."   
For more than four decades, President Clinton has seen Hillary fight for these things. And this is what she'll fight for as president.
