    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Collins (D) IL and Weiss (D) NY)
The Administration opposes H.R. 4784 because it only transfers jurisdiction of the building (which is being used as a shelter for the homeless) at 425 Second Street, Northwest, Washington, D.C. to the District of Columbia. The Administration urges prompt House passage of the Senate-passed Administration proposal, S. 2251, which would transfer ownership of the building to the District of Columbia. S. 2251 would carry out the agreement between the Administration, the District of Columbia, and the Community for Creative Non-Violence.
