    Rosalynn and I send special greetings and good wishes to those of our fellow citizens who join us in the joyous celebration of Christmas.
Together let us thank God for all the blessings He has given us and ask Him to sustain and strengthen us as individuals and as a nation. Let us also offer our prayers for those who live where there is strife, hunger, persecution, or injustice. May the year ahead be better for them and for their families and loved ones.
We hope that this holiday season will be a very happy and satisfying one for all Americans and that 1981 will bring us closer to the realization of our hopes and dreams.
