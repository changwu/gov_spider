    On August 24, 2017, President Donald J. Trump met with General Zulkifeli bin Muhammad Zin, Director General of the Malaysian National Security Council, accompanied by Malaysia's Ambassador to the United States, Zulhasnan Rafique, and expressed the gratitude of the United States for the Malaysian Coast Guard, Royal Malaysian Navy, and Royal Malaysian Air Force's help in recovering the fallen United States sailors of the USS John S. McCain. The President also told General Zulkifeli that he looks forward to welcoming Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak to the White House on September 12. General Zulkifeli was in Washington, D.C., to meet with Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs LTG H.R. McMaster. Noting the 60th anniversary of United States-Malaysia relations, LTG McMaster and General Zulkifeli discussed ways to strengthen bilateral ties, particularly in trade and investment, as well as defense and security cooperation. A stronger partnership in these areas will help the two countries address shared challenges and promote regional peace and stability, including the fight to defeat ISIS and other extremist networks.
