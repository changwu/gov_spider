    Pennsylvania Congressman Jim Gerlach and former Pennsylvania GOP Chairman, Alan Novak, both Mitt Romney supporters, made statements on President Obama's visit to Scranton, Pennsylvania today.
"Three years after President Obama promised to turn around the economy, it is clear that his policies have not worked for Pennsylvania or the rest of the country," said Congressman Gerlach. "Unemployment remains much higher than when he took office and the policies President Obama is pushing will not alleviate the problem. Mitt Romney has laid out bold conservative solutions to our economic troubles that can be implemented his first day in office so that we can finally start revitalizing the economy. That is why I support him and why Pennsylvanians will support him next November."
Former Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Alan Novak said, "As President Obama brings his failed policy prescriptions to Pennsylvania, voters should be reminded of the promises he made three years ago to turn around the economy. Clearly, that has not happened. Mitt Romney has the economic knowledge and plan to reverse the failures of the last three years. Unlike our current president, Mitt Romney has the track record of turning around troubled enterprises and he will do exactly that as president."
