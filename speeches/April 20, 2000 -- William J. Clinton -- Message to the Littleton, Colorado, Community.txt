    It is written in Scripture: "Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted." Hillary and I are with you in the spirit of comfort and prayer as you gather to remember those who lost their lives one year ago today.
You do not mourn alone. What happened in Littleton pierced the soul of America. Though a year has passed, time has not dimmed our memory or softened our grief at the loss of so many, whose lives were cut off in the promise of youth. It has not caused us to forget their gallant teacher—a man whose character and values brought so much strength to the school, sports teams, and community he served.
Last year, in the midst of the heartbreak and devastation of the Columbine tragedy, we saw the American spirit at its best—in the spontaneous outpouring of support for the Littleton community and in the determination to prevent such tragedies in the future. Our hearts have not yet fully healed, but today America stands together as one to keep faith with all those who lost their lives at Columbine—and all those whose lives were forever changed that day. We must continue to honor their memory and your courage by resolving to make America a safer place for all our children.
Hillary and I continue to keep all of you in our thoughts and prayers.
BILL CLINTON
