    AMERICAN journalism has lost one of its most distinguished figures today with the death of Orvil Dryfoos, publisher of the New York Times. That great newspaper has suffered a serious loss. Mr. Dryfoos will be sorely missed by those who knew and admired his integrity, courage, and his devotion to journalistic truth.
