    Hello, everybody! Well, I just wanted to let everybody know, it's good to be back in New Hampshire! It is a spectacular night. It's almost like summer in New Hampshire here.
And look, I'm mainly here to say thank you. The first time I came to New Hampshire, I didn't have any gray hair. [Laughter] Now I do. But I tell you, because of the incredible people here, the way that you guys have lifted up Michelle and me—and not to mention Malia and Sasha when they've been in camp up here—you guys have always taken good care of us.
I just have one more favor to ask you. Make sure that the person who succeeds me is somebody who shares the values that all of you express in your daily lives every single day—somebody who cares about the environment, somebody who cares about our kids, someone who respects all people. And we've got the chance not only to elect an outstanding President in Hillary Clinton, but we also have the chance to elect an outstanding U.S. Senator in your Governor, Maggie Hassan.
So I just want everybody—you've only got 1 more day left, which all comes down to how hard we work. If you took the time to come down here and say hi to me, I know you've got to time tomorrow to knock on some doors and make some phone calls. All right?
