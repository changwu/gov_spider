    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Bosco (D) California and two others)
The Administration supports the authorization of appropriations of $30 million over fiscal years 1991 and 1992 for rehabilitation and deferred maintenance of the Kennedy Center. However, the Administration strongly opposes the provision of H.R. 5070 which requires that the Secretary of the Interior provide all services necessary for the operation of the building. Currently, the Secretary is responsible only for services necessary to the nonperforming arts functions of the Center.
Accordingly, the Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 5070, but will seek an amendment in the Senate to limit the Services provided by the Secretary to those needed for nonperforming arts functions.
