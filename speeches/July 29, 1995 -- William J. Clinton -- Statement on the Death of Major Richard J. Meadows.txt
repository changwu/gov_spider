    I mourn the passing today of Major Richard J. Meadows, USA (Ret.), whose dedicated and exceptional service is cherished by everyone who knew of his extraordinary courage and selfless service.
I recently had asked General Wayne Downing, the commander-in-chief of the U.S. Special Operations Command, to present the Presidential Citizens Medal to Major Meadows. I am gratified to know that Major Meadows' wife, Pamela; his son, Mark, a U.S. Army captain; and daughter, Michele, will receive this award tonight at a gathering of those involved in the Sontay raid at Hurlburt Field. Although this will now be a posthumous honor, I am pleased that Major Meadows knew of this honor before he died.
To Major Meadows' family and friends and to the Special Operations community, I extend my heartfelt condolences. We will all remember him as a soldier's soldier and one of America's finest unsung heroes.
