    Jill and I are keeping all families affected by the wildfires in Colorado in our thoughts and prayers. We are deeply saddened to hear about the damage that has been done and the families who are being forced to evacuate their homes amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We thank the brave firefighters and first responders who are putting their lives on the line to protect Colorado families and contain these devastating wildfires. To all who live in an affected region, please follow guidance and safety precautions from your local officials.
