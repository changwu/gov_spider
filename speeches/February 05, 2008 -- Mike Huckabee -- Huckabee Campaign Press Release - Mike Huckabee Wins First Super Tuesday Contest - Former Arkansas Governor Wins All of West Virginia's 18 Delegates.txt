    Little Rock, AR â€“ Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee decisively won the first victory of Super Tuesday 2008 by winning West Virginia's 18 at-large delegates this afternoon.
Earlier today, Huckabee spoke at the West Virginia Republican Convention, emphasizing his positive message of family, life, and freedom which he said "triumphed in the Mountaineer State" and will continue to resonate in numerous Super Tuesday states, from Alabama to Alaska.
"Two days ago, the New York Giants pulled off the greatest upset in Super Bowl history. Today, as pundits write my political obituary, we won a key Super Tuesday victory. Time and time again, my campaign has defied conventional wisdom. We did so in Iowa, after being outspent 20:1, and we did so today by winning what I hope will be the first of many Super Tuesday victories."
"Our campaign is testament that the American dream is alive and well," said Huckabee. "Running for President isn't about who spends the most money or who has the most support on Wall Street or on K Street. If that was the case, the nomination picture would look vastly different.
"This victory was a triumph of Main Street, sending a message that becoming President of the Unites States is about message not money, principles not politics, and courage not convenience. Luckily for America, in places like Iowa and West Virginia, voters lead example and do the right thing regardless of what the pundits might say," said Huckabee.
