    Romney Campaign Economic Adviser Glenn Hubbard today made the following statement on the October unemployment report:
"Over the last four years, President Obama has consistently pressed for higher taxes, more burdensome regulations, and more borrowing, which has given us the most anemic recovery since the Great Depression. Today's unemployment numbers only further underscore the fact that President Obama has failed to fulfill his promise to restore the strength of our economy. To achieve that, we need to elect Mitt Romney, who will reform our tax code to encourage job creation, and roll back Obama-era regulations that have stifled growth. With Mitt Romney as president, the next four years will be better than the last."
