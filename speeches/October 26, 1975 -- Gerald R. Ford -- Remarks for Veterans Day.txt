On this Veterans Day, we pay special and appropriate tribute to the men and women who put their lives on the line for their country--those who served in the armed services of the United States. We salute them for their part in the preservation of freedom and honor them for their courage and devotion to Country.
I ask all Americans to pause today in tribute to the priceless contribution of all veterans and, in particular, those who gave their lives so this Nation might live.
I urge your private and public expression of gratitude for the heritage of liberty and freedom which they have secured for all Americans.
