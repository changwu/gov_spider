    It is apparent that the current work stoppage between the American Federation of Grain Millers and the eight grain facilities in Duluth, Minn., and Superior, Wis., is having an increasingly severe impact upon the general economy and public welfare of this geographical area as well as seriously threatening the many thousands of farmers who are now into their annual harvest with no means to ship their grain.
It is my deep concern therefore that every effort be made to bring an immediate end to this dispute.
In this regard, I am directing Wayne L. Horvitz, the national director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, to become personally involved and to provide whatever assistance he deems necessary.
In this endeavor, a meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday, August 21, 1979, commencing at 2 p.m. at the offices of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service in Minneapolis, Minn.
I am confident that you will participate in these meetings recognizing not only your own personal concerns, but also your responsibility to the interests of those being adversely affected by this unfortunate dispute.
This will require a total commitment by you to continue bargaining until an all-out exhaustive effort has brought about an end to this strike.
JIMMY CARTER
