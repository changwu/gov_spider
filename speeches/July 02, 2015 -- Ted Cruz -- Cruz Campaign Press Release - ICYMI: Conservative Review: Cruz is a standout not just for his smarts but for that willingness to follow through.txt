HOUSTON, Texas — Recently, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke with Conservative Review's Jeffrey Lord for a wide ranging interview covering the recent Supreme Court decisions, breaking the Washington Cartel, and the desperate need for politicians to tell the truth. The full article may be found here and an excerpt appears below:
"...this is why people are so cynical about politics, because too many people are willing to lie."
And so it is.
All of which makes A Time for Truth a riveting political read and Ted Cruz himself that rarest of rare breeds – a truth-teller who is unafraid to take on all those Washington special interests and the Washington Cartel they represent.
Without doubt, Ted Cruz now has some of those scars from the arrows coming his way — many of them from establishment Republicans whose favorite firing position is from the back.
There are over a dozen candidates for the Republican presidential nomination out there in the 2016 cycle. But without a doubt, particularly among those who currently hold office or once did so, Cruz is a standout not just for his smarts but for that willingness to follow through on this promise to his Texas constituents in his successful Senate campaign against a Texas GOP establishment figure:
"If I go to Washington, and I just vote right a hundred percent of the time, I will consider myself an abject failure. If I am not standing on the front lines with arrows sticking out of my torso, I won't be doing my job."

Without doubt, Ted Cruz now has some of those scars from the arrows coming his way — many of them from establishment Republicans whose favorite firing position is from the back. He is indeed on the front lines – and the man I spoke to has absolutely no intention of retreating.
Which is exactly why he has so many enemies inside Washington – and so many more friends outside of it.
