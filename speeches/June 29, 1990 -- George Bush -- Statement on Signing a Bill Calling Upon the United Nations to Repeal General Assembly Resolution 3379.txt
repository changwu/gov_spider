    I have today signed S.J. Res. 246, a joint resolution of Congress "calling upon the United Nations to repeal General Assembly Resolution 3379," which declared Zionism to be "a form of racism and racial discrimination." S.J. Res. 246 requests the President to report periodically to the Congress on progress made to repeal the resolution.
The United States vigorously opposed the 1975 adoption of the pernicious proposition, in United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 3379, that Zionism is a form of racism. We continue to work actively for its renunciation. It is long overdue that all of the member states of the United Nations join us in renouncing UNGA Resolution 3379.
For these reasons, I wholly agree with the sentiments underlying this congressional repudiation of a totally counterproductive UNGA resolution. By signing S.J. Res. 246, I add my full endorsement as President of the United States, and the person charged by the Constitution with maintaining the foreign relations of this Nation, to this otherwise nonbinding expression of congressional sentiment.
At this time, I also want to reaffirm U.S. determination to pursue efforts toward a comprehensive, just, and lasting Middle East peace. In our view, this peace must be achieved on the basis of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of territory for peace. It must provide for Israel's security and recognition and for Palestinian political rights. We strongly hope that Israelis, Palestinians, and the Arab states will take the necessary steps to create an environment in which a viable peace process can thrive.
