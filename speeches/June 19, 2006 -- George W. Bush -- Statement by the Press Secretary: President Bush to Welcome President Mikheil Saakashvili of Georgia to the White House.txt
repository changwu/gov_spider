    President Bush will welcome Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili for a meeting at the White House on July 5, 2006. Georgia's Rose Revolution was a powerful moment in modern history that has inspired others to seek freedom. Georgia is a key ally in an important region, and a valued partner in the war on terror, making important contributions in Iraq. The President and President Saakashvili will discuss developments in consolidating Georgia's democratic transition since the President's May 9-10, 2005 visit to Georgia, efforts to promote a peaceful resolution to the separatist conflicts in South Ossetia and Abkhazia within a unified Georgia, cooperation in Energy Security and Georgia's Euro-Atlantic aspirations and our common commitment to working together to advance freedom and security around the world.
