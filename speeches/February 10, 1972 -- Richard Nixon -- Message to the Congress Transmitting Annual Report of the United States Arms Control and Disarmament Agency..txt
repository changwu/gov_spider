    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to the Arms Control and Disarmament Act as amended (P.L. 87-297), I herewith transmit the Eleventh Annual Report of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. I am also pleased to report to the Congress that this document reflects appreciable progress in the disarmament field during calendar year 1971.
Our progress has been especially significant in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks with the Soviet Union. In May 1971, I was able to announce that a deadlock had been broken. We reached an understanding with the Soviet leadership to concentrate on working out an accord to limit the deployment of defensive antiballistic missile systems (ABMs), and to conclude it simultaneously with an agreement on certain measures limiting offensive strategic weapons. This joint understanding reinforces my firm commitment to reach an equitable agreement limiting both offensive and defensive strategic nuclear weapons.
Another highlight of 1971 occurred when the American and Soviet SALT Delegations reached two collateral agreements that were signed in Washington on September 30. The first dealt with measures to be taken by each country to reduce the risk of accidental nuclear war, while the second provided for improvements in the reliability of the Washington-Moscow Direct Communications Line, or "Hot Line", by using satellite communications systems.
In Geneva, at the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, the United States was also among the principal architects of a convention banning the development, production and stockpiling of biological weapons and toxins. The presence of these weapons in the arsenals of any civilized nation is no longer justified.
As 1972 opens, I am determined to maintain American leadership in achieving arms control measures which will enhance both national and world security and contribute to a lasting peace.
