    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to section 411(c) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2171 note), I hereby transmit the East-West Trade Report for the third quarter of 1981, covering trade relations between the United States and nonmarket economy countries.
Economic sanctions against the Soviet Union and Poland in response to the repression in Poland were imposed in December 1981. These political and economic measures affecting our relationship with these countries were designed to convey that we cannot and will not conduct "business as usual" with the perpetrators and those who aid and abet them. The annual East-West Trade Report for 1981 will cover these sanctions in greater detail.
