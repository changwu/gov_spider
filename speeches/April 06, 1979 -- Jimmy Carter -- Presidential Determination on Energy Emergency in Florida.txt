    Based on a Petition submitted to me by the Governor of the State of Florida, pursuant to Section 110(f) of the Clean Air Act, I hereby determine that a regional energy emergency exists in the State of Florida of such severity that a temporary suspension of certain particulate and opacity control regulations which apply to fossil-fuel fired electric generating plants under the Florida Air Quality Implementation Plan may be necessary, and that other means of responding to the energy emergency may be inadequate. This determination shall be effective for not more than thirty (30) days. If, during the period of suspension, I find that a regional energy emergency no longer exists in Florida, I will direct that this determination of regional energy emergency be rescinded and that all suspension orders issued by the Governor be terminated effective on the day of that rescission. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency retains full authority to disapprove temporary suspensions of regulations in Florida and to exercise his emergency powers authority under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act, when and if necessary.
I commend the Governor for his commitment to act with care if he suspends air pollution regulations under the authority provided by this determination, since such regulations are important to protect public health. I commend him for undertaking energy conservation measures and for his commitment that no suspension will be granted if the result would be a violation of any national ambient primary or secondary air quality standard.
This determination shall be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER.
