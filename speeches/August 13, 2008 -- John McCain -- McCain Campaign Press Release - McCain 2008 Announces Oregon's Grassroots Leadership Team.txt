    OREGON CITY, OR -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced Oregon's Grassroots Leadership Team. This team of local Oregon leaders will help organize and manage the campaign's grassroots efforts, including the "get out the vote" turnout operation, in each county and city across the state of Oregon.
Each of Oregon's 36 counties will have a designated chairman at the local level to serve as the point of contact for local volunteers and supporters, and to help communicate John McCain's message of country first, national security, stronger economy and government reform.
"John McCain has proven throughout his life that putting our great country first will be the guiding principle that defines his administration," said former Oregon Governor Victor Atiyeh. "McCain's unquestioned bipartisan approach to finding solutions to the tough issues facing Oregonians today is refreshing in a time of unmitigated partisanship and gridlock in Washington."
Gov. Atiyeh continued, "Through our strong and diverse leadership team we will be able to effectively drive a message of low taxes, stimulating the economy and genuine answers to health care concerns. John McCain has a bold, principled plan to help America move forward without bowing to ever-changing political winds. Oregon deserves a strong president that rises above petty partisanship and puts country first."
