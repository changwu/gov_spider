    DURING the past month, I have made clear that the United States must and will act to increase its energy independence. One effective way--which can have immediate payoff--is to reduce unnecessary energy demands.
Today, I have ordered that the Federal Government continue during the current fiscal year its energy savings program. I have directed that agencies hold energy consumption to levels 15 percent below the amount consumed in fiscal year 1973. In addition, I have instructed the Administrators of the Federal Energy Administration and General Services Administration to recommend to Secretary Morton, Chairman of the Energy Resources Council, a multi-year program to assure that energy efficiency is considered in all decisions involving Federal facilities and operations.
Last year, actions by Federal agencies saved the equivalent of 90 million barrels of oil. Both these accomplishments and these new goals can serve as examples for all sectors--for business and industry, State and local governments, and for all our citizens in their daily activities.
The new objective for Federal energy conservation is one step. We are now working with industry to find ways to reduce energy requirements for its activities and products. We will continue working with all sectors to find other steps that can be taken to conserve energy.
I again urge all Americans to join in this effort with serious voluntary actions to conserve energy. All of us contribute daily to the demand for energy. We can all act to reduce that demand.
