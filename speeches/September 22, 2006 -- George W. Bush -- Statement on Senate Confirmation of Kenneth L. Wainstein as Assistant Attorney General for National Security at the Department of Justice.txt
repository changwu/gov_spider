    I am pleased the Senate has confirmed Kenneth Wainstein as the first Assistant Attorney General for National Security at the Department of Justice. As head of this new division, Ken will bring together our national security, counterterrorism, counterespionage, and foreign intelligence surveillance litigation under one Assistant Attorney General. Ken is an effective leader, who will play an important role in our efforts to combat terrorism.
Ken's confirmation fulfills one of the critical recommendations of the WMD Commission and further strengthens our ability to protect all Americans.
I urge the Senate to give all my nominees a prompt up-or-down vote.
