Highly respected Senator Richard Burr Chairman of Senate Intelligence said today that after an almost two year investigation he saw no evidence of Russia collusion. 'We don't have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the Trump campaign and Russia.' Thank you!Retweets: 34678Favorites: 153015

Not only did Senator Burr's Committee find No Collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia it's important because they interviewed 200 witnesses and 300000 pages of documents & the Committee has direct access to intelligence information that's Classified. @GreggJarrettRetweets: 22281Favorites: 87159

...It is all a GIANT AND ILLEGAL HOAX developed long before the election itself but used as an excuse by the Democrats as to why Crooked Hillary Clinton lost the Election! Someday the Fake News Media will turn honest & report that Donald J. Trump was actually a GREAT Candidate!Retweets: 29169Favorites: 137509

Deepest sympathies to Congresswoman Debbie Dingell and the entire family of John Dingell. Longest serving Congressman in Country's history which if people understand politics means he was very smart. A great reputation and highly respected man.Retweets: 10668Favorites: 66450

I was a big fan of Frank Robinson both as a great player and man. He was the first African American manager in baseball and was highly respected at everything he did. He will he missed!Retweets: 17978Favorites: 115678
