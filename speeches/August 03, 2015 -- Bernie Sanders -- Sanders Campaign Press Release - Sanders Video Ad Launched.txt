    BURLINGTON, Vt. â€“ In a new online video, Bernie Sanders discusses why he is running for president and what he would do to restore the great American middle class and take on the billionaire class.
"Today in America, we have enormous problems. They are solvable problems," Sanders says in the video. "This country belongs to all of us. We want to make policy that improves the lives of all of our people. That's how we transform America."
The five-minute video talks about Sanders background as an immigrant's son and his early career as mayor of Burlington, Vermont, and lists some of his accomplishments in Congress.
The video also details Sanders' proposals on some of the most critical issues confronting the country ranging from climate change to college costs.
The video was first shown to some 100,000 Iowans who got a chance for a sneak peek. It has since been watched 500,000 times. It is featured prominently for the first time today at BernieSanders.com, the campaign website.
