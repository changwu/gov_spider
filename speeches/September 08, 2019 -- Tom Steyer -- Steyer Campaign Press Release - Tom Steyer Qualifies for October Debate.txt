(SAN FRANCISCO, September 8, 2019) — Today, presidential candidate Tom Steyer officially qualified for the Democratic National Committee debate in October by gaining his fourth qualifying poll. The CBS News / YouGov released this morning shows 2% support for him in Nevada.
"It's now more clear than ever that Tom's message is resonating with Americans across the country— that it is time to break the corporate stranglehold on Washington and bring democracy back to the American people," Campaign Manager Heather Hargreaves said. "We are thrilled that Tom will be able to share his vision— of how together we can fix our broken political system— with the American public."
