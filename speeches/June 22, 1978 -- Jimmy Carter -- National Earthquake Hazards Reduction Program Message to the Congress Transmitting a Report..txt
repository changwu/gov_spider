    To the Congress of the United States:
Throughout its history, the human race has faced the threat of earthquakes, but in the last few years advances in science and technology' have taught us more about earthquakes, and reduced the mystery of their origin and effects. These advances now permit us to anticipate earthquakes and to mitigate their potentially disastrous consequences. Today there is hope that we may eventually be able to predict earthquakes reliably.
Through the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 (Public Law 95124), the Congress seeks to apply these advances by "the establishment and maintenance of an effective earthquake hazards reduction program." I am transmitting today a plan for a National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program. This program is designed to meet the objectives of the important legislation you have passed. It deals with: predicting and preparing for earthquakes; ways in which government, industry, and the public can apply knowledge of seismic risk when making land-use decisions; and achieving earthquake-resistant design and construction.
As this program emphasizes, the Federal Government must set a strong example in developing guidelines and standards for its own facilities. But Federal effort alone is not enough; to succeed in this effort, we must have the cooperative efforts of State and local governments, industry and business, professional and volunteer organizations, and the public.
