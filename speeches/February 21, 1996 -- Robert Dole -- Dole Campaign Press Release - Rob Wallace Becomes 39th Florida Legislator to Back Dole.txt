Wallace is President and Founder of Environmental Engineering Consultants of Tampa and is also active in Tampa-area civic groups. He will become a Vice-Chairman of the Florida steering committee.
"Bob Dole is the conservative leader America needs to complete the Republican Revolution of 1994," Wallace said. "Through years of public service, Bob Dole has been in the trenches and has stood up for conservative principles. I am dedicated to helping Bob Dole spread his conservative message across Florida."
Florida's House Republican Leader Daniel Webster, welcomed Wallace; "We're proud to have Rep. Wallace on the Dole team. With his support, Bob-Dole is a step closer to winning Florida in March. A Dole Administration will mean less government and more freedom for the American people."
"Representative Wallace has fought long and hard for Republican ideas in Florida, Wallace is both an economic conservative as well as a social conservative who can clearly resonate Bob Dole's message. It is an honor to have him on our team," said Campaign Manager Scott Reed.
Florida's primary takes place on Super Tuesday--March 12th. Florida will send 98 delegates to the Republican convention this year.
