Marco endorsed Senator Ernst as the conservative choice in the 2014 primary before she soundly beat her Democratic opponent.

Senator Ernst and Marco share a bunch of similarities — in their paths to the Senate and in their priorities for America.
Marco Rubio reminding voters that Ernst's story is just like his — establishment told him not to run — but they did and won

Over the course of my time in the Senate, I have had the opportunity to work with Senator Marco Rubio on national security. We have had that opportunity to discuss the threats to America.
He does understand those threats very well. I know he has the confidence necessary in a leader to contain or destroy ISIS. I watched him fight that fight. Beyond our national security, he is a father just as I am a mother. And I know that he wants to work hard to make sure that that American Dream is alive for our children.

With just one week to go until the caucus, Marco was honored to be joined by one of Iowa's strongest conservative voices!
