    The President. Thank you all.
Q. Was it worth coming?
The President. Yes, you bet. It's always good to come home to vote. And I urge all people to vote when given a chance. It's also good to be home in Texasâ€”get a little rest here in my homestead and then heading over to New Orleans tomorrow and Mississippi.
Thank you all.
