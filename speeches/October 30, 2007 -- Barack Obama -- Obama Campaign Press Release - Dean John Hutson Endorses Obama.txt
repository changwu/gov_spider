    MANCHESTER, NH-John Hutson, Dean of Franklin Pierce Law Center and former Judge Advocate General of the U.S. Navy, announced his support for Barack Obama today. Hutson endorsed Obama as best candidate to move the country beyond our failed foreign policy and restore our moral leadership in the world, citing Obama's unifying leadership, his early stand against the war in Iraq, and his belief in strong, personal diplomacy with friend and foe.
"Obama is the only major candidate who had the courage and judgment to oppose the tragic war in Iraq and a reckless amendment that lays the groundwork for war in Iran," Dean Hutson said. "And he understands that a strong President is not afraid to talk to our enemies and tell them that we'll never back down from the values that make America great."
Now a resident of Bow, Hutson served as a judge advocate in the United States Navy from 1972-2000. He has served as President and Dean of Franklin Pierce Law Center since 2000. Dean Hutson was a registered Republican until changing his party affiliation this month to vote for Obama in the primary.
"The damage this administration has done to our standing in the world is not irreparable-but to undo that damage we need a bold, principled leader who isn't afraid to challenge the conventional thinking that has taken hold in Washington," Hutson said. "Barack Obama is that leader."
