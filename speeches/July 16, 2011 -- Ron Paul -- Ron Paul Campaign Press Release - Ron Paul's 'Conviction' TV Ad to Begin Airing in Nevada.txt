The ad, which has already begun airing in Iowa and New Hampshire, will be a significant buy for its Nevada run. In the spot, Paul is highlighted as the national leader of the strong opposition movement against raising the country's debt ceiling.
"Nevada is a key constituency with important and growing influence on the National political environment, and Dr. Paul plans to win the state in 2012," said Jesse Benton, Ron Paul 2012 campaign chairman.
