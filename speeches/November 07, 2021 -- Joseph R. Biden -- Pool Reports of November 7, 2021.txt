Travel pool report #6 — walking on the beach
POTUS and FLOTUS arrived at the beach at Cape Henlopen State Park at 4:08 p.m. They both waved to the pool and walked in a straight line toward the shore. They are walking alongside the water. POTUS did not respond to shouted questions from the pool.
Pool is distant but it looks like POTUS took a photo of FLOTUS standing near the water.
The president wore a black jacket, dark trousers, and a blue baseball cap. FLOTUS is wearing light wash jeans and a white coat. It's windy, 54 degrees, and the waves are quite strong.

Travel pool report #7 — walk has ended
POTUS and FLOTUS finished their walk and the motorcade left the beach at 4:45 p.m. They walked in one direction along the shore and cut out of your pooler's vision at 4:21 p.m. Pool moved in a bus to another location to catch the end of the walk but did not see them enter the motorcade.
Your pooler was also shown some close-up shots — at one point, POTUS wrapped his arm around FLOTUS and they took a selfie on the beach.
