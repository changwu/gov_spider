    Ahead of their endorsement rally in Reno, Nevada, Senators Dean Heller and Orrin Hatch released the following statements about why they're supporting Jeb:
Senator Dean Heller (R-NV):
"Our nation is at a crossroads. It is in dire need of a proven leader. That leader is Jeb Bush. As the governor of Florida, Jeb built a strong record and proved to Americans his policies will help them advance toward a better tomorrow. The nation needs the pragmatic, conservative, principled leadership that only Jeb provides. And Jeb understands why Nevada is important when appealing to the majority of American voters. Most importantly, Jeb believes in growing the party and uniting it as he runs for president. That's exactly what America needs. Someone who has the vision, the experience, and the ability to bring our nation forward to experience the best days ahead of it. That person is Gov. Jeb Bush. I proudly endorse him to become the next president of the United States of America."
Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT):
"Jeb is a proven leader. He has a real record of cutting taxes, fostering job creation, and reforming government. I know Jeb will return the United States to a position of leadership in the world."
