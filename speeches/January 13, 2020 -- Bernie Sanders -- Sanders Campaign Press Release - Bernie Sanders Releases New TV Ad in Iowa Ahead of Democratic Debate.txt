    DES MOINES, Iowa â€“ Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign on Monday, ahead of the Democratic debate, launched a new TV ad in Iowa, titled "Strive."
Watch: "Strive"
The spot opens with footage of President John F. Kennedy's famous speech in 1962 calling on America to strive for greatness, saying, "We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard." The ad continues with Sanders echoing Kennedy's words and stating that settling for half measures is not good enough.
"Strive" is Sanders' ninth ad to run in Iowa, following "Patients Before Profits," "Billionaires," "Fights For Us," "Belongs To Us," "Hope," "Iowa First," "Big Us" and "For All." All nine ads have been produced entirely in-house by Bernie 2020 staff.
The full ad can be seen here and the transcript is below:
KENNEDY: We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.
SANDERS: President Kennedy knew settling for half-measures wasn't good enough.
So when candidates say we can't guarantee health care for all, make college affordable for all, combat climate change, or create a world at peace, remember that America is best when we strive to do big things, even when it's hard.
I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message.
