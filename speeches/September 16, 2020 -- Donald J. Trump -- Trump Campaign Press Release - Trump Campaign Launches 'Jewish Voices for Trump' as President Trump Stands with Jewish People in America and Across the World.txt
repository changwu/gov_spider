    While the Democrat Party invites anti-Semites into its ranks, turns its back on Israel, and encourages American weakness abroad, President Trump stands for the safety, security, and prosperity of the Jewish people and the Jewish State of Israel. President Trump has reaffirmed America's commitment to Israel after years of neglect under the Obama-Biden Administration and invested federal resources into combating anti-Semitism. Moreover, President Trump recently signed a historic peace accord between Israel and two major Arab nations, demonstrating the success of his America First agenda at achieving peace through strength. With the launch of 'Jewish Voices for Trump,' the Trump Campaign is working to unite the Jewish people around President Trump's firm commitment to defend every American, regardless of religious background.
"President Trump is a champion of the Jewish people and the greatest ally the State of Israel has ever had. President Trump has fought against anti-Semitism in America and throughout the world while continuing to ensure the long-term success and security of the Jewish State. From moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, to recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, to tearing up the disastrous Iran nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama-Biden administration, to signing the historic Abraham Accords, President Trump's record on Israel and the Middle East can be summed up in four words: Promises Made, Promises Kept," said Boris Epshteyn, Trump 2020 Strategic Advisor and Co-Chair of Jewish Voices for Trump. "Today's extremist Democrats are electing anti-Semites into Congress and inviting them to speak at their national convention. They are turning their back on our Israeli allies, minimizing the Holocaust and fermenting anarchy in our streets. In stark contrast to the radical, hateful Democrats, President Trump remains the most ardent champion of the Jewish community and friend to the State of Israel. These are just some of the reasons that Jewish Americans from coast to coast, and those living overseas but voting in America, are eager to re-elect President Trump in November."
Leading the 'Jewish Voices for Trump' coalition as co-chairs are: Co-Chair Dr. Miriam Adelson, Co-Chair Sheldon Adelson, Co-Chair Wayne Berman, Co-Chair Boris Epshteyn, and Co-Chair Julie Strauss Levin.
