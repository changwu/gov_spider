    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I am submitting to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question. The previous report covered progress through September 30, 1994. The current report covers October 1, 1994 through November 30, 1994.
During this period, senior U.S. officials met frequently with President Clerides and other officials of the Republic of Cyprus. In late October, Greek-Cypriot leader Clerides and Turkish-Cypriot leader Denktash had five face-to-face meetings in Nicosia under the auspices of the United Nations. No concrete agreements were reached, but all the main issues involved in a settlement were addressed. Mr. Clerides has stated his willingness to continue discussions if a substantive basis for negotiations is established within the framework of U.N. resolutions and the high-level agreements of 1977 and 1979.
In addition, Mr. Denktash wrote to U.N. Secretary General Boutros-Ghali on November 21 reaffirming his commitment to a bizonal, bicommunal federation. He has also stated his willingness to enter immediate negotiations with Mr. Clerides. We hope that these statements will facilitate efforts to develop a basis for immediate talks between the two leaders on an early implementation of the U.N.-proposed package of confidence-building measures and on an overall solution.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
