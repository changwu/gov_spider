There was no Collusion (it is a Hoax) and there is no Obstruction of Justice (that is a setup & trap). What there is is Negotiations going on with North Korea over Nuclear War Negotiations going on with China over Trade Deficits Negotiations on NAFTA and much more.

NEW BOOK - A MUST READ! 'The Russia Hoax - The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump' by the brilliant Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett. A sad chapter for law enforcement. A rigged system!Retweets: 24919Favorites: 88965

A Rigged System - They don't want to turn over Documents to Congress. What are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal 'justice?' At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!Retweets: 31510Favorites: 115465

'This isn't some game. You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States.' John Dowd March 2018. With North Korea China the Middle East and so much more there is not much time to be thinking about this especially since there was no Russian 'Collusion.'Retweets: 23303Favorites: 92123
