    Today I signed the National Integrated Drought Information System Reauthorization Act into law. This bipartisan legislation ensures that the Federal Government can continue to provide timely, effective drought warning forecasts and vital support to communities that are vulnerable to drought. States, cities, towns, farmers, and businesses rely on tools and data from the National Integrated Drought Information System to make informed decisions about water use, crop planting, wildfire response, and other critical areas. As climate change increases the intensity of weather-related disasters such as droughts, wildfires, storms, and floods, providing access to updated drought-related science and tools is growing even more important.
Currently, a number of Western States are facing drought conditions, including a severe drought in California, and my administration is pursuing every measure to provide relief and support in partnership with States. To complement the National Integrated Drought Information System, as part of my climate action plan, Federal agencies have also formed a National Drought Resilience Partnership to help communities better prepare for droughts in the long term and prevent the worst impacts on families and businesses. I commend Congress for passing this bipartisan bill to continue to build our national resilience to drought and help communities, farmers, businesses, and individuals better prepare and recover when disaster strikes.
