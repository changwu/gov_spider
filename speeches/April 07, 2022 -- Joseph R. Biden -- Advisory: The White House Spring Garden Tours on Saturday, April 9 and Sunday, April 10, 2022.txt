There will be an opportunity for media coverage from 9:30 AM - 10:15 AM ET on Saturday, April 9. For interested media, please RSVP HERE by Friday, 4/8 at 5:00 PM ET.
These tours are free and open to members of the public; however, a ticket is required for all attendees, including small children. The National Park Service (NPS) will distribute free, timed tickets at a tent stationed near the Ellipse Visitor Pavilion each day beginning at 8:30 AM ET. The entry point for all guests will be located near the intersection of 15th Street NW and Constitution Avenue NW. Tickets will be distributed, one ticket per person, on a first-come, first-served basis.
