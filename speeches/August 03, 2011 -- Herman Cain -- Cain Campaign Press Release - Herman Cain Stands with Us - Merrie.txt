Merrie and her husband Jerry, who is an LA County firefighter, created the 9/11 Rose Bowl Parade float because they wanted to honor the 10 year anniversary of 9/11. The float's theme was "Remember. Reflect. Renew." She supports Herman Cain because, "We need to get those politicians out and we need to get a business person in. I stand with Herman Cain because he stands with us."
