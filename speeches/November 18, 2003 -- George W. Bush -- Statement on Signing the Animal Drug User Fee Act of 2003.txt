    Today, I have signed into law S. 313, the "Animal Drug User Fee Act of 2003." The Act is designed to expedite the animal drug development process, while continuing to ensure the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs.
Section 4(a) of the Act purports to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to submit legislative recommendations to the Congress and to establish procedures by which the Secretary must formulate such recommendations. The legislative power does not extend to requiring the Executive submit legislative recommendations to the Congress nor to specifying procedures by which the Executive must formulate any legislative recommendations that the Executive makes. The executive branch shall execute section 4(a) in a manner consistent with the Constitution's exclusive commitments to the President of the authority to submit for the consideration of the Congress such measures as he judges necessary and expedient and the authority to supervise the unitary executive branch.
GEORGE W. BUSH
The White House, November 18, 2003.
