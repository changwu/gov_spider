Biden's record of plagiarism and dishonesty goes back decades.
Earlier this year, Joe Biden repeatedly regaled voters with a tale about himself being arrested 30 years ago in South Africa while trying to see Nelson Mandela. The lie was detailed and deliberate. "I had the great honor of being arrested with our U.N. ambassador on the streets of Soweto trying to get to see [Mandela] on Robbens Island," Biden said. He even went so far as to claim that he'd been thanked by Mandela for getting arrested.
Biden fabricated the entire event. The ambassador Biden mentioned said it never happened. Finally, Biden had to admit he made it up. "I guess I wasn't arrested," he told CNN.
Similarly, Biden had to admit last year that an emotional, vivid story he liked to tell on the campaign trail about pinning a medal on a war hero was also made up.
Biden's record of plagiarism and dishonesty goes back decades.
Biden once said he was "shot at" in Iraq – that was false. He falsely claimed he confronted Slobodan Milosevic. He told a voter he was a coal miner – that was false too. He claimed he marched in the civil rights movement – nope, that didn't happen either.
To downplay his coronavirus tall tales, the media said Biden sometimes has a "fuzzy concept of time" – but these deceptions can't simply be brushed aside as memory problems.
Biden's still the same guy who misrepresented his law school grades and college degrees. He's been making stuff up ever since.
