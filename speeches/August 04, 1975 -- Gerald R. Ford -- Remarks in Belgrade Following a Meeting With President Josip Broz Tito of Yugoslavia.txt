    Mr. President:
The talks that we have had for the last day have been too short, but we have discussed in great detail some of the very major matters that both of our countries are equally interested in.
We did discuss the bilateral relations between Yugoslavia and the United States. That included, of course, our economic relationships. It did, of course, include our military relationships. And in both instances, I indicated very firmly that I would give both matters or problems my very personal attention because of their significance.
We did discuss the results of the CSCE Conference in Helsinki. It was agreed that this was a step forward, as both of us indicated in our speeches in Helsinki, but that we had to produce progress if we were to justify the action. And when we meet here in Belgrade 2 years from now, the success of Helsinki would be proven by the actions that have been taken in the interim.
We did, of course, discuss the problems of the Middle East. I indicated that the United States would continue its very vital interest in progress in the Middle East. I stated very emphatically that a stalemate in the Middle East was unacceptable. I indicated that moderation on the part of all parties was essential.
I also indicated that flexibility was necessary if we were to achieve the kind of results that would avoid a potential, serious development, a catastrophe from the point of view of the world as a whole. Moderation, greater flexibility are absolutely essential at the present time.
I, of course, thank the President for his cordial and friendly welcome, and I express to the Yugoslavian people my gratitude for the warm reception given to Mrs. Ford and myself and our son, and I look forward to an expanding and improving relationship between our peoples.
Thank you very much.
