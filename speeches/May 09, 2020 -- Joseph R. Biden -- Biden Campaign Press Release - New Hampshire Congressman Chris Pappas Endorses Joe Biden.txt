    Today, New Hampshire Congressman Chris Pappas released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:
"We all must join together to elect Joe Biden as the next President of the United States. Joe Biden represents the values of our party and the fundamental decency of the American people. He is ready to lead and will protect the health and well-being of all Americans and bring our nation back together. We can make progress with him as President, especially if we also re-elect Jeanne Shaheen and Democrats to Congress."
With Congressman Pappas's endorsement, the entire New Hampshire Congressional delegation has now publicly endorsed Joe Biden, including Congresswoman Annie Kuster and Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan.
Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 2,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
