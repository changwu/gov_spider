    My economic agenda passed by Democrats in Congress to rebuild our manufacturing and infrastructure here at home continues to pay off for the American people, this time in Georgia. This plant was announced during my trip to the Republic of Korea in May, and I am excited the groundbreaking is happening months ahead of schedule. Hyundai's commitment to invest more than $5 billion and create more than 8,000 jobs making electric vehicles and batteries will help boost the entire community around Bryan County with good jobs people can raise a family on and ultimately help lower costs for the American people. This has been at the heart of the historic legislation we have passed over the past 2 years, and the last thing we should do is repeal it as Republicans in Congress want to do.
