    Today, President Donald J. Trump signed into law important legislation to help victims of child sexual exploitation, the "Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Victims Assistance Act of 2018."
The Trump Administration is prioritizing the fight against this evil through our ongoing commitment to innovative initiatives, including Project Safe Childhood, and we are taking these steps to confront a truly disturbing reality. Since March 2015, for example, the number of distinct children identified in child pornography material has nearly doubled, from 8,600 to almost 16,000. We must end this scourge on our children and our society.
The bill the President signed today will help ensure that victims of child pornography and other child sexual abuse crimes receive restitution for the harm they have suffered. It ensures that a minimum amount will be ordered in each case and allows victims to choose from different forms of restitution.
Making America safe again starts with protecting our people—especially our children—from the savagery of sexual exploitation and abuse. The President is proud to have signed the Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Victims Assistance Act into law.
