    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of Clark Clifford, an American statesman who helped shape half a century's struggle for freedom. From his first days by President Truman's side as a young naval aide, to his wise counsel to President Carter, he was someone upon whom Presidents could rely for judicious and effective advice. When his wisdom and experience were needed, which was often, he offered it with charm, grace, and a certain humility. As Secretary of Defense at a critical time under President Johnson, he helped to begin the search for peace in Vietnam. His legacy of public service is notable in our history. Our thoughts and prayers go to his wife, Marny, and their three daughters.
