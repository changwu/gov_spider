    We extend our sympathies and condolences to the families of the victims of the August 1 Mozdok hospital terrorist attack. The United States condemns this act of terrorism, which targeted hospital patients and those who care for them. No cause whatsoever, be it national, ethnic, religious, or political, can justify terrorism.
