    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report a new proposal to rescind $173.0 million in budget authority previously provided by the Congress. In addition, I am reporting ten new deferrals totaling $495.1 million, and revisions to four previously reported deferrals increasing the amount deferred by $76.4 million.
The rescission proposal affects a program in the Department of Energy. The deferrals affect programs in the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Health and Human Services, Justice, and Labor, as well as the Railroad Retirement Board and the United States Railway Association.
The details of each rescission proposal and deferral are contained in the attached reports.
