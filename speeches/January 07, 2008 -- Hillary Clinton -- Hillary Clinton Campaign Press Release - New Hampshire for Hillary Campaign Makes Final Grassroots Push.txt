    MANCHESTER, NH - With less than 24 hours until the New Hampshire primary, the New Hampshire for Hillary campaign's Get Out the Vote Operation is in full swing. Staff, volunteers, and supporters are working around the clock to ensure that New Hampshire voters know that tomorrow they can help pick a president who can hit the ground running on day one.
In the final hours leading up to the primary, over 6,000 volunteers will fan out across the state, participating in more than 200 canvasses and knocking on tens of thousands of doors. In their efforts to reach out to their friends and neighbors across the state, volunteers and staff will walk close to 400 miles.
Staff and volunteers will be joined in their efforts by more than a dozen national supporters including campaign Chairman Terry McAuliffe; Maryland Lt. Governor Anthony Brown; tennis legend Billie Jean King; Senator Evan Bayh (D-IN); Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa; Senior Campaign Advisor Ann Lewis; Congressman Jim McGovern (D-MA); Congressman Barney Frank (D-MA); Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney (D-MA); Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX); Congressman Joe Crowley (D-NY); Congressman Bill Pascrell (D-NY); General Wesley Clark; and EMILY's List President Ellen Malcolm. Along with Senator Clinton and President Clinton, they have made stops in all 10 counties.
Tomorrow, nearly 300 campaign drivers will make sure that New Hampshire voters have transportation to their polling locations. Staff and volunteers will continue working hard until the polls close to convey one message: Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to make real change happen.
