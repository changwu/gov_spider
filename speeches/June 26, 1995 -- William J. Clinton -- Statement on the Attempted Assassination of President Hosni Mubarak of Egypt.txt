    On behalf of the American people, I wish to express my outrage at the attempt made today by terrorists to assassinate President Mubarak of Egypt. I am relieved that President Mubarak was not harmed and has now returned safely to Cairo.
The United States stands by Egypt—our partner for peace and prosperity in the Middle East and around the world—at this moment. The enemies of peace will not be allowed to thwart the peaceful hopes of the peoples of the region, and the efforts of President Mubarak and the peace makers to make those hopes a reality.
