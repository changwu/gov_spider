(House Rules)
(Rep. Paulsen, R-MN, and three cosponsors)
The Administration is committed to helping startups, boosting innovation, and growing the economy, and is willing to work with the Congress on fiscally responsible measures to achieve those goals. However, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5719 because it would increase the Federal deficit by $1 billion over the next ten years. Failing to pay for new tax cuts is fiscally irresponsible.
