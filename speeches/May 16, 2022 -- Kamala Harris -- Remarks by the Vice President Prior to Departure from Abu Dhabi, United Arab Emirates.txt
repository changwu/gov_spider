    THE VICE PRESIDENT: So, we have been here -- and I am here leading the presidential delegation on behalf of the President and the American people and our administration to express our condolences to a friend and to a partner, the United Arab Emirates; to express congratulations also to the new president; and to reaffirm the shared commitment we have to security and prosperity in this region and also how the American people have benefitted from this relationship in terms of security and prosperity.
And so, we were here to discuss the strength of that partnership and that friendship and our commitment, going forward, to continue to work at the strength of that relationship.
Thank you.
