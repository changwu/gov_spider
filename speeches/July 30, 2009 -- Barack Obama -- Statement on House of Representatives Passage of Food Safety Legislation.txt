    Today the House of Representatives passed H.R. 2749, the "Food Safety Enhancement Act of 2009," legislation that will raise food safety standards, allow the FDA to issue mandatory recalls of harmful products, and enhance our oversight of imported food.
This action represents a major step forward in modernizing our food safety system and protecting Americans from food-borne illness. Those are the goals of the Food Safety Working Group I convened in March and charged with making recommendations to improve our food safety system. And that is why we announced a new rule to control Salmonella contamination in eggs and are working to reduce the presence of harmful pathogens such as E. coli in meat and produce, strengthen our capacity to trace the source of outbreaks, and update our emergency operations procedures.
I commend the House of Representatives for its action today and look forward to working with the Senate to enact critical food safety legislation.
