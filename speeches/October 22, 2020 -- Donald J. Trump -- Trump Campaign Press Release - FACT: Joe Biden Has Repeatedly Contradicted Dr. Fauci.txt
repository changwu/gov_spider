    Biden should stop ignoring what Dr. Fauci has said.
Joe Biden is not listening to Dr. Fauci, he's ignoring him. Biden has been contradicting scientists like Dr. Fauci every chance he gets:


Biden: "President Trump knew how deadly COVID-19 was and did nothing." (09/17/2020)

When he was asked in March whether the Trump Administration was "doing everything possible," Dr. Fauci replied, "I believe so… I think in the context of what we're being challenged with, I think everybody's doing really well." (03/10/2020)

Biden: "He just wasn't up to it, he froze, he failed to act." (09/21/2020)

Dr. Fauci: "We acted very, very early." (03/31/2020)

Biden: "Due to Donald Trump's lies and incompetence in the past six months we've seen one of the gravest losses of American life in history." (09/21/2020)

Dr. Fauci: "The coordinated response has been – there are a number of adjectives to describe it – impressive, I think, is one of them. I mean, we're talking about all hands on deck… I'm down at the White House virtually every day with the Task Force… So I can't imagine that, under any circumstances, that anybody could be doing more." (03/22/2020)

Biden: "If Donald Trump had acted just two weeks earlier, 54,000 lives could have been spared in March and April alone." (09/09/2020)

Dr. Fauci: "The first and only time that Dr. Birx and I went in and formally made a recommendation to the president, to actually have a, quote, shutdown in the sense of, not really shutdown, but to really have strong mitigation …. the president listened to the recommendation and went to the mitigation. The next, second time that I went with Dr. Birx into the president and said 15 days are not enough, we need to go 30 days, obviously there were people who had a problem with that because of the potential secondary effects. Nonetheless, at that time, the president went with the health recommendations, and we extended it another 30 days… I can just tell you the first and only time that I went in and said we should do mitigation strongly, the response was yes, we'll do it." (04/13/2020)

Dr. Fauci: "Clearly, early on, we made a travel ban with regard to China. That was a very smart move, right there, because what that did was prevent a major influx from China. Today, the new China is Europe, because Europe now is the major element, the major geographic component, that is now seeding other countries throughout the world. And that's the reason why we made the very difficult but appropriate decision to have a travel ban on the European countries. So we are definitely ahead of the curve on that." (3/13/2020)

Biden: "He continued to lie about COVID-19." (09/16/2020)

Dr. Fauci: "I don't recall anything different than in our discussions that we had with the president that he said things quite similar publicly… In my discussions, and in the discussions of other Task Force members with the president, we're talking about the reality of what was going on and then when we would get up in front of the press conferences, which were very, very common after our discussions with the president, he really didn't say anything different than we discussed when we were with him… I didn't really see any discrepancies between what he told us and what we told him and what he ultimately came out publicly and said." (09/09/2020)

Biden: "The president revealed in no uncertain terms the lack of seriousness with which he continues to take this pandemic." (09/16/2020)

When he was asked if he agrees that "the Task Force and the President took the outbreak very seriously from the beginning," Dr. Fauci responded, "Yes." (09/23/2020)

Dr. Fauci: "We at NIH, as you know, have right from the very beginning put our foot on that accelerator in every aspect, including the development of vaccines and therapeutics. And as I described in my opening statement, we actually started that in January, literally days after the virus was known and its sequence was published." (5/12/2020)

Biden is shamelessly fear-mongering and playing politics with a public health crisis. When Biden falsely accuses President Trump of malfeasance, he is actually smearing Dr. Fauci as a liar. Biden should stop lying about President Trump's phenomenal response to the virus and stop ignoring what Dr. Fauci has said.
