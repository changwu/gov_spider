FLOTUS Pool Report No. 1 - Tucson departure 
Good morning from the gorgeous Westward Look Wyndham Grand Resort and Spa where the motorcade departed at 7:59 a.m. en route the Tucson airport. I'll again be your pooler for this final day of Dr. Biden's three day, three state tour. Your pool was swabbed for COVID early this morning. We didn't have eyes on FLOTUS as she entered her black SUV.
Today we're headed to Reno, Nevada and then on to Fort Campbell, Kentucky.
The motorcade pulled up to Executive One Foxtrot at 8:35 a.m. as several F-16s were taking off on an adjacent runway.
Dr. Biden greeted the police officers who accompanied her motorcade on motorcycles, walking down the line and stopping to take photos with them.
She's wearing a navy blue blazer with gold buttons over a white dress, with nude heels.
She boarded E1F at 8:43 a.m., waving from the top of the stairs.
We'll be wheels up Reno shortly.

Executive One Foxtrot was wheels up at 9:07 a.m. MST.
We landed at Reno International Airport at 9:57 a.m. PST. (We're in four time zones today, so all times are local.) Flight was uneventful and pool had no special guests to the back. Pooler did spot the Hoover Dam and Lake Tahoe from the air.
It's partly cloudy and 44 degrees here, with snow-capped mountains surrounding the tarmac.
Dr. Biden walked off E1F at 10:09 a.m. She's now wearing a lilac scarf. She hugged a female greeter.
She got into her SUV at 10:10 a.m.
We're rolling to Truckee Meadows Community College as of 10:11 a.m.
From the East Wing:
On the final day of the First Lady's trip out west, she will depart Tucson, Arizona, for Reno, Nevada. She will visit Truckee Meadows Community College (TMCC) to highlight how the American Rescue Plan has helped community colleges like TMCC continue their efforts to build a strong, local, and diverse workforce through hands-on learning. She will be joined by Angela Hanks, the Acting Assistant Secretary for the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) at the U.S. Department of Labor, Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak (D), and Lt. Governor Lisa Cano Burkhead (D).
TMCC received over $14 million from the American Rescue Plan's Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF). TMCC has spent almost $7 million of this funding on direct emergency grants to students. TMCC also used this funding to continue supporting staff and students' technology needs. Critically, TMCC used American Rescue Plan funding to sustain its operations in the face of declining revenues and enrollment and continue to provide essential programs such as wraparound services and mental health counseling.
Truckee Meadows Community College (TMCC) is a public community college in Reno, Nevada. TMCC offers students certificates, associate degrees, and several bachelor of applied science degrees. Its name is based on its primary service area, Truckee Meadows, an area in Reno and Sparks. TMCC is a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI).
Today, the First Lady will learn about three programs: nursing, emergency medical services, and radiologic technology. After the tour, she will give remarks and be introduced by Savannah Terrana, a Radiologic Technology student at TMCC. The First Lady participated in a virtual tour of TMCC's advanced manufacturing facility in July 2020.

FLOTUS Pool Report No. 3 - Truckee Meadows Community College 
The motorcade arrived at Truckee Meadows Community College at 10:28 a.m.
Dr. Biden hugged Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak and lingered outside for several minutes as pool was pulled inside.
About 20 students in kelly green scrubs awaited Dr. Biden in a nursing classroom.
"What a great looking group of students," the governor said.
Biden stood next to a bed with a dummy in it, which students use as a patient.
Karin Hilgersom and Julie Ellsworth made introductions. Dr. Jody Covert, wearing a white lab coat, then talked to Biden about the nursing program . Covert said the classroom was first semester nursing students - along with two near-graduates.
Press was pulled at 10:40.

"You have more men or women in your program?" Biden asked.
Savannah said there were only four women.
Pool was pulled at 10:48 a.m.

FLOTUS Pool Report No. 4 -Truckee final tour stop/remarks 
First a quick note on Pool Report No. 3 – the student I IDed as "Savannah" is Samantha Ramirez.
Dr. Biden made a final classroom stop at 10:52 a.m. in the "rad" lab – the radiology lab – where a mannequin named Pixie, dressed in a teal green unitard, was laying down on a bed. Here the first lady met Savannah Terrana.
"This is Pixie," Terrana said. "She has real human bones."
"She does?" Biden asked.
"So we take x-rays on her first. She's flexible. And then we take pictures of her and we go into the field and we're ready to shoot on real people," Terrana explained. "She's awesome."
"Well, you're awesome," Biden said.
At 11:07 a.m. Biden entered an atrium set up for her remarks.
There's a podium set up that says "Building a Better America – Reno."
Terrana introduced Biden. She said she received a $1,500 grant to continue her schooling as part of the American Rescue Plan.
Biden hugged Terrana as she took over the podium.
"Tell your husband hi," Terrana told the first lady.
"Whenever I see him next," FLOTUS joked.
Biden talked about how she toured Truckee's manufacturing program virtually in the summer of 2020. "Nice to see you in-person," she told one student she had met virtually. And called out a student named Veronica, who she met at Northern Virginia Community College.
"I keep in touch with so many of my students, like I'm sure that you do," Biden said.
Biden then delivered similar remarks to what she said Monday in Chandler, beginning with inauguration day about a year ago.
"We came here thinking it was going to be so warm," she said of coming to Reno, talking about how similar the weather was to D.C. in January.
The first lady talked about how the president lost his first wife and daughter in a car accident.
"And I met him years later. And so I started dating a family," she said.
"Quite honestly I didn't know what a senator did," she also offered.
She, again, took a shot at Trump, saying Biden was sworn-in in the "aftermath of four years of chaos."
Speaking about Ukraine she said, "This has been just so shocking to all of us."
She talked about her husband's leadership through the pandemic – and then gave a shout-out to the nursing students she met, explaining how they're "addressing a critical healthcare shortage."
"You're going to get them even before you graduate," she said of their job prospects.
"I always say the nurses are my best students," she added.
She also pledged again: "And we're going to make sure you can afford childcare."
Biden talked about how during the pandemic it felt like we were "under this black cloud for so long."
"Of course I'm Joe's wife – but you were right to put your faith in him over a year ago when you voted him into office. And that's because in the face of uncertainty, he is unshakable, and I hope you saw that in the State of the Union and when he was on yesterday when he was talking about the oil embargo. Despite deep divides at home and abroad he knows how to bring people together and he never loses sight of what this is all about - the people. And when he goes to bed at night, and when he wakes up in the morning, he thinks about how to make life better for you and your family."
"I love being at a community college and you know that's true because it's my spring break and I'm at a community college!" she said as she wrapped at 11:23 a.m.
Motorcade was rolling back to Reno International at 11:26 a.m.
Here are the remarks as prepared, which she deviated from slightly:
**EXCERPTS**Remarks as Prepared for DeliveryFirst Lady Jill BidenTruckee Meadows Community CollegeReno, NVMarch 9, 2022
***In the summer of 2020, I had the opportunity to "tour" Truckee Meadows' manufacturing program—virtually—and meet some of your students. Even from thousands of miles away, I heard about how much this school is doing to support students, with things like transportation and housing, so that they can cross the finish line and get great jobs.
In fact, Rebecca Pinkerton, who I met that day, is here with us now.
But as we found out about so many things during the pandemic, virtual is just not the same. Is it?
So, I'm excited to be with you in person and have the chance to see this school up close once again. So excited, in fact, that I'm using my spring break time to come here!
On a cold winter morning a little over a year ago, I held our family bible and watched my husband take the oath of office.
In that moment, he was the man I fell in love with so many years ago—a father of two boys standing in the wreckage of unthinkable loss, who stitched a broken family back together with grit and grace.
He was the man who took the train home to Delaware every night, because he knew that showing up for the smallest moments can sometimes mean the most.
He was the Senator who learned to get up when he got knocked down and fight even harder for what he knows is right—the Vice President whose steadfast counsel helped guide our country through many storms.
On that Inauguration Day, he was Joe—and then, suddenly, he became something else, too: The President of the United States.
It felt like Americans across the country were holding their breath in the aftermath of four years of chaos.
But as Joe stood there—shoulders back, eyes shining with fierce optimism—I could see his determination to bring us together to lead us forward and build a better America.
And every day since, he has worked to do just that.
Millions of families have been able to send their children back to school and find jobs and catch up on bills.
We still have a long way to go. Our world faces incredible challenges. But we've come so far.
And we're just getting started.
One year ago, we passed the American Rescue Plan. I've spent the last few days touring Arizona and now Nevada, visiting businesses, community colleges, and a community health center. And I've seen what "building a better America" means for real families.
It means investing in our workforce, so it's ready for industries of the future.
It means working families have the opportunity to train for great jobs, no matter who they are or where they live, so that they can build good careers.
It means students like Savanna have the support they need to cross the finish line.
That's what the American Rescue Plan is doing here in Reno.
Today, we saw some incredible health care programs—and heard how the ARP helped this school stay open. Not only is Truckee Meadows connecting students to jobs that pay well, it's addressing a critical health care workforce need for this community.
Make no mistake, schools like TMCC and programs like these change lives. Every person who benefits—who is better off today than they were a year ago—passes that benefit along.
When we invest in you, you invest in your family, in your neighborhoods, in local businesses, in your cities and states.
It's what Joe said last week: The state of our Union is strong because the American people are strong.
That's why we're going to keep investing in community college partnerships and workforce development.
We're going to make sure you can afford child care so you can pursue your education and career.
We're going to create jobs—even more than we already have.
You were right to put your faith in Joe Biden a year ago.
Because in the face of uncertainty, he is unshakeable.Despite deep divides—at home and abroad—he knows how to bring people together and get things done.
He never loses sight of what this is all about: the people he serves.
When he goes to bed at night and when he wakes up in the morning, he thinks about how to make life better for you and your family.
It's just who he is. It's who he's always been.
He's going to lead us forward to a better America—and it starts here. It starts now. And most of all, it starts with you.
Thank you.

FLOTUS Pool Report No. 7 - Fort Campbell BBQ remarks and color 
Pool was pulled into a large multi-purpose room on base, while FLOTUS participates in a photo line. There's giant signage of an eagle that says "Airborne" on it and then several other signs with the motto "rendezvous with destiny." There's also a very big American flag along one side of the room.
About 15 or so tables are filled with families awaiting the first lady's appearance – attendees are mostly women with children.
A food line is set up offering the following menu: garden salad, cold slaw (using that spelling), green beans, maggie's mac-n'cheese, slider rolls , cornbread, pulled pork, pulled chicken.
Another table is set up with various BBQ sauces. And another for beverages.
It smells delicious.
FLOTUS walked into the room at 5:49 p.m.
About 50 families of deployed servicemembers are in attendance, the opening speaker said.
A girl named Justice introduced the first lady – and her family has adopted two children from Ukraine. Overall her parents have five kids.
"I am a military mom," Biden said at the top, saying she was wearing "Army green" since she had been an Army National Guard mom.
"I changed on the plane, so I could fit in with everybody's fatigues," she said.
"Actually this is my third visit here. So I'm kind of familiar with Fort Campbell," she added.
She talked about the current moment with Ukraine:
"There are moments that we realize history is being written right in front of us," she said, adding that it would "divide our world before and after."
"This is one of those moments."
"It's tough to watch the news," she said.
She continued, "The president and I are so proud of you, the members of the 101st Airborne division, who are helping keep our promise to NATO. We are holding Putin accountable for his war through diplomacy and crippling sanctions . We are providing Ukraine with economic, humanitarian and security assistance."
"I saw your motto coming in, 'When you want it done ask a 101,'" she remarked.
"I knew that the president was sending troops into Poland and other places – and I said, gosh, how are the families doing?" Biden said, explaining that the trip to Fort Campbell came together quickly as she decided to make a stop on her way back from the west coast.
"You serve alongside your loved ones," she said.
"And you're carrying a heavier share of the childcare and home responsibilities," she continued.
"I happen to know that because my son was deployed to Iraq. So I know how that feels. Every morning you get up and say a prayer," she said, speaking about Beau.
"You're doing the hard stuff. Sure, they're doing the hard stuff … but you're keeping it all together for your loved one who's deployed," she added.
She talked about how quickly the 101st deployment came about.
"You didn't have time to say that lengthy goodbye," she said.
"And you answer the call with grit and resilience and grace. With consistency and courage. And I know that you're strong, but I'm sure there are times when you say to yourself, I'm just tired of being strong. This is hard stuff," she said.
"I know this community has a fierce bond," she said.
"You love one another, it's family," she continued.
"I want you to know that you don't have to carry the weight of this alone. It's OK to ask for help," she said, adding that people should feel free to seek mental health services.
"I know how many families they help. Don't be afraid to just pick up the phone."
"And I want you to know that your commander-in-chief thinks about you every single day. Family is the love that grows in unexpected places. It's the bond that we build through choice and chance," she said.
"With all my heart I want to thank you for your sacrifice," she said.
"I hear one of the things you really need is quality education. Education for special needs children, childcare, spouse employment … I'm really working hard on spouse employment. I want you to know I'm working for you, Joe's working for you. And we cannot thank you enough."
"So I'm coming around and you can yell at me or say kind words, it's up to you."
She wrapped official remarks at 6:02 p.m. and is currently mingling with the crowd.

FLOTUS Pool Report No. 8 - official excerpts 
She's still mingling with families – taking lots of pictures.
Meanwhile, passing this along from the East Wing:
**EXCERPTS**Remarks as Prepared for DeliveryFirst Lady Jill BidenFort Campbell, KentuckyMarch 9, 2022
***Good evening Ft. Campbell—It's very special to be here with you.
There are moments when we suddenly realize that history is being written in front of us—when we can almost feel ourselves cross the line that will divide our world into "before" and "after."
This is one of those moments. It's tough to watch the news, isn't it?
I am here today to tell you that the President and I are so proud that you, the members of the 101st Airborne Division, are helping keep our promise to NATO.
We are holding Putin accountable for his war through diplomacy with crippling sanctions.
We are providing Ukraine with economic, humanitarian, and security assistance.
And the Screaming Eagles are there in Europe, standing with our allies and welcoming Ukrainian refugees.
When you want it done, ask the 101!
And as an Army mom, I know that you, their families, serve alongside them—loving, and encouraging, and praying for them, carrying a heavier share of the child care and home responsibilities, losing sleep while pride and hope and fear and frustration wrestle in your mind.
You didn't get months to prepare. You didn't have time for a lengthy goodbye. In a moment, the plans you had made changed.
But your families faced this challenge like you've faced all the others before it.
Each of you put your shoulders back and your chin up.
You answered the call of duty with grit and resilience, with constancy and courage.
I know that you are strong. There is no question about that.
And I know that this community has a fierce bond. You look out for each other. You love each other.
But I want you to know that you don't have to carry the weight of this alone. It's OK to ask for help.
If you need someone to talk to, Military One Source has counseling and other mental health resources.
And organizations like the Armed Services YMCA are here to support you with programs like child care and connections to community resources.
Don't hesitate to reach out.
I also want you to know that Joining Forces—our White House initiative to support military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors—is working every day to get you the support you have earned.
Because your commitment to this country never wavers. You deserve that same devotion.
And I want you to know that your Commander in Chief thinks about each of you every day.
Family is the love that grows in unexpected places.
It's the bonds we build through choice and chance—like the families you make with one another.
Military families are our family.
And we stand up for each other.
We look out for each other.
And we take care of our own.
With all my heart: thank you for your sacrifice. God bless and protect our troops and their families.
