    The President. Good morning. I just had a breakfast with my nominee to be the Secretary of Defense, Bob Gates. Bob Gates will be a fine Secretary of Defense. I appreciate the fact that he's getting a hearing today in the United States Senate. I hope for a speedy confirmation so he can get sworn in and get to work.
Those who wear the uniform know they'll have a friend in Bob Gates in the Defense Department. He admires our military; he respects those who have volunteered to serve our country. He's going to do an excellent job for us.
Again, Bob, I thank you for agreeing to serve.
Secretary-designate Gates. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you very much.
The President. Best of luck up there on Capitol Hill. Good luck to you.
Secretary-designate Gates. Thank you.
The President. Thank you all.
