?POTUS spoke for about 15 minutes

The single greater honor I've been afforded as president is to stand before so many of you…and talk about Veterans Day.
To be a veteran is to survive challenges most Americans will never know.
You are the very spine of America..and all of us owe you.
We've asked so much of you for so long.
Our administration is going to meet the sacred obligations that we owe you. … We're going to keep pushing to be more nimble and responsive.
If you're struggling, reach out. Call a veterans' crisis line.
Veterans are the soul of America.
Biden also mentioned his late son as well as veterans Colin Powell and Max Clelland, who recently died.

"Today, 100 years later, we keep a sacred watch over their graves."
