    Memorandum for the Assistant Secretary of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health, the Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency, the Chairman, Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Commissioner, Food and Drug Administration
I was very pleased to receive your letter of July 27, describing the steps your four agencies are taking to develop a common, coordinated approach in regulating toxic and hazardous substances.
As you know, I am determined to protect the health of our people and the quality of our environment from damage done by toxic substances. We can better coordinate our efforts and make them both more effective and less burdensome.
I congratulate you on taking this step toward a better regulatory system. Your initiative will be a major contribution to the Administration's overall regulatory reform effort. It is especially useful that you are beginning the effort with a clear signal to your employees both in and outside of Washington of the seriousness of your aim to work together. Close cooperation among the regional and field offices of your agencies is essential if your efforts are to succeed.
Please keep me informed of your progress.
JIMMY CARTER
