    Warmest greetings to all who are observing Easter Sunday. Easter is a time of hope and great joy for Christians the world over. It is a time to reflect on the blessings of rebirth, as the seasons transform and the cycle of life renews itself once again. This celebration holds the promise of new beginnings, fresh approaches to old problems, and the exciting prospect of a brighter future.
On this day when families gather together and worshipers attend church services, we hope for a stronger sense of community in this great nation. As we welcome the return of spring, let us rededicate ourselves to a season of renewed hope and faith, a season of peace and regeneration.
Hillary and I extend our best wishes for a happy Easter.
BILL CLINTON
