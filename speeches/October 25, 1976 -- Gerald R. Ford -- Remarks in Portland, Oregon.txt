    Thank you all very, very much for coming out here. I know that this is a special effort on your part, but it is a wonderful welcome for me to come to Oregon, to Portland, and to have the fine support of people like Bob Packwood, Mark Hatfield, and of course, my very good friend, Edith Green, and Mrs. Tom McCall, and to have the demonstration of friendship and support from so many of you.
Let me say that in the remaining 8 days between now and November 2, I will be campaigning on the programs that have been successful. In the last 2 years--you know how tough it was 2 years ago when I became the President on August 9, 1974. We had lost trust in the White House; we were on the brink of the worst recession in 40 years; inflation was over 12 percent; and we were still involved in the war in Vietnam.
The American people, working with me, have been able to turn this situation around, and we have made incredible progress. We are on the way to a healthy economy. Inflation is less than 6 percent; we have 4 million new jobs; 88 million people are working in America--the highest in the history of the United States.
We are out of the war in Vietnam, and we have the capability to stay at peace. And I am proud to say to you, as I say to your fellow Americans, not a single young American is fighting and dying on foreign soil today, and we are going to keep it that way.
But the progress we have made in the last 2 years is not what we need or want, but it is the foundation from which we can build. And in the next 4 years, with your support, we can build those things that will give to all of us--you in Oregon and all of the 215 million Americans in 40 other States--the quality of life that is so essential, not only for us but those to follow. And I pledge to you that in the next 4 years, we will do better than we have done, and you will be proud of America, as I am.
Thank you very, very much.
