For the last 10 months, Hillary Clinton has been traveling around the country, talking to people about what's at stake in this election—and why we need to elect a Democrat who will build on the progress we've made and keep going.
So on the night of the Iowa caucus, she thanked everyone who poured their dreams and determination into her campaign ... 
... and stopped to recognize a unique moment.


  " It is rare that we have the opportunity we have now to have a real contest of ideas. To really think hard about what the Democratic Party stands for, and what we want the future of our country to look like—if we do our part to build it."

She made it clear that this is just the beginning. 
We've still got work to do. 
She'll take on discrimination, fight for equality ... 
... and stand up to Republican attempts to take our country in the wrong direction. 
And she's not going to stop until she gets the job done.
