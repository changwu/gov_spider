    HOUSTON, Texas - One day after earning the support of Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Ted Cruz was today endorsed for President by former California Governor Pete Wilson.
Wilson, who served as Governor of California, United States Senator, and Mayor of San Diego, announced his backing at the California Republican Party Convention in San Francisco.
"The most urgent challenge facing a President in 2017 is confronting and changing the dangerous national security legacy of Barack Obama who has invited aggression and contempt from our enemies and distrust and disaffection from former allies. We dare not suffer a third Obama term. Ted Cruz is the winning candidate we need," said Wilson.
"I am honored to have the support of Governor Wilson, a solid Republican leader whose lifetime of public service demonstrates how Republicans focused on providing solutions to the challenges facing the American people can win in blue states as well as red," said Cruz.
