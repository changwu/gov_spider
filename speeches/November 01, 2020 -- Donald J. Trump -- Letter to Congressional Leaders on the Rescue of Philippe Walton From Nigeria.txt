    Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:) 
At my direction, on October 30, 2020, United States forces conducted an operation in Nigeria to rescue Mr. Philippe Walton, a United States citizen. Mr. Walton had been kidnapped on the morning of October 27, 2020, from his home in Niger. His captors transported him across the Niger border into Nigeria, demanded a ransom for his release, and threatened to kill him if his family failed to pay that ransom.
The operation was undertaken by a small number of combat equipped United States forces after the United States received reliable intelligence regarding Mr. Walton's location in Nigeria. These forces departed Nigeria on October 31, 2020, successfully completing the operation. Mr. Walton is safe and is now in the care of the United States Department of State. No United States military personnel were injured or killed during the operation.
I directed this action consistent with my responsibility to protect United States citizens both at home and abroad and in furtherance of United States national interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-148). I appreciate the support of the Congress in this action.
DONALD J. TRUMP
