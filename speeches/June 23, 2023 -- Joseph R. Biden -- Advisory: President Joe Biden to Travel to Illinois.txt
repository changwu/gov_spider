    On Wednesday, June 28, the President will travel to Chicago, Illinois. The President will deliver a major address on "Bidenomics" â€” his vision for growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top-down. These remarks will be open press.
The President will also participate in a campaign reception. This reception will be covered by the restricted out-of-town pool.
Additional details to follow.
