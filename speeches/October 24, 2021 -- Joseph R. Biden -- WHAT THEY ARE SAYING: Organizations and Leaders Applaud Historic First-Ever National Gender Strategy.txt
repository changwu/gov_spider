    On Friday, the Biden-Harris Administration announced our nation's first-ever national gender strategy. It is the first whole-of-government effort to advance gender equity and equality, marshalling the capacity of every department and agency across the federal government. The strategy addresses and advances gender equality through both domestic and foreign policy and will close gender gaps and improve lives both at home and abroad.
