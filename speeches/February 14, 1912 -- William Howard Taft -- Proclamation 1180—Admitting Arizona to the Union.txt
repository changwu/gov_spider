And Whereas said people did adopt a constitution and ask admission into the Union:
And Whereas the Congress of the United States did pass a joint resolution, which was approved on the twenty-first day of August, one thousand nine hundred and eleven, for the admission of the State of Arizona into the Union, which resolution required that, as a condition precedent to the admission of said State, the electors of Arizona should, at the time of the holding of the State election as recited in said resolution, vote upon and ratify and adopt an amendment to Section one of Article eight of their State constitution, which amendment was proposed and set forth at length in said resolution of Congress:
And Whereas it appears from information laid before me that the first general State election was held on the twelfth day of December, one thousand nine hundred and eleven, and that the returns of said Election upon said amendment were made and canvassed as in Section seven of said resolution of Congress provided:
And Whereas it further appears from information laid before me that a majority of the legal votes cast at said election upon said amendment were in favor thereof, and that the Governor of said Territory has by proclamation declared the said amendment a part of the constitution of the proposed State of Arizona:
And Whereas the Governor of Arizona has certified to me the result of said election upon said amendment and of the said general election:
And Whereas the conditions imposed by the said Act of Congress approved on the twentieth day of June, one thousand nine hundred and ten, and by the said joint resolution of Congress have been fully complied with:
Now, Therefore, I, William Howard Taft, President, of the United States of America, do, in accordance with the provisions of the Act of Congress and the joint resolution of Congress herein named, declare and proclaim the fact that the fundamental conditions imposed by Congress on the State of Arizona to entitle that State to admission have been ratified and accepted, and that the admission of the State into the Union on an equal footing with the other States is now complete.
In Testimony Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done at the City of Washington this fourteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and twelve and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and thirty-sixth.
