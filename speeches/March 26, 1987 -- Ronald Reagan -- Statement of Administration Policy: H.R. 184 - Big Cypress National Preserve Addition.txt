    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Lewis (R) FLA and 18 others)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 184. The bill would require additional Federal land acquisition costs of at least $40 million to $60 million. These increased costs cannot be justified during these times of severe budgetary restraint, particularly when Federal acquisition of the land involved is not necessary. Finally, such acquisition could be pursued through a land exchange, which might be accomplished at no direct Federal cost.
