    The National Restaurant Association sent a letter on behalf of their members to Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader McCarthy, and Leader McConnell urging them to pass the American Rescue Plan and give restaurants the assistance they desperately need.
The letter states: "The National Restaurant Association has completed our sixth national survey of our membership since the March 2020 pandemic started – drawing from restaurants of every type and in every community. The results demonstrate a continued vulnerability for the nation's second-largest private sector employer, and one that warrants prompt passage of the $25 billion Restaurant Revitalization Fund in the American Rescue Plan...."
"While many other industries have moved into a recovery phase, the restaurant industry ended last year in a double-dip recession and with 2.5 million fewer jobs. At this point, we forecast the industry has lost $255 billion in revenue..."
Help for restaurants is help for employees and communities, and a signal that our country is one step closer to turning a corner. We urge prompt passage of the American Rescue Plan.
The support from the National Restaurant Association follows a similar letter last week from over 160 business leaders supporting the Biden's American Rescue Plan, a survey from CNBC that showed 63% of small business owners support the rescue plan, and numerous polls showing bipartisan support for the plan, including a recent Navigator poll that shows 76% of Americans – and 60% of Republicans support the American Rescue Plan. This latest letter also follows the endorsement of more than 400 more bipartisan mayors across the nation.
The National Restaurant Association also joins a long list of individuals and organizations who are showing the benefits of urgent relief including Brookings, Moody's Analytics, and the Chief Economist of the International Monetary Fund.
