VP pool report #2
We arrived at our destination at 4:45pm to join the VP at the Capital Pride Festival on Pennsylvania Ave.
Pool first laid eyes on the VP as she took the stage & started speaking at 6:09pm.
She's wearing a pink jacket, white t-shirt with the word LOVE visible, white pants & white Chuck Taylors.
She ended her remarks at 6:12pm. (Quotes to come)
As she walked off the stage the crowd was chanting KA-MA-LA!
While we were waiting for the VP, we saw singer Jody Watley & Ricky Rosé, a DC-based drag king, perform.

VP Pool report #3 - Quotes
Pool did not see the VP leave.
Some quotes from the VP's remarks at the Capital Pride Festival.As always please check tape
"Happy Pride! Listen we have so much to celebrate, and we celebrate each other every day, we celebrate the progress we have made. And we celebrate the fact that we are in this to stand for what we stand for and fight for what we stand for."
"Because no one should fear going to a nightclub for fear that a terrorist might try to take them down. no one should fear going to a pride celebration because of a white supremacist. No one should fear loving who they love. our children in Texas and Florida should not fear who they are.we should not have to be dealing with 300 laws in states around our country that are attacking our LGBTQ+ brothers & sisters."
