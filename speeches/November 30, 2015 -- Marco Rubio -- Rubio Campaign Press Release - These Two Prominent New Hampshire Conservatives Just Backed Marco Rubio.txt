Team Marco added two big time New Hampshire conservatives in just the past week: Franklin Mayor Ken Merrifield and Robb Thomson, a former Commissioner of Resources and Economic Development.
Here's what Merrifield had to say about Marco:

Elections are always about creating a bright future, and Sen. Rubio has the intellect, optimism, and vision to take us there.
He is a principled conservative who has led and demonstrated command of critical issues, such as strengthening America's foreign policy, transforming higher education, and embracing the 21st century economy to create opportunities for all.
As the son of a bartender and a maid, he does not come from wealth and privilege. He not only understands the American dream, he has lived it. There is no GOP candidate better able to create a contrast with Hillary Clinton, unite our party, and win next year.
Merrifield was elected to a historic fifth consecutive term as Mayor of Franklin, N.H. earlier this year, and he previously served as Vice Chairman for the New Hampshire Republican Party.
These endorsements are a sign of major momentum in the crucial first in the primary state, and the last Super Saturday for Marco was a major grassroots success.
Find out why Merrifield and Thomson are backing Marco by reading up on his positions on foreign policy, higher education, and the 21st Century economy.
