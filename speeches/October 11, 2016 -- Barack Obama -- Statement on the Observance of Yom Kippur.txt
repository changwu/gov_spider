    I extend my best wishes for an easy and meaningful fast as Jewish communities in the United States, Israel, and around the world observe Yom Kippur. The Day of Atonement is a humble reminder to take stock of our shortcomings, but also a testament to our capacity to change and to grow, to lead a life of meaning, and to make a difference in the lives of others. Through our prayers, deeds, and character, we can do our small part to create a better future for ourselves and our world. On behalf of Michelle and our family, G'mar Chatimah Tovah.
