In case you missed it, President Obama is proposing a new energy tax — $10 on every barrel of oil.
Marco's not a fan, and he let a crowd in New Hampshire know it.


You may not have heard this, it just broke on the news. The president wants to solve transportation issues in America. Being from the left, guess what his answer — what do you think the answer was to our transportation issues? A tax! It's his answer to everything.
He wants to put a tax on Ebola. He wants to put a tax on — I'm kidding about that. That is not a real thing.
Everything is a tax. Now it is going to be a ten dollar a barrel tax. Who's going to pay that? You are. You are going to pay it.
Sure, the barrel of oil is down to 35 dollars. It's not going to be down there forever. But the tax will be. All to fund this pipe dream that he has with his high-speed this, and clean cars that. We don't need a tax for these things. Everything is about a tax. They are obsessed with taxes. We are going to fix our tax code, not make it more expensive and more complicated. I have a plan to do that.
Marco opposes all new taxes on energy, and his tax plan will fix our tax code and spur economic growth, not hold us back.
