About 3,000 people braved the cold rain to pack the Paramount Theater in Huntington Monday evening to hear Ohio Gov. John Kasich say that he was determined to prevent Republican frontrunner Donald Trump from becoming the party's presidential nominee.

"This is the first election I get to vote in, and this is the candidate I wanted to see," he said. "He's a very common-sense candidate. He has a proven record and more experience than anyone else running for president."
Marsh said he liked Kasich because the Ohio governor wouldn't continue the partisanship that has divided Congress.
"He's definitely someone who can compromise and get his ideas done as well as work both sides of the aisle," said Marsh, adding that he would not support Trump if the billionaire were to get the nomination.

Earlier in the day, Kasich had appeared at Hofstra University's David S. Mack Student Center and visited Sagamore Hill, home of Theodore Roosevelt. At the town hall he told the audience he drew strength from TR's example of "perseverance" in the face of opposition. He also recounted that when he was a teenager he'd wrangled a chance to ask President Richard Nixon a question at a public event, but he never got around to telling the Paramount crowd what he had said.
Timing was tight because Kasich was going live at 7 p.m. with Greta Van Susteren, host of Fox News' On the Record.
