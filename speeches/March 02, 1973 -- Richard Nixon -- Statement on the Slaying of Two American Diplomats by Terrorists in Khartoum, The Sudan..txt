    IT WAS with the deepest sense of grief that I have learned of the acts of terrorism which took the lives of Ambassador Cleo A. Noel and Deputy Chief of Mission George Curtis Moore. The United States is emphasizing its strong feeling that the perpetrators of this crime must be brought to justice.
This tragic event underscores once again the need for all nations to take a firm stand against the menace of international terrorism. I know the American people join me in expressing our deepest sympathy to the families of these diplomats who have given the last full measure of devotion in service to their country.
