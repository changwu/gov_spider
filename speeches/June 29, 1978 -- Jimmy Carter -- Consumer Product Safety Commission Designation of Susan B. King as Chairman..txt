    The President today announced that he will designate Susan Bennett King as Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. In announcing the designation, the President emphasized that he personally made the decision to support the 3-year reauthorization of the agency and that he backs the OMB budget recommendation for FY 1979.
King, 38, of Washington, D.C., was nominated to be a member of the Commission last January. She has also served as special assistant to the Chairman of the Federal Election Commission, as vice president of the Center for Public Financing of Elections, and as Washington director of the National Committee for an Effective Congress.
