(House Rules)
(Sen. Lincoln, D-Arkansas)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of S. 3307, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. This bill, which passed the Senate unanimously, would make significant improvements to nutrition programs that serve millions of children across our country each day. S. 3307 would help reduce hunger during the school day; improve the nutritional quality of school lunches, breakfasts, and all other food sold in schools; and achieve other important reforms to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars. Passage of this legislation also would help advance the Administration's goal of solving the problem of childhood obesity within a generation, which is at the heart of the First Lady's Let's Move! campaign. The Administration applauds the bipartisan efforts that led to Senate passage of S. 3307 and urges House passage of this legislation.
