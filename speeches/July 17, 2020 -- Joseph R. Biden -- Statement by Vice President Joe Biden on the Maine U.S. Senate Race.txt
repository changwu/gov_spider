    I want to congratulate Sara Gideon on her win in Tuesday's Democratic primary.
This November, we need to restore the soul of America by ending the Presidency of Donald Trump. To do that, I need the help of every voter in Maine.
But ending the Trump nightmare is not enough. We can't just go back to the way things were. We need to make progress on health care, the climate crisis, criminal justice reform, our courts, and so much more. And to do that, I need Sara Gideon in the U.S. Senate.
Sara has been a leader on expanding health care coverage and lowering costs. On fighting against opioids and fighting for working families. She's taken on the drug companies and she's fought for the environment.
I support Sara Gideon for U.S. Senate and hope you will too.
