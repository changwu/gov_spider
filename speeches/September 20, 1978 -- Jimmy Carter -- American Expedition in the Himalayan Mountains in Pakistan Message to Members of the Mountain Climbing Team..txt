    The American team's ascension of K2 is an inspiration to all who seek to conquer not just the highest pinnacles, but to master all that is worthy of mastery. K2 was worthy of your efforts, and you proved worthy of the attempt. I know the people of the United States, and especially Washington and California, join me in saluting you for the skill, courage and stamina exhibited in climbing the mountain that is second in height only to Everest, and perhaps second to none in difficulty. We are especially proud of James Wickwire, Lou Reichart, John Roskelley and Rick Ridgway.
Congratulations to all 14 members of the team that made this achievement possible. We are gratified for the excellent support provided by the Pakistani members, and thankful that all returned safely from this historic climb.
