    Today, Colorado Governor Jared Polis announced his endorsement of Joe Biden for President of the United States.
"I'm proud to endorse Joe Biden for president. Joe Biden has the heart and experience for this moment, and is building the broad and diverse coalition of support that is needed to unify our country. With all that is facing us, it could not be clearer -- we need a kind, empathetic, and experienced leader like Joe who has the experience to get our country back on track and start delivering for all of us on day one. I'm going to do everything I can to elect Joe Biden and I hope Coloradans all across the state will join me."
Governor Polis's endorsement builds on the wide support for Joe Biden in Colorado. Biden for President has previously announced more than 3,000 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
