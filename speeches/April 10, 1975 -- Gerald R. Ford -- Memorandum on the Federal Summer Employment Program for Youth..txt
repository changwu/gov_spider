Memorandum for Heads of Departments and Agencies
Many young Americans wall put their vacations to practical use by finding worthwhile jobs this summer. We in Government can and should help them.
I request that all Federal managers give their full support to the 1975 Federal Summer Employment Program for Youth. Young employees can be used in various capacities--as replacements for vacationing regular employees and as supplementary help in agencies experiencing increased summer workloads. They provide Government agencies with a chance to expand relationships with educational institutions and to gain a better understanding of the generation that will work for the Government in the future.
Your leadership is needed in the selection of young people from the Summer Employment Examination, agency merit staffing plans and the Federal Summer Intern Program. Since we must also continue to assure opportunities for needy youths in Government service, I am setting a general goal of one needy youth for every forty regular employees.
The Chairman of the Civil Service Commission will continue to provide guidance on all aspects of the Federal Summer Employment Program and will report to me on its performance. The support of your agency has contributed greatly to the success of this program in past years. I urge you to give this year's program your continued personal involvement.
