    Japan-U.S. Trade
Q. Mr. President, has Mr. Mori agreed to a fourth year of the trade deregulation talks with the U.S.?
President Clinton. Maybe the Prime Minister should answer that.
Prime Minister Mori. Yes, we agreed to continue the dialog for another year.
President Clinton. And I'm very pleased about that because it's, I think, been a very fruitful thing for both our countries, and I think it willâ€”the agreements we've made here at this summit, I think, will be very positive for Japan's economy and our relationship.
North Korea
Q. Mr. President, what is your assessment of North Korea's offer to curb its missile program in exchange for space exploration assistance? Is there any reason to believe that's credible?
And Mr. Prime Minister, were you reassured by that offer?
President Clinton. Well, let me say, based on what President Putin said last night in our conversations, I think that it's something that needs to be explored, and we need to see exactly what the specifics are. I think that he would agree with that, too. It's not clear to me exactly what the offer is and what is being requested and the time for it. But I think we heard enough so that there should be an attempt to determine what the facts are here, but I can't say that I'm clear enough on what the offer was to make a final judgment.
