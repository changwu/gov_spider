    I strongly endorse and have approved the decision of the Civil Aeronautics Board permitting Laker Airways to provide low-fare "Skytrain" service for 1 year between New York and London.
The Skytrain service will offer substantial new benefits to consumers. The fare from London to New York will be $101.48, and $135 from New York to London.
I believe that low-cost air service should also be available to passengers traveling within the United States. I therefore reaffirm my strong commitment to legislation currently before Congress to guarantee that proposals to offer low-fare service in domestic markets receive prompt and favorable attention by the CAB.
