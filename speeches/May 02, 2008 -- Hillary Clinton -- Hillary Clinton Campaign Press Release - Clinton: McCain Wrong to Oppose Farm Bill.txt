    Sen. McCain revealed yesterday that he would veto the farm bill; Farm bill would provide farms with disaster relief, country of origin labeling, renewable energy advances
Hillary Clinton today said that Sen. John McCain was wrong to say yesterday that he would veto the 2008 farm bill as President, noting it would provide American family farms with priorities like permanent disaster relief, country of origin labeling, renewable energy advances and rural development broadband deployment.
Yesterday, McCain told an Iowa audience, "I do not support [the farm bill]. I would veto it." McCain missed votes on the Farm Bill in 2007, and in 2002 called a farm bill critical to American family farms "an appalling breach of our federal pending responsibility."
"Rural America is struggling in the face of skyrocketing energy prices, an economic downturn and rising food prices," Clinton said. "Saying no to the farm bill would be saying no to rural America."
Senator Hillary Clinton made these remarks on the importance of the farm bill at the Mansfield-Metcalf Dinner in Butte on March 4:
"This Farm Bill needs to move and the president needs to get out of the way so that we can start taking care of rural America."
