    Des Moines, IA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following statement regarding the agreement reached by Congressional Democrats and Republicans and the White House to raise the debt ceiling:
"I commend Speaker Boehner, Leader McConnell, and the conservative leadership for moving the ball in the right direction," said Senator Santorum. "Unfortunately, this deal does not go far enough and it is not one that would have been made by a Santorum Administration because it does not accomplish the necessary goal of balancing the budget. It is also disappointing that those members of congress who want to be our president were not leaders in the legislature to advance the conservative cause. As president, I will be committed to passing a Balanced Budget Amendment to once and for all ensure we never again put our nation's fiscal health in jeopardy."
