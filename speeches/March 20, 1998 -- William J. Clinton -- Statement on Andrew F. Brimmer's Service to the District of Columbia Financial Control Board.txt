    Dr. Andrew Brimmer has contributed his considerable skills, energy, and commitment to the effort to restore the District of Columbia to financial health. Today we can say the District has started down the path toward fiscal discipline and responsibility.
The First Lady and I, along with the entire administration, would like to thank Dr. Brimmer for all he has done on behalf of the District. We are pleased that he has been able to meet his commitment to the administration to serve a 3-year term. His work for the District is the capstone of a long and distinguished career of public service.
We are grateful for Dr. Brimmer's service in this endeavor, which, at times, has been a difficult undertaking. Having worked with him during this period, I personally would like to offer Dr. Brimmer my sincere thanks and appreciation for a job well done.
