    Dear Ambassador Hills:
Pursuant to section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 (Public Law 93 - 618, 19 U.S.C. 2252), I have reviewed the Report of the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) dated December 21, 1992, concerning the results of its investigation of a petition for import relief filed by domestic producers of extruded rubber thread.
I have accepted the findings of Vice Chairman Watson and Commissioners Brunsdale and Crawford that extruded rubber thread was not being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the industry in the United States producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported articles.
This decision is to be published in the Federal Register.
Sincerely,
George Bush
