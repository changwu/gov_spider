    The sudden death of Arthur Okun has left me and countless others deeply saddened. A distinguished career has been cut short.
Art Okun was a brilliant economist who transcended the artificial boundaries between his discipline and public policy. I relied on him frequently for advice, which he gave honestly and candidly.
I especially admired his commitment to economics not as an end in itself, but as a tool to improve the lives of all Americans, especially working people and the poor.
Economics was never static to Art. It was instead a forever changing inquiry into our dynamic economic system. To read his works, to discuss problems with him, was to experience the great sweep of his mind and his constant search for practical solutions.
Art Okun was a good man and a good friend to many of us. Rosalynn and I will miss him, and I extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Suzanne, and to his sons.
