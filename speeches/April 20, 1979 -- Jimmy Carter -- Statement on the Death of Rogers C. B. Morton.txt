    Americans who care about conservation and the environment have lost a champion with the death of Rogers C. B. Morton. He fought gallantly for the outdoors he cherished. In Congress, in the Cabinet, and in politics he was both an ardent partisan and a perfect gentleman. His spirit, courage, and humor enhanced our public life and will be greatly missed.
