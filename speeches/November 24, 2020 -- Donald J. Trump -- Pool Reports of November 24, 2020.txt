Good morning from the White House on a sunny, crisp day. On the first full day of the official federal transition, President Trump has one event on his schedule: The annual Thanksgiving turkey pardon, slated for 2pm in the Rose Garden.

All quiet here otherwise, and apart from inaugural viewing construction in Lafayette Square, no outward sign of transition-related activity.

 In-town pool report #6/ full POTUS remarks 
Please check against video/official transcript. POTUS spoke for about 65 seconds.
"Well thank you very much. I just want to congratulate everybody. The stock market Dow Jones industrial average just hit 30,000 which is the highest in history. We've never broken 30,000. And that's despite everything that's taken place with the pandemic, I'm very thrilled with what's happened on the vaccine front. That's been absolutely incredible. Nothing like that has ever happened medically and I think people are acknowledging that, and it's having a big effect.But the stock market's just broken 30,000. Never been broken, that number. That's a sacred number, 30,000. Nobody thought they'd ever see it. That's the ninth time since the beginning of 2020 and it's the 48th time that we've broken records during the Trump administration and I just want to congratulate all the people within the administration that worked so hard. And most importantly I want to congratulate the people of our country, because there are no people like you. Thank you very much everybody."
