    Reaffirms authority of states to oversee water distribution
SANTA FE, NM-- Presidential candidate New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson's national press secretary Tom Reynolds today released the following statement on Richardson's water policy for America's future:
"As president, Gov. Richardson will launch a national dialogue on water issues affecting all parts of the country, including quality, conservation, efficiency and reuse. While certain areas of the country enjoy greater water supplies than others, Richardson in no way proposes federal transfers of water from one region of the nation to the other. Richardson believes firmly in keeping water in its basin of origin and of the rights of states to oversee water distribution.
"As governor of a western state, Richardson understands more than others the importance of protecting our water supplies. In New Mexico he has developed a statewide water initiative, he has created a statewide strategic water reserve, and he has created a water innovation fund and a water trust fund to invest in water conservation and production.
"As President Gov. Richardson will embrace a national water policy that will specifically help protect the authority of states and the rights of local communities throughout the country."
