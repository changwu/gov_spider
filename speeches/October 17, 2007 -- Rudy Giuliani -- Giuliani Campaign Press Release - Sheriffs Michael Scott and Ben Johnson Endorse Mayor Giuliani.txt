    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced Lee County Sheriff Michael Scott and Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson have endorsed Mayor Giuliani for President.
"When it comes to fighting crime and working for public safety, no candidate, Republican or Democrat, has a record that matches Rudy Giuliani. The nation knows how Rudy cleaned up New York City as a crime-fighting Mayor and that's exactly what we need in our next President. We're happy to have Michael and Ben join the team," said Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger, National Co-Chair of Law Enforcement for Rudy and Co-Chair of Florida Law Enforcement for Rudy.
When Mayor Giuliani took office there were almost 2,000 murders in New York City a year and more than 11,000 major crimes every week. The actions of the Mayor and his administration resulted in a 66 percent reduction in murders and an overall 56 percent drop in New York's FBI crime index between 1993 and 2001. New York's reduction far outpaced the 16 percent decline in the national crime index.
