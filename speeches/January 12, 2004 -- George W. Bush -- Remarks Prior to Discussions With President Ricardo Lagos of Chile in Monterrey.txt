    President Bush. Listen, I'm honored to be here with el Presidente de Chile, Ricardo Lagos. Mr. President, thank you for your leadership and friendship. We have had a very close working relationship. And the people of the world should take notice of the fact that Chile and America negotiated and finalized a free trade agreement, a free trade agreement which is in the interests of the people of America and the people of Chile. It's an example of the bilateral trade relationships that my Government thinks is important.
But beyond that, we've got a relationship based upon shared values. The President is a strong leader who believes in human dignity and human rights and in freedom. And for that, Mr. President, I'm grateful for your strong voice here in our neighborhood. It's good to see you again, sir. Thank you. You're looking good these days.
[At this point, President Lagos spoke in Spanish, and no translation was provided. He then continued in English.]
President Lagos. Your Spanish is improving. [Laughter]
President Bush. Thank you. I appreciate that.
