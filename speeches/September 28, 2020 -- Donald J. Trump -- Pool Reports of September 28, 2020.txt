 In-town pool report 4 -- More quotes from the truck event 
"We've been working on this very long and very hard," Potus said. "This is a really unique thing because the four wheels are -- hub motor, hub motor -- this is the only one that does this in the world. It has a lot of advantages."
Sen. Portman gave a little more detail: "This is exciting. Lordstown Ohio got a gut-punch when General Motors decided to stop making the Chevy Cruz and pulled out ... 1500 workers lost their jobs right away. ... This was the biggest employer in the Mahoning Valley, which is where Youngstown is ... We're now calling it Voltage Valley, because we not only have this pickup truck being produced at the old General Motors plant, but right next to that plant there's a new LG Chem General Motors joint venture making batteries. They're going to hire 1100 people this year. The combination of this company and the battery plant will mean we replaced about the same number of workers, but with a really interesting future which is bringing even more electric vehicle, electric technology companies. Youngstown State University is playing an active role in this, providing training on electric vehicles technology. This is a rebirth, and it's really exciting, and as you know, the president and thisadministration have been very helpful in this effort to try to bring back the jobs in the Mahoning Valley."
Peter Navarro also spoke for a few minutes. "This didn't happen by accident." When the GM plant shut down, the president and Sen. Portman "sprung into action." "This is a great partnership," he said.
"The area was devastated when General Motors moved out," Potus said. "Beyond the plant, it's incredible what's happened in the area. It's booming now. It's absolutely booming. ... It's an incredible piece of science, technology. It's going to happen now with more and more trucks. And ultimately they say you'll be able to do it for less money, and it's better, which is a good combination."
According to the Lordstown Motors website, the truck is the first all-electric in-wheel drive system, using four hub motors that are 95% efficient. More here: https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/tech
