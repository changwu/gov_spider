    
Well played, Abbi and Ilana.
In the latest episode of Comedy Central's "Broad City,"?a show about a best-friend duo navigating post-college life in New York, Ilana Glazer's character spends the day volunteering for Hillary Clinton's campaign. On her way out the door, she and her best friend, Abbi, run into a surprise guest.

The episode wasn't actually filmed at campaign headquarters in Brooklyn—but the show's producers certainly captured the office vibe. Here's what they got right (and wrong).
The decor is pretty spot on.
The "H" wall featured in last night's episode is a dead ringer for the one at HQ—right down to the Post-its.

What's on the Post-its? Dozens of handwritten reminders from staffers and visitors about the things we're fighting for.

And just like the "Broad City" set, Hillary for America's walls are filled with logos, posters, and other campaign knick-knacks.


But the office isn't quite as sleek or spacious as Broad City makes it out to be.
At the real HQ, you'll find people working on every available surface.
Filing cabinets double as standing desks, and the hallways are pop-up conference rooms.

Our "refreshments bar" looks a little different.

And when it comes to office attire, we keep it pretty casual.
What can we say? The hours are long.


One thing the show got absolutely right: You can (and should) come volunteer at Hillary HQ—or at a field office near you! Click here to join us.
