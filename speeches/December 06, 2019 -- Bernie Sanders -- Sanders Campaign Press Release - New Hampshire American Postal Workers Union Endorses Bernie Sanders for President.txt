    WASHINGTON â€“ The statewide organization of the American Postal Workers Union (APWU) today endorsed Bernie Sanders for President following a unanimous vote by the union's board. Just days earlier, the board and members of APWU Local 230 of Manchester, also voted unanimously on a resolution for his endorsement. Sanders has triple the national union endorsements of any other candidate, marking his strength as the candidate of the working class and organized labor.
"Bernie Sanders has demonstrated a vast understanding of the issues that impact postal workers," said New Hampshire APWU Legislative Director, Janice Kelble. "Throughout his entire career, he has fought to maintain Public Postal Services and advocated for the enhancement of postal services, both as a member of the House of Representatives and as a member of the United States Senate. He not only votes the right way on legislation, but he has introduced meaningful legislation to achieve much needed postal reform."
"We are extremely pleased to support the candidate who has always stood with workers", added statewide President of New Hampshire APWU Dana Coletti
This endorsement from the NH APWU is demonstrative of Bernie's strong relationship with labor. The APWU endorsement closely follows those from other major labor groups including from the United Teachers Los Angeles (UTLA), National Nurses United (NNU), Boston Independent Drivers Guild (BIDG), United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America (UE), and National Union of Healthcare Workers (NUHW).
Sanders is a strong, unwavering advocate for unions across all sectors. Sanders has the most thorough and extensive plan of any presidential hopeful to strengthen the rights of American workers and the labor movement, laid out in his Workplace Democracy Plan.
