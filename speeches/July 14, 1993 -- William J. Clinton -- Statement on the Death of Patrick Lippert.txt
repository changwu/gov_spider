    I am deeply saddened by the untimely death of one of America's brightest young leaders, Patrick Lippert. An activist for many years, most recently Patrick launched Rock the Vote, an organization that reinvigorated an entire generation's interest in our democratic process by rallying them to vote in the past election, many for the first time. Rock the Vote will continue to serve as a political forum for countless new generations of young Americans to come, thanks in large part to Patrick.
Many remarkable Americans have accomplished far less than Patrick did in his 35 years. As executive director of Rock the Vote, he helped to conceive of and then to pass the motor voter bill, which will make registering to vote much easier for millions of Americans. I was honored to have Patrick at my side 6 weeks ago as I signed the bill into law.
Patrick's friends knew him as a tireless and selfless fighter for the rights of people he never even knew. His concern for people and for his country was profound. He will be sorely missed by all of us who were inspired by his relentless fight for change. His passing should serve as a reminder that we must rededicate ourselves to the ideals he stood for.
