    Throughout his career, David Pryor has been a champion of America's finest values. He is a fierce advocate for our children and the elderly and a ready voice for the cause of reason. From the State legislature and the Governor's office in Arkansas to the U.S. Congress, he has served our country from the bottom of his heart and in the best possible way. His retirement from the Senate will be a loss felt by us all.
I know I can continue to count on David's exceptional counsel, both as a valued adviser and a trusted friend. I look forward to his continued active involvement in the business of our Nation.
