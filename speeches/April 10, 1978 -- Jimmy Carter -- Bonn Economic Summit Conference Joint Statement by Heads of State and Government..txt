    The Heads of State and Government of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America have agreed to hold the next Summit meeting in Bonn at the invitation of Chancellor Schmidt on July 16 and 17. The European Community will be represented by the President of the Council and the President of the Commission in sessions dealing with matters within the Community's competence. The meeting will provide an occasion for the participants to review the world economic situation and to give impetus to national and international approaches that can contribute to a healthier world economy.
The world faces serious and interrelated economic problems. Their resolution requires approaches in various areas that, taken together, will reinforce each other in improving the economic situation. The interrelated issues to be addressed include the achievement of more rapid global growth with further progress in reducing inflation, energy, trade, international monetary matters, and the cooperation between industrial and developing countries. These issues must be tackled by individual countries in a mutually supportive manner. The Summit participants will work to this end in developing their policies and in preparing for the July meeting.
