    I am honored to address you, the people of Kenya and Tanzania. On behalf of all the American people, I extend our deepest condolences to the families and the friends of those Kenyans and Tanzanians who perished in the tragic attacks in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
Some of them worked alongside Americans at our Embassies, making vital contributions to our common efforts, and we are very grateful for their service. Others were nearby, working hard, as they did every day. All of these men and women were important to America, because we cherish our friendship with your peoples. We have long admired the achievements of your citizens and the beauty of your lands. All three of our nations have lost beloved sons and daughters, and so many, many more were injured. We pray, too, for their speedy recovery.
Let me express America's profound gratitude for your extraordinary efforts, with Americans and others, to respond to this shared tragedy, pulling people from the wreckage, aiding the wounded, searching for evidence as to who committed these terrible acts.
Violent extremists try to use bullets and bombs to derail our united efforts to bring peace to every part of this Earth. We grieve together, but I am proud that our nations have also renewed our commitment to stand together, to bring the offenders swiftly to justice, to combat terrorism in all its forms and to create a more tolerant and more peaceful world for our children.
