    President Trump. Thank you very much, everybody. It's a great honor to be with President Putin, his representatives, my representatives.
We have many things to discuss, including trade and including some disarmament and someâ€”a little protectionism, perhaps, in a very positive way. And we're going to discuss a lot of different things.
We've had great meetings. We have had a very, very good relationship. And we look forward to spending some pretty good time together. A lot of very positive things going to come out of the relationship.
So, Vladimir, thank you very much. Thank you.
President Putin. Thank you, Mr. President.
Well, I cannot but agree with Mr. President. We have something to discuss here. All the topics have been outlined. We haven't seen each other since Helsinki meeting, although our teams have been together working, and they gave us a great opportunity to follow up on that.
Thank you very much, both teams, for that. Thank you for your attention.
President Trump. Thank you very much. Thank you.
