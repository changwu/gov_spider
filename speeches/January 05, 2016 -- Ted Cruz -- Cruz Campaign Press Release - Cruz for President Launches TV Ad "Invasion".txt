    HOUSTON, Texas – The Cruz for President campaign today announced a new TV ad, "Invasion", highlighting the impact of illegal immigration on American jobs. The ad makes the point by showing men and women dressed in business clothes running across the border as Cruz describes how the immigration debate would take on a different tone if those illegally entering the country were taking the jobs of lawyers, bankers, or journalists.
Cruz notes that as President he will triple the border patrol, build a wall that works, and make securing the border a top priority. The ad will run statewide in New Hampshire beginning January 5. The ad may be viewed here.

CRUZ: I understand that when the mainstream media covers immigration, it doesn't often see it as an economic issue. But I can tell you, it is a very personal economic issue.
And I will say, the politics of it would be very, very different if a bunch of lawyers or bankers were coming across the Rio Grande...
...Or if a bunch of people with journalism degrees were coming over and driving down the wages in the press. Then we would see stories about the economic calamity that is befalling our nation.
If I'm elected president, we will triple the Border Patrol. We will build a wall that works. We will secure the border.
I'm Ted Cruz and I approve this message.
