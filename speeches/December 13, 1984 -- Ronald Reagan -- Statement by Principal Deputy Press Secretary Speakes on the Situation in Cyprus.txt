    The United States welcomes the announcement late yesterday by United Nations Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar that the two Cypriot communities have agreed to participate in a summit meeting in January. We view this as a very positive development, one that would create new opportunities to end the division of Cyprus and establish a reunited Cypriot Government.
Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar will have our full support as he works toward a settlement, and the United States Government extends its sincere appreciation for his efforts.
