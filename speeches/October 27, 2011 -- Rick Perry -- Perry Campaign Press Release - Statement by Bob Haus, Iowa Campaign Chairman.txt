    WEST DES MOINES, Iowa - Campaign Chairman Bob Haus today released the following statement:
"For almost 65 years, Iowa has been a proud right to work state. Gov. Romney's flip-flops on right to work laws was just plain wrong. When presented with a chance to be a leader and to stand up for workers and taxpayers, he shrugged his shoulders and looked the other way. In doing so, he undercut what has been a cornerstone of Iowa's economic growth and individual freedoms for the past 65 years. Gov. Romney may have shrugged off right to work protections, but Iowans took key note."
