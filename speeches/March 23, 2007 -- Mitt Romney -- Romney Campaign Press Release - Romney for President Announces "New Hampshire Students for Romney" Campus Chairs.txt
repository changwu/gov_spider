Boston, MA â€“ Today, Romney for President announced the formation of "New Hampshire Students for Romney," a grassroots group that will help Governor Romney spread his vision for change in Washington to college campuses around the Granite State.
Together, these eleven young leaders will serve as Students for Romney Campus Chairs at their respective colleges and universities.
"These young leaders will be at the center of our efforts to organize and harness the support that Governor Romney enjoys among students at New Hampshire's colleges and universities," said Bruce Keough, New Hampshire State Chair of Romney for President. "As the Governor's campaign gathers momentum in New Hampshire and around the nation, we look forward to tapping the enthusiasm and resourcefulness of our student supporters."
"Governor Romney's success in reforming government to make it smaller and more efficient resonates with students who are worried that runaway federal spending will saddle our generation with a cumbersome bureaucracy and a big tax bill," said Christopher DuPuy, Campus Co-Chair at Southern New Hampshire University. "From Asian competition to the Jihadist threat, America is facing a new generation of challenges that call out for an innovative and energetic leader like Governor Romney."
