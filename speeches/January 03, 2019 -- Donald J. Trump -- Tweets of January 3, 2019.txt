The Shutdown is only because of the 2020 Presidential Election. The Democrats know they can't win based on all of the achievements of 'Trump' so they are going all out on the desperately needed Wall and Border Security - and Presidential Harassment. For them strictly politics!Retweets: 30482Favorites: 129182

The United States Treasury has taken in MANY billions of dollars from the Tariffs we are charging China and other countries that have not treated us fairly. In the meantime we are doing well in various Trade Negotiations currently going on. At some point this had to be done!Retweets: 22311Favorites: 106376
