    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced the endorsement of the New York 10-13 Associations of America. New York 10-13 is a national organization of retirees and active members of the New York City Police Department. Its membership totals more than 18,000.
Mayor Giuliani received today's endorsement at a press conference in Sarasota, Florida. It was attended by Richard Carroll, the Associations' Chief of Operations, and Leonard Letizia, the Associations' Assistant Chairman and Political Coordinator.
"Mayor Giuliani was a tremendous advocate for the needs of New York City's policemen," said Carroll. "Under Rudy, New York's police force increased by thousands, crime was cut in half, murders were reduced by two-thirds and the city was transformed. Our Associations are proud to endorse Rudy Giuliani for President for all he has done for New York's police officers. He will be a great advocate for all active duty and retired policemen and other first responders across the country."
"I'm honored to receive the endorsement and support of the 10-13," Mayor Giuliani said. "The Associations' work representing the retired police officers of New York is incredibly important. I look forward to their involvement in my campaign."
