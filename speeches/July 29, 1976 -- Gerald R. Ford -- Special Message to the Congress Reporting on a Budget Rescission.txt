    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith propose rescission of $45 million in budget authority appropriated for payment to the Legal Services Corporation.
Approval of this rescission proposal will reduce Federal spending by $45 million over 1977 and 1978. The proposed rescission would prevent unneeded expansion of Legal Services Corporation activities and delay greater geographic coverage until program evaluations are completed.
The details of the proposed rescission are contained in the attached report.
