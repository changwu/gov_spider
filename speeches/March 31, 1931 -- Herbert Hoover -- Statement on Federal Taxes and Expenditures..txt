    THE PRESIDENT said:
"There will be no increases in taxes if the next Congress imposes no increases upon the budget or other expenditure proposals which the administration will present. But for Congress to do this the people must cooperate to effectively discourage and postpone consideration of the demands of sectional and group interests."
