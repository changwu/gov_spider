    The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) is a groundbreaking initiative that encourages all nations to embrace political and economic reform and has enjoyed bipartisan support since I announced it 2 years ago. The powerful combination of trade, open markets, and good government is history's proven method to defeat poverty on a large scale, to vastly improve health and education, to build a modern infrastructure while safeguarding the environment, and to spread liberty and enterprise.
Already, the MCA has encouraged countries to govern justly, invest in their people, and promote economic freedom. The MCA will support these efforts, helping the poorest countries seize the opportunities of the global economy and meet the needs of their people for better health and education, cleaner water, and a brighter future. I urge Congress to ensure that the MCA can fulfill its promise as a bold new vision for international development and a powerful expression of the generous spirit of the American people.
