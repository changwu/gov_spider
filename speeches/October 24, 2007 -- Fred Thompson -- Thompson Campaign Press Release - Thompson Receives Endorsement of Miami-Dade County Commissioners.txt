McLean, VA - Today Fred Thompson received the endorsement of two experienced members of the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners. Commissioner Natacha Seijas and Commissioner Joe Martinez have both announced their support for Fred Thompson for President of the United States.
Commissioner Natacha Seijas was elected to the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners in 1993, becoming the first Hispanic woman to be elected to the County Commission. Representing the Hialeah, Miami Lakes, Palm Springs and Country Club regions, she serves as Chairperson of the Infrastructure and Land Use Committee and was recently appointed to the Governmental Structure Task Force.
"I am proud to support Senator Fred Thompson," said Commissioner Seijas. "His strong commitment to conservative principles and values and his dedication to free markets and reduction of government waste will be of great benefit to the state of Florida and this nation."
Commissioner Joe Martinez has served the residents of District 11 since October 2000. In November 2004 he served as Chairman of the Board of County Commissioners, the first Hispanic elected to hold this leadership role. A 17-year veteran of the Miami-Dade Police Department, Martinez currently chairs the Budget and Finance Committee.
"Fred Thompson is the right man to lead this nation as we face increased challenges," said Commissioner Martinez. "He has the necessary leadership qualities, experience, and judgment to strengthen our economy and protect this nation from global threats."
"We are pleased to have the support of Commissioner Seijas and Commissioner Martinez," said Randy Enwright, National Political Director. "I admire the leadership they have provided over the years to Miami-Dade County and the state of Florida, and I look forward to working with them to spread Senator Thompson's message across Florida and throughout the nation."
