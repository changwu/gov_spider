    Dear Jim:
I have completed my review of the report from the Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident. I believe that a program must be undertaken to implement its recommendations as soon as possible. The procedural and organizational changes suggested in the report will be essential to resuming effective and efficient Space Transportation System operations, and will be crucial in restoring U.S. space launch activities to full operational status.
Specifically, I would like NASA to report back to me in 30 days on how and when the Commission's recommendations will be implemented. This report should include milestones by which progress in the implementation process can be measured.
Let me emphasize, as I have done so many times, that the men and women of NASA and the tasks that they so ably perform are essential to the nation if we are to retain our leadership in the pursuit of technological and scientific progress.
Despite misfortunes and setbacks, we are determined to press on in our space programs. Again, Jim, we turn to you for leadership. You and the NASA team have our support and our blessings to do what has to be done to make our space program safe, reliable, and a source of pride to our nation and of benefit to all mankind.
I look forward to receiving your report on implementing the Commission's recommendations.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
