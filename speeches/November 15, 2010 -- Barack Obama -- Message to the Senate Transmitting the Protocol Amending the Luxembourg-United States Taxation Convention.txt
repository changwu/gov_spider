    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to its ratification, the Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital, signed on May 20, 2009, at Luxembourg (the "proposed Protocol") and a related agreement effected by the exchange of notes also signed on May 20, 2009. I also transmit for the information of the Senate the report of the Department of State, which includes an Overview of the proposed Protocol and related agreement.
The proposed Protocol and related agreement provide for more robust exchange of information between tax authorities in the two countries to facilitate the administration of each country's tax laws. They generally follow the current U.S. Model Income Tax Convention and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development standards for exchange of tax information.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the proposed Protocol and related agreement and give its advice and consent to their ratification.
