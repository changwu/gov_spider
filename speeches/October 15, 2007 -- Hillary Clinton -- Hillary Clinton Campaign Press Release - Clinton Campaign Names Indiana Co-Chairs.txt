    The Clinton Campaign today announced seven leading Hoosiers as Indiana Co-Chairs.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to deliver the change this country needs," said Indiana House Speaker B. Patrick Bauer.
"Her 35-year record fighting for children and families makes Hillary uniquely qualified to be President and hit the ground running on her first day in office," said former Indiana First Lady Judy O'Bannon.
"We need a leader with Hillary's ability to end the war in Iraq, provide universal health care for every American and move us towards energy independence," said State Senator Vi Simpson.
"We've seen growing support in Indiana, and I'm honored that these community leaders are joining our effort to change America," Clinton said.
The group joins Campaign Co-Chair Senator Evan Bayh and Indiana Co-Chair and former Secretary State of Joseph Hogsett in leading Hillary's Hoosier campaign effort.
