    The President yesterday declared a major disaster exists in the State of Washington and ordered federal aid to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the area affected by wildfires and mudslides during the period of August 9 to September 10, 2015.
Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the wildfires and mudslides in the counties of Chelan, Ferry, Lincoln, Okanogan, Pend Oreille, Stevens, Whatcom, and Yakima and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures in all areas within the state.
W. Craig Fugate, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Thomas J. Dargan as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
FEMA said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
