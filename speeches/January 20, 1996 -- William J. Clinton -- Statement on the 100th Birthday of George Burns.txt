    Hillary and I extend our warmest wishes for a wonderful birthday to one of the most talented entertainers of our time. George Burns' knowing smile and dry wit have touched the hearts and funny bones of three generations. His impeccable timing breathed life into the mundane, and his clever humor crystallized many ageless skits. His youthful attitude, now a century old, continues to inspire us today. We send him all our best on this happy occasion.
