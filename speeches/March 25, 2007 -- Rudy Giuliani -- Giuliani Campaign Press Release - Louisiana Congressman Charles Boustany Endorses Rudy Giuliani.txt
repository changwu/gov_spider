    Following Senator David Vitter's recent announcement of support, the Rudy Giuliani Presidential Exploratory Committee announced another major Louisiana endorsement today. Congressman Charles Boustany will support Rudy Giuliani for President.
"As a Republican and a conservative, I know Rudy Giuliani is the best choice to be the next president," Dr. Boustany said. "On the most important issues of ensuring our national security and protecting our families, keeping taxes low and making government more efficient, Mayor Giuliani's record speaks for itself and his leadership is exactly what we need in the White House."
Senator David Vitter, the Giuliani campaign's Southern Regional Chairman, welcomed the support from another member of the Louisiana delegation. "I am thrilled to have Representative Boustany join Team Rudy and help with our efforts in the south. Together we will work aggressively to communicate the Mayor's optimistic vision and proven record of leadership."
"Congressman Boustany is a respected leader in his state and I welcome his support as part of our growing team in Louisiana and in the south," Mayor Giuliani said.
Congressman Boustany was first elected to represent Louisiana's 7th District in 2004 and is currently serving his second term. A conservative Republican, Boustany has been credited for his focus on healthcare and work to address needs of constituents following Hurricanes Rita and Katrina. Prior to his time in the U.S. House of Representatives, Dr. Boustany, a noted heart surgeon, headed a successful medical practice in southwest Louisiana.
