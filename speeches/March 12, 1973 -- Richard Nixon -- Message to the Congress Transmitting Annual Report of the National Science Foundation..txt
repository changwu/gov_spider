    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit to the Congress the Twenty-Second Annual Report of the National Science Foundation, covering the fiscal year 1972.
During the period covered by this report, the Foundation continued to make an important contribution to the strengthening of our economy and our society through science. It increased its support for scientific research in all disciplines and further expanded its involvement in research focused on domestic problems.
The report should be of special interest to the Congress at this time, in view of the additional responsibilities that would be transferred to the Director of the National Science Foundation from the Office of Science and Technology by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1973, which I proposed last month. I believe that this account of the Foundation's outstanding work during 1972 helps to confirm its fitness to undertake a broader role in the national science effort in 1973.
