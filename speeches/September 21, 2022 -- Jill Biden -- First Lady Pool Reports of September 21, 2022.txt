The First Lady and Queen Letizia's Cancer Efforts: The First Lady and Queen Letizia share a commitment to supporting cancer patients and their families, and ensuring that patients from all communities are represented in cancer research. In June 2022, ahead of the NATO Summit, the First Lady and Queen Letizia visited the AECC's offices in Madrid to discuss its support for patients and cancer research, including international research collaborations. Queen Letizia has a prominent and visible role in the fight against cancer and in 2010 assumed the Honorary Presidency of the AECC.
Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC)The Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC) is the home for cancer research and patient care at Columbia University and New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC). HICCC's cancer center researchers and physicians are dedicated to understanding the complex biology behind cancer, from before it begins to its evolution and spread. The center applies that knowledge to the discovery and design of innovative cancer therapies and prevention strategies that reduce the disease's incidence and progression and improve the quality of life. HICCC's mission is to empower innovation and discovery in cancer research, prevention, early detection, therapy, and survivorship to reduce the burden of cancer for its patients, its community, and the world.

Community Outreach and Engagement:

The First Lady and Queen Letizia will learn about the center's catchment area (the area from which the cancer center mostly draws its patients); cancer health disparities within its catchment area; and the center's community outreach and engagement programs, including "YES in THE HEIGHTS," its National Cancer Institute-funded cancer research summer internship program for local underrepresented high school and undergraduate students. The First Lady and Queen Letizia will hear from:

Dr. Mary Beth Terry, a cancer epidemiologist who focuses on cancer prevention and directs the center's community outreach and engagement
Ceyda Topcu, a high school senior from Staten Island who participated in the "YES in THE HEIGHTS" program this summer






Efforts to Promote Diversity in Clinical Trials

The First Lady and Queen Letizia will learn about HICCC's designation and activities as an NCI Minority/Underserved Community Oncology Research Program (MU-NCORP) site; and its other efforts to promote diversity in clinical trials, including how its clinical trial nurse navigators work to make clinical trials accessible to people who live in the neighborhoods near the center. The First Lady and Queen Letizia will hear from:

Dr. Andrew Lassman, who leads HICCC's clinical trials
Mario Sambula, a prostate cancer patient who participated in a clinical trial at HICCC
Brianne Bodin, an Oncology Research Nurse Manager and former clinical trials nurse navigator






Global Collaboration on Cancer Research

The First Lady and Queen Letizia will learn about HICCC's collaboration with cancer researchers in Spain and the Dominican Republic. The First Lady and Queen Letizia will hear from:

Dr. Raul Rabadan, who works to solve pressing biomedical problems through quantitative computational models and collaborates with researchers at the Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO)
Dr. Chin Hur, who leads cross-cultural trainings with Dominican Republic medical personnel to enhance the quality of cancer care for diverse populations, including the Dominican population in Washington Heights and other communities in New York City





Background on Dr. Biden's cancer advocacy efforts: As First Lady, Dr. Biden works to support cancer patients, survivors, and their loved ones as they navigate their cancer journey. The President and First Lady reignited the Cancer Moonshot with the goal to reduce the death rate from cancer by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years, and improve the experience of people and their families living with and surviving cancer — and, by doing this and more, end cancer as we know it. In 1993, after four of her friends were diagnosed with breast cancer, Dr. Biden started the Biden Breast Health Initiative in Delaware, which educated more than 10,000 high school girls about the importance of early detection of breast cancer. As Second Lady, Dr. Biden continued to stress the importance of breast cancer research and early detection. Following the Obama-Biden Administration, then-former Vice President Biden and Dr. Biden continued their cancer work through the Biden Foundation and the Biden Cancer Initiative.As First Lady she continues her work emphasizing early detection efforts and the patient, family and caregiver experience with cancer. She has also focused on the importance of cancer screenings, especially those delayed or put off due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She has encouraged government partners, the business community, and non-profit sectors to help make screenings more accessible and available to all.In addition to the First Lady's engagement with Queen Letizia in June, she has engaged in the following internationally-focused cancer efforts:
· May 2022: The First Lady visited the National Children's Hospital of Costa Rica to celebrate the finalization of memoranda of understanding between Costa Rica's public health authority, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Through this research collaboration, Costa Rican pediatric cancer patients will have access to a novel cancer immunotherapy treatment – CAR T-cell therapy – and Costa Rican medical personnel will receive training opportunities.
· March 2022: The First Lady visited St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, to learn about St. Jude's research initiatives and supportive services for patients and their families. Dr. Biden also greeted with Ukrainian pediatric cancer patients and families who were brought to St. Jude. Many Ukrainian pediatric cancer patients were displaced by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Background on the Cancer Moonshot:As Vice President, in 2016, Joe Biden led the Cancer Moonshot with the mission to accelerate the rate of progress against cancer. The cancer advocacy, patient, research and health care communities responded with tremendous energy and ingenuity. Now, President Biden has reignited the Cancer Moonshot and set a new national goal: if we work together, we can cut the death rate from cancer by at least 50% over the next 25 years, and improve the experience of people and their families living with and surviving cancer.

FLOTUS pool report #2 - tour color and remarks starting
Remarks from Dr. Biden and Queen Letizia are starting shortly and being live streamed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shm0rrq2BXo
During the tour of the center, which had three stops, Dr. Biden and Queen Letizia met with researchers, patients, and students studying STEM under a local program.
They shook hands with all and asked several questions about the research, how the patients were doing and what the students were working on. Pool was a few feet away and it was hard to hear everything.
Dr. Biden asked the students how they got interested in science and if they had family members who suffered from cancer.
One girl told her she originally wanted to be a nurse but now wanted to do research after joining the YES in the Heights program, which is the program that promotes STEM education.
"Go for the doctorate," Dr. Biden told her.
"It's so great to see young women going into stem fields," Dr. Biden said and joked she'd rather see them become an English teacher.
And when she talked with researchers who were doing computer modeling on cancer rates, Dr. Biden said: "We got to work harder and we've got to work faster."
After the tour the two took photos with students in the YES education program. Students introduced themselves in English and Spanish. Dr. Biden asked the students how they got involved in the program. It was hard to hear the conversation and answers.
Dr. Biden didn't respond to a question on whether she'd visit migrants while in New York.

FLOTUS pool report #3 - remarks and wrap
At the top of her remarks, Dr. Biden spoke of Puerto Rico:
"I, like, all Americans, I want to say that my heart is with the people of Puerto Rico, who are coping with Hurricane Fiona. You are not alone, or forgotten. We stand with you. And we will do everything we can to help you rebuild."
She talked about her visit to Spain in June and how Queen Letizia, whom she called "my dear friend," invited her to see research efforts there.
"After my visit, I wanted to bring the Queen here to see what we are doing here in the United States through the Cancer Moonshot, especially as the Columbia Cancer Center works closely with researchers" in Spain.
"None of us can beat cancer alone. It takes all of us sharing our best ideas and practices, working together to ease the burden on patients and their families, and creating the kind of care that saves lives."
"We can give our people the future they deserve no matter where they call home. Together we can end cancer as we know it."
After her speech, Dr. Biden didn't respond to a question on whether she would visit Puerto Rico.
She and the Queen walked out together after their remarks. They are departing separately and pool did not see departure.
That's a wrap folks. Let me know if you have any questions.
