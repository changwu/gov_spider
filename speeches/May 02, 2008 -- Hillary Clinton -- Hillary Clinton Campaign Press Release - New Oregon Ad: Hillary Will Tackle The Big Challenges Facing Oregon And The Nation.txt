Hillary Clinton: Oregon knows that with bold ideas there's no challenge we can't meet.
We can transform our energy future by making the oil companies invest in new clean energy and create millions of new green jobs.
We can end No Child Left Behind and have affordable health coverage for every single American
And we can start bringing our troops home from Iraq within the first 60 days.
It's going to take a fighter to meet these challenges. If you give me the chance, together, we'll turn our country around.
I'm Hillary Clinton and I approved this message.
