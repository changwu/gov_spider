    Current and Former Members of Congress
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY): "Gina Haspel is a tremendous choice to lead the Central Intelligence Agency. She would bring more direct, hard-earned experience to the role of @CIA director than any leader in the agency's history."
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC): "[Haspel is] without a doubt, the most qualified person the president could have chosen to lead the CIA and the most prepared nominee in its 70-year history."

Marco Rubio (R-FL): "Gina Haspel is a career intelligence officer who has served over 30 years with the CIA, and combated both communist threats and terrorist organizations like Al-Qaeda and ISIS. She is perhaps the most highly qualified person ever nominated for this crucial national security position. Her nomination has the support of six former CIA Directors who have served under presidents of both parties, and I look forward to her rapid confirmation on the Senate floor."
Sen. Jim Risch (R-ID): "I have known Ms. Haspel for the 10 years I have been on the Committee and have had the opportunity to work with her over the years and even visit her out in the field.

Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT): "It's time to put the destructive partisanship aside and confirm Gina Haspel as CIA Director."

Rep. Ann Wagner (R-MO): "It is time for Senate Dems to stop playing political games with our national security & support the nomination of Gina Haspel, the first woman ever nominated to be @CIA Director. She is a distinguished 33yr career veteran of the agency & extremely qualified to lead her peers."
Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-ND): "Acting Director Haspel is a dedicated public servant who has demonstrated she is qualified to head the CIA.
