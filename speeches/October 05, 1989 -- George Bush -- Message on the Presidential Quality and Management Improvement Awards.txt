    Message to Civilian and Military Personnel
I would like to ask you to join me in a partnership to improve Government operations and services to the public. I know from my own experiences in Government that Federal civilian and military personnel make critical differences every day in how well and how efficiently Government organizations provide essential public services. Because of the urgent need to reduce the Federal deficit, it is of vital importance that each of us explore ways to improve not only our own performance, but also that of our organizations.
Accordingly, I have asked that heads of Federal agencies actively use their awards authorities to encourage and to recognize those individuals and groups whose ideas and other achievements significantly improve the quality and efficiency of Government. Further, I have requested that they inform me concerning major cost-saving achievements as well as other efforts that significantly improve the quality of services provided to our citizens so that I might add my personal thanks through letters of commendation and granting Presidential Quality and Management Improvement Awards.
In addition to reducing the Federal deficit, I want to challenge everyone in Government to find ways of improving the quality of services and products without increasing their costs. All of us in Government service can make a difference. Therefore, I ask that each of you work with me in making these goals a reality.
I look forward to learning about your accomplishments and recognizing personally those individuals whose efforts support our objectives of improving services to our citizens and reducing the cost of Government operations. With your participation, I am confident that we can continue to provide our citizens the very best services of any Government in the world.
George Bush
