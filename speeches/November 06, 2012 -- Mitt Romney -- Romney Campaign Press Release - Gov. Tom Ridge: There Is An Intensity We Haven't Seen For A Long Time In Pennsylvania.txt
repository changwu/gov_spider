GOV. TOM RIDGE: "The notion that you had a president that really understood the value of taking advantage of the natural gifts we have with coal and natural gas is very appealing to them. And they're a very patriotic state, obviously as we all are, but the notion that we would be less dependent on foreign sources is very important. And I think you are going to see a different turnout in the collar counties in Philadelphia as well. I don't think the folks in those counties, Bucks, Montgomery, et cetera, particularly care for the divisive nature of this presidency, the class warfare. A lot of them have sons and daughters that graduated from college who can't find a job. So you pull these things together and there is an intensity and an excitement as evidenced by the 30,000 people in 45 degree weather on Sunday night we haven't seen in Pennsylvania in a long, long time."
