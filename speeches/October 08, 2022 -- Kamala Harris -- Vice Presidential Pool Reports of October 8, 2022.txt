VP travel pool #3 - VP remarks at LBJ Library
VP was asked eight questions about reproductive rights by moderators Mini Timmaraju, President of NARAL Pro-Choice America, Julieta Garibay, Senior Capacity Building Director for Groundswell Fund and audience members, who had previously submitted questions.
The VP spoke about reproductive rights in the context of her family history (her mother was an advocate for access to reproductive health as a breast cancer researcher) , her works as a prosecutor in California and California senator and the efforts of the Biden/Harris administration.
VP mentioned the importance of speaking on reproductive rights at the LBJ Library, given former President Lyndon B Johnson's impact on voting and civil rights. Luci Baines Johnson, the former president's daughter, was in attendance.
VP said that people don't need to abandon their beliefs to know that the government should not be making reproductive health decisions. The crowd applauded to this remark.
VP said the Biden/Harris admin is working with DOJ to collaborate with state Attorney Generals to ensure Americans have a right to travel. Harris made a point to single out Texas AG Ken Paxton as one state leader that the Biden/Harris administration is has not worked with.
VP made a point of championing young leaders and their role in advocating for reproductive rights. She said it was critical to build coalitions with other groups who are seeing attacks on their rights (LGBTQ+, women and voting rights in general). VP pointed to the work of advocates in Kansas who rejected a proposal to restrict reproductive access. "I'm so in awe of those people in Kansas who said, 'Mhhmhh, we're not having it,'" said the VP.
Additional quotes:
"I have someone who's close to me, whose sister-in-law, just a couple of weeks ago, who died in childbirth. This is 2022 in America." said VP when asked by an audience member sitting in the front about what the Biden/Harris administration is doing to address disparities in maternal mortality rates. VP said Black women in Texas are three times more likely to die in childbirth than white women, regardless of education or socioeconomic status. After answering the question, VP smiled at the questioner who appeared to be a young woman and said that they needed her efforts to keep fighting for reproductive rights.
"Let's take the flag back, this is about freedom and liberty," VP said in response to a question from Timmaraju about how she views the fight for abortion moving forward.
"A democracy will be as strong as our willingness to fight for it," said VP in response to a question about what makes her hopeful for the future, a question submitted by an audience member.

VP travel pool report #4 - Preview of VP's speech
VP arrived at the Hyatt Regency Hotel just before 5 p.m. for the Johnson-Jordan Reception hosted by the Texas Democrats.
A preview of the VP's speech was shared on background from a Democratic official:

On Saturday, October 7th, 31 days from the midterm elections, Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver the keynote address at the sold out Texas Democratic Party's Johnson-Jordan Dinner.


As she has done throughout her travel across the nation, the Vice President is expected to acknowledge and condemn Governor Abbott's extremist attacks on voting rights and reproductive rights, following the lead of replicating national Republican leaders' attacks on freedom and liberty.

Currently, there are 2 abortion laws in effect in Texas:

Under the trigger law, abortion is banned in Texas from the point of fertilization, with no exceptions for rape or incest. Under this law, performing an abortion is a felony punishable up to life imprisonment.
In 2021, prior to the Dobbs decision, Gov. Abbott signed SB 8 into law, which is a six-week ban with no exceptions for rape or incest. It allows private citizens to bring suit against health care providers or facilitators of abortions.




In 2021, Gov. Abbott signed a sweeping voting law (SB 1), which:

Bans 24-hour and drive-through voting;
Requires mail ballots to include a driver's license number or the last four of a Social Security Number on the ballot envelope;
Expands the power of partisan poll watchers and constrains election workers' ability to stop harassment by poll watchers.






The Vice President will also praise the Democratic Texas legislators "principled protest" opposing SB1 that she describes as "full on attack on voting rights"

"You all came to the White House because you knew this was not only a Texas fight—this was a national fight. And even though SB1 passed—you demonstrated the grit that real leaders in Texas are made of.




As we head into the final month before the midterm elections, the Vice President will also remind Democrats of the accomplishments they made possible by electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, including historic investments in our nation's infrastructure ($8B to Texas alone), lowering the costs of health care and prescription drugs through the Inflation Reduction Act and cancelling student loan debt that will impact up to 3 million Texans.


Finally, the Vice President will remind the audience that this election we have the opportunity to end the attacks on reproductive freedom, voting rights and other extremist policies that are out of step with the will of the American people.

"Right here in Texas, you have registered more than 300,000 new voters since Roe v. Wade was overturned. Kansas voters turned out in record numbers to protect reproductive rights. And Democrats are winning in places like Alaska. It is no wonder these extremists are so scared to let Americans vote."
