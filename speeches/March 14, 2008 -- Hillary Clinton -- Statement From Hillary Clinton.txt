    Hillary Clinton put out the following statement in response to reports that President Bush personally intervened to order the EPA to weaken its new limits on ozone:
President Bush opened a new front in his administration's war on science this week. His personal intervention to weaken the Environmental Protection Agency's new limits on ozone proves that he has abandoned even a pretense of scientific integrity in decision-making. His efforts are directly at odds not only with accepted science, but with his government's own arguments before the United States Supreme Court.
This is only the latest in a long series of examples where the Bush administration's perversion of science helps special interests at the expense of public health -- though it is certainly one of the more brazen. I will work with Senate Environment Committee Chair Barbara Boxer to investigate the President's decision and to hold him accountable.
And when I am President, I will end the Bush war on science. And I will work to revise the ozone standard to reflect the available standard and to protect the public health, as the clean air act requires. Months ago, I outlined a detailed agenda to restore scientific integrity to government decision-making. I promised that as President I would issue an executive order to revive the longstanding practice of giving experts a central voice in agency rulemaking and call on agencies to pursue evidence-based decisions, and to direct all department and agency heads to safeguard against instances of political pressure threatening scientific integrity and promote openness and transparency in decision-making.
