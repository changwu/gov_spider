    Warmest greetings to everyone celebrating Saint Patrick's Day.
More than 1500 years ago, Saint Patrick escaped the bonds of slavery and brought his message of faith and opportunity to the Emerald Isle. His extraordinary courage and conviction inspired the Irish people and heralded a new era of enlightenment and peace for his adopted homeland. Today, Saint Patrick's legacy continues to endure, in Ireland and beyond, as we strive for the hope embodied by his teachings and his life's work.
On this feast of the patron saint of Ireland, we rejoice in our Irish heritage and honor the Irish Americans who have made immeasurable contributions to our nation and our culture. Since the earliest days of our republic, the sons and daughters of Ireland have symbolized the American dream. Overcoming political, economic, and social struggles, Irish Americans have achieved tremendous success in all realms of American lifeâ€”from politics to education, business to the arts.
This Saint Patrick's Day has a special importance to all friends of Ireland for it is the first in a generation to occur in a peaceful Northern Ireland. Let us today join together to build on the progress of the past year and advance the cause of peace and reconciliation.
Across our country today, in parades, in classrooms, and in churches, millions of Irish Americans will celebrate the spirit of Saint Patrick that lives on in all of us. Best wishes to all for a wonderful holiday.
