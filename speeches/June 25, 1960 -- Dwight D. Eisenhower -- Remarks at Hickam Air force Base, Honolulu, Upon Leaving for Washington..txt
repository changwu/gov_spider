    Governor Quinn, Admiral Felt, officers and men of the armed services, and my friends of Hawaii:
All of you have made my few days here in Hawaii a memorable experience, a most pleasant and enjoyable one--and indeed an instructive one. I have learned more about your history, your industrial development, your agriculture, your educational and cultural pursuits.
And incidentally, I want to say from all I have heard about this East-West Cultural Center, that I assure you that you have my prayers for its great success. I hope it will be supported properly, because I am quite sure it will be one mechanism through which the friendly States bordering the Pacific ocean will be brought closer together.
Now I cannot, of course, thank each of you individually for all you have done to make the stay here of my party and myself so enjoyable.
There is only one thing actually you could have done for me, and that was to show me how to beat number nine at Kaneohe. It looks easy, but it fooled me.
To all of you, my thanks, my heartiest alohas and my prayers that this State is going to develop to fulfill the highest aspirations and hopes and dreams of all of your people--particularly those who have done so much to bring about the present state of development in this lovely region-and those who saw that it should be indeed a sister State of the Union.
I am indeed proud that Governor Quinn has handed to me this medal, because it was for me a very great honor to urge Statehood for Hawaii and to sign the bill that made it a State.
So again as I go, thanks to all of you--particularly to everybody I saw that was grinning and shouting along the road the other day, when I left this city.
Thank you very much. Goodbye.
