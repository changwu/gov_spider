    CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday issued the following statement on Gov. Scott Walker's plan to eliminate overtime pay, lower wages and destroy the trade union movement in the United States:
"At a time when the rich are getting richer and everyone else is getting poorer, Gov. Walker's attack on the trade union movement would lower wages and the benefits that working people receive while making the wealthy and large corporations even richer.
"Workers have the constitutional right to form unions, to collectively bargain and to participate in the political process. If we are going to rebuild the crumbling middle class we need a stronger trade union movement, not a weaker one. Gov. Walker's proposal would move us in exactly the wrong direction."
