    Nevada Supporters Join Hundreds in National "Turn the Page in Iraq" Canvasses
Las Vegas, NV - Today the Obama campaign officially opened new headquarters in North Las Vegas and Carson City. Assemblyman Kelvin Atkinson and Assemblywoman Marilyn Kirkpatrick joined dozens of volunteers and supporters at the North Las Vegas grand opening. Assemblywoman Sheila Leslie was on the ground for the office opening in Carson City.
"The Obama campaign is building the strongest grassroots volunteer operation in Nevada," said Assemblywoman Sheila Leslie. "New offices around the state will make it easier for volunteers and supporters in every neighborhood and precinct to join Barack Obama's movement for change."
"Nevadans want a leader who will make real progress on real issues," said Bill Peterson, a volunteer from Las Vegas. "Senator Obama has the courage to take on the special interests in Washington who have no interest in changing the system."
Across the state, volunteers joined in the national "Turn the Page in Iraq" canvasses. Participants gathered for hundreds of canvasses across the country to show that there is a movement to change the way Washington works and to end the failed policies in Iraq. Silver State Obama supporters went door-to-door in over 45 precincts, including Carson City, North Las Vegas, Southwest Las Vegas, Pahrump, Sun Valley, Mesquite, Elko, Reno, Winnemucca and Ely.
"Senator Obama opposed the war before it began," said Peter Boyd from Las Vegas. "I'm letting my neighbors know that Senator Obama has the judgment to get the big decisions right and move our country forward."
