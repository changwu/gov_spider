    President Bush congratulates the Congolese people for their deep desire to embrace democracy as demonstrated by the nationwide vote for a new constitution on December 18-19. A decision on this constitutional referendum represents an important step in the democratic process in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The United States will work cooperatively with the international community, all political parties, and Congolese civil society to ensure the DRC's political transition occurs peacefully, freely, and fairly through democratic elections at the presidential, legislative, and provincial levels.
