    THE PRESIDENT. Hello, everybody.
Q. How did it go today, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, we had a long, very thorough discussion. I thought it went well. We got started on energy, and we'll finish up with that tomorrow.
Q. What did they think of your energy program?
THE PRESIDENT. I think most of them see the need for reducing our imports of oil and for continuing to use atomic power in an expanding way. But we're all determined to hold down on the proliferation of nuclear weapon capability, and how to resolve this problem with so many different kinds of nations' needs is one that will probably be our most difficult undertaking. But we will continue to work on it tomorrow, and I was very pleased with today's discussion.
Q. How do the Germans seem to feel about this problem of spreading nuclear power?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think we're all unanimous in not wanting to see the weapon capability expand. As you know, Germany signed a nonproliferation treaty years ago and so has Japan and so have we, and I think we all feel the need to control the explosive capability, but to let people have adequate fuel.
Thank you for waiting for inc.
