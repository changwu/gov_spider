    TODAY the Veterans Administration is dedicating a new hospital in Columbia, Mo. This brings the nationwide system of veterans hospitals to a total of 167, with more under construction and in the planning stage.
This latest addition will provide health care services primarily to the veterans of central Missouri. But its opening also symbolizes the strong and continuing commitment of this Administration to making the best possible medical care available to every eligible veteran.
Fulfilling the Nation's obligation to its veterans is a matter of justice and national honor. Meeting their medical needs is one of our highest national priorities. To insure that they are met, I intend to maintain and reinforce the independent system of Veterans Administration health care facilities when and as required.
