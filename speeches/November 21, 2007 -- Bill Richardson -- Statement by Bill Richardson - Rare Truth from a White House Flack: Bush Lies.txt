    Richardson: "President Bush has bamboozled the country"
SANTA FE, NM-- New Mexico Governor and Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Richardson today released the following statement regarding former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan's revelation that President Bush was involved in efforts to mislead the American public about the disclosure of a CIA operative's identity:
"It is a low point in our history when the leader of the free world fights to deceive the American public. Rather than defend the Constitution, President Bush has bamboozled the country. Whether it is outing a CIA operative, illegally spying on Americans, or advocating the use of torture, the Bush administration has made a mockery of our legal system.
"I pledge that, as President, I will prosecute anyone responsible for torture. I will never compromise. I will find out who is responsible for torture, and if laws were broken, there will be prosecutions. No one is above the law.
"As the next President, I will bring real leadership to the White House to repair the damage wrought by the Bush administration and truly change the ways of Washington. I will bring this country together, thanks to my experience, and return America to its rightful standing in the world.
"The oath I take to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution will be my solemn promise to each and every citizen of this nation. I will never mislead the American people."
