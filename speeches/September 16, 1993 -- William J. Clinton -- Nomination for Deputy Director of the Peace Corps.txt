    The President today announced his intention to nominate U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Djibouti, Charles R. Baquet III, a former Peace Corps volunteer, as Deputy Director of the Peace Corps.
"Like Peace Corps Director Carol Bellamy, Charles Baquet is a former volunteer who knows firsthand the possibilities and problems facing the Peace Corps," the President said. "I am confident his experiences both as a volunteer and as a Foreign Service officer will serve him well as he works to ensure the Peace Corps meets its mission of helping others around the world."
