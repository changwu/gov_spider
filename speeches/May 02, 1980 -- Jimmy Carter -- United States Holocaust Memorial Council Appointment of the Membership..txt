    The President's Commission on the Holocaust was created in November 1978 to make recommendations regarding the establishment and maintenance of an appropriate memorial to those who perished in the Holocaust, the systematic, state sponsored extermination of 6 million Jews and the murders of millions of other people. The Commission was further instructed to examine the feasibility of obtaining funds for the creation and maintenance of the Memorial through contributions by the American people.
The Commission submitted a report to the President in the fall of 1979 which recommends a three-part memorial:
—A National Holocaust Memorial Museum, to be erected in Washington, D.C., of symbolic and artistic beauty, visually and emotionally moving in accordance with the solemn nature of the Holocaust.
—An educational foundation dedicated to the pursuit of educational work through research and exploration of issues raised by the Holocaust for all areas of human knowledge and public policy.
—A Committee on Conscience composed of distinguished American moral leaders. This Committee would receive reports of actual or potential genocide anywhere in the world and alert the national conscience, influence policymakers, and stimulate worldwide action to bring such acts to a halt.
The President approved these recommendations with the understanding that funding proposals for the Memorial should provide that construction costs would be raised primarily from private contributions. He has now appointed a United States Holocaust Memorial Council, whose Chairman is Mr. Elie Wiesel, a survivor and noted author and scholar, formerly Chairman of the Holocaust Commission, to carry out the recommendations of the Commission.
