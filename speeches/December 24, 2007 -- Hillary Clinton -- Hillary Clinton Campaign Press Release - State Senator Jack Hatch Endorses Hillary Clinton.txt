DES MOINES, IA â€“ As the Clinton campaign's momentum continues to build in Iowa, State Senator Jack Hatch of central Des Moines, Senate District 33, endorsed Hillary today, citing the superiority of her health care plan.

"This is a historic election that will have an enormous impact on the direction of our country," Senator Jack Hatch said. "Hillary Clinton is an agent of change who will enact universal health care and open up great opportunities for women, like my 18-year-old daughter, by making the dream of being president one day a real possibility. I trust Hillary to change our country because she has the strength and experience to enact real solutions to our big challenges. "
Senator Hatch is serving his second term in the Iowa Senate after winning reelection in November 2006. Before that, Hatch served in the Iowa House of Representatives from 1985 to 1993.
