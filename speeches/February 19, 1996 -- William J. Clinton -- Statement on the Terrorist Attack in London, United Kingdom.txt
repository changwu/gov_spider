    It is with great sadness that I once again express my condolences to the victims of an IRA bomb in London. These cowardly acts of terrorism are the work of individuals determined to thwart the will of the people of Northern Ireland. They want peace. I condemn these acts of violence in the strongest possible terms and hope those responsible are brought swiftly to justice.
Over the last 17 months, the people of Northern Ireland have tasted peace and grown accustomed to the blessings of a normal life. We must not let the men of the past ruin the future of the children in Northern Ireland. The Irish and British Governments are engaged in intensive efforts to move the peace process forward. I strongly believe that is the path to follow.
For our part, we will continue our dialog with the Irish and British Governments and the parties to support their efforts to restore the ceasefire and find a lasting and just peace. We look forward to the summit expected at the end of the month between the Irish and British Governments. I am hopeful they will find a way to peace.
