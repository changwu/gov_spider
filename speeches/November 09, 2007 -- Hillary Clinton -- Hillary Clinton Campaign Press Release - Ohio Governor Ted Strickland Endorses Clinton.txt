    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of Ohio Governor Ted Strickland.
"These serious times call for a leader with Hillary Clinton's strength and experience," Gov. Strickland said. "Hillary has what it takes to win Ohio and take back the White House in 2008. Her commitment to rebuilding the middle class and expanding opportunity for all Americans is exactly what this country needs."
"I am truly honored to have Governor Strickland's support,"Clinton said. "He has united Ohioans to restore integrity and accountability to state government and move Ohio forward."
Strickland was elected Governor in 2006 in a landslide victory on the strength of his Turnaround Ohio Plan, which focuses on the unbreakable link between economic growth and educational achievement.
Governor Strickland began his career as a Methodist minister, psychologist and professor, before being first elected to Congress in 1992. In the House, he helped author the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), a federal initiative that now provides health insurance to millions of low-income children, and fought to ensure that our troops have the life-saving armor and equipment they need.
