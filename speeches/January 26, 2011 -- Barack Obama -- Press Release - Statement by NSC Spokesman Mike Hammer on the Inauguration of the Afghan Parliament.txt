    The United States welcomes the inauguration today of the Afghan Parliament in Kabul. The seating of parliament is a significant milestone in the progression of Afghanistan's democracy and an extremely important moment for Afghans who bravely cast their votes last September.
The constructive debate and co-operation between Afghanistan's Office of the President and the recently elected members of Parliament demonstrates the Afghan commitment to ensuring that the will of the Afghan people is carried out and democratic principles are prioritized.
The United States joins the Afghan people in celebrating today's achievement and we encourage the Afghans to begin an inclusive dialogue on electoral reform.
The United States looks forward to continuing to work in partnership with the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the new parliament as it carries out its important Constitutional role on behalf of the Afghan people.
