    The second debate was a show, and if you came away with one thing, it was that Jeb stands for what he believes in. We saw it so much, we can't decide which clip was the best, so we're looking for your help.
We pulled the top clips from last night, but now we need you. Help us out and vote below:
Jeb standing up for the love of his life, his wife, Columba. "She loves this country as much as anyone in this room."
We're still waiting on Donald Trump to apologize. But we won't hold our breath.

Jeb standing up for his brother. "When it comes to my brother, one thing I know for sure, he kept us safe."
As Jeb said, do you remember the rubble? We sure do.

Jeb standing against Trump's casinos more than a decade ago. "I'm not going to be bought by anybody."
That one looked like it hurt, Donald.
