    The President today declared a major disaster exists in the Territory of the U. S. Virgin Islands and ordered Federal aid to supplement Territory recovery efforts in the area struck by Hurricane Omar during the period of October 14-16, 2008.
Federal funding is available to the Territory and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by Hurricane Omar on the islands of St. Croix and St. Thomas, including Water Island.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures for all islands in the Territory of the U. S. Virgin Islands.
