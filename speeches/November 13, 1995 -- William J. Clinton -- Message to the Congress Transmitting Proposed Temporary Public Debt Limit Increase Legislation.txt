    To the Congress of the United States:
In disapproving H.R. 2586, a bill that would have, among other things, provided for a temporary increase in the public debt, I stated my desire to approve promptly a simple increase in the debt limit. Accordingly, I am forwarding the enclosed legislation that would provide for such an increase.
I urge the Congress to act on this legislation promptly and to return it to me for signing.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, November 13, 1995.
