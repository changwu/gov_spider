    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Hawkins (R) FL and 2 others)
The Administration opposes S. 2324 unless it is amended to:
— reduce the bill's excessive authorization levels, which exceed the Administration's budget request by $24. 6 million for fiscal year 1987 and by $83. 5 million over the three years 1987-1989;
— delete the statutory requirement for a specified minimum number of VISTA volunteers each year, because it encroaches on ACTION'S ability to manage the program and would adversely affect funding for service-learning and discretionary grant programs; and
— remove the proposed establishment of a VISTA Literacy Corps, which is an unnecessary, duplicative new program.
