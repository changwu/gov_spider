    The Clinton Campaign is launching a new television ad in Iowa and New Hampshire focused on Hillary's long record of fighting to preserve Social Security and improve the lives of America's seniors.

The new 30-second spot, entitled "There For You," details Hillary's fight to stop the Bush Administration from privatizing Social Security and jeopardizing the bedrock of retirement security that 34 million Americans rely on.
The ad also describes Hillary's multi-year effort to pass the Lifespan Respite Care Act, which helps 44 million Americans care for an adult family member who has a chronic illness or disability each year. The bill provides hundreds of millions in grants for states and localities to increase the availability of respite care and help families care for their loved ones.
Throughout the campaign, Hillary has outlined a series of measures aimed at protecting elderly consumers from fraud and deceptive marketing in the long-term care insurance market. She would crack down on the use of fine print clauses to deny seniors coverage and would discourage premium increases by requiring that a larger percentage goes to paying consumer claimsâ€”not to insurance company profits.
Following is the script for the ad:
Announcer: When George Bush threatened to privatize social security, Hillary was there fighting every step of the way to stop him.
And she was there for every senior who needs round-the-clock-Care, creating a law to ease the burden on family caregivers.
She's still there fighting to stop long term care insurance scams that prey on the elderly. These days, it seems like every candidate on earth is coming here for You.
But which candidate has been there for you all along?
Hillary Clinton: I'm Hillary Clinton and I approved this message.
