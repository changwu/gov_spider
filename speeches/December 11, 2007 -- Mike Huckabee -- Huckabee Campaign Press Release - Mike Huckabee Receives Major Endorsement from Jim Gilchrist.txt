    LITTLE ROCK, AR – In Iowa today, former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee received a major endorsement from Jim Gilchrist, founder of the Minuteman Project.
Huckabee said he was honored to receive the endorsement. "No one can question Jim's commitment to this country and the immigration problem. He has mobilized a group of volunteers to go to the border and draw attention to the issue of immigration. All of us want a policy where people come to this country through the front door, not the back door," said Huckabee during a morning news conference.
Gilchrist added, "Governor Huckabee actually wrote a plan that I can embrace. I found his ‘Secure America' plan would open the dialogue and help begin the process of solving the illegal immigration problem."
Gilchrist, who founded the Minuteman Project in 2004, said he appreciated Huckabee's plan to secure America 's borders.
Last week, Huckabee unveiled "The Secure America Plan: A Nine-Point Strategy for Immigration Enforcement and Border Security." Huckabee said he believes in adopting the best policy ideas to provide a "tough, equitable and comprehensive approach" to dealing with the current immigration crisis.
Huckabee said his goal is to implement a broad-based strategy that commits the resources of the federal government to the enforcement of our immigration laws and results in the attrition of the illegal immigrant population.
A 30-second television ad, called "Secure Borders," began airing in Iowa Monday to educate voters about Huckabee's call for a new immigration strategy, which begins with securing America 's borders.
