    The President's Committee on Mental Retardation, established by Executive Order No. 11280 on May 11, 1966, as superseded by Executive Order No. 11776 on March 28, 1974, has organized national planning, stimulated development of plans, policies and programs, and advanced the concept of community participation in the field of mental retardation.
National goals have been established to:
(1) promote full participation of people with mental retardation in their communities;
(2) provide all necessary supports to people with mental retardation and their families for such participation;
(3) reduce the occurrence and severity of mental retardation by one- half by the year 2010;
(4) assure the full citizenship rights of all people with mental retardation, including those rights secured by such landmark statutes as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Public Law 101-336 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.);
(5) recognize the right of all people with mental retardation to self-determination and autonomy, to be treated in a nondiscriminatory manner, and to exercise meaningful choice, with whatever supports are necessary to effectuate these rights;
(6) recognize the right of all people with mental retardation to enjoy a quality of life that promotes independence, self- determination, and participation as productive members of society; and
(7) promote the widest possible dissemination of information on models, programs, and services in the field of mental retardation.
The achievement of these goals will require the most effective possible use of public and private resources.
Now, Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App. 2), it is hereby ordered as follows:
