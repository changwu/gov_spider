    Chairman Thieu, Prime Minister Ky, most distinguished officials from the Republic of Vietnam, and the United States of America, ladies and gentlemen:
Once again I am very pleased to welcome two brave Vietnamese leaders to American soil.
We met in Hawaii a little over a year ago. Then our talks were of plans and hopes.
Today, we meet in a time of progress. It is our common task to extend that progress in the days ahead.
Ever since our conference last fall in Manila, your country has traveled far on the road to democracy. Your assembly has hammered out a new Constitution. I am informed that I will see a copy of that Constitution during our meeting here.
It is the foundation stone of a freely and popularly elected government. You are the leaders of 16 million courageous and dedicated people who are determined to forge a free nation from the fires of war.
Your people look to a Vietnam that is unencumbered by a foreign presence on its soil, unhindered by acts of terror and aggression, free to determine its own destiny.
I hope that this conference will be of value to both of us in charting the course for the future of the struggle for freedom in Vietnam.
I am also delighted and particularly anxious for you to get to know Ambassador Bunker, who will shortly succeed Ambassador Lodge in Saigon.
I know that you will find him an able and understanding Ambassador, as you will his associate, Mr. Locke.
I know you will find him a worthy successor to a very brave and distinguished patriot.
Last week I reassured my own people that America is committed to the defense of South Vietnam until an honorable peace can be negotiated.
I renew that pledge to you today. Thank you very much.
