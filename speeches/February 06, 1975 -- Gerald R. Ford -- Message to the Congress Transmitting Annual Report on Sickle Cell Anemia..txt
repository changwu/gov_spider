    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to send to the Congress the Second Annual Report on the Administration of the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act (P.L. 92-294) in accordance with the requirements of Section 1106 of the Public Health Service Act. The Annual Report highlights the progress made in the implementation of the National Sickle Cell Disease Program and related activities as provided for in the Act.
Research efforts to investigate the mechanisms and subsequent complications of the abnormal sickling phenomenon in sickle cell anemia have continued to receive significant attention over the past year under the National Institutes of Health. Clinical trials and preliminary studies utilizing various antisickling agents are underway to alter the sickling process and thus aid individuals who suffer from sickle cell anemia. Demonstration service activities designed to improve public awareness, education, detection and counseling in regard to sickle cell have significantly increased over the past year under the combined efforts of the Health Services Administration and the National Institutes of Health.
The activity toward Sickle Cell Anemia continues to be of high priority for our Government and I am pleased to commend this report to the attention of the Congress.
