    President Obama looks forward to welcoming President Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone, President Macky Sall of Senegal, President Joyce Banda of Malawi, and Prime Minister Jose Maria Pereira Neves of Cape Verde to the White House on Thursday, March 28. The United States has strong partnerships with these countries based on shared democratic values and shared interests. The five leaders will discuss strengthening democratic institutions across sub-Saharan Africa, and building on Africa's democratic progress to generate increased economic opportunities and expanded trade and investment. The visit of these four leaders underscores the strategic importance the President places on building partnerships and substantive engagement with sub-Saharan Africa, and our commitment to working with strong and emerging African democracies.
