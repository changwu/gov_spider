    On National Air Traffic Control Day, we recognize the dedicated professionals of the Federal Aviation Administration. We thank these hard-working men and women for the critical role they play in air travel across our country and around the globe. In 2017, air traffic controllers in the United States oversaw the safe movement of planes carrying more than 840 million passengers and 39 billion pounds of freight.
Given the important responsibility air traffic controllers have to ensure the safety of millions of travelers and tons of cargo, their vital role in transportation safety and our economy cannot be overstated. That is why my administration continues to pursue the modernization of our Nation's air traffic control services. Making targeted investments in next-generation technology systems will improve the delivery of air traffic control services for the benefit of the traveling public. We must ensure that air traffic controllers have access to the technology they need to effectively and efficiently manage our Nation's airspace.
These efforts will ensure we can continue to efficiently transport goods in the new economy and further improve the flying experience for the Nation's air travelers.
