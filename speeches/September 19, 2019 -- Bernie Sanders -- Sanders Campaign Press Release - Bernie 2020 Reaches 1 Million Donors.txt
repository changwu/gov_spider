    Sanders is the Fastest Candidate in History to Reach the Milestone
WASHINGTON â€“ Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign on Thursday announced it has received contributions from more than 1 million individual donors, making Sanders the fastest candidate in history to reach the milestone.
"With 1 million contributors, this is the only Democratic campaign that has more supporters than Donald Trump," said campaign manager Faiz Shakir. "Our strength is in numbers, and that is why Bernie Sanders is the only candidate who is able to say his campaign will rely only on grassroots funding in both the primary and against Donald Trump. Like all campaigns we are beholden to our donors, and we're proud to stand with one million working people."
Out of the 1 million donors to Sanders' campaign, 99.95 percent are able to give again, and their contributions add to the over 2.5 million already made. The campaign can also count on more than 125,000 people making monthly recurring contributions, providing a consistent stream of reliable investment that will last throughout the campaign and build the organization required to win the nomination and defeat Donald Trump.
Starbucks, Walmart and Amazon are the most common employers of Sanders' 1 million donors. The top occupation remains teachers, with tens of thousands of teachers making more than 80,000 contributions so far this year, with all 50 states, DC and Puerto Rico represented.
Sanders continues to be the only Democratic candidate with more individual contributions than Donald Trump. In counties nationwide that flipped from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016, Sanders has received more than 81,000 donations, which is three times the next Democratic candidate and more than the next three Democratic candidates combined. The most common employers of Sanders donors in Obama-Trump counties are Walmart, USPS and Target.
