    To Past and Present Members of the NSC Staff:
I congratulate you on the 50th anniversary of the National Security Council.
During the more than forty years of the Cold War, you guided our country's leaders through the brinksmanship of East-West confrontation. In the almost ten years since communism's collapse, the NSC Staff has helped identify the possibilities and protect against the perils of our new era.
Indeed, at a time when the world's increasing interdependence challenges us all to new patterns of thought and action, the NSC's role is more important than ever. Your sound judgment, advice, and dedication are a key part of our ability to seize the opportunities of the 21st century. Because of your work, our lives are safer, our economy stronger, and our country more secure. On behalf of a grateful nation, congratulations and thank you.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
