  A Proclamation

As Americans, we enjoy a rich heritage of freedom. How fortunate we are that the founders of this great country were committed to the ideal that all people share inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This ideal has been the inspiration for many generations of Americans in the building of what is today the greatest and most prosperous Nation in the world.
The people of the United States cherish their liberties and recognize that our freedoms of conscience and action are at the heart of the unique American tradition. To preserve this great tradition, it is important for us all to pause from time to time to rededicate ourselves to the democratic ideals which have served us so well.
For this purpose, the Congress, by joint resolution approved July 18, 1958 (72 Stat. 369, 36 U.S.C. 162), has designated May 1 of each year as Loyalty Day, a day for the reaffirmation of loyalty to the United States of America and for the recognition of the heritage of American Freedom.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 1984, as Loyalty Day and call upon all Americans and patriotic, civic, and educational organizations to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies. I also call upon all government officials to display the flag of the United States on all government buildings and grounds on that day.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 22nd day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.

RONALD REAGAN
