    "And with three quarters of young people going to the ballot box in November voting on jobs and the economy, we're confident that they're going to break to us as they see the effects of the last three and a half years of the Obama economy on them." - College Republican National Committee Chairman Alex Schriver

CR CHAIR ALEX SCHRIVER: "That same Harvard Institute of Politics study tells us that 74 percent of young people's number one issue is jobs and the economy. And so, that's what this election is about. This election is about 16 percent youth unemploymentâ€”that's twice the national average. It's about three in ten young people moving back into their parents' basement, about a trillion dollars of student loan debt, which is about $22,000 a person. So we know that our candidates and our party are right on those issues. And with three quarters of young people going to the ballot box in November voting on jobs and the economy, we're confident that they're going to break to us as they see the effects of the last three and a half years of the Obama economy on them."
