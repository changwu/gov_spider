    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Luken (D) OH and 3 others)
The administration opposes H.R. 2167, for the following reasons:

 The bill does not make enough progress toward merging the railroad unemployment insurance system with the Federal/State Unemployment insurance system, as has been proposed by the administration. The administration's proposal would provide sound financing and higher weekly benefits for unemployed railroad workers;  
 It includes costly railroad retirement provisions; and  
 It will increase the budget deficit for fiscal years 1988 and 1989.
