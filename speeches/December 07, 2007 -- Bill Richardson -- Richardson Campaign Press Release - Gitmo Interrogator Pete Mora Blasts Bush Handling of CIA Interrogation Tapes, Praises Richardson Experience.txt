    SIOUX CITY, IA-- Former Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib interrogator Pedro "Pete" Mora campaigned in Iowa today on behalf of New Mexico Governor and Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Richardson. He called out the Bush Administration on recent revelations that the CIA destroyed tapes of harsh interrogations.
"The Bush Administration has allowed the use of abusive and illegal interrogation techniques that are against the Geneva Conventions, and the destruction of these tapes can only be considered a cover-up," Mora said. "It is a clear attempt to hide evidence from the world.
"As an interrogator, I was at the tip of the spear in the Global War on Terror. I had to face down some of our nation's most brutal enemies, but I always did it with basic respect for human dignity. Bill Richardson has been doing the same thing his whole careerâ€”facing down the toughest the world has to offer and protecting America's interests without compromising America's values."
Richardson weighed in on the case before the Supreme Court regarding the rights of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay prison.
"If I were President, the Supreme Court would not even be considering this case, because I would have shut down Guantanamo a long time ago," Richardson said. "I'm honored to have Pete Mora speaking out with me about the need for our country to be the world's conscience, not the world's policeman."
Richardson also criticized the Bush Administration the CIA tapes.
"The Bush-Cheney Administration seems to be on a mission to destroy our credibility in the world," Richardson said. "That these tapes existed is reprehensible. That they were destroyed is outrageous. When I'm President, we're going not going to encourage torture, we're going to prosecute those who practice it, even if those prosecutions go all the way to the top. No one is above the law."
