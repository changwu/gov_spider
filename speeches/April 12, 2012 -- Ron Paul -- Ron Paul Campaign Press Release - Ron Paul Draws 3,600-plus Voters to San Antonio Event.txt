LAKE JACKSON, Texas — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul drew a remarkable 3,600-plus supporters and undecided voters to the final of three town hall meetings he held in his home state of Texas this week.
The 12-term Congressman from the Lone Star State's 14th District spent Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday holding fundraisers, engaging the Texas and national media, and holding large events drawing thousands of attendees.
Dr. Paul's outdoor town hall meeting took place at 7:00 p.m. CST on the city's Main Plaza, located at 115 North Main Street, San Antonio, TX 78205. The event was organized by 'Youth for Ron Paul' (YFP). YFP, an initiative of the Ron Paul 2012 Presidential campaign, launched in September 2011, and since its inception, students nationwide have organized 607 chapters and recruited more than 76,000 people.
