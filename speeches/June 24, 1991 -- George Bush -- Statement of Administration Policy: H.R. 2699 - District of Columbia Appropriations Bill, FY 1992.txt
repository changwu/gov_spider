    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Floor)(Sponsors: Whitten (D), Mississippi; Dixon (D), California)
This Statement of Administration Policy expresses the Administration's views on the District of Columbia Appropriations Bill, FY 1992, as reported by the Committee.
The President stated in a letter to Speaker Foley on June 4th that he would veto any legislation that weakens current law or existing regulations for abortion-related activities. Section 114 of the Committee bill, which would permit the use of Congressionally-appropriated local funds to finance abortions, would substantially weaken current law and would, therefore, lead to a veto of the bill.
The Administration urges the House of Representatives to adopt language concerning abortion that was included in the FYs 1989-91 District of Columbia Appropriations Acts. The language of these Acts prohibited the use of Federal and local funds to perform abortions, except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term. The President will veto any District of Columbia Appropriations Bill that does not contain this language.
On the basis of OMB's initial scoring, the Administration finds that the Committee bill is within the House 602(b) allocation for the Federal payment to the District. In aggregate, the House 602(b) allocations are consistent with the statutory spending limits enacted in the Budget Enforcement Act.
