    Scott Raecker, an influential Iowa state legislator and executive director of Character Counts, endorsed Newt Gingrich today at the Rotary Club in Des Moines.
Urbandale Rep. Scott Raecker said his decision wasn't based on any specific issue, or on Gingrich's chances of winning the Iowa Caucuses, but rather on what Gingrich and his campaign brings to the race.
"It's my position that his voice needs to continue in the race," said Raecker, chairman of the Iowa House Appropriations Committee and executive director for Character Counts in Iowa.
"I, like many Americans, am frustrated with the polarization of our country and our government in Washington," said Raecker. "His campaign of ideas and this voice that he is bringing shows that the longer he is in the campaign, the better off we will be."
Raecker said he likes that Gingrich is talking about solutions to big problems and doing it in a positive, proactive way.
