    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
REVISED(House)(Jones (D) Oklahoma)
The Administration will not object to-House passage of H.R. 2005, but will work in the Senate to (1) amend section 2 of the bill to make permanent, with annual review requirements, the authority to conduct experiments and demonstration projects under section 505 of the 1980 Disability Amendments; and (2) delete the bill's provision that would grant Medicaid eligibility for widows and widowers who lost eligibility as a result of the increase in benefits provided by the Social Security Amendments of 1983 (P.L. 98-21).
Although the Administration understands the concern that prompted the inclusion of the latter provision, the Administration opposes this provision because it provides special treatment for a particular group of individuals who were affected by P.L. 98-21,1 when similar benefits are not provided for other persons in like financial circumstances.
