    At a book signing today in Naples, FL, Newt took the time to answer questions from third grader Katrina Russell, who wants to be a journalist when she grows up. Click here and here for a pictures of Katrina right after she interviewed Newt.
Gingrich paused the line of about 500 people waiting to have books signed to take Katrina's questions. He leaned in endearingly, with his hand to his cheek, letting down his usual gruff Speaker of the House guard.
"Have you met a president? If so who was your favorite one?"
"My favorite president is George Washington," Gingrich said. "I've met Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Obama and myself, but I'm not president yet but with your help I might be."
"If you become president, will you order Godfather's Pizza?"
"I like Herman Cain. Godfather's Pizza is good. I eat too much pizza. I'm not supposed to eat too much pizza. Do you like Godfather's Pizza?" Gingrich asked.
"I haven't had it before," Katrina said.
"Well, I will tell Herman Cain that you should get some Godfather's Pizza," Gingrich said.
Katrina asked him one last question before moving on.
"If you have pets, what are you going to do with them?"
"I don't have pets right now, but I love pets," Gingrich said. "We used to have dogs which I like a lot. Maybe if when we get to the White House we might get a dog."
Katrina told ABC News she was surprised Gingrich didn't have any pets, but she told the press why he won her over.
"He's a good person and I know he'll make good laws and he'll set the U.S.A to some peace. He's just a really good person and that's why I'm voting for him," Katrina said.
