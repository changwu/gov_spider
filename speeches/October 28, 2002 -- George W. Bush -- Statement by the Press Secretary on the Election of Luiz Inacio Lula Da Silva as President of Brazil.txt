    The President telephoned Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva today to extend congratulations on his election as President of the Federative Republic of Brazil.
The President told President-elect da Silva he looked forward to working with him, especially with regard to advancing democracy, good governance, and free trade in the hemisphere.
The United States and Brazil enjoy excellent bilateral relations which we will continue with the new government. Our two countries share many common interests and fundamental values and goals that will enable us to continue to work closely together to bring great benefits to our people.
The United States appreciates President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's friendship with the United States, his work to strengthen the bilateral relationship, and his strong leadership in the hemisphere and beyond. We wish him well and look forward to continuing to work with him until the end of his Presidency.
