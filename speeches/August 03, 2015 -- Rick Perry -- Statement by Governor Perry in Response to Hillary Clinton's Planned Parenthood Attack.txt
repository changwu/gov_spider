    AUSTIN — Governor Rick Perry today released the following statement responding to Secretary Clinton's attack over Planned Parenthood:
"Secretary Clinton should explain to the American people why she supports an organization that rips apart and sells the body parts of aborted babies. I am proud to have defunded Planned Parenthood in Texas, and support efforts to defund them at the federal level. I have also called for the revocation of Planned Parenthood's federal non-profit status. My policies in Texas have proven that you can protect women's health while also protecting human life."
