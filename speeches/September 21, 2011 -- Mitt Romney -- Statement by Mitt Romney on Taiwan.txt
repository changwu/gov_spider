    Mitt Romney today issued the following statement on President Obama's refusal to sell military jets to Taiwan:
"President Obama's refusal to sell Taiwan new military jets is yet another example of his weak leadership in foreign policy. Every American president for the past three decades – both Republican and Democrat – has recognized our interest in helping Taiwan defend itself. In the face of China's intensive military buildup, the United States needs the strongest possible partnerships in Asia. However, President Obama has ignored Taiwan's request and caved into the unreasonable demands of China at the cost of well-paying American jobs. This decision raises serious questions about his commitment to our closest partners and to the policies that have sustained American leadership abroad."
