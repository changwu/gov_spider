    Mitt Romney today announced additional endorsements in Alabama.
"My support is growing in Alabama because voters in the state are looking for a change of direction in Washington," said Mitt Romney. "President Obama has grown government at the expense of the private sector. I will shrink government and expand the private sector with the help of these leaders."
Announcing his support, State Representative Blaine Galliher said, "Mitt Romney's plan for more jobs, smaller government, and less debt is exactly what conservatives are looking for in Alabama. After three years of exploding debt and fewer jobs, it is clear that we need a proven job creator and budget cutter like Mitt Romney in the White House. We are supporting Mitt Romney because our country can't afford four more years of President Obama and because Alabama deserves a proven leader like Mitt Romney as president."
