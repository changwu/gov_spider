    Today, First Lady Melania Trump traveled to Tennessee to visit the Vanderbilt Children's Hospital as part of her Be Best campaign. After arriving in Tennessee, Mrs. Trump was met by United States Representative Marsha Blackburn and United States Air Force Colonel Keith Allbritten.
When Mrs. Trump arrived at the Children's Hospital, she was greeted by Chief Executive Officer and President of Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Dr. Jeff Balser, Deputy Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs, Dr. Wright Pinson, and the Chief of Staff for Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital, Dr. Margaret Rush.
The First Lady participated in a roundtable discussion on neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), which was led by TeamHOPE. Following the roundtable, the First Lady stopped inside a playroom and met with children who are currently patients at the hospital.
Mrs. Trump then spent time speaking with a NAS affected family. She also delivered fleece baby blankets to patients and families of the hospital.
"Thank you to Vanderbilt University Medical Center and to the dedicated staff at Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital for hosting me today, and for sharing your important work and research on NAS," said First Lady Melania Trump. "Through Be Best, I look forward to working with medical centers around the country in our effort to raise awareness and educate people on the real dangers of NAS. I also want to thank the families and patients who have shared their personal stories on this difficult but important issue â€“ it is through honest and real dialogue that we can remove the stigma of addiction and have a positive impact on those suffering from this condition."
