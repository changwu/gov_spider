    Today I issued an Executive order reforming how the United States reviews national security concerns that may arise from foreign investments, in light of the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007. The Executive order furthers the goals of the new law by ensuring that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by certain foreign investments into the United States. The Executive order reaffirms our commitment to open economies and our policy of welcoming foreign investment and the important economic benefits that such investment brings. At the same time, the Executive order sets forth procedures for protecting our national security, recognizing that our openness is vital to our prosperity and security.
