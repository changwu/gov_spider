    Of course, Mrs. Proctor and ladies, there is really nothing for me to say except thank you.
I thank you, of course, for this present. But far more for the cordial friendliness you have exhibited to me here. I count this breakfast a great opportunity to be a little closer to you people, to meet you, to exchange a hand-clasp and to go away believing that I have made some new friends among a people with whom I am going to leave a big portion of my heart.
Thank you.
