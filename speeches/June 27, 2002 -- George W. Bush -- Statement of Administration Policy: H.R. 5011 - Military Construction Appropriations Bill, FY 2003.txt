    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Reps. Young (R) Florida; Obey (D) Wisconsin)
The Administration supports the FY 2003 Military Construction Appropriations Bill as reported by the House Committee. The bill ensures that the Nation's military construction priorities are met, and provides the resources and infrastructure for our fighting forces at home and abroad.
Fiscal discipline and restraint on overall government spending are critical to the Nation's ability to provide needed resources for national defense and homeland security and a fiscal environment that encourages continued economic growth and a quick return to budget balance. The President supports a discretionary spending total of $749.1 billion and a $10.0 billion reserve for the war on terrorism, in accordance with the House-passed Budget Resolution. The President also urges the Congress to provide appropriations consistent with the President's request for defense and homeland security activities to support the War on Terrorism and increased national homeland security efforts. The House Committee reported bill is consistent with these principles.
The Committee's bill supports the President's request for Base Closure and Family Housing. While the Military Construction bill exceeds the President's request by over $0.5 billion, the Administration notes that the bill level is within an overall acceptable discretionary total. The increase for roughly 90 unrequested projects totaling $0.6 billion in this bill could potentially constrain the opportunity to support higher priority programs in other areas. The Administration looks forward to working with the House to advance our collective goals as the process moves forward.
