    California Membership is 55,000 Strong
The Clinton California Campaign received a major boost today with the endorsement of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers â€“ an organization with 55,000 active and retired members in the Golden State.
"Hillary Clinton has been a tireless advocate for working families who have been invisible to this Administration. Her strength and experience make her the most qualified candidate to bring about the change working families need," said Tom Brandon, Executive Secretary Treasurer of the California Conference of Machinists.
The IAM will launch a massive education campaign among IAM members and extensive publicity in union publications and websites nationwide. Twenty-five states with over 450,000 active and retired IAM members will vote within a three week period starting with the Iowa caucuses and ending in California on February 5.
"I am honored to receive the support of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers," Clinton said. "It is time for America's working families to again share in our nation's prosperity. They will not be invisible to my administration."
The IAM is among the nation's largest industrial trade unions, representing over 700,000 active and retired members in airline, aerospace, manufacturing, railroad, woodworking and shipbuilding industries, and is a member of the AFL-CIO.
The United Transportation Union and its 125,000 active and retired members endorsed Clinton earlier this week.
