    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ John Edwards released the following statement about the UNITE HERE radio ads that are running in Nevada:
"Just three weeks ago Senator Obama was calling on me and Senator Clinton to demand that outside groups not run ads on our behalf. These new ads look like the same old nasty divisive politics that both Senators Obama and Clinton denounced just two days ago. It is extremely important for us to quit focusing on fights between politicians and instead focus on what we need to do for working people, for the Latino community in Nevada and across the country."
