    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Bingaman (D) NM and Lieberman (D) CT)
The Administration strongly supports passage of S. 1742 (with Committee amendment substitute) reauthorizing the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) for four full years from enactment. While S. 1742, as reported by the Committee on Governmental Affairs, contained a number of items on which Senior Advisors recommended veto, a compromise has been reached which accommodates Administration and small business concerns. The amended S. 1742 would no longer significantly intrude on Presidential oversight of regulatory review and paperwork reduction.
The House passed last night a bill which the Administration and small business strongly oppose, but indicated they would accept the amended Senate bill. To not pass the Committee substitute will significantly impair OIRA's ability to operate next year and threaten OIRA appropriations.
Equally important, there is agreement by the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs to hold hearings early next year on legislation which would remedy the problems created by the Supreme Court's decision in Dole vs. Steelworkers.
