    In Berlin today the German Government and German companies signed an agreement that will lead to payments to victims of Nazi slave and forced labor. This important and generous act will bring comfort and some measure of justice to surviving victims of the Nazi era. It is a fitting capstone to the 20th century and a cornerstone for a 21st century of peace and tolerance. I welcome the signing of this historic agreement and commend the German Government and companies for their responsibility and courage. I also applaud Chancellor Schroeder, Deputy Treasury Secretary Eizenstat, and German negotiator Lambsdorff for their leadership and perseverance in bringing us to this point.
