    Memorandum for the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology
Subject: Working Group on International Energy
The report of the President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), Powerful Partnerships: The Federal Role in International Cooperation on Energy Innovation, will help advance my Administration's goals for addressing energy-linked economic, environmental, and security challenges. As you point out in the synthesis of the report, our window of opportunity for moving the world off of its current energy trajectory—which entails higher consumer costs, greater regional pollution, more pronounced climate disruption, and increasing risks to energy security—is closing fast. Thus, we should act expeditiously on PCAST's recommendations for strengthening capacities for energy technology innovation, promoting technologies to limit energy demand and for a cleaner energy supply, and improving management of the Federal international energy research and development portfolio.
As a first step, I direct you to form a working group on international energy research, development, demonstration, and deployment under the National Science and Technology Council, as recommended by PCAST. The working group should build on the PCAST report and assess the portfolio of programs underway in the Federal agencies and develop a strategic vision, including budget recommendations that can be considered in agency requests for FY 2001.
Please commend John Holdren, the members of his panel, and all of PCAST for its fine report on this important matter.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
