IT IS with much satisfaction that I send to the members of the Institute of Pacific Relations my greetings and wishes for a successful conference. The aim of the Institute is to bring about a better understanding among the nations of the Pacific. I have confidence that this is one of the most effective methods of securing peace and friendly relations.
