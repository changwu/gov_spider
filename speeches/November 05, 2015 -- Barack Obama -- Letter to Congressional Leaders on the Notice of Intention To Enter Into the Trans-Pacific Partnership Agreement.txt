    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Consistent with section 106(a)(1)(A) of the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-26, Title I; the "Trade Priorities Act"), I am pleased to notify the Congress of my intention to enter into a free trade agreement, known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement. The TPP Agreement will generate export opportunities for U.S. manufacturers, service suppliers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses; help create jobs in the United States; and help American consumers save money while offering them more choices. The TPP Agreement will also benefit the other signatories by providing economic opportunity and by strengthening democracy. I am negotiating to enter into the TPP Agreement with the following countries: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam; provided that those countries meet the market-access goals that we set out to achieve and agree to high-standard obligations, consistent with the Trade Priorities Act.
Consistent with the Trade Priorities Act, I am sending this notification at least 90 days in advance of signing the TPP Agreement. My Administration looks forward to working with the Congress in developing appropriate legislation to approve and implement this TPP Agreement.
Sincerely,

BARACK OBAMA
