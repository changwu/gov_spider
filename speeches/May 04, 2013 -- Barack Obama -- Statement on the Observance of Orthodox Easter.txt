    This weekend, Michelle and I extend our best wishes to members of the Orthodox Christian community here in America and around the world as they observe Holy Friday and the Feast of the Resurrection.
For millions of Orthodox Christians, this is a joyful time. But it's also a reminder of the sacrifice Christ made so that we might have eternal life. His decision to choose love in the face of hate, hope in the face of despair, is an example we should always strive to follow. But it's especially important to remember this year, as members of the Orthodox community have been confronted with persecution and violence, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. For centuries, the region and the world has been enriched by the contributions of Orthodox communities in countries like Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq.
As a nation, we reaffirm our commitment to protecting universal human rights, including the freedom of religion. And in this season of hope and restoration, we celebrate the transformational power of sacrificial love.
