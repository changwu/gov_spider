I think Marco Rubio represents the best opportunity for the future. He's somebody who understands that, as I did in my campaign, this race is about someone who's going to be accountable to the next generation. There's a lot of people in this campaign who understand the past. There's a lot of people, especially Hillary Clinton, who understand the economies and politics of old, but they don't understand the future. And that's what this race is about.
