    At a town hall in Bedford, New Hampshire, Jeb was moved by the courage of a Syrian-American woman named Nora who helped fourteen of her family members flee ISIS and Assad.

  

    Inspired by Nora's courage. America must lead. We cannot sit back and accept this slaughter. https://t.co/dxrMqwI2Ob

Her story is a powerful reminder of why American leadership is so desperately needed right now. "I wish Jeb were president now," said Nora in a CNN interview where she explained she's supporting Jeb because of his detailed strategy for defeating ISIS and Assad. We cannot sit back and accept this slaughter of innocents and allow Russia and Iran to exert their influence in the region.
Watch and share Nora's story below.
