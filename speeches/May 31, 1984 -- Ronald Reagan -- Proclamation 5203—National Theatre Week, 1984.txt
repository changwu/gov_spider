  A Proclamation

Theatres enrich the lives of all Americans. They have pioneered the way for many performers and have given them a start in artistic careers. Theatres enable their audiences to take part in the creative process; they challenge and stimulate us and show us our world in a new light. The strength and vitality of America's theatres are proof of our dedication and commitment to this vital art form.
Americans in all parts of the country have made theatre a part of their lives. We participate as performers and audience members in schools, community theatres, and at the professional level. Through these efforts, we have nourished an art form that proudly celebrates the diversity and creativity of all our people.
In recognition of the many contributions theatres make to the quality of our lives, and in celebration of this art form which enriches us in so many ways, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 292, has designated the week of June 3 through June 9, 1984, as "National Theatre Week," and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of June 3 through June 9, 1984, as National Theatre Week. I encourage the people of the United States to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, programs, and activities.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.

RONALD REAGAN
