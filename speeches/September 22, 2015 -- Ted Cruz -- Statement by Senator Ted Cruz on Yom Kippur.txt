    HOUSTON, Texas — U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement in observance of Yom Kippur.
"Tonight, in synagogues across the world, our Jewish friends will spend a day in prayer, fasting, and personal repentance. The prayers of the day, contained in the timeless machzor,? describe the power of Atonement and conclude that there are three things which can reverse an evil decree — repentance, prayer, and charity. God promises us that if we repent with sincerity, He will always accept our prayers. Let us take this to heart — by looking inward to correct our past mistakes, by asking for God's help, and by reaching out to those around us with acts of kindness, may we be inscribed in the Book of Life and may God's blessings continue to shine upon America, Israel, and our friends around the world. I wish all my Jewish friends a meaningful fast."
