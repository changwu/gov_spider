    On June 18, I announced my intent to nominate Richard Holbrooke as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations because of my confidence that he will make an outstanding U.N. Ambassador. Ambassador Holbrooke has made remarkable contributions to our Nation's security in this administration and in previous administrations: working to bring lasting peace to Bosnia, helping to diffuse tensions and find workable solutions in Kosovo and Cyprus, serving as our Ambassador to Germany, promoting peace in regions of Asia.
Ambassador Holbrooke has stated that he is cooperating with a review by the Departments of State and Justice of his financial disclosure reports and contacts with State Department officials during the year following his departure from government service in February 1996. I look forward to a prompt resolution of this review and submission of his nomination to the Senate.
