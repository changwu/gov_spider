    The President and the people of the United States were shocked and saddened to learn of the murder of Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh. Mrs. Lindh was a tireless advocate for freedom and peace. The United States shares the grief of the Swedish people over their loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Anna Lindh and the Swedish people.
