    On November 16, 1990, consistent with the authority provided me under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701, et seq.), I issued Executive Order No. 12735. In that order, I declared a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons. Because the proliferation of these weapons continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on November 16, 1990, must continue in effect beyond November 16, 1992. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12735.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.
