H.R. 3650, the "Federal Judiciary Emergency Special Sessions Act of 2005," which allows Federal courts to conduct business outside their territorial jurisdiction upon a finding by the court that, because of emergency conditions, no location within its territorial jurisdiction is reasonably available where court could be held.
