    The President announced his intention today to nominate former New Hampshire Congressman Norman E. D'Amours to the Board of Directors of the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).
"The NCUA Board is charged with an important task, safeguarding the futures of the millions of hard-working Americans who put their savings in credit unions. I have faith in Norm D'Amours' ability to uphold that responsibility," said the President.
