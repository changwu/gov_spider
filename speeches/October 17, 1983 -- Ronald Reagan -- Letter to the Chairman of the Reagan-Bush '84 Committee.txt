    Dear Paul:
I am writing this letter in response to your decision to chair Reagan-Bush '84. I deeply appreciate your action. The work of your Committee will be of great help to me at such time as I may make a formal decision to seek a second term as President.
Meanwhile, I recognize that due to the technical requirements of the Federal election laws (including the requirement for the designation of a principal campaign committee), your Committee must file with the Federal Election Commission as a committee that will be working on behalf of my reelection. This letter will serve as my consent for the purpose of allowing you to form this Committee, and I request that Angela M. Buchanan Jackson serve as the Committee's Treasurer.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
[The Honorable Paul Laxalt, United States Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20510]
