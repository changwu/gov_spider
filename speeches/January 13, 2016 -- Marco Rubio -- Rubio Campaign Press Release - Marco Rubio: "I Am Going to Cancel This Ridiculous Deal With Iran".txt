Speaking in South Carolina, Marco pledged to cancel the disastrous Iran deal, citing yesterday's news about the seizure and ill treatment of U.S. servicemen by Iran:


By the way, I don't know if you saw these images, they're really horrifying and they made me really angry this morning. American sailors, on their knees, hands behind their head. A female sailor, forced to wear a headscarf, penned up in a jail cell. You know why these things happen? Because they know they can get away with it with Barack Obama in office. They know they can humiliate us. . . .
That is why on my first day in office, in that Oval Office, I am going to cancel this ridiculous deal he has struck with Iran.
Marco has outlined a policy to stand against Iran, prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and reimpose sanctions on Day One.
