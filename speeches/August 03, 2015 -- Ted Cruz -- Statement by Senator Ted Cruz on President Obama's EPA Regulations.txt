    HOUSTON, Texas — U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement in response to President Obama's announced EPA regulations:
"The President's lawless and radical attempt to destabilize the Nation's energy system is flatly unconstitutional and—unless it is invalidated by Congress, struck down by the courts, or rescinded by the next Administration—will cause Americans' electricity costs to skyrocket at a time when we can least afford it. I urge leaders of both parties, including Democrats who represent communities that will be devastated by this reckless policy, to stand up against this Administration's dangerous agenda of economic decline."
