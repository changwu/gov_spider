    President Trump hasn't just failed the Hawkeye State — he's given up on even trying to lead. More than 130,000 Iowans have tested positive for COVID-19, more than 1,700 have lost their lives, and the economy has been devastated. But the only thing President Trump is offering the people of Iowa is more excuses and lies — not a plan to get the virus under control. Iowans have had enough. They deserve leaders they can count on to fight for them, not for the wealthy and well-connected — and who don't quit on saving lives, but who will end this crisis. As President, I'll work to not only stop COVID-19, but to build our economy back better for working people for generations to come.
