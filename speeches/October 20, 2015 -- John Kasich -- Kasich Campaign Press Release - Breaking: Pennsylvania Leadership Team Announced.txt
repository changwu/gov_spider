Today former Congressmen Bob Walker and John Fox, former State Senator, former Chairman of the Pennsylvania Republican Party Earl Baker, former Senate President Pro Tempore Bob Jubelirer, former Secretary of Revenue Howard Cohen, Luzerne County Republican Party Chairman Bill Urbanski, and Pittsburgh business leader Nick Haden endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich for President.
Bob Walker served more than two decades in the U.S. Congress where he represented southeastern Pennsylvania before retiring in 1996. From 1989—1994, Walker served as Chief Deputy Whip, and when Republicans won control of the House in 1995, then-Speaker Newt Gingrich appointed the Congressman Chairman of Republican Leadership. He also served as Chairman of the Science, Space and Technology Committee and Vice Chairman of the House Budget Committee. During his time in Congress, Walker earned a reputation as strong fiscal hawk and a tireless advocate for limited government.
Said Walker, "I worked alongside John Kasich for fourteen years, and throughout that time, Kasich was a leader, a visionary and a reformer. Whether it was balancing the federal budget or reforming the Pentagon, John never shied away from a challenge, and was uniquely able to bring aboard both Republicans and Democrats to accomplish big things. I am thrilled to serve as his Honorary State Chair, and I look forward to working with our tremendous Leadership Team in Pennsylvania to deliver my home state for John Kasich."
Former State Senator Earl Baker was elected to the Pennsylvania State Senate for two terms and also served as Chairman of the Pennsylvania Republican Party for four years. Prior to his election to the Senate, Baker was a Member of the Chester County Board of Commissioners for more than a decade. Said Baker, "John Kasich has precisely the experience and the record of success that America sorely needs. As governor of Ohio, he turned an $8 billion projected budget deficit into a $2 billion surplus, and presided over an economy that has created more than 347,000 private sector jobs. All the while, he cut taxes by $5 billion dollars – more than any sitting governor – and the state workforce is at its lowest level in more than three decades. By applying conservative principles to pragmatic problem-solving, John Kasich has breathed new life into Ohio, and I am proud to join his team in Pennsylvania."

"I am honored to have gained the confidence of such an esteemed group of conservative leaders," said Kasich. "Pennsylvania is a big, important state, and with the remarkable team that has come together here, I know we are going to be very competitive."
"This Pennsylvania Team is remarkably strong and balanced," said Beth Hansen, campaign manager for Kasich for America. "Anchored by the wisdom and counsel of Congressman Walker, the team includes the right mix of public servants, political strategists and business leaders, who collectively understand what it takes to be successful in Pennsylvania."
