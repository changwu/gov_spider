    I am deeply saddened by the death of Jack Buck. Jack endeared himself to sports fans throughout the country with his colorful commentary and love of America's pastime. An honoree of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, Pro Football Hall of Fame, and Radio Hall of Fame, Jack covered sports in St. Louis, Missouri, and across the Nation for the last 50 years. I extend my deepest sympathies to his family. He will be missed.
