    I am pleased to note that the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted to report the Alaska lands bill earlier this afternoon. While the protections afforded by the committee's bill are not as substantial as those which I originally proposed and which I continue to support, the committee's action today is an important step.
I would like to commend Senator Jackson and the other members of his committee who have devoted their time and energy to this legislation. In particular, I would like to express my thanks to Senator Tsongas, who has led the effort in committee to strengthen the bill.
The passage of legislation protecting Alaska's priceless natural heritage is the highest environmental priority of my administration. The legislation I proposed to the Congress not only protects Alaska's cultural and natural heritage but also accommodates the need for balanced development of Alaska's natural resources. Earlier this year the House passed such a bill. I am hopeful that the Senate will as well.
