    Congressman Jason Chaffetz made the following statement on tonight's debate in Jacksonville:
"Mitt Romney tonight displayed a defense of economic freedom that all conservatives should be proud to support. No other candidate in the field, and certainly not in the White House, has his knowledge of the economy and understanding of how to unleash the American entrepreneurial spirit. As Newt Gingrich's unhinged attacks on free enterprise showed today, he is not the person that our party should nominate to face President Obama. We need someone who will defend the private sector, not denigrate it like President Obama, and give confidence to job creators that they have an ally in the White House."
