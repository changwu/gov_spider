    The President is extremely pleased by the Senate's resolution of advice and consent to ratification of the CFE Treaty.
This action could not be more timely. The CFE Treaty is the cornerstone of the new security structure we have been working to construct in Europe. Its full implementation will put in place a system of equipment limits and verification provisions that will help provide a stable and secure framework for future European political development.
We call upon all other signatories to ratify the treaty promptly so that it can be implemented as soon as possible.
