    President Obama will host Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore at the White House for an official visit and State Dinner on August 2. The two leaders will celebrate the bilateral relationship between Singapore and the United States that has served as an anchor for the U.S. rebalance to Asia. Marking the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations, the two leaders will highlight the enduring principles that have inspired the tremendous growth in our cooperation, which has attracted more than 3,500 U.S. companies to establish a presence in Singapore, forged strong security ties between our militaries, and led to increased exchanges of college students. As partners in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, the Counter-ISIL coalition, and the Paris Climate agreement, the two leaders will discuss how our relationship can continue to address international challenges and advance a rules-based order for the Asia-Pacific.
