    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Cunningham (R) California and 297 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 218 and urges swift House passage of this important measure. H.R. 218 would allow qualified current and retired law enforcement officers with proper identification to carry concealed firearms in certain circumstances, notwithstanding State or local laws to the contrary. The bill would establish a uniform and consistent law rather than require officers to navigate the current patchwork of State and local laws regarding the carrying of concealed firearms. Also, this legislation will better protect the Nation from danger by ensuring that officers are ready to handle an emergency regardless of their location and duty status, and will help them to better protect themselves and their families from vindictive criminals.
