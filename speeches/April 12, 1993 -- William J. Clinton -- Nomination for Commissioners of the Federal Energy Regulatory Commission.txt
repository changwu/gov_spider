    The President announced his intention today to nominate four experts on energy regulation, Bill Massey, Donald Santa, James Hoecker, and Vicky Bailey, to be Commissioners of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He also announced his intention to designate Elizabeth Anne "Betsy" Moler as the Commission's Chair, a position she has held on an interim basis since February.
"I have called for a sensible, comprehensive energy policy that serves our future energy needs, protects our precious environment, and helps to build a growing economy," said the President. "This experienced and talented group of Commissioners will help to meet those goals."
