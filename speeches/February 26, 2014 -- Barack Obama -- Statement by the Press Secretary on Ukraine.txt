    The United States strongly supports Ukrainian leaders' ongoing work to form an inclusive, multiparty government to represent all the people of Ukraine as they prepare for May elections, and to restore order, stability, and unity to the country. As the process moves forward, the United States again calls on all parties in Ukraine and in the region to support reconciliation and the country's return to political and economic health, and will work with the international community in building an economic assistance package based upon Ukraine's achievements in crafting a unity government. An inclusive, broad-based government committed to reconciliation and to economic reform is the necessary foundation for international assistance. We call on Ukraine's leaders to do their utmost to protect the security and human rights of all their citizens, including the rights of minorities, to recommit to honor the state's international obligations, and to avoid divisive policies. We urge outside actors in the region to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, to end provocative rhetoric and actions, to support democratically established transitional governing structures, and to use their influence in support of unity, peace, and an inclusive path forward. We remind all governments of their political commitments to transparency about military activities under the Vienna Document 2011 and other OSCE principles designed to ensure peace and security in the Euro-Atlantic region.
