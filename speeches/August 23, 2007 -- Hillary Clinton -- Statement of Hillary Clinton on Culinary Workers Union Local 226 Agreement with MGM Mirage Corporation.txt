    "Just two weeks ago today I was in Las Vegas visiting with members of the Culinary Union at a rally, energized in support of their contract negotiations. Today I was thrilled to learn that the hard work of negotiating teams on both sides of the table has paid off, and that an agreement has now been reached between the union and MGM Mirage Corporation. This is a great victory for all involved - affirming that quality of life for workers and a prosperous, growing business are not mutually exclusive. Maintaining that balance is the American way, and why the collective bargaining process is so important."
"Through this agreement, MGM Mirage sends a strong message that the workers who support Nevada's tourism industry are the company's greatest and most valuable assets. Their great work fuels one of the nation's most vibrant economies. This agreement will protect workers' rights to fair wages, excellent benefits and opportunities for advancement - ensuring that thousands of Culinary members have the opportunity to achieve their Las Vegas dreams. These successful negotiations are of national significance, proving the importance of union representation to those who would not otherwise have a voice in society."
"I applaud both the Culinary and MGM Mirage for their dedicated efforts to bring about this historic agreement, which will benefit so many members. But there is much more work to be done in Nevada to ensure that all of the union's 50,000 members whose contracts have expired can also rest easy, knowing that they too will have agreements in place. I have pledged to stand with members of the Culinary until every last one has a responsible contract. It is my sincere hope that other negotiations in progress in Nevada can bring about equally positive results."
