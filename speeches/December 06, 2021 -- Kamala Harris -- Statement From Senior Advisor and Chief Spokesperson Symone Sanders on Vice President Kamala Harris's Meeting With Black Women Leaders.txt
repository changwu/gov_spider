    Today, Vice President Kamala Harris convened a follow-up meeting with Black women leaders to discuss progress on the Build Back Better Act, the Administration's efforts to amplify and implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure law, and voting rights. This group of leaders previously met with the Vice President on July 16, 2021 to discuss protecting the fundamental right to vote.
During today's meeting, the leaders engaged with the Vice President on specific provisions of the Build Back Better Act that would benefit all communities, including the Child Tax Credit, Universal Pre-K, and investments in childcare. They discussed the importance of ensuring all Americans have accessible and affordable high-speed internet, which the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes possible. The Vice President thanked the leaders for their continued work on these issues, and reiterated her commitment to seeing the passage of the Build Back Better Act, the Freedom to Vote Act, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.
