    Today, Florida's only statewide elected Democrat, Commissioner of Agriculture Nikki Fried, endorsed Vice President Joe Biden. In 2018, Fried became the first Democrat to win statewide in Florida since 2006.
"This is the most important election of our lifetime. It's so important that we are united together as one party, one state, and one country to defeat Donald Trump in November. I know that the time for that unity is right now â€“ and the candidate to unite behind is Joe Biden," said Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried. "Joe is bringing together a diverse coalition that reflects America's greatness. And Joe's record of selfless service is exactly what we need to restore America's moral compass, heart, and leadership at home and abroad. I'm excited and proud to stand with him today."
Fried's endorsement shows the momentum and strength that Biden has across the Sunshine State as Floridians vote early. Fried joins more than 60 leaders across Florida that have endorsed Joe Biden for President, including former Senators Bill Nelson and Bob Graham, Orlando, Tampa, and St. Petersburg Mayors, and current Members of Congress Debbie Murcarsel-Powell, Kathy Castor, Charlie Crist, Val Demings, Ted Deutch, Lois Frankel, Alcee Hastings, Al Lawson, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Darren Soto, and Frederica Wilson. Biden for President has previously announced more than 2,100 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
Biden's endorsements showcase the diversity of support for Vice President Biden in Florida and across the country, as well as the trust that these leaders have in his ability to beat Donald Trump, restore the soul of this nation, rebuild the middle class, and bring the country together.
