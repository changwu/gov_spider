Earlier this week, Nevada Assemblyman David Gardner announced he was switching from supporting Jeb to supporting Marco.
Now he's joined in Nevada by Washoe County Commissioner Bob Lucey, who had this to say about making the switch:
After watching Marco in the last two debates, I have come to realize that there is no candidate running for president who has shown a better understanding of our national security challenges and the struggles that working families across Nevada face than Marco Rubio.
Marco is a leader we can trust to keep us safe and ensure that each of us has more and better opportunities, and he is the only candidate who can unite the party and defeat the Democrats this November. I am proud to offer him my full support.

Lucey announced his decision yesterday at an event featuring Rep. Jason Chaffetz.
