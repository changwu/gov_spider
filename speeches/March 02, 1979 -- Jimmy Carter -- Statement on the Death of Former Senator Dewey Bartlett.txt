    Rosalynn and I extend our deepest sympathy to the family of Dewey Bartlett.He was the second Republican Governor in Oklahoma history, and although his Senate career was cut short by his illness, he had already established himself as a strong conservative voice in the Senate with an abiding concern for solving our Nation's energy problems.
We were often on opposite sides on issues, but I found him a worthy opponent and shared his colleagues' respect for Senator Bartlett's abilities and dedication, and join them in mourning his loss.
