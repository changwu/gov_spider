    Today Kasich for America announced a new TV and digital ad buy in Massachusetts.
"Progress," which will begin airing on Thursday, points to John Kasich's record of success as governor of Ohio: 400,000 new private sector jobs, the largest tax cut in the nation and fewer regulations slowing the growth of small businesses.
Said Senior Adviser John Weaver, "Results matter. In Ohio, they matter to every small business owner who has stayed afloat because of John Kasich's tax cuts. They matter to every person who feeds their family with a job that John Kasich helped create. Americans are looking for leadership that translates into solutions to our greatest challenges. That leadership can only come from John Kasich."
