WH in-town pool report #6/ POTUS remarks at first DNC virtual reception
POTUS spoke at a virtual reception for the Democratic National Committee at 3.46pm. Pool joined via Zoom but it was audio only.
POTUS said: "I'm on mute - can you hear me now? All right. Well, thank you very much, Jamie, for that introduction and your leadership at DNC.
"Look, to all of you, thank you for leading our state parties. I've been all over the country as well and I tell you what, your heart and soul have been put into this effort. And you can feel it. You can really feel it. I just feel optimistic.
"I don't want to take too much of your time but we still got a lot of work to do to get out that vote. But no matter what happens tomorrow, I want to thank you and let you know how grateful I am to you.
"You helped get me and Kamala elected in 2020 and we're going to surprise the living devil out of people because of all the work you've done. You've helped generate support for our agenda for the past 20 months and then some of the most consequential things we've ever accomplished with the narrowest of margins.
"I kid with Kamala, every time she voted, we win - we have 50-50 in the Senate. And we won a lot. You represent everything about our party and the reason why I got into politics in the first place, to get us through the pandemic, take on the powerful special interests and give working people in the middle class a chance. We finally took on Big Pharma and beat them. I've been fighting for that for a long time.
"Protect climate with American jobs and ingenuity to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms. Nobody, even mainstream Republicans are no longer talking about, is there a climate crisis? They've seen what's happened just in the last six, eight, 10 months around the country.
"And look, you also worked like the devil to protect the climate but beyond that, American jobs and American ingenuity, protect the fundamental rights and freedoms we have as Americans, which are very much in jeopardy if these Maga Republicans take over.
"You're bringing people in the political process, making sure that democracy delivers. That's what a Democrat is all about. Not the power for power's sake but the power to do good for the country. That sounds self-serving about us, but it's true: the power to do good for the country.
"As I say, the super wealthy don't need us but the working folks need us. Serious people, we're doing God's work out here. And what you've done with this midterm cycle, I think is literally incredible. Getting voters registered, getting the early vote out, getting them fully engaged and it matters, it matters.
"You know, one more night, probably another 30 hours nationwide between now and where we are till the last vote is cast. One more night to do everything we can to win it and to keep it going. Look, if we're able to hold on, we're going to be in incredible shape. Imagine what we can do in a second term. If we maintain control. I know that sounds like a very high expectation, but I think - anyway, I'm optimistic.
"I want to remind you to remind your teams, with so much at stake for our nation, don't leave a thing - put it all out there. Go full bore till the last poll closes. Make that extra call - not a joke. Knock on that extra door. Most of all, keep the faith. Remind the folks that the power is in their hands.
"This is not a referendum, this is a choice, and the more people we get out to vote, we win. We win. So let's go win. Let's get everybody we possibly can to vote. Get 'em to the polls. I want to thank you and God bless you all for all you've done because it truly matters. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."

WH in-town pool report #7/ POTUS remarks at second DNC virtual reception
POTUS spoke at another virtual reception for the Democratic National Committee at 4.07pm. Pool joined via Zoom but it was audio only. At one point POTUS criticised Republicans, saying: "We're up against some of the darkest forces we've ever seen in our history. These Maga Republicans are a different breed of cat. This is not your father's Republican party. It's a different deal."
Full remarks below:
"Jamie, thank you, pal. You know, that introduction is a little over the top for me, but I tell you what, it's not for your leadership. And Chris, you've done a hell of a job, pal. You have really done one incredible job. And thank you for leading in our finance effort. And the fact that you Virginia McGregor from Scranton with you - that helped a little bit, too.
"Anyway, look, I just went through the numbers - let me say that as well; I know you just said it - because I know how hard it is to raise a total of $292 million this cycle. I want you to know how grateful I am, how much it matters to everyone, how much it matters to our chances. And I want you to know that, you know, you helped get me and Kamala elected in 2020, and you raised a lot of money for us as well.
"But you helped generate support for our agenda during the last almost two years. You kept us going. You helped generate so much. We got some really big things done and some of the most consequential things ever accomplished by the narrowest of margins. A 50-50 Senate - I told Kamala, every time she votes, she wins. And she does.
"And so we have a shot at keeping the Senate and increasing it and I'm optimistic about the House as well. You know, you guys represent everything that's good about our party. The reason why we got into politics in the first place. We got involved in politics in the first place to help people. We helped them get through the pandemic, helped them deal with the crises they all face, helped them with their health care, helped them across the board to take on powerful special interests, particularly Pharma. You know, I've been doing this for a long time. We finally beat Pharma because of your help.
"You know, we take on powerful special interests, working to give the middle class just a shot, just an even chance. As my dad used to say, I don't expect the government to solve my problem but at least I expect them to understand my problem. So here's what we did. We went out there. We took on those interests. We gave the middle class a fighting chance.
"We've got a lot more to do: protect the climate, American jobs and ingenuity. We passed the biggest climate bill ever, ever in American history, almost $400 billion. It matters. It matters. It's just beginning to take hold. We did everything from - anyway, I won't get into everything we got done.
"But we also, most importantly, I think, fought to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms that bring people into the political process and make sure this democracy delivers. That's what being a Democrat is all about. It's not about power for power's sake. It's about getting power to work for people who need a little bit of help. Just a shot. My dad used to say, just a shot, just a little bit of breathing room. And that's what being a Democrat's all about.
"Again, not power for power's sake but power for the good of the country. You know, I know it's not easy. We're up against some of the darkest forces we've ever seen in our history. These Maga Republicans are a different breed of cat. This is not your father's Republican party. It's a different deal. That's why what you did is so important.
"Because we're in this election when history suggests we shouldn't be. We should be being blown away. With your support, we've been able to get voters registered, get them to vote early, get them fully engaged, get them excited, and make 'em understand that this matters. It matters so much. We've got one more night to do everything we can to win, another probably 30 hours between the last poll close. So let's go win this thing.
"And no matter what happens tomorrow, we need you in the path ahead. We really do. We're just getting started. We're just getting started and we have so much more we can do and to be proud of. So once again, thank you, thank you, thank you. You know, you're an incredible group of people and the way you've gone out there and never let a moment go by without making our case is just incredible. So I want to thank you again, God bless you all and may God protect our troops.
"And by the way, you heard me say a thousand times, as my Grandpa Finnegan used to say when I walked out the door, 'Joey, keep the faith.' And my grandmother: 'No, Joey, spread it.' You're spreading the faith. It really matters to our democracy and the rest of the world looking to us as well. Not just folks at home, the rest of the world, and you're allowing us to do it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
