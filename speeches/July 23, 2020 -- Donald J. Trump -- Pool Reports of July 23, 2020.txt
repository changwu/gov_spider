Advisor Trump has spearheaded the administration's commitment to these efforts, working closely with the President on the One Trillion Trees Initiative â€“ an ambitious global effort to conserve, restore, and grow a trillion trees around the world.

 In-town pool report #12 -- POTUS plays catch with Rivera 
By now much of this should have aired on ESPN, but check any quotes here against the transcript.
One bit of news was the president responding to a question about National outfielder Juan Soto's positive COVID-19 test.
"No, no, no. They'll be able to take care of it. They're going to be able to take care of it," Trump said.
He said he would watch at least part of tonight's Yankees-Nationals game.
"If I can, I'm going to. I'm going to watch at least a part of it. I've been pretty busy between China, Russia, North Korea and about 30 other nations, but I will certainly get a little bit of it, yes," the president said.
As for the event itself, at 6:07 p.m., President Trump and Mariano Rivera emerged from the White House to see two rows of Little Leaguers playing catch on the South Lawn.The president and Rivera were largely out of audio range of the pool. initially as they greeted the Little League players and made their way to the end of the lines.
The greatest there ever was" Trump said of Rivera, and the two men took baseball gloves and played catch for a few minutes before stopping to make remarks, likely for the ESPN pregame audience.
"Let me ask you for an audience, big audience, you were the greatest reliever of all time. You've got a presidential Medal of Freedom. In Fact, Tiger Woods got it and you did it right after Tiger."
"You had a pitch that broke a lot of bats, Mariano. I've watched many, sitting with George, good old George who is watching you right now," Trump said. "He's very proud of you, but sitting with George and I watched you break more bats."
"The Lord gave me that great pitch," Rivera said of the cutter that was the Hall of Fame closer's trademark pitch.
President Trump also repeated some comments he had made at the briefing about Rivera's warm-up song "Enter Sandman"
President Trump said he had spoken with Yankees president Randy Levine, "he said the team's going to be great."
At 6:15 p.m. the president and Rivera gathered with the Little Leaguers and their coaches for a group photograph. Rivera could be seen appearing to sign some autographs, and the president and Rivera returned to the White House minutes later.
