    Ozal
President Bush held a wide-ranging discussion for approximately 1 hour with President Ozal of Turkey this afternoon, with particular attention to the Persian Gulf. Their discussion was characterized by the same close cooperation that we have enjoyed with Turkey. President Bush noted that Turkey is showing real leadership in the international response to Iraq's aggression against Kuwait and that the United States is committed to helping Turkey to deal with the effects of that situation on Turkey.
President Bush accepted President Ozal's previous invitation to pay a state visit to Turkey in the first part of 1991. President Bush's visit will symbolize the particularly close ties between the United States and Turkey and is intended to contribute to a continuation of the excellent relations between the two countries. President Bush and President Ozal agreed to confirm a date for the meeting soon. The last American President to visit Turkey was President Eisenhower in 1959.
Mazowiecki
President Bush met for approximately 20 minutes with Polish Prime Minister Mazowiecki. They discussed the Polish debt situation, and President Bush stated the U.S. concerns and understanding of this matter and noted that the United States will be addressing it seriously. Prime Minister Mazowiecki reemphasized Polish support of the United Nations Gulf policy and stated that Poland will shortly be sending a hospital ship and a rescue ship to the area. President Bush expressed his gratitude for the Polish effort in support of the international community's stand against the Iraqi aggression in Kuwait. President Bush reiterated the need for the international community to continue in its firm resolve against the Iraqi aggression so that Saddam Hussein [President of Iraq] fully recognizes he has no choice but to comply with the United Nations resolutions.
