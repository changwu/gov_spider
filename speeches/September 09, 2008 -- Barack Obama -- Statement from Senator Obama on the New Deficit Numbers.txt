    Chicago, IL -- "Today, we learned that Washington has run up a record budget deficit of $407 billion this year, more than $1 trillion worse than the budget surplus President Bush promised for 2008 in his first budget. John McCain wants us to think he represents change, but he wants to spend $3.4 trillion more than President Bush on tax cuts, most of which will go to the wealthiest corporations and big oil companies and leave more than 100 million middle-class families without a dime of tax relief. Barack Obama will bring real change by cutting taxes for middle-class families and small businesses, paying for all his proposals to reduce the deficit, and will put America on a path towards fiscal responsibility and a stronger economy," said Senator Barack Obama.
