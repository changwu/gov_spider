My dear Mr. Speaker:
I am glad to learn of your interest in the American Opera Company. It is a vital movement to establish a national organization for young American singers, composers and writers.
I wish to take this opportunity to endorse so fine an effort and to urge all music loving Americans to lend their support in making it a permanent national institution.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
