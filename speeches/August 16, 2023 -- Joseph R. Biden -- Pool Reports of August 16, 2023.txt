In town pool report #7 - Biden speaks
Biden, wearing a dark suit and flanked by  about 16 stage participants, started by touting how IRA took on special interests, created good paying jobs. He began speaking at 3:10.
"Guess what, it's working," he said in his trademark whisper.
"When I think climate- not a joke- I think jobs," he said.
Tens of billions of dollars in gasoline will be saved by 2030, he said.
"When I say climate means jobs, I mean good paying union jobs."
Says he cut deficit by $1.7 trillion.
Average billionaire in America pays an 8.2 percent tax rate, he said.
"I'm not here to declare victory on the economy," he said. "We have a lot more work to do."
"When we invest in ourselves, we strengthen the middle class."
After about a half hour of speaking, he raised his voice and spoke passionately about how America has never failed when it sets out to accomplish its goals.
Crowd stood and applauded as he finished his remarks at 3:37.
