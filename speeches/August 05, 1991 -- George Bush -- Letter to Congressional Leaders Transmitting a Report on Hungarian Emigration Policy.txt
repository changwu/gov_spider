    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In January 1991 I determined and reported to the Congress that Hungary continues to meet the emigration criteria of the Jackson-Vanik amendment to, and section 409 of, the Trade Act of 1974.
As required by law, I am submitting an updated formal report to the Congress concerning emigration laws and policies of the Republic of Hungary. You will find that the report indicates continued Hungarian compliance with U.S. and international standards in the areas of emigration and human rights policy.
Sincerely,
George Bush
