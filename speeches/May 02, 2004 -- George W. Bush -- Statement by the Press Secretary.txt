    We have been informed of the results of the Likud voting. Our own view has not changed: The President welcomed Prime Minister Sharon's plan to withdraw settlements from Gaza and a part of the West Bank as a courageous and important step toward peace. We will be in consultation with the Prime Minister and the Government of Israel about how to move forward.
