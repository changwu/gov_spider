    Tonight the United States Senate finally overcame weeks of parliamentary roadblocks by a partisan minority and voted to restore desperately needed unemployment insurance assistance to 2 1/2 million Americans who lost their jobs in the recession. Americans who are working day and night to get back on their feet and support their families in these tough economic times deserve more than obstruction and partisan game-playing that happens too often here in Washington. I thank the Members of the Senate who stood on the side of these working families today and urge Members of the House to pass this extension so I can quickly sign it into law. I also call on Congress to act on more proposals that support our economic recovery, including passing critical aid to our States and support to small businesses to create new private sector jobs.
