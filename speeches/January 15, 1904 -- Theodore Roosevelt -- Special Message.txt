    To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a petition to the President of the United States to aid in preserving the Calaveras groves of big trees, submitted by the Calaveras Big Tree Committee and the citizens of California and elsewhere.
I cordially recommend it to the favorable consideration of the Congress. The Calaveras Big Tree Grove is not only a Californian, but a national inheritance, and all that can be done by the Government to insure its preservation should be done.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
