    Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:) 
In accordance with section 517 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2321k), I am providing notice of my intent to designate Colombia as a Major Non-NATO Ally.
I am making this designation in recognition of the importance of the U.S.-Colombia relationship and Colombia's crucial contributions to regional and international security.
Sincerely,
JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
