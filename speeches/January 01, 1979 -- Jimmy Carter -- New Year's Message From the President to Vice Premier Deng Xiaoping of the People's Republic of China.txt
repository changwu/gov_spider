    On this New Year's Day, I welcome the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China.
New tasks now await us. The new Sino-American relationship offers great potential benefit to the welfare of our peoples, to the promotion of peace and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region, and to stability throughout the world.
The American people—and I personally—look forward to your forthcoming visit to the United States. In Washington, we can talk seriously with each other about both global and bilateral matters.
Together, we can seize the opportunity your visit affords us to foster a constructive and enduring relationship between our two peoples. To that end, Mrs. Carter joins me in wishing you and Madame Cho Lin a Happy New Year, and we look forward to greeting you in the United States.
