    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 9/21/92)(House)(Horton (R) New York and 5 others)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 5851, and will seek Senate amendments to:

— Delete section 6(b), which would vest the Commission with broad subpoena power. This power would be inappropriate in light of the Commission's advisory role.
— Provide for appointment of all Commission members by the President.
— Clarify that Federal agencies would not be required to furnish to the Commission information determined by an agency head to be confidential in nature.
— Change the date by which the Director of the Office of Management and Budget would be required to submit a final report from January 21, 1995, to two years after the submission of the Commission's final report.
