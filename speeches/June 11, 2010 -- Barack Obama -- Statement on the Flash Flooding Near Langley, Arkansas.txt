    Michelle and I would like to extend heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of those who lost their lives during this horrible flash flood, and we offer our prayers for those who anxiously await news of loved ones still missing. State and local first-responders continue their critical lifesaving efforts on the ground. I have instructed FEMA to be in close contact with Arkansas Emergency Management officials and to report back concerning any unmet needs, and I will ensure that FEMA continues to coordinate with our State and local partners throughout this tragedy. When natural disasters strike, our first-responders are on the frontlines providing emergency assistance and keeping our communities safe. Many of them are showing true bravery today, and for that I thank them.
