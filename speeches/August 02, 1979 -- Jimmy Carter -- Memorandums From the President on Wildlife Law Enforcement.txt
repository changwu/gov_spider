    Memorandum for the Secretary of Agriculture
In my Environmental Message of August 2, 1979, illegal trade in fish and wildlife was identified as a significant environmental problem. Recent criminal and civil investigations have indicated that this trade runs to tens of millions of dollars a year and can introduce serious disease. It is important that we strengthen the individual and collective abilities of agencies to deal with this problem.
We must establish a coordinated federal wildlife enforcement program. To improve the effectiveness of this program, I am submitting legislation that strengthens wildlife enforcement laws. I am also directing agencies to take certain individual actions and to form two task forces to coordinate their activities.
I therefore direct that your Department:
• Assign a representative to a wildlife law enforcement committee chaired by the Department of the Interior which will include representatives from the Departments of Treasury, Justice, Agriculture and Commerce. The committee will review agency enforcement experiences, priorities and problems, expedite review of agency trade regulations, help coordinate federal trade enforcement policies generally and keep agency heads informed.
• Establish and chair a plant enforcement task force which will include representatives from your Department and the Departments of Justice, Interior and Treasury. The task force will investigate the illegal trade in plants and will bring appropriate prosecutions.
• Assign representatives as appropriate to interagency teams, chaired by the Department of the Interior, which will audit wildlife import documents to discover fraudulent documentation.
• Place greater emphasis on coordinating your review of quarantine-related import documents with other documents relating to wildlife imports to protect the quarantine program from the filing of fraudulent documents and to improve enforcement.
• Use special agents to investigate the illegal trade in plants.
Please give these assignments your immediate attention.
