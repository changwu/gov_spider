We appreciate the effort that these companies and their stakeholders have made, and the President's team will be reviewing these reports closely in the days ahead. It is clear that going forward, more will be required from everyone involved - creditors, suppliers, dealers, labor and auto executives themselves - to ensure the viability of these companies going forward.
