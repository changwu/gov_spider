    The President announced today the creation of Presidential Emergency Boards Nos. 202 and 203 to investigate and make recommendations for settlement of current disputes between the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) and employees represented by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and the Brotherhood of Railway, Airline and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employes, respectively.
The President, by Executive orders, created the Emergency Boards pursuant to appropriate requests as mandated by the Railway Labor Act. The LIRR is the largest commuter railroad in the United States, transporting 283,000 passengers each week day over a 330-mile system extending from Manhattan to the end of Long Island. In addition, LIRR provides the only rail freight service on Long Island and connects with the Nation's rail system through New York City.
The emergency board procedures of the Railway Labor Act applicable to commuter railroads provide that the Boards will report their findings and recommendations for settlement to the President within 30 days. The parties must then consider the recommendations of the Emergency Boards and endeavor to resolve their differences without engaging in self-help during a subsequent 90-day period.
