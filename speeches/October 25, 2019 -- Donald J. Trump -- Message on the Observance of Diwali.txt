    As Diwali commences, Melania and I wish those observing the Festival of Lights a blessed and happy celebration.
For many Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and Buddhists in the United States and around the globe, this sacred period is an opportunity to commemorate the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. Throughout this holy time, members of these faiths engage in prayer, light diyas and lanterns, and partake in traditional feasts and other festivities with friends and family.
The observance of Diwali throughout America is an important reminder of the significance of one of our Nation's core tenets: religious liberty. My administration will continue to defend the rights enshrined in our Constitution that enable people of all faiths to worship according to their beliefs and conscience.
We pray that this year's observance brings love, joy, and eternal peace.
