    His Royal Highness Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, led a long, remarkable lifeâ€”the hallmarks of which were loyalty and service. From his decorated service in the Royal Navy during World War II to his long marriage and partnership with Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, he dedicated himself fully to his family, his country, and the Commonwealth. Whether he was promoting environmentalism or the wellbeing of military families, he brought a profound sense of purpose to all he did.
Doug and I send our condolences to the Royal Family and the people of the United Kingdom.
