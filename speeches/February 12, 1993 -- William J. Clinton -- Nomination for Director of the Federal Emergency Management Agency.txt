    The President today announced his intention to nominate James Lee Witt, the head of Arkansas State Office of Emergency Management and a former county judge, as Director of the Nation's Federal Emergency Management Agency. "The devastation wrought by Hurricane Andrew last year was a sober reminder that we need to provide strong, organized, and effective help to American families whose lives are dramatically affected by disaster," President Clinton said. "James Lee has done an outstanding job in Arkansas, and I am confident he will do the same for the country in his new role."
