    By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 4, Title II of the act of November 26, 1940, 54 Stat. 1212, and as President of the United States, after suitable investigation by the Civil Service Commission, including consultation with representatives of the heads of executive departments and independent establishments concerned, and finding that such action is necessary to the more efficient operation of the Government, it is hereby ordered as follows:
1. There are hereby excluded from the provisions of the Classification Act of 1923, as amended and extended, positions filled by patients in hospitals operated by the Federal Government or the municipal government of the District of Columbia.
2. Unless otherwise provided by law, the rates of compensation for such positions shall be determined by the heads of the respective departments and independent establishments or by the Commissioners of the District of Columbia. No such rate of compensation shall exceed the rate which would be applicable to the position if it had remained under the provisions of the Classification Act of 1923, as amended.
3. This order shall take effect as to the several positions as of the first pay period commencing after the date hereof.
