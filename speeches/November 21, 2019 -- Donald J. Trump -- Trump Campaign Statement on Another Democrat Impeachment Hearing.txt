    "Two more witnesses and two more whiffs by Democrats in their sham impeachment circus. Let's remember that Nancy Pelosi promised she would not proceed with impeachment unless it was a bipartisan endeavor, which it clearly is not. Adam Schiff has turned the House Intelligence Committee into an arm of the Democratic National Committee, and despite that has managed to produce no evidence at all that President Trump did anything wrong. New public polls show that independent voters and most Americans are rejecting the Democrat charade, and with good reason."
- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
