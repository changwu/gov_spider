    I want to congratulate Mr. Mazowiecki on his election as Prime Minister of Poland and assure him of our strong support as he seeks to lead his country toward economic recovery and democratic change. I also salute President Jaruzelski, for his political wisdom in endorsing a government reflecting the genuine will of the Polish people, and Solidarity, under the leadership of Lech Walesa, for its constructive role in helping bring about a new beginning in Poland.
Since the roundtable agreement of last April, Poland has pursued a path of democratic change. The elections in June, the convening of Poland's new Parliament and its election of General Jaruzelski as President, and now the election of Mr. Mazowiecki as Prime Minister, are further dramatic signs of this historic process. These developments hold promise not only for a peaceful democratic transition in Poland but also for a broader process of European reconciliation, toward a Europe whole and free.
At Hamtramck, Michigan, just after the signing of the roundtable agreement between the Polish Government and Solidarity, I pledged U.S. support for Poland's economic and political reforms. We reiterated that support during visits to Warsaw and Gdansk last month and announced measures we are taking to assist. I want the Polish people and their new government to know that they will have our continued support as they meet the serious economic and political challenges before them.
