    As a veteran, teacher, minister, and Congressman, Edolphus Towns has dedicated his life to public service. In his 30 years representing the people of New York, Ed has fought tirelessly to improve the public health care system, strengthen consumer protections, and improve the public education system. He has served as chairman for the Congressional Black Caucus, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and currently chairs the Congressional Social Work Caucus, which he created to provide a platform for over 600,000 social workers who positively impact the lives of the elderly, the disadvantaged, children, and veterans. Michelle and I join the people of New York in wishing Ed and his family all the best in the future.
