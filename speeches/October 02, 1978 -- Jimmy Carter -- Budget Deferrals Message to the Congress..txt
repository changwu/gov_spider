    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report 30 deferrals of fiscal year 1979 funds totalling $1,178.2 million. The deferrals are primarily routine in nature and do not, in most cases, affect program levels.
The details of each deferral are contained in the attached reports.
