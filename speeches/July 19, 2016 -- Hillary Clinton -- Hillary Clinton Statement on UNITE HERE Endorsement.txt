    Today, following the endorsement of UNITE HERE, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement:
"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of UNITE HERE.
"American workers built the greatest middle class in history by fighting for higher wages, safer working conditions, retirement security and the right to organize and bargain collectively. UNITE HERE has been on the front lines for decades, fighting to raise the minimum wage and reform our broken immigration system. They've stood strong to protect the rights and safety of workers across the country—and they've stood up to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, who personally signed a contract with a union-busting firm to try to keep UNITE HERE from organizing workers in Las Vegas. I was proud to visit with UNITE HERE workers on the picket line twice in the primary, and I was even prouder when they overcame Trump's intimidation campaign and were officially certified as a union earlier this year.
"UNITE HERE knows, as I do, that America is stronger together. Workers' rights to organize, to bargain collectively, to be safe on the job, and to retire with dignity and security after years of hard work are fundamental to our country and to our economy. In too many statehouses across the country—and even in the halls of Congress—these rights are under concerted attack by Republicans and big corporations who have forgotten that a strong economy requires a strong workforce. If I am elected President, workers will always have a seat at the table and a champion in the White House. I'll protect and build upon President Obama's executive actions on immigration and will introduce legislation to at last secure comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship within my first 100 days. And I'll always have workers' backs—because when workers are strong, America is strong."
