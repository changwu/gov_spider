    Laura and I are deeply saddened by the death of Ed Bradley. For over 40 years, the American people have turned to Ed as a trusted source of information about events that have shaped our Nation. From serving as a White House correspondent to his many years as a journalist for a television newsmagazine, he produced distinctive investigative reports that inspired action and cemented his reputation as one of the most accomplished journalists of our time.
Today our thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Bradley's family and colleagues.
