I'm from Columbia, S.C, home of the University of South Carolina Gamecocks!

I'm a teacher at a local elementary school here in Columbia, SC. When I'm not volunteering or working I enjoy reading a good book, playing with my three dogs, and talking to literally anyone and everyone about Marco Rubio.

A typical day on the trail varies but is always fun!

Before I even get out of bed I check Facebook and Twitter for any new Marco Rubio articles and updates. 

Then I stock up with plenty of coffee and Diet Coke for a long but fun day. I go teach all day and then head down to our state headquarters in downtown Columbia.
From there, I go door knocking, place yard signs, or make phone calls.

On special days we get to go to see Marco at his local events. I never get tired of seeing him in person and listening to him speak!

Volunteering involves a lot of hard work, time from family and friends, and lots of talking. 
I can honestly say I can't imagine doing anything different with my time for the past 5 months; us volunteers have all truly become a family. 

I love campaigning and I encourage everyone to get involved â€” just go here to sign up to volunteer in your state, and go here to make calls from home!
I promise the experience is worth everything and more. I hope to see you on the trail!
