    I am signing into law today S. 1671, which designates the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness in the State of Montana.
This act adds 904,500 acres of some of Montana's most rugged and beautiful backcountry alpine lakes, meadows, and mountains to the National Wilderness Preservation System. It is the product of years of work by that tireless and dedicated conservationist, the late Senator Lee Metcalf of Montana. The enactment of this bill fulfills one of his dreams. I want to express my appreciation for the dedication of Senator Metcalf and to his colleagues in the Senate and House of Representatives who have helped make this act possible.
This administration's goal of incorporating the Nation's most deserving areas as wilderness before they are lost forever moves an important step closer to realization with the enactment of this bill.
