    Staten Island, NY - Newt Gingrich released the following statement regarding Herman Cain's announcement to suspend his presidential campaign.
Herman Cain's 999 plan got our country talking about the critical issue of how to reform our tax code and he elevated the dialogue of the Republican presidential primary in the process. I am proud to know Herman Cain and consider him a friend. I know from having worked with him for more than a decade he will continue to be a powerful voice in the conservative movement for years to come.
