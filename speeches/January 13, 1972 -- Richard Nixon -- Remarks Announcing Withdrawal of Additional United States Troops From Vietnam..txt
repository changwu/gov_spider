    Ladies and gentlemen:
I am announcing today the withdrawal of an additional 70,000 [troops] from Vietnam over the next 3 months.
This means that our troop ceiling by May 1 will be down to 69,000. This withdrawal has the approval of the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Government of South Vietnam.
There will be another announcement that will be made before May 1 with regard to a further withdrawal.
The Secretary of Defense will brief you on the details of the announcement.
