GOV. BOBBY JINDAL: "I think the voters, we've been in Ohio and Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh today, I think voters understand this is the most important election of our lifetimes. These two different candidates offer two very different visions for America. Under President Obama, he has grown the federal government to 24% of the GDP. 23 million underemployed, unemployed Americans. He has grown taxes, grown spending with Obamacare expanding government, creating a new entitlement program. Governor Romney offers a very different vision for the government and for our country. He wants to grow the private sector, not the public sector. He wants to shrink government spending. He wants to cut taxes. I think people understand that you've got two probably of the most different views of the role of the government, the future of our economy, the future of our country in a presidential contest in probably a generation. This president is the most liberal, incompetent president probably since going all the way back to Jimmy Carter. And so there will be a lot of dust-ups and a lot of distraction especially from the presidential camp. The reality is the President can't run on his record, can't run on his broken promises. This is really about two very different visions for America."
