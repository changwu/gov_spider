    In my State of the Union Address, I outlined a major research and production effort called Project BioShield to better protect the American people against possible bioterrorist attacks. I commend the House for passing the "Project BioShield Act of 2003." This legislation will help spur the development and availability of next generation countermeasures against biological, chemical, nuclear, and radiological weapons. I urge the Senate to act on this very important legislation.
