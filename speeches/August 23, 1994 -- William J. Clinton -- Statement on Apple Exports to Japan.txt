    I am pleased to announce that the Government of Japan has agreed to take the first steps to open its market to American apples. This is good news for Washington's apple industry and for those workers whose jobs depend on it.
As many of you may know, American apples have been totally banned from the Japanese market for the past 23 years. After months of negotiations, however, we have cleared away obstacles to the export of apples from the State of Washington. Right now, apples are being inspected in preparation for export.
Exports mean jobs, and that is why we will continue to work to open markets in Japan and elsewhere. I appreciate Japan taking this step toward greater liberalization of trade and closer economic relations between our two countries. As we move ahead, I look forward to building on this achievement to open Japan's markets to more of America's competitive goods and services.
