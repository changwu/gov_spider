Yesterday I was asked about Cuba, and of course, I'm terribly disappointed that Castro seems to be firming up his totalitarian position instead of moving towards the free and fair elections -- what I think all of us here would like to see. I'd like to see him shift from that highly militarized island and let democracy have a chance.

And we want to see democracy and freedom. We want to see self-determination. And we also want to see peaceful evolution. And that is in the interest of Eastern Europe as they begin to solidify their democracy. And so, that would be my appeal. And the second one would be please don't ask me any more hypothetical questions because I don't want to get -- --
Q. But it's not a hypothetical. Have you been in contact with Gorbachev on this question?
The President. Previously, yes.
