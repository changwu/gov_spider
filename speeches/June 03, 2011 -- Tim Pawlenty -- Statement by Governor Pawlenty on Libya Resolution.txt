    "The House of Representatives has voted on a resolution questioning President Obama's leadership on Libya. The fact that this resolution is required is a testament to the President's failure of leadership on foreign policy. Members of the House from both parties have asked where we are headed in Libya, wondered whether the Commander in Chief is poised to command troops, asked for information about costs and end game, and been rebuffed. The American people have seen President Obama speak only briefly on the question of NATO operations in Libya. Is it any wonder there are doubts?
"As President, I will engage the Congress and the American people to support a transparent, coherent strategy in defense of American lives, American interests, and American values in the world."
