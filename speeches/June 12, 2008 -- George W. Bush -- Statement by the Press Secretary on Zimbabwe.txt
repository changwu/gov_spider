    The United States is deeply troubled by reports that the Secretary General of the Movement for Democratic Change Tendai Biti has been arrested upon his return to Zimbabwe. The Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), African Union, and the United Nations have all called for an end to intimidation and violence so as to allow for a free and fair democratic process. The continued use of state-sponsored violence in Zimbabwe and the regime's actions, including unwarranted arrests of opposition figures, are clear signs that the regime has rejected these calls by the region and the international community, and is in clear violation of SADC's election principles. We believe the time has come for the United Nations Security Council to take up immediately the issue to prevent further deterioration of the region's humanitarian and security situation.
