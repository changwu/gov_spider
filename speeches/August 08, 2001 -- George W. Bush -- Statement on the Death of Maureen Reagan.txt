    Laura and I are deeply saddened to learn of Maureen Reagan's death. Maureen was a devoted, caring daughter and mother. She fought tirelessly to increase funding for Alzheimer's research and raise public awareness of the disease. Our thoughts and prayers are with Maureen's husband, Dennis, their daughter, Rita, and the entire family.
