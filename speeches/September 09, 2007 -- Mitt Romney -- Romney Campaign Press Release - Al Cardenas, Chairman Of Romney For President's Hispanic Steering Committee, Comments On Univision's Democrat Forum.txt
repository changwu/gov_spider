Boston, MA â€“ Al Cardenas, the Chairman of Romney for President's National Hispanic Steering Committee, issued the following statement regarding tonight's Democrat presidential forum on Univision:
"Tonight's Univision forum demonstrated once again the consequences that a President Clinton, President Obama or President Edwards would have on the Hispanic community. Whether it's tax increases for families and the two million Hispanic business owners, socialist-style health care, coddling dictators, opposing free trade with our allies or putting family values last, the Democrat presidential candidates made clear how out of sync their policies are with the best interests of the Hispanic community.
"Mitt Romney has put in the effort to reach out to this vital bloc, and, after watching tonight's debate, I am confident his vision for the Hispanic community and all Americans will trounce the Democrats' vision in any match-up."
