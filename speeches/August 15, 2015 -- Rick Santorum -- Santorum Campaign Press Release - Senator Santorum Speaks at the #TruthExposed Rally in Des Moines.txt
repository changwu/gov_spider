    In recent weeks, a series of videos have exposed the horrific procedures being performed at Planned Parenthood's facilities. These videos have shocked the nation, and more and more people are joining the call to defund Planned Parenthood every day.
Senator Santorum has always stood up for the dignity of every human life, and on August 15 he rallied with Iowa Right to LifeÂ in Des Moines and call for an end to these barbaric practices.
Our tax dollars shouldn't be used for morally objectionable purposes, and Planned Parenthood should be defunded immediately.
If you agree, join our campaign today and call for both the federal government and the states to defund Planned Parenthood and defend the dignity of every human life.
