    Hillary and I are deeply saddened to learn of the death of General John Stanford. His life was marked by bravery and dedicated to the service of his country. From Vietnam to the Pentagon to the public school classrooms of Seattle, America is lucky to have been blessed by General Stanford's leadership, compassion, and vision. After 30 years of military service, the general brought his own infectious brand of courage and optimism to a new battle. He streamlined and reinvigorated Seattle's schools, inspiring his students to strive for excellence and an entire community to believe once again in their public schools. Our thoughts and prayers go to his wife, Patricia, their sons, Steven and Scott, and the students, teachers, and schools of Seattle.
