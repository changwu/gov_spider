    Gov. Kulongoski is First Signer Of Online Petition Urging Sen. Obama to Debate In Oregon
Oregon for Hillary today launched an online petition at www.debateoregon.com., urging Sen. Obama to participate in two Oregon debates proposed by Hillary Clinton. Supporters can also text "DEBATE" to "442008" to sign the petition on their cell phone.
"Hillary Clinton is committed to listening to Oregonians, and with the launch of her new Oregon Compact policy plan, she is pledging to work closely with our state," said Oregon for Hillary Communications Director and Oregon native, Julie Edwards. "Oregon voters should have the same chance to hear from the candidates as the voters of Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire - all of which hosted debates. We encourage everyone to go to www.debateoregon.com. to send the clear message that Oregon issues deserve to be heard."
Oregon Governor Ted Kulongoski became the first to sign the petition and announced a multi-city trip tomorrow to discuss Hillary's Oregon Compact and advocate for a candidates' debate.
Earlier today, Clinton challenged Sen. Obama to participate in two Oregon debates:
"Since the Pacific Northwest hasn't had a single presidential debate, I am proposing today that Oregon host two Democratic debates, including one specific debate on the challenges facing rural Oregonians. I encourage Oregonians to pay attention in the weeks ahead; to see how Senator Obama and I address the issues that people in Oregon care about. Debates about real issues -- Oregon issues -- are good for the state and healthy for our democracy."
