    I commend the Senate for passing legislation that will bolster the Nation's defenses against biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear threats. Project BioShield will speed the development of new vaccines and treatments that would help prevent harm to Americans in a terrorist attack. This legislation carries out my proposal to encourage accelerated research and development of medical countermeasures based on the latest scientific discoveries, provides for rapid stockpiling of critical new drugs and vaccines, and makes these treatments available quickly in emergency situations. America is more secure today because we have placed a strong emphasis on homeland defense, and initiatives like Project BioShield are another important step in winning the war on terror.
