PAUL RYAN: "The American system of limited government and free enterprise has done more to help the poor, has done more to uplift people out of lives of dependency and on to lives of self-sufficiency, has done more to create opportunity than any other economic system ever designed. We don't want to replace that. We want to renew and revitalize that. That is the American idea of economic opportunity."
