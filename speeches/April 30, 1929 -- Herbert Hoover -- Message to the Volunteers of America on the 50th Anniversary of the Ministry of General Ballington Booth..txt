My dear Mr. Young:
The Fiftieth Anniversary of the ministry of General Ballington Booth is rightly the occasion for general felicitations, and I gladly extend mine both to him and to Mrs. Maud Booth.
Their work in developing the Volunteers of America into an organization of its present high social value is a distinctive contribution to human welfare. Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
