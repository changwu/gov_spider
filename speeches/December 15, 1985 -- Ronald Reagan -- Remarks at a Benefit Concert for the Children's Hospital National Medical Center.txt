    Nancy and I are delighted that so many have lent their talents tonight to help benefit the Children's Hospital National Medical Center here in Washington. On occasions like this, our thoughts reach back to that day 1,985 years ago in Bethlehem. Tom, I hope you won't feel like I'm horning in on your profession, but I'd like to read a contemporary news account of that event 2,000 years ago: "And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them and the glory of the Lord showed 'round them, and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, 'Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the City of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.'"
So, it's appropriate that in the Christmas season we honor the little children. Like the Savior who first appeared in this world a helpless infant, our children, in their vulnerability, innocence, and trust, carry the light of the world in their hearts. With our children, we literally hold the future in our arms. Let us follow the better angels of our nature and come to see this thing which the Lord has made known to us in the spirit of every little child.
Let me read a little more of that news account: "'And this shall be a sign unto you,' the angel said to the shepherds. 'Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.' And suddenly there was with the angel, a multitude of the heavenly hosts, praising God and saying, 'Glory to God in the highest, and on earth, peace, good will toward men.'"
Thank you again for all that you've done for the Children's Hospital. Let us find comfort and joy in our children and with them pray for peace on Earth and good will toward men.
Thank you, and God bless you all.
