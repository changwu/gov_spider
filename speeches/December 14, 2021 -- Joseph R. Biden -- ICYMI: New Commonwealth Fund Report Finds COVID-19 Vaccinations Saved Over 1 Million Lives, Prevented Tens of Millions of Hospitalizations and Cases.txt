    Today, the Commonwealth Fund released a new study about the impact of the United States' COVID-19 vaccination program, finding that vaccines saved over 1 million lives and prevented 10 million hospitalizations and 35 million cases. A majority of the deaths and hospitalizations prevented would have taken place following the spread of the Delta variant in the summer and fall.
The Commonwealth report also notes that, "The U.S. vaccination program campaign has profoundly altered the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing nearly 1.1 million deaths. Even with only about 60 percent of Americans vaccinated to date, the nation has dodged a massive wave of COVID-19 deaths that would have started as the Delta variant took hold in August 2021. Because of Delta's rapid and nationwide spread, deaths due to COVID-19 would have far exceeded all previous peaks."
The report reflects the impact of President Biden's vaccination campaign that has resulted in 200 million Americans fully vaccinated, up from just 2 million when the President took office. It also makes clear that we have the tools to protect against severe disease and death, and that it is critical for Americans get vaccinated and boosted with the emergence of the Omicron variant.
