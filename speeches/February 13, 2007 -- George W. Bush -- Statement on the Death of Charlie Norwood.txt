    Laura and I are deeply saddened by the death of Congressman Charlie Norwood. Charlie was a good friend and a strong, spirited legislator who always stuck to his principles, remembering that his duty was to represent the best interests of the citizens of his district. Throughout his seven terms in Congress, he was a strong advocate for patients' rights, high-quality education, and protecting the homeland. As a lawmaker, he had the ability to deliver on his promises. I enjoyed working with him and valued our close friendship.
After becoming ill, Charlie demonstrated his extraordinary strength by continuing to serve our Nation with the same dedication. He was a good man and a true patriot.
Laura and I send our prayers to Charlie's wife Gloria and his children and grandchildren.
