    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Montgomery (D) MS)
The Administration supports H.R. 1040.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 1040 would increase outlays; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill for fiscal years 1994-1998 is less than $500,000.
