Memorandum for the Attorney General
The Commission on CIA Activities Within the United States has presented its final report to me. Transmitted herewith is a copy of the report.
Under Executive Order 11828, the Commission is required to furnish to the Attorney General any evidence found by it which may relate to offenses under the statutes of the United States. Vice President Rockefeller has advised me that the Commission desires that the Department of Justice examine all materials collected by the Commission to make this determination. Such materials include information relating to allegations that the CIA has been involved in plans to assassinate certain leaders of foreign countries.
In addition to the materials accumulated by the Commission, there are relevant materials on these subjects in the files of the National Security Council and certain State Department and Defense Department files of similar relevance. All of these materials are now available for your investigation through Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President.
I hereby request that you review all of these materials as soon as possible and take such action as you deem warranted as a result of your investigation.
