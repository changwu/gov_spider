For the first time in our political history, the Vermont primary on March 4 may make a difference in determining the nominees for president. The Republican race is almost concluded, but the Democratic race remains hotly contested. Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama will make history if one of them wins the nomination.
Back in 2006, few would have predicted that the top contenders for the Democratic nomination in 2008 would be a woman and an African-American. These are exciting times. With two such strong, qualified candidates, how do we choose? The difference has been framed as a choice between change and experience. That is easy political shorthand, but the facts are more interesting and complex. Both Sen. Clinton and Sen. Obama represent change. Foremost, they represent change from the domestic and foreign policies of George Bush. Both represent change if we envision their portraits hanging in the White House next to the white men who preceded them.
I support Hillary Clinton because she is the first woman to be qualified to be president. Health care, women's issues, the environment and education are areas where female politicians have had the greatest impact. Today we know they are critical issues to our well-being and even to our survival. She will put them at the top of her agenda.
