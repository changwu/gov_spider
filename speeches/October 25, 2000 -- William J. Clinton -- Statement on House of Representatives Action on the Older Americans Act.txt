    I applaud the House of Representatives for today's overwhelming bipartisan vote to reauthorize the Older Americans Act (H.R. 782). Our Nation's older Americans have been waiting for more than 5 years for Congress to approve this critical legislation. Now that the House has acted, it is imperative that the Senate pass this important legislation before it adjourns.
The Older Americans Act is the cornerstone of our Nation's commitment to senior citizens. Seniors all across the country rely on vital OAA in-home and community-based services, including home-delivered meals, nursing home ombudsmen, and employment and transportation services that are essential to preserve their dignity and independence.
I am also pleased that the House bill includes the new National Family Caregiver Support Program, proposed by this administration to help hundreds of thousands of family members who are struggling to care for their older or disabled relatives. The Senate must do its part to pass this legislation without further delay.
