    Nancy and I were saddened to learn of the death of Congressman George O'Brien last evening. We considered George a friend, a dutiful and unyielding servant of the people he represented in Congress for the past 14 years, and a man who cared very much about the direction and future of his country. His full and unselfish life for the good of his fellow man will live on as an example to us all. We shall miss him.
