    President Obama spoke by phone today with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan to discuss the international response to North Korea's nuclear test. The two leaders condemned the test and agreed that North Korea's actions constitute yet another violation of its obligations and commitments under international law, including several UN Security Council Resolutions. President Obama reaffirmed the unshakeable U.S. commitment to the security of Japan, and the two leaders agreed to work together to forge a united and strong international response to North Korea's latest reckless behavior. Separately, the President congratulated Prime Minister Abe on the recent agreement between Japan and the ROK to resolve the longstanding "comfort women" issue, and commended two of our most important allies for having the courage and vision to forge a lasting settlement to this difficult issue.
