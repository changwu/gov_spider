    I welcome the decision of the Orange Order and its local lodges to voluntarily call off and reroute the contentious parades scheduled for this weekend. In choosing not to risk confrontation, the members of the Orange Order have taken a significant step. I hope that the people of both communities redouble their efforts to reach accommodation on other contentious parades in a spirit of good will and generosity and reject the inexcusable violence that we saw in Northern Ireland today.
The Orange Order's decision, and the warm welcome that has greeted it, confirm my conviction that the people of Northern Ireland want and deserve an end to violence and confrontation. The people of Northern Ireland have the United States' unwavering support to build on this moment of hope to seek a lasting settlement to the conflict that has divided them for far too long.
