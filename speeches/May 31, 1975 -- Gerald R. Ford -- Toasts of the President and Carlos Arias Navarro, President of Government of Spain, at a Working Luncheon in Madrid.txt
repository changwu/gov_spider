    Mr. President, Mr. Minister, Your Excellencies:
For a quarter of a century, Spain and the United States have enjoyed the most cordial and the most productive ties, characterized by our common efforts to meet the danger of aggression against the Western community of nations and, supported by mutual respect for the aspirations of our respective peoples, to secure for themselves a better life.
Mindful as we have been of each other's concerns and needs, we have forged, fortunately, a harmonious and a very fine relationship.
We have met today to reaffirm our commitment to build this cooperation in a mutually beneficial manner.
The world has changed, as we well know, from when the first U.S.-Spanish friendship agreement which was signed in 1953. But the need for strong defenses has not lessened in any way whatsoever. Spain and the United States have, in the past, contributed together to the maintenance of a strong Western security. The present and future call for no less effort. The United States remains totally dedicated to this task.
It would be my observation that the cooperation being carried out in so many fields between our countries demonstrates the breadth of our interests, the depth of friendship, and the commitment of the United States and Spain to a better life for our citizens. Spain, of course, is an important part of our Atlantic conception.
Mr. President, I raise my glass and propose a toast to this spirit of friendship. May our cooperation be preserved and strengthened. May it assure peace for Spaniards and Americans alike Mr. President.
