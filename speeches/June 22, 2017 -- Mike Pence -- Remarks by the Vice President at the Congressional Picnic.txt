    THE VICE PRESIDENT: To all the members of the House of Representatives and the United States Senate, to all of the families of those who serve, to all of the friends who are gathered here, on behalf of the First Family, Karen and I are honored to welcome you to the 2017 White House Picnic in the Park. (Applause.) It's Central Park on the South Lawn.
We especially are grateful to the leadership -- the House and Senate in both parties that are so well represented here today. Would you join me in thanking Senator John Cornyn and Senator Dick Durbin for representing the Senate leadership tonight? (Applause.) We're honored you're here. And thank you to Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Kevin McCarthy, and Speaker Paul Ryan from the House of Representatives for joining us. Thank you so much. (Applause.)
As a matter of fact, could we just give a big round of applause to all the men and women who serve in the Congress of the United States? (Applause.) Tonight is about saying thank you. (Applause.)
You know our family has lots of memories at the White House picnic. The first time we came here, our two daughters were six and seven years old. Now they're standing right over here. One is 22 and one will turn 24 years old this Sunday -- Audrey and Charlotte are with us today.
The White House picnic for us is always about family. It's always about being able to leave politics outside the gate and being able to get together with the families of those who serve in both political parties. And on behalf of the First Family we thank you for continuing this wonderful bipartisan tradition tonight on this beautiful evening in our nation's capital.
So with good food, good fellowship, and quite a view, join me in welcoming to the podium our host for this evening -- First Lady Melania Trump and the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Cheers.)
