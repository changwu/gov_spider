    Ohio Governor John Kasich is challenging the Republican Party to rally behind ideas that are reasonable and achievable. Yesterday he spoke to 100 local Republicans at a town hall meeting hosted by South Carolina Senator Tim Scott in Hilton Head.
He said, "My job is to make sure the Republican Party has a program next fall that can pass the smell test. . . I think it's important we be realistic about what we can accomplish in this country."
At the Veterans Day event, Kasich talked about his ideas for making veteran healthcare services available at a wider range of clinics in addition to Veterans Affairs centers.
He also shared his vision for tailoring school curriculum to the needs of individual students.
America needs a President with a plan that's achievable, not political rhetoric that holds no weight in the real world. Winning the White House takes more than ideologyâ€”it takes a proven record and winnable goals.
