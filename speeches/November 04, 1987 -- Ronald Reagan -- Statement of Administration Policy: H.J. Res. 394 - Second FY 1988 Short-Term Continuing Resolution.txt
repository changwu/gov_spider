    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Sponsor: Whitten (D), Mississippi)
The Administration does not object to H.J. Res. 394, a simple extension of P.L. 100-120 through December 16, 1987.
The Administration opposes the Bonior amendment and if adopted, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.
The Administration stresses the importance of the budget negotiations with the Congress and looks forward to their successful conclusion. Accordingly, the Administration feels that current law should be extended without amendment. Only this type of continuing resolution, unencumbered with additional and potentially objectionable provisions, would achieve speedy Executive approval and thereby avoid unnecessary and costly disruptions of government.
The Administration also wishes to stress the importance of having the budget negotiations reach a speedy conclusion, and accordingly the President's senior advisors would recommend that he not approve any subsequent additional short-term resolutions.
