    The President today spoke with over 500 rabbis from the four major American Jewish religious denominations to mark Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, which begins at sundown on September 13. In addition to wishing the Rabbis and their congregations a happy, healthy new year, the President discussed and answered participants' questions on a range of topics, including the nuclear deal among the P5+1, the EU, and Iran that will verifiably prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Acknowledging the vigorous debate that has occurred within the American Jewish community and in Israel, the President explained that the deal is consistent with his unwavering commitment to Israel's security, and he expressed his willingness to discuss additional ways to enhance Israel's security and further strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship as the deal is implemented.
