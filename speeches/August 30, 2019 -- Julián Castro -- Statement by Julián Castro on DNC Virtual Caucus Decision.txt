    CHARLESTON, SC (August 30, 2019) – On Friday, August 30, presidential candidate and former Obama Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and San Antonio Mayor, Julián Castro, issued the following statement after reports indicate that the Democratic National Committee will reject plans for a virtual caucus in Iowa.
The Democratic National Committee's decision to disenfranchise tens of thousands of voters, and decrease turnout by up to a third, in the first-in-the-nation caucus state is an affront to the principles of our democracy.
For years, our party has fought for increased access to the ballot, most recently evidenced by the legal struggles in Georgia, North Carolina, and my home state of Texas. This decision goes against everything our Party says we stand for.
As I've campaigned in every corner of Iowa, I've heard from teachers, home care workers, nurses, single parents, shift workers, and senior citizens who tell me the same thing: one night of caucusing is not enough.
Protecting the integrity of our elections is a critical concern. But with only 157 days until the Iowa caucus, the DNC's feet-dragging has done a serious disservice to Democratic voters and the principle of a fair, accurate, and unburdensome primary or caucus.
I strongly urge the DNC to embrace the values of our Party by allowing absentee voting -- either through a secure virtual caucus, mail-in ballot, or early voting absentee process -- in order to ensure that all Iowans have an opportunity to participate in their caucus.
