History is made by ordinary people doing extraordinary things
Rosa Parks was an ordinary woman who stood up against injustice. When she refused to give up her seat on the bus, she forever changed the course of history.
Decades later, Parks sat with Hillary Clinton at the State of the Union.



The country in which Rosa had refused to give up her seat was very different from the one whose leaders applauded her that night.

60 years after Parks was arrested, we are still fighting for equality.



  " There are still injustices perpetrated every day across our country, sometimes in spite of the law, sometimes, unfortunately, in keeping with it. There are still too many Americans, especially too many African Americans, whose experience of the justice system is not what it should be. There are still too many ways in which our laws and our policies fall short of our ideals."

Rosa Parks' fight is not over...


  " So even as we celebrate all that our country has achieved in the past 60 years, we must, in keeping with the legacy of those who have gone before, look to the future and the work that is left to do."

... and we must all commit to continuing that fight.
