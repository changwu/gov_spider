    The United States welcomes China's submission of its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) earlier today. The INDC submission follows from the target that China announced in the November 2014 Joint Announcement by President Obama and President Xi and helps to provide continued momentum toward reaching a successful climate agreement in Paris. Countries accounting for nearly 70 percent of current global energy carbon-dioxide emissions have already announced and are taking action on post-2020 climate policies. The United States encourages all major economies to submit their INDCs as soon as possible to lay the groundwork for a successful outcome at the twenty-first session of the Conference of Parties in Paris at the end of this year.
