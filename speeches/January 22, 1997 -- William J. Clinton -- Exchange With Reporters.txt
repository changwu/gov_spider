    16th Street Explosion
Q. [Inaudible]—the explosion near the abortion clinic this morning—any thoughts on that?
The President. Let me say that we do not yet have all the facts involving the incidents this morning. But Federal officials are working with the local law enforcement officials to get to the bottom of this. I want to emphasize again, as I had to do just a few days ago, that acts of violence against people who are trying to exercise their constitutional rights are acts of terror. They are illegal. They are wrong. And we will do our very best to investigate them, to catch who is doing it, and to make sure they're punished. But as to the incidents this morning, we are still investigating them. The facts are unfolding. Whatever happened, there is never an excuse for an act of violence against someone exercising a constitutional right.
Q. [Inaudible]—at the Mayflower, Mr. President?
The President. We're on top of the situation, I believe. We're doing our very best. And obviously I'm concerned about the safety of anybody involved that might be subject to that sort of thing. But the investigators are there, and we're working hard on it.
