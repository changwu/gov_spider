    Columbia, SC - Fred Thompson released the following statement today regarding testimony by Ambassador Ryan Crocker and General David Petraeus before Congress:
"America owes a tremendous debt of gratitude to Ambassador Ryan Crocker, General David Petraeus, all of the men and women of our armed forces who are serving and have served in Iraq as well as their families here at home.
"Gen. Petraeus' report strengthens my conviction that we can achieve our objectives in Iraq and that we must not withdraw precipitously. He and Ambassador Crocker gave a candid assessment, and I believe Gen. Petraeus when he says that the security situation is improving and momentum is now on our side.
"The opportunity for political reconciliation is occurring. It is happening at the local level -- what some call 'bottom up' reconciliation. We must nurture that progress, not dismiss it because the Congress couldn't foresee such a benchmark of success and write it into law."
