    Listen, thank you all very, very much. Barbara and I are thrilled to be here, delighted to be with your great Governor, John Engler, and Michelle. And let me just tell you what a great day it is to be in Michigan. Even the Clinton people are nice around this State. It's wonderful. [Laughter]
We've made a great dramatic change for world peace. To listen to Governor Clinton talk about it, foreign affairs and national security is nothing. I am proud to have served my country in wartime, and I'm proud to have served it in peace. And I am proud that because of our leadership, we have far less fear of nuclear weapons today. And now we need your help to renew America. We cannot let a tax-and-spend Governor come in and change things in that direction. Let's change them by holding the line on taxes, cutting back on this spending, and giving power to the people of Michigan. That's what we've got to do.
Thank you for a great day. We don't want this train to run late, but we do want to say hello and say thank you very much for this warm welcome.
Don't listen to Governor Clinton when he tries to tear down this country and say we're somewhere below Germany and above Sri Lanka. Never forget we are the United States of America, the greatest country on the face of the Earth. We can overcome every problem we've got, but don't do it by putting in the Arkansas Governor who wants to raise your taxes and raise spending. Give me 4 more years. Leave Barbara as the best First Lady in the entire world. And let's win this election. Let us win this election.
Thank you very, very much. All aboard! All aboard! All aboard!
