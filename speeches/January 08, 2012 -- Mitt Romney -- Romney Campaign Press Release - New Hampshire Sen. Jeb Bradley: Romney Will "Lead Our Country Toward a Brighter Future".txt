    New Hampshire Senate Majority Leader Jeb Bradley made the following statement on this morning's debate:
"Mitt Romney showed today why so many New Hampshire voters support him: he has a demonstrated leadership ability, conservative record of success, and the vision to get our country back on track once again. Granite Staters will come out in support of Mitt Romney on Tuesday because he represents a clear break from President Obama and is the one candidate who can fix our country's many problems. With the help of New Hampshire voters on Tuesday and in November, Mitt Romney can defeat President Obama, and lead our country toward a brighter future."
