    Ohio Gov. John Kasich held his 100th New Hampshire town hall meeting in Bedford today, reaching a milestone with the most town halls held in New Hampsire by any candidate in the current campaign. In addition to his 100 town halls, John Kasich has held or participated in dozens of forums, house parties, meet and greets, and speeches in the state.
John Kasich declared his candidacy for president in Columbus, Ohio, on July 21, 2015. That same day, the governor flew to New Hampshire and held his first New Hampshire town hall at Rivier University in Nashua. Over the following two days, Kasich held additional town hall meetings in Portsmouth, Center Harbor, Wolfeboro and North Conway.
"One hundred town halls in little more than six months is an impressive record and I'm grateful to all the New Hampshire voters who have come out to hear what I have to say," said Kasich. "Town halls are an important tradition in New Hampshire, where voters expect to meet candidates face-to-face and discuss the issues most important to them. From the enthusiastic response I've seen throughout the state, it's clear my campaign has been meeting that expectation."
Since entering the campaign last July and energetically campaiging across the Granite State, John Kasich has received editorial endorsements from eight New Hampshire newspapers as well as the New York Times and Boston Globe. Ten polls in the past month have placed him in 2nd place in New Hampshire.
