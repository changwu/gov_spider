    I can hear you. We had a good look at the crowd there. And I want to salute Lonnie and Heidi English and I wish everybody there in the support of the Valley Children's Hospital all the best.
And I wish each of you could see this magnificent Air Force One piloted by Colonel Danny Barr. It's a marvelous airplane, and I think it represents our country very well as we go not just here but overseas as well.
I wish you well. This air show that will benefit the Valley Children's Hospital is just a wonderful thing. I salute you. I salute you all at TV 30 for their civic -- I don't know how to say it, but the civic responsibility, you might say, of supporting this wonderful charity. But also you're bringing people a lot of happiness there.
So, good luck to each and every one of you. Again, to Lonnie and to Heidi who thought of this in the first place, well done. Well done. My only regret is I don't get down to see some of those shiny things we flew over.
