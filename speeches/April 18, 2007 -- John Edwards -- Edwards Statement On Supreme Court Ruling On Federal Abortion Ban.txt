    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Senator John Edwards released the following statement about today's 5-4 Supreme Court ruling upholding the federal abortion ban.
"I could not disagree more strongly with today's Supreme Court decision. The ban upheld by the Court is an ill-considered and sweeping prohibition that does not even take account for serious threats to the health of individual women. This hard right turn is a stark reminder of why Democrats cannot afford to lose the 2008 election. Too much is at stake - starting with, as the Court made all too clear today, a woman's right to choose."
