    [Dated June 12, 1975. Released June 13, 1975]
Memorandum for: Vice President of the United States, Secretary of Labor, Director, Office of Management and Budget, Chairman, U.S. Civil Service Commission, Director, Council on Wage and Price Stability, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Reserve Affairs Subject: President's Panel on Federal Compensation
I am today establishing a new President's Panel on Federal Compensation and designating you to serve as its members. You will direct an immediate comprehensive review of the major Federal employee compensation systems and present to me by November 1, 1975, policy recommendations on how the Federal Government can best determine the appropriate levels of total compensation for its employees under the principle of comparability with non-Federal employers. The primary objective of the review is to ascertain any needed changes in Federal compensation policies and practices, keeping in mind our goal of a system that is fair and equitable both to the employees and to the public.
Vice 'President Rockefeller will serve as the Chairman of this Panel, and Robert E. Hampton, Chairman of the Civil Service Commission, will be its Vice Chairman.
I am also designating the Executive Director of the Domestic Council, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, the Assistant to the President for Economic Affairs, and the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Federal Pay, to act as advisors to the Panel.
Other senior officials of Government will be represented when matters of particular interest to them are being discussed (e.g., the Secretary of State when Foreign Service salaries are the topic, the Administrator of Veterans Affairs when pay rates and procedures concerning the Department of Medicine and Surgery are under discussion).
