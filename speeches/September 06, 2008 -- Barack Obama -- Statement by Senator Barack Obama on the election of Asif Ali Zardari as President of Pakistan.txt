    Chicago, IL -- "I congratulate Asif Ali Zardari on his election as President of Pakistan. I am glad to hear of his pledge to return this office to its traditional stature, and return to Parliament the powers unconstitutionally appropriated to the presidency. I am also glad to hear of the restoration of several deposed judges, an important step towards the restoration of a truly independent judiciary. I wish Mr. Zardari well, and look forward to working with him to confront the extremists who threaten Pakistan and the United States."
