    Of all the basic rights that contribute to human development, one of the most important is the first amendment freedom of the press. A free press independent of government control and expressing a variety of viewpoints is crucial to both democracy and individual liberty.
Since last May, my administration has been trying to explore the proper constitutional way for us and the Congress together to correct the threat of encroachment on freedom of the press that was raised in the Stanford Daily case.
As a result of this work, I will soon propose legislation that would restrict police intrusion into news media offices, and would give members of the press notice and an opportunity to challenge requests for the products of their reporting work.
I think this is a major step forward in protecting the integrity of the freedom of the press.
