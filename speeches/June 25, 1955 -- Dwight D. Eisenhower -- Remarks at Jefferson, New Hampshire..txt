    NOT LONG AGO General Summerfield learned that I was leaving Washington and was going to come to New England, and he told me about this gathering of Postmasters, and among other things asked me to bring his greetings to you and sort of served notice that if I didn't stop here and visit with you a minute, I had better not come back.
Entirely aside, my friends here, from my pleasure in meeting with each of you this morning, I am looking out a little bit for my own skin and standing all right with my Postmaster when I get back there.
I think this gives me just an appropriate chance to say something about the appreciation I have of the services of the good public servant, the individual who takes a job in the government and does it with his full heart and soul so that the kind of service that we are supposed to render our people is actually received by them.
General Summerfield tells me that the Postmasters of the United States, all through the United States, are doing just that kind of job. He is very proud of them, and nothing could give me greater pleasure than to come here and--through you to the rest of them--say thanks a lot, because that is the kind of thing that the Federal government ought to be giving to our people everywhere.
I see up at the end there are some Boy Scouts that I hope to get a chance to stop and say Hello, because of my admiration and affection; and at the other end I see a choir, so I think I am promised a song; and just behind me are practically all the political brass of New Hampshire and part of Washington. So that just sort of brings the whole crowd together, and if I can hear the song and see the boys, the last word I will say is: a very hearty good morning, it is very wonderful to be with you.
