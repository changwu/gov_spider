    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with section 360D of the Public Health Service Act (21 U.S.C. 360qq), I am submitting the report of the Department of Health and Human Services regarding the administration of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968 during calendar year 1990.
The report recommends the repeal of section 360D of the Public Health Service Act that requires the completion of this annual report. All the information found in this report is available to the Congress on a more immediate basis through Center technical reports, the Radiological Health Bulletin, and other publicly available sources. This annual report serves little useful purpose and diverts Agency resources from more productive activities.
