    Former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty today made the following statement on Newt Gingrich's comments about Mitt Romney's character:
"I thought I had heard it all from Newt Gingrich, but for him to question the character of Mitt Romney is over the line. I have spent a lot of time with Mitt Romney, and I can tell you with zero hesitation that he is a man of flawless character. Mitt ran the state of Massachusetts and the Salt Lake City Olympic games with integrity beyond reproach. As President, he will govern with the same leadership guided by the morals and values that Americans hold dear. Newt Gingrich's attacks on his character are way out of bounds."
