    The President. I just want to deviate from my normal position on not taking questions or making statements at these Cabinet meetings. But I do want to take what is an unusual opportunity to let you know that our colleague and our very able Attorney General, Dick Thornburgh, has informed me that he expects to become a candidate for the U.S. Senate. And at my request, however, I am pleased -- we talked about this yesterday and again just now -- I am pleased that he has agreed to remain in office through at least the end of July.
And we've also discussed the key legislative issues that we have before Congress that are so important to the administration, and certainly to the Attorney General and to the Department of Justice. And he's agreed to continue to help to push for our civil rights bill, for a crime bill that is long overdue. And one of the key things we've got left to do is the implementation of that landmark Americans with Disabilities Act, drawing up the regulations for that. It's critical.
And I want to just take this opportunity before the Cabinet to thank him, my friend and our able Attorney General, for his outstanding record as Attorney General and for his sound advice -- legal adviser to two Presidents. And we are going to miss his wisdom and his support.
And Dick, I just can't tell you what a fantastic job, in my view, you have done. And so, I'm delighted you're willing to accommodate my request that you stay on for the end of this timeframe I mentioned, and we just wish you the very best in whatever lies ahead.
Q. Who is his replacement? [Laughter]
The Attorney General. I'm sorry to hear you're so sad I'm going. [Laughter]
