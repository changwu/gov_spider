    The United States Senate needs to act to protect the sacred constitutional right to vote, which is under unrelenting assault by proponents of "the big lie" and Republican Governors, secretaries of state, attorneys general, and State legislatures across the Nation. It is urgent. Democracy—the very soul of America—is at stake.
Today Senate Democrats would like to start debate on the Freedom To Vote Act. Senate Democrats have worked hard to ensure this bill includes traditionally bipartisan provisions. But Senate Republicans are likely to block even debate on the bill, as they have before on previous voting rights bills. It's unconscionable.
The right to vote—to vote freely, to vote fairly, and to have your vote counted—is fundamental. It should be simple and straightforward. Let there be a debate and let there be a vote.
