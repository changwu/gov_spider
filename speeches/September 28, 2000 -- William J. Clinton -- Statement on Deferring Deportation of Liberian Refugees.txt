    Today I directed the Attorney General and the Immigration and Naturalization Service to defer for one year from September 29 the deportation of certain Liberians who are present in the United States on that date. This action is aimed at promoting stability in Liberia and West Africa. In particular, I am concerned that a decision by our Government to deport Liberians who have enjoyed the protection of our country for many years could cause the involuntary repatriation of many thousands of Liberian refugees from other nations in West Africa. This would severely burden Liberia and cause instability in Liberia and in the region. I understand that Congress is actively considering a legislative fix for this problem, and I would welcome any solution that would provide relief for Liberians with longstanding ties to the United States.
