    I applaud the Supreme Court's decision today to make sure that drug traffickers who carry firearms, whether on their person or in their car, are subject to the stiffest penalties possible. Crime rates have fallen in America for 6 years in a row, but guns and drugs remain serious problems among our youth and in many of our neighborhoods. Today's decision is one more victory for law enforcement and law-abiding citizens in the fight against crime and drugs.
