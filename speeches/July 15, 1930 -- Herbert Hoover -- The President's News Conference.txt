    THE PRESIDENT. I have got very few questions that I can adequately reply to.
SECRETARY OF LABOR
I have one in connection with the Secretaryship of Labor. Secretary Davis is going to continue in office for the present, so that speculation on that is premature.
MASSACHUSETTS TERCENTENARY COMMISSION
I have another question relating to the Commission for Celebration of the Tercentenary of the Founding of the Colony of Massachusetts. I have today requested Governor Alvan T. Fuller, ex-Governor Channing Cox, Miss Mary Emma Woolley, of Mt. Holyoke, James Phelan, of Boston, and John Richardson of Boston, to become the public members of the Commission.
And that is all I have got.
