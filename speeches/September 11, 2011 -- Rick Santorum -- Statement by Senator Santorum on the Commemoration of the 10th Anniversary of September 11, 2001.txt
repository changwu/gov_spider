    Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following remarks in commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks.
Senator Santorum said, "Today marks the 10th anniversary of the most despicable and cowardly acts of violence ever carried out against our nation. But in our darkest hour, the heroism of the American spirit served as a beacon of strength, light, hope and healing for the entire world. As a nation we came together - rejecting what divides us and instead we were clinging to what makes us one nation under God. Today, let's reflect on that unifying American spirit - remembering and praying for those innocent people who lost their lives 10 years ago. May God bless the United States and her people as we continue to heal from the decade old wounds - and may this day serve as a sobering reminder that we must remain united and vigilant against the radical threat that still looms, seeking to destroy us not for what we have done but for who we are as a people."
