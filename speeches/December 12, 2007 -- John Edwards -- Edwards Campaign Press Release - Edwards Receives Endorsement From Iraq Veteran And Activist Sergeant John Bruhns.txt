    Bruhns says Edwards has the best plans to restore hope to the middle class and end the war in Iraq
Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Today, Senator John Edwards received the endorsement of Sergeant John Bruhns, an Iraq veteran and former legislative representative for Americans Against Escalation in Iraq. Bruhns enlisted in the Army after 9/11 and served in Iraq for a year in the battalion hat took part in the first day of the invasion.
"As someone who served in the U.S. military honorably for eight years I am saddened by what has come of America," Bruhns said. "It is absolutely heartbreaking to go overseas to fight a war just to come home to see your fellow Americans unemployed, in debt, down on their luck, and living hand-to-mouth. The American people are ready for a complete change from what we have lived through with the disgraceful and tragic presidency of George W. Bush. We need a president that will respect and fight for the rights of all Americans.
"I strongly believe that John Edwards is the best candidate running for the presidency of the United States," Bruhns continued. "I believe that he will be strong at home and abroad. I believe that he has the best plan to end poverty, protect American jobs, and restore hope to the middle class. Most importantly, I believe wholeheartedly that he will end the war in Iraq and that he would never send our brave men and women in uniform into harms way unless it is absolutely necessary."
"I am honored to receive Sergeant Bruhns' endorsement," said Senator Edwards. "His commitment to serving our country should serve as an example to all of us. I look forward to working with him to expand economic opportunity at home and to restore America's moral authority in the world. Together, we can create the better America we believe in."
