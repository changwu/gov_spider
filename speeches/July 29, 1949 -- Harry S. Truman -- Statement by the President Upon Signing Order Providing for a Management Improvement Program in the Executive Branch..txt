    SINCE the Reorganization Act of 1949 was passed, I have submitted to the Congress a number of plans to improve the organization and management of the executive branch. Other steps to further the recommendations of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch are under study. In cooperation with the Congress I intend to move ahead as rapidly as is consistent with well-considered action.
While improvements in the organization and administrative arrangements of the executive branch are essential to efficient conduct of Federal programs, they do not in themselves result in better operations. Responsible officials must follow through to see that potential improvements in Government operations are actually realized.
In an Executive order which I have just signed, I am taking steps to assure that there shall be a continuous and systematic effort throughout the executive branch to evaluate and improve the effectiveness and economy of Government operations.
Department and agency heads will continue to have primary responsibility for such action. It is my intention that the responsible executives shall schedule comprehensive reviews of activities under their jurisdiction in order to improve internal agency organization, identify and eliminate overlapping or unnecessary activities, simplify or modernize procedures, and assure that management shall be effective in its day-today direction and supervision of operations. In scheduling such appraisals it is my intention that priority shall be given to those areas of operation in which the greatest benefits in economy or improved service to the public are expected.
The Bureau of the Budget will review accomplishments and keep me informed of progress and matters requiring action by me.
The Advisory Committee on Management Improvement will assist me in planning an effective management improvement program on a government-wide basis and in reviewing progress and accomplishments under it.
