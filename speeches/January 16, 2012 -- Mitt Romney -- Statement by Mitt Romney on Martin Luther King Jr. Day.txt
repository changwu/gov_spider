    Mitt Romney today made the following statement celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. Day:
"Martin Luther King Jr. Day is an occasion to reflect on the legacy of an outstanding American. Dr. King not only believed in the fundamental truth that we are all made in God's image, he fought for that truth in a campaign that brought our country closer to fulfilling its historic promise of liberty and justice for all. The United States has made enormous strides toward racial equality in the decades since Dr. King's death, but we must never rest until all people are judged, in his immortal words, not 'by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character."
