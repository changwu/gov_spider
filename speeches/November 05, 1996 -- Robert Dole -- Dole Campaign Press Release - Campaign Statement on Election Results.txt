    "Bob Dole has completed his last political mission with courage and honor.
Even in defeat, he has much to claim in the way of success. Bob Dole led his party in this election representing trust and conservative principles. With Republicans headed toward retaining the leadership of Congress, this country on the broadest front endorsed what Bob Dole stands for."
--Nelson Warfield
