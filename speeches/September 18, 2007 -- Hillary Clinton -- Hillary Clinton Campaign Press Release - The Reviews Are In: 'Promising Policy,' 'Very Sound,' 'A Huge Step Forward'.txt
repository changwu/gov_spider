    WASHINGTON POST'S E.J. DIONNE - HILLARY PLAN SHOWS SHE 'HAS THE CHARACTER TO BE PRESIDENT': "There's another message: She knows a lot more than she used to about voters and how to persuade them -- and about herself. Leaders who can laugh at their own failures are usually more trustworthy than those who can't... It could turn out that Clinton's strongest argument is that someone who is aware of her own shortcomings, laughs about them and works at them has the character to be president." [Washington Post, 9/18/07 ]
WASHINGTON POST ED BOARD - HILLARY'S PLAN IS 'PROMISING POLICY': "But Ms. Clinton, in setting out her route to universal coverage, adds some promising policy twists. The most interesting would limit the tax deductibility of employer-sponsored health plans for the wealthiest Americans, a sensible step toward fixing one of the most expensive and counterproductive parts of the tax code." [Washington Post, 9/18/07]
NEW YORK TIMES' DAVID BROOKS - 'HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH CARE PLAN IS A HUGE STEP FORWARD...BETTER THAN THE GOP CANDIDATES' PLANS': " Hillary Clinton's health care plan is a huge step forward from 1993. It's better than the GOP candidates' plans [New York Times, 9/18/07 ]
HARVARD PROFESSOR ROBERT BLENDON - HILLARY'S PLAN OFFERS 'LOTS OF CHOICES,' COULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO 'REPUBLICAN MODERATES': "In her new plan, '˜she's offering lots of choices,' Blendon said. '˜I think it's much less threatening, and it has provisions that I think a number of moderate Republicans could live with.' [Concord Monitor, 9/18/07 ]
NEW REPUBLIC'S JONATHAN COHN, AUTHOR OF 'SICK' - 'EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CLINTON PLAN...[IS] A REMINDER THAT THIS IS HER STRENGTH': "Would she be vague, figuring she had the least to prove on the matter and that details could only come back to haunt her? Would she settle on something less than universal coverage, figuring the political support for it was too weak? Would she kowtow to the insurance and pharmaceutical lobbies, which had started donating to her campaigns? The answer seems to be no, no, and no...Everything about the Clinton plan--from its thorough details to its well-orchestrated roll-out to its deft efforts at blunting interest-group opposition--are a reminder that this is her strength. And not a minor one to consider." [New Republic, 9/17/07 ]
CEO OF KODAK PRAISES HILLARY'S PLAN - SHE RECOGNIZES 'AMERICA'S HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN GOVERNMENT, BUSINESS AND INDIVIDUALS': "Antonio Perez, the chairman and CEO of Kodak who has contributed to Clinton's campaign this year, praised her plan in Monday's release: '˜Senator Clinton's healthcare reform plan recognizes that managing and financing America's healthcare system is a shared responsibility between government, business and individuals.'" [The Hill, 9/18/07 ]
EZRA KLEIN - HILLARY'S POLICY IS 'VERY, VERY SOUND': "So the policy is very, very sound, and includes other sundry goodies like a Best Practices Institute that will vastly accelerate the amount of research done and distributed on the cost-effectiveness of treatments, better chronic care incentives, and so forth." [Ezra Klein blog, 9/17/07 ]
COMMONWEALTH FUND - 'IT'S A STRAIGHTFORWARD PROPOSAL...TRYING TO STRENGTHEN WHAT WORKS RELATIVELY WELL AND TRYING TO FILL IN THE GAPS': "It's a straightforward proposal in that it builds on the current system," said Sara Collins, assistant vice president of the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that focuses on health care. Clinton is "really looking at where the gaps are in the system and trying to strengthen what works relatively well and trying to fill in the gaps." [Concord Monitor, 9/18/07 ]
CNBC'S JOHN HARWOOD - HILLARY'S PLAN 'HAS HIT THE SWEET SPOT':"[T]his is precisely the issue on which her experience may be most valuable. In other words, she's drawing from both the left and right. Sometimes that's a sign that a politician has hit the sweet spot." [CNBC.com, 9/17/07 ]
THE ATLANTIC'S MATTHEW YGLESIAS - HILLARY'S PLAN IS 'AMBITIOUS...UNDERCUTS SOME OF THE MAIN ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE (INCLUDING BY ME) AGAINST HER':"It certainly has the look and feel of a decently ambitious proposal...in a way that really undercuts some of the main arguments that have been made (including by me) against her" [The Atlantic, 9/17/07 ]
WASHINGTON MONTHLY'S KEVIN DRUM - '˜HILLARY'S PLAN STRIKES ME AS... THE POLITICALLY SAVVIEST AND MOST PRACTICAL OF THE LOT': "Hillary's strikes me as not just substantively as good as any of them (and better in some ways), but also the politically savviest and most practical of the lot. Given her experience in 1994 (she knows what won't work) combined with the legislative canniness she seems to have developed in the Senate (she know what will work), that's not too surprising." [Washington Monthly's Political Animal, 9/17/07 ]
