    MANCHESTER, NH â€” Former Colorado U.S. Senator Gary Hart today endorsed Michael Bennet for President of the United States. The pair made the announcement at the New Hampshire Democratic Party State Convention, where Hart will introduce Bennet later today. Hart won an insurgent victory in the Granite State during the 1984 Democratic presidential primary.
"A number of years ago, the voters of New Hampshire provided an opportunity for a young Colorado senator to build a strong national candidacy. They have the chance now to do it again," said Hart. "Michael Bennet has the intelligence, experience, and judgment to put our nation back on track at home and abroad."
In 1984, Hart won a surprise victory in New Hampshire on the basis of bold new ideas to change the country. This year, Bennet is the candidate with ambitious plans to move America forward with a new generation of leadership, and his campaign continues to gain momentum in New Hampshire and nationwide.
"Gary Hart shocked the world when he won the New Hampshire primary by campaigning on new and better ideas to change the country. It's in that spirit that I'm running for president," said Bennet. "Our home state of Colorado is lucky to call Senator Hart one of our own, and I'm honored to have his endorsement and to carry on the baton of generational change that he represents."
