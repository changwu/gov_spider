    Governor Nikki Haley made the following statement on tonight's debate:
"Tonight, Mitt Romney once again displayed his vision, leadership, and grace under fire. He showed why he is without question the right man to end the chaos in Washington, D.C. and put America back to work. Neither our state nor our nation can afford four more years of President Obama, and it is critical that we nominate someone with Mitt Romney's history of results. We need a president who has a record of not just talk, but of actually getting things done, and Governor Romney is that man."
