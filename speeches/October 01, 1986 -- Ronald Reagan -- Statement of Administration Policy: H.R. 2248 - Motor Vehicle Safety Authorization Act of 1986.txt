    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Wirth (D) Colorado and 12 others)
The Administration urges that H.R. 2248 not be considered under suspension of the rules, but under a rule permitting adoption of amendments. The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 2248 unless it is amended to:
— Delete Section 7, which would establish unnecessary regulatory barriers to the entry of foreign made automobiles.
— Delete the unconstitutional delegation of authority to the Comptroller General, in Section 6 as reported by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to alter the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate a regulation.
— Remove the exemption, in Section 6, from compliance with Federal safety standards for the Secretariat of certain public international organizations. Such a statutory exemption would be inconsistent with a proposed regulation, published by the U.S. Customs Service, to eliminate the existing regulatory exemption for employees of such organizations.
