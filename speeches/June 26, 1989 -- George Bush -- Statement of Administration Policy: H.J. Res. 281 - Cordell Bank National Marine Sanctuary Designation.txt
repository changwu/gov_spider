    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Bosco (D) California and 2 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.J. Res. 281 because it would provide congressional approval for the designation of Cordell Bank as a National Marine Sanctuary. The ban on oil and gas activity in the Sanctuary, as proposed by the joint resolution, can be accomplished administratively, however, and a rulemaking proposing such a ban is underway.
With respect to section 3 of H.J. Res. 281, the Administration will seek its deletion in the Senate. Section 3 would prohibit oil and gas exploration and drilling for Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases off of North Carolina until an environmental impact statement (EIS) for exploration is completed. This prohibition is contrary to the OCS Lands Act, which .requires, without exception, decisions on exploration plans within 30 days of receipt. By requiring another EIS for the exploration stage,
H.J. Res. 281 goes beyond the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the OCS lands Act which already require an EIS before an OCS lease sale. The Department of the Interior also conducts a second EIS before actual development in a new area. An EIS was prepared prior to offering the North Carolina leases in question, and Interior will conduct an additional EIS should development be proposed.
