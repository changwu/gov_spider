    This week, because of President Trump's refusal to take strong, swift action to combat the coronavirus pandemic, the 200,000th American and the 8,000th Pennsylvanian died of COVID-19. To make matters worse, President Trump is actively trying to strip away health care for Pennsylvanians when they need it most and putting at risk protections for the 5 million Pennsylvanians with preexisting conditions, including Pennsylvanians experiencing long-term side effects from COVID-19. This crisis didn't have to be this bad. Were it not for President Trump's failed leadership, thousands of Pennsylvania families would not have suffered such horrific loss and countless others would not be faced with economic hardship, including the nearly 20,000 people out of work in Dauphin County today.
Families in Harrisburg and across Pennsylvania deserve a president that will put their health and economic wellbeing above his own political gain. As President, I will take action to combat COVID-19 and rebuild our economy so Harrisburg workers and families have access to good jobs with good benefits and the option to join a union. And I'll make sure Pennsylvanians are cut into the deal of our economic recovery, not left to fend for themselves.
