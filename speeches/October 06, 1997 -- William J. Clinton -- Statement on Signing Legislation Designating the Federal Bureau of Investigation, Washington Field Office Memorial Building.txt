    Today I am pleased to have signed into law H.R. 2443, a bill that would designate the new Washington, D.C., field office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as the "Federal Bureau of Investigation, Washington Field Office Memorial Building." The new building is so named in honor of the five FBI agents who have been killed in the line of duty while assigned to the FBI's Washington field office: William H. Christian, Jr., Martha Dixon Martinez, Michael J. Miller, Anthony Palmisano, and Edwin R. Woodriffe.
Naming the FBI's new field office in honor of these brave and courageous FBI employees is a reminder to us all of the difficult and dangerous job that FBI agents do—day in and day out.
In establishing this permanent memorial, we do well to remember—and be grateful for— the lives of all Federal, State, and local law enforcement personnel who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the performance of their duties.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
