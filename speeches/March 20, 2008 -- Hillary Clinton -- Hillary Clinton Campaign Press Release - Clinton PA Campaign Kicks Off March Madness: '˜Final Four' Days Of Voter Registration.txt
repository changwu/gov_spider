    Hillary Supporters, "Ugly Betty" Actress America Ferrera, "Rock the Vote" Leader Jehmu Greene to participate in registration drives, statewide canvasses, and phone banks to encourage voter registration before March 24 deadline
Philadelphia, PA â€“ The Clinton campaign today announced March Madness: The "Final Four" Days of Voter Registration, an effort to encourage Pennsylvanians to register to vote in the Democratic primary. In the countdown to the state's March 24th registration deadline, Pennsylvanians for Hillary will hold voter registration drives and rallies with key surrogates, statewide canvass kick-offs, volunteer visibilities, and phone banks on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Monday. Due to the Easter holiday, campaign activity will be limited and offices will be closed on Sunday, March 23.
"Pennsylvania voters want a candidate who is ready to lead on Day One and get this country back on track," offered Pennsylvanians for Hillary State Director Mary Isenhour. "Hillary Clinton is the leader with the experience and the record of accomplishment to make sure Pennsylvania's voices are heard again."
During March Madness: The "Final Four" Days of Voter Registration, Pennsylvanians for Hillary will knock on thousands of doors, hold dozens of events, and reach thousands of people throughout the state. This final drive to register voters will reach cities across the Keystone State, from Philadelphia to State College to Scranton to Pittsburgh to Erie, and cities in between.
On Saturday, "Ugly Betty" actress America Ferrera and the first African American "Rock the Vote" President Jehmu Greene will participate in voter registration and youth outreach events. Details of their events are forthcoming.
