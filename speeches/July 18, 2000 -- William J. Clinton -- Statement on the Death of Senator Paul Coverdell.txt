    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Senator Paul Coverdell.
Paul Coverdell spent a lifetime serving the people of Georgia and our country. He was a tireless advocate who worked to ensure that children have access to quality education. And he was a leader in America's war against drugs. As Director of the Peace Corps, he proudly carried America's spirit of volunteerism around the world.
I join all Americans in honoring Paul Coverdell for his years of service as a soldier, a public servant, and a statesman. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Nancy, his family, and his many friends.
