    IT GIVES me great pleasure to greet the Ministerial Council of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development as it commemorates the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Marshall Plan. There could be no finer tribute to the continuity of European and American policy than the celebration of this event in the home of this Ministerial Council.
The Marshall Plan was a milestone in a policy which has been remarkably steadfast in its two-fold purposes of building a healthy European economy and founding our American relationship with Europe on a basis of partnership in political, economic and security fields. At the time, the United States gave generously of its resources, recognizing that its strength imposed special responsibilities.
Now, on this anniversary, we face a new world and new tasks. With restored strength in Europe and Japan comes the need to redefine those early post-war responsibilities. Together we must erect a new international monetary system and make renewed progress toward a free and fair system of trade. We must deal too with the problems of our environment and with the need to assure that continued economic growth will lead to actual improvements in the quality of life. And we must extend the spirit of international cooperation-the spirit of the Marshall Plan---by assisting the developing nations through an adequately funded aid effort and responsive trade policies.
The tasks ahead will not be easy, but surely if we could rebuild from the ashes of war, we can succeed now in rebuilding a new era of growth and prosperity in the service of peace.
