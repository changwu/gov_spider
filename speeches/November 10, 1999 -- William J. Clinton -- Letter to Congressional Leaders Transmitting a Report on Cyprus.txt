    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question covering the period August 1, 1999, to September 30, 1999. The previous submission covered events during June and July 1999.
In an official working visit to the United States, Turkish Prime Minister Ecevit and I had a productive meeting on September 28. We exchanged views on a number of topics, including Cyprus. I emphasized that reaching a just and lasting solution to the Cyprus dispute remains one of my highest priorities. The Prime Minister and I agreed that there cannot be a solution to the Cyprus problem that would return the situation to what it was before 1974: all Cypriots must live in security. Prime Minister Ecevit supported my idea that my Special Emissary for Cyprus, Alfred H. Moses, travel to the region to explore ways to move forward on the Cyprus issue, in particular by starting comprehensive talks with no pre-condition under U.N. auspices, as called for by the G-8.
The international community mourned the death of Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Kranidiotis. His passing is a true loss for Greece and Cyprus.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
