 In town pool report #3 
The president emerged from the White House at 10:16 and took just under eight minutes of questions. He started talking about signing a disaster declaration for Iowa. Here are the highlights:
"We'll be making a pretty big journey today stopping at a couple of wonderful states...I just approved an emergency declaration for Iowa who had an incredible wind storm like probably they've never seen before. Really did a lot of damage..."
Today's trip:
"We are heading now to a combination of different places. We may do a surprise visit...a surprise visit to Iowa. If we can get it in we will do that."
Have you pressured the FDA to approve the oleander treatment for Covid? "I haven't. It is something that people are talking about very strongly. We'll look at it. We're looking at a lot of things... We are very close to a vaccine..."
Is an Iowa stop planned for today?
"It is possible we are trying to work it into the schedule. ...I'll be going very soon and possibly today."
Are you following Belarus?
"That's a terrible situation, Belarus. We'll be following it very closely."
Have you heard about Iran paying bounties in Afghanistan?
"No I haven't heard about that."
Inaudible question on Brazilian students
"We are looking at it..."
What is your goal for week?
"...We are going to be working very hard. It doesn't have to be covered but it probably will be... Pretty comprehensive. We're going to be working very hard. We have to..."
When will there be a funeral for your brother?
"Probably on Friday. We're looking at Friday. We may do just a small service right here at the White House for my brother. We're looking at doing that. That would be I think a great honor to him. I think he would be greatly honored. He loved our country. He loved our country so much. He was so proud of what we were doing and what we are doing for our country. So I think it would be appropriate. So we'll have probably on Friday afternoon a small service in honor of my brother Robert."
Stimulus talks
"I think that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer should get back into Washington and they should approve stimulus for the people...
"We'll take care of the Post Office. We want to make sure that the Post Office runs properly and it hasn't run properly for many years, probably 50 years. It was run very badly. So we want to make sure the Post Office is run properly and doesn't lose billions of dollars. Somebody said it lost $78 billion over a relatively short period of time... You can't have that... (added that Democrats are pushing for aid to poorly run statesJ "that's unfair to the rest of the country."
Are you worried that Post Office cutbacks affect deliveries of prescriptions?
"The Post Office is running very well. Now look, if you look at the Post Office, for years that's all people complained about. We are going to run it well and we're going to not lose so much money. One of the things the Post Office loses so much money on is delivering packages for Amazon and these others. Every time they deliver a package they probably lose $3 or $4. That's not good. They have to raise those prices. Not for the people to pay but for Amazon and those companies to pay."
Marine One lifted off at 10:29.

 Out of Town Pool Report #1 - JBA Departure 
Good morning from Andrews Air Force Base. Marine One touched down at 10:39 AM.
President Trump exited, wearing a navy suit and a red tie. He gave reporters a thumbs up and boarded Air Force One without stopping to talk.
He was accompanied by Mark Meadows, Hope Hicks, Stephen Miller and Kayleigh McEnany.
The president is making stops in Mankato, Minnesota and Oshkosh, Wisconsin today, where he will deliver campaign speeches.
We are on the small AF1 today so will not have signal once we board. We will be wheels up for Minneapolis, Minnesota shortly. 


 August 17, 2020 12:05

 Out of Town Pool Report #2 - Minnesota arrival and Meadows Gaggles 
Air Force One was wheels down in Minneapolis at 12:02 CDT.
During the flight, the president's chief of staff Mark Meadows came back twice and spoke on the record on the following topics:
On possible trip to Iowa today: "He wanted to go to Iowa today. Logistically, we could not make it work at the last minute."
Stimulus negotiations: Said he had not spoken to "Pelosi and Schumer in over a week."
He said Mnuchin made the last contact and Pelosi responded. Meadows said he had had "a number of conversations" with moderate Democrats and said they had been helpful.
"We are making progress at least in a conceptual way. But there has been no real discussions between the four negotiators"
USPS
"I know the post office really well. It's not an issue of money. They've got over 10 billion cash on hand, they've got another line of credit."
"The postmaster general has said he is willing to pay overtime."
"A lot of the headlines are not indicative of what's actually taking place at the Post office."
"The boxes that have been pulled down, the processing machinery that was all under Megan Brennan, it had nothing to do with this postmaster General."
On DeJoy testifying to Congress: "I don't know that they've noticed the hearing at this point."
He said 10 billion was the current offer.
On short term funding for the Post office:
"It's not only unrealistic, it's unnecessary."
"This is not a funding issue as much as it is a long term reform issue."
"This is not the first time we've seen delays in our postal system."
More Stimulus:
On House potentially voting Saturday, he said if Pelosi would agree to a deal with "direct stimulus to the American people at a high number, for the post office, we would sign that."
Said state and local funding remains the biggest sticking point. Said of Dems' $915 billion request "you can't justify that kind of number" and said the White House is offering $150 billion.
Said they are "willing to have a discussion on state and local" and said Post office funding is "not really a stumbling block." Said the president is "willing to provide money for the Post office as long as it is included in some other skinny measure if we cannot agree to a larger deal."
He later said on Stimulus that while they could support a deal that provided funding to "those that are hurting" and help to the post office, he had a "low expectation that will happen." He predicted a "partisan bill."
"We're not expecting a follow up call from Speaker Pelosi unless her members encourage her to actually come back to the negotiating table."
"The president has been fully engaged on the negotiations"
On GOP Convention:
"I think that you're going to expect a difference in the visions for America."
Tik Tok:
"As it relates to Tik Tok, we're hopeful that some of the US companies that have expressed interest will be able to address the national security concerns."
"Some of the damage in terms of data going to China has certainly been done. "
On a report of Iran bounties for Us Troops: said he wouldn't comment on Intel, but said it was "not a surprise."
A senior administration official also said it was possible they could see additional countries signing on to the UAE deal, but did not see it as likely.

On former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican who is speaking at the Democratic Convention tonight.
