    I have reviewed the report of the Comptroller of the United States, both personally and also with the White House Legal Counsel, Bob Lipshutz, and my faith in the character and competence of Bert Lance has been reconfirmed. I see no other conclusion that can be drawn from any objective analysis of these findings.
It's obvious that few individuals in Government or out of Government have ever undergone such an extensive and detailed investigation of their personal and business affairs by the Comptroller's Office, by the Justice Department, and twice by the Senate Committee. This process has not been an easy one for Bert, nor for those who are close to him. But I think I speak for him and his family, as well as for myself, when I say that we all recognize that intense scrutiny is a legitimate part of public life and public service.
I want to conclude by thanking Bert Lance for standing firm through difficult times, by answering every question put to him, and by going through this ordeal the last several weeks and, in all instances, conducted himself as a gentleman and as a man of complete integrity.
What is important is that Bert Lance is a man of competence, of honesty, trustworthy, and a man of integrity, and that his services to this country can and should continue. Bert Lance enjoys my complete confidence and support. I'm proud to have him as part of my administration.
As he has been throughout, Mr. Lance is now available to answer any questions that you might have. As far as I'm concerned, as President, the intense investigation and the Comptroller's report has answered questions that were raised against Bert Lance. And any questions that you might have now, in addition to those answered by the Comptroller or including those, Bert will be glad to provide those answers to you.
Bert, I'm proud of you.
