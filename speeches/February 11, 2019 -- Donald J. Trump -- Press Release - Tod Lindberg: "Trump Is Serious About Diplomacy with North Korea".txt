Trump Is Serious About Diplomacy With North KoreaBy Tod LindbergThe Wall Street JournalFebruary 6, 2019

The new tack was made clear in a detailed speech given at Stanford last week by Stephen E. Biegun, the U.S. special envoy to North Korea. Mr. Biegun firmly reiterated the administration's objective: "the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea."

"I don't mince my words when I say that [Mr. Trump] is unconstrained by the assumptions of his predecessors," he said. "President Trump is ready to end this war. It is over. It is done. We are not going to invade North Korea. We are not seeking to topple the North Korean regime." Disapproval of North Korea is not a policy, and the expression of disapproval is not diplomacy.

The Trump administration makes no such assumption about North Korea's eventual benevolence.
