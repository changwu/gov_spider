    Former Governor Bob Ehrlich, the first Republican elected as Governor of Maryland since 1966, announced today his support for Mayor Rudy Giuliani to be the next President of the United States. Similar to Mayor Giuliani, Ehrlich inherited an enormous budget deficit and used fiscal discipline to turn around Maryland's economy despite an overwhelming Democratic state legislature. Ehrlich will serve the Committee as the Mid-Atlantic Regional Chairman.
Governor Bob Ehrlich praised Giuliani's experience, leadership and record of results. "In the post-September 11th world, we need a competent, tough, and principled president. Rudy Giuliani is the right man for the job," said Governor Ehrlich. "As Mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani cut taxes, took on crime and government waste, and gave strength to an entire nation after the September 11th attacks. America needs a leader like Rudy Giuliani as president and I am proud to support his candidacy."
"I am honored to have the support of Governor Ehrlich," said Mayor Giuliani. "As Governor, Bob Ehrlich was never afraid to take on difficult challenges and find the right solutions for his constituents."
