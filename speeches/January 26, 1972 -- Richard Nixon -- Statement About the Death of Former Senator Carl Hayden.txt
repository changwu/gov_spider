    FOR 57 years, the energy and devotion of Carl Hayden strengthened and enriched the Congress of the United States. In the Congress--and in the country--he helped to keep alive the spirit and the character of the old West.
Senator Hayden told generations of newcomers to the Congress that it was better to be a workhorse than a show horse--and he followed that adage in every aspect of his life. As a result, his influence for good reached into every corner of our national experience. Quietly, but firmly, he made his lasting imprint on our history.
Carl Hayden entered the Congress a year before I was born. The first man to represent Arizona in the House of Representatives, his name became synonymous with the development of that State. With his death, Arizona and the Nation have lost another great link with our pioneering past.
Carl Hayden became a legendary figure for his countrymen even before his active years were over. Today, the entire Nation mourns his passing. But we know that as long as the Nation lives his legend will live on.
