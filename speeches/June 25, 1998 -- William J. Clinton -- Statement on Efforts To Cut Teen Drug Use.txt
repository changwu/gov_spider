Today's Pulse Check shows that the work of America's parents, teachers, and public officials is far from done. America's young people need to hear a single, unambiguous message: Drugs are wrong and dangerous, and they can kill you. This survey also indicates that we must continue our efforts to toughen drug enforcement and to get hardened drug users off the street and into mandatory testing and treatment.
