    We are deeply saddened by the vicious murder of four Russian diplomats taken hostage by Al-Qaida in Iraq. We send our condolences to the families of the victims of these terrorists and to the Russian people for their loss. We will continue to deepen our cooperation with Russia to defeat terrorism and bring the perpetrators of this act of violence to justice.
With this brutal killing, Al-Qaida in Iraq has once again shown its savagery. As Al-Qaida continues to target diplomats and innocents of all nationalities and religions, they continue to prove that they are enemies of all humanity. Despite these horrific acts, Al-Qaida's actions will not dissuade the Iraqi people, the United States, or the international community from establishing a prosperous, stable, and safe Iraq that is controlled by the Iraqi government for the Iraqi people.
