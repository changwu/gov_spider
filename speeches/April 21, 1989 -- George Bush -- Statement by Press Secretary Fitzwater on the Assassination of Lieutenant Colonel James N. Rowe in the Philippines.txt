    This was a cowardly and heinous act. Colonel Rowe was in the Philippines to help the Filipino people in their efforts to defend democracy. We will work closely with the Filipino Government in their efforts to track down and bring to justice those responsible for this assassination.
The U.S. Government support for Philippine democracy is unshaken. As President Bush has said, "President Aquino has our total support in her effort to maintain national unity, revitalize democracy, and counter the Communist insurgency." President and Mrs. Bush extend their deepest sympathy to the family and friends of Colonel Rowe.
