    "The Vice President welcomes today's announcement by USAID that it will activate a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to respond to the urgent humanitarian needs in the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. In coordination with officials on the ground, the team will provide the technical expertise needed to help scale up emergency food assistance, jobs programs, and protection for the most vulnerable families and communities. The citizens of these countries are still suffering from the effects of two devastating hurricanes and the ongoing global pandemic. The deployment of a DART team will provide needed humanitarian assistance, helping the people of the region where they are."
