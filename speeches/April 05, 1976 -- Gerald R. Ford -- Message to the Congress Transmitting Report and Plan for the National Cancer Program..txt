    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to submit to you the report on the activities, progress, and accomplishments of the National Cancer Institute during calendar year 1974, as well as a program plan for the next five years. The Director's Report and the Plan were prepared in accordance with Title IV, Part A, Section 410A(b), Public Health Service Act, as amended (42 USC 286e (b)).
The Administration is pleased to note the progress and accomplishments in cancer research, especially on cancer treatment and detection, and in promotion of the use of cancer knowledge in medical and health practice. A number of centers of cancer expertise have been established across the country. The results of the research and control activities must surely foretell an ameliorating influence on the formidable cancer statistics that face us today.
Our intensified cancer research effort was born of public. concern about the problems of cancer, which takes many forms, and it has our continuing support and commitment. The recommendations of the National Cancer Program Plan for substantial increases in funding, expanded research training, and new construction of research facilities must, however, be annually reviewed in the context of limited budgetary resources and other competing demands.
Our national involvement is symbolized by the National Cancer Program. People in Government and in the private sector must share the responsibility in this total effort against cancer. This report and this plan are a mark of our progress toward the ultimate solutions to the problems of cancer.
