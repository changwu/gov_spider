    Nancy and I congratulate George Bush and Dan Quayle on their historic victory. Their mandate will continue the changes that create jobs, prosperity, and peace for all Americans. This has been a long and vigorous campaign. Now we must pull together and help the Vice President accomplish the goals he has laid out for the Bush administration. I look forward to working with George and his team on a smooth transition.
