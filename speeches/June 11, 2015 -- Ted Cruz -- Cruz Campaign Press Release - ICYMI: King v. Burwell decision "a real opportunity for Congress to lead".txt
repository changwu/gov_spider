HOUSTON, Texas â€” U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke with POLITICO's Manu Raju on the upcoming King v. Burwell Supreme Court decision and the opportunity it provides to lead. Excerpts from the article appear below:
In an interview with POLITICO, the 2016 presidential candidate weighed in on the high-stakes Supreme Court case that could end subsidies for millions of people who receive their health insurance through the federal exchange. A majority of Republican senators have endorsed an approach to keep those subsidies in place until September 2017, but Cruz flatly said "no" when asked if he'd sign on as well.
"I think the best legislative option is to allow states to opt out," Cruz said in the Capitol. "I am cautiously optimistic that the Supreme Court will conclude in King vs. Burwell that the Obama IRS disregarded the plain language of the statute and acted lawlessly. And when that occurs, it will be a real opportunity for Congress to lead."
He added: "In a perfect world, we would take that opportunity to repeal Obamacare. At a minimum, we should allow states to opt out."
