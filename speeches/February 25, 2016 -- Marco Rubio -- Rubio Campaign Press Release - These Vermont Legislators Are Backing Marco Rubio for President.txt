Today, Team Marco released a strong team of Vermont legislators and elected officials supporting Marco.
Heading into March 1, Marco has the support he needs to do well in Vermont.
State Representative Kurt Wright is backing Marco to unite the party and win:
I am honored that so many legislators and Vermont leaders are standing behind the candidate that can win in November: Marco Rubio. Marco offers a positive vision for the future of America and in the White House, he will work every day to grow and expand opportunity which is why I will be voting for him on Tuesday.
State Senator Dustin Degree adds:
Marco Rubio offers so much optimism and understands that America is an exceptional nation, much like Ronald Reagan did. I'm proud to join with these individuals in supporting him for President, and I know that we will all be encouraging our constituents, neighbors and friends to cast their ballot for Marco on March 1.
Check out the impressive list of Vermont conservatives backing Marco!
