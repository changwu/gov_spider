    Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
I have just issued a proclamation which designates March as Red Cross Month.
This has been an especially tragic year for hundreds of thousands of our fellow. countrymen left destitute by disasters. The Red Cross--once every sixteen minutes-has helped bring relief in disaster situations in what has proven to be the costliest disaster year in its 96-year history.
I am a Red Cross blood donor myself and I know the value of its Blood Program's efforts to insure that we constantly have an adequate supply, voluntarily given. Also, through the Red Cross, we help the millions of men and women in uniform, veterans and their families cope with emergency situations and provide knowledge and skills to prevent accidents and save lives through training in first aid, water and boating safety, and health and nursing courses.
Within the Federal Government, the Red Cross is a part of the Combined Federal Campaign, but more than half of its 3,000 chapters raise all their funds in March. All chapters use the month to inform the public of Red Cross services available to citizens and to recruit new blood donors and volunteers.
As President of the United States and Honorary Chairman of the American National Red Cross, I urge all civilian employees of the Federal Government and members of the Armed Forces to support this vital voluntary effort to the best of their ability.
