    Grassroots support grows for Governor Richardson as New Hampshire primary approaches
MANCHESTER, NH-- The Richardson for President campaign today announced the endorsements of sixty-five prominent Granite State activists, businesspeople and community leaders, including eight New Hampshire state representatives, five town Democratic chairs, and the Dean Emeritus of Dartmouth Medical School.
In endorsing New Mexico Governor and Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Richardson, State Representative and Sullivan County Democratic Chair John Cloutier cited his record and proven ability to deliver change.
"As a successful governor, diplomat, and global troubleshooter, Bill Richardson has been tested, and he has proven his worth," said Cloutier, a lifelong resident of Claremont. "Bill Richardson can create the change that we desperately need in Washington, and he is ready to lead on day one."
The endorsements are a strong showing of statewide grassroots support for Governor Richardson and provide the latest boost to the Richardson for President campaign in New Hampshire. On Sunday, Governor Richardson was endorsed by the Conway Daily Sun, who called him the "the only heavy-weight" in the Democratic race for President.
