  MITT ROMNEY: "You know what it is. It says, 'Forward.' 'Forward' is his campaign's slogan. I think 'forewarned' is a better term.  We know what would happen if he were re-elected. We would see more years of high employment. We'd see more years of massive deficits. We'd see more years of almost no wage growth in this country. We'd see more years of a nation on the cusp of the kind of crisis you're seeing in Europe. We're forewarned, and that's why we're not going to re-elect this man. We're going to get America on track to create jobs and prosperity."
