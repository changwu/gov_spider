    "Today, the President was briefed by the National Incident Commander Admiral Thad Allen and Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change Policy Carol Browner regarding the ongoing efforts to contain the BP oil spill.
He was informed that skimming, dispersing, and burn operations continue with eight controlled burns yesterday.
He was also updated on BP's efforts to begin to put cutting machines into place that will be used to cut the riser pipe for placement of an alternate containment device. According to BP, the riser cutting will likely start Monday, or Tuesday.
They also discussed the fact that the flow rate could increase as much as 20% until the containment device is applied over the leak.
Adm. Allen indicated that, as per the President's direction, government and contractor resources in areas affected by oil will be tripled. He also indicated that officials on the ground have increased efforts to be more responsive to needs identified by local communities."
