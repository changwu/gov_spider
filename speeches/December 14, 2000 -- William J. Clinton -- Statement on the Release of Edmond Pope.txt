    I welcome today's release of Edmond Pope after 8 months of detention in Russia and appreciate President Putin's decision to pardon Mr. Pope.
Mr. Pope's ordeal was unjustified. It is fortunate that humanitarian considerations prevailed in the end.
I admire the impressive support Mr. Pope received from his wife and family and from Congressman John Peterson of Pennsylvania and other Members of Congress. I commend their tireless efforts on his behalf.
