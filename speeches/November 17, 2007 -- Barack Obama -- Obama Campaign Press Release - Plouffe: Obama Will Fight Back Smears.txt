    Below is a statement from Obama campaign manager David Plouffe.
"The Clinton campaign has admitted that they do not possess the 'scandalous information' in question and we take them at their word. But what we don't accept is their assertion that this is somehow falling for Republican tricks. This is exactly the kind of smear politics, Democrats need to fight back on, regardless of the source or the party. Democrats should know that when Barack Obama is their nominee, he will not allow the 'Swift boat' politics of fear and diversion to prevail in this campaign."
