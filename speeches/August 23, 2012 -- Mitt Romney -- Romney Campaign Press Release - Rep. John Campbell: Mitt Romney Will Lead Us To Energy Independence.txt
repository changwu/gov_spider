    California Congressman John Campbell made the following statement on Mitt Romney's vision for America as an energy superpower:
"Ensuring that this nation achieves energy independence is critically important to America's future security and prosperity. Today, Governor Romney has introduced a diverse and all-encompassing energy strategy that will make use of all of our natural resources, create much needed jobs, and accomplish complete energy independence in less than a decade. It is time to stop spending hundreds of billions on foreign oil and begin to implement real solutions that will lower energy prices, provide more efficient and cleaner fuels, and eliminate American dependence on expensive, imported energy. Governor Romney has shown he is ready to lead on energy reform and I'm proud to support his plan."
