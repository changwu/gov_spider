Pool Report 5 - More complete quotes from Dr. Sherwood-Randall
More from Deputy National Security Adviser Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall.
She started off the gaggle with the following remarks...as always, please double check against official transcript....
***
"We look forward to meeting with Governor Abbott and other state and local leaders to learn more about the recovery situation on the ground, and what more we can do to help."
"As you know, the President directed us to rapidly mobilize as many federal resources as possible to assist Texas' recovery efforts, along with recovery efforts in the other states that were affected by the severe winter storm improperly."
Said emergency and disaster declarations in Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Louisiana "have allowed FEMA and others to serve more than 2 million meals and nearly 2 million gallons of water over 60 generators and more than 100,000 gallons of fuel and lots and lots of blankets to Texans. these numbers keep changing as we do more, but the bottom line is, we're very focused on meeting immediate needs as well as providing direct individual financial assistance to uninsured families to help them recover from the death threats effects of extreme weather."
"As of yesterday afternoon FEMA had already awarded over $9 million in individual assistance grants to Texans. More broadly, we brought the full range of federal resources to bear in a whole of government effort, involving the Department of Defense, the Agriculture Department Health and Human Services Department. Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy. All of these agencies and others have been working hard to provide Texans with the resources they need. For example on the Department of Energy they issued the most expansive emergency order in the history of the agency, which permitted excess electricity generators to exceed the missions limitations on a temporary basis, and thereby restoring power as quickly as possible to those who have lost it due to the challenges presented to the energy supply chain and generation capabilities in Texas."
"As we continue to learn more in the coming days and weeks, one thing we know for sure is we cannot treat what happened in Texas, and in the whole region of the south as an isolated event. the impacts reflect our shared vulnerabilities through extreme weather events and other threats, and the need for collective action to modernize our critical infrastructure across the country so that we can meet the full spectrum of challenges that we will face in the future, going forward with a very close collaboration among the federal government, states, communities, and importantly private sector, to incentivize the kinds of actions that need to be taken to build the kind of resilient infrastructure that we can truly depend on"
She thanked energy and water plant workers, road workers, National Guardsmen and "everyone who stepped forward to help. And those who make truly valiant efforts to deliver essential to those in the incredibly difficult circumstances."

In-Town Pool Report 6: Psaki- Khashoggi Questions 
More complete quotes from Press Secretary when asked about POTUS' call with Saudi king/ Khashoggi killing:
Asked if POTUS raised Khashoggi to Saudi King during call, Press Sec stated:
"I don't have more to read out from the call, I can tell you broadly that the President raises...as does every official at every level, concerns we have about human rights abuses and steps that we expect the government and officials in the country to take moving forward, and certainly that was a part of the conversation."
Asked if there are possible sanctions administration is weighing over Khashoggi's killing:
Psaki: "Let me first say that we've been clear at every level that our intention is to recalibrate the relationship and this will be a different relationship with the Saudi government. At the same time, we of course we want to end the war in Yemen, we want to ensure that humanitarian crisis is addressed and the president and every member of our team is not going to hold back in voicing concern, and taking action as needed...I will say again that we expect the report, we are going to abide by our legal obligation to have that report released through our intelligence community. Once that report is released, I would expect, you know any actions would be announced after that report so stay tuned."
Asked if POTUS had concerns about MBS being in line to succeed King Salman. Psaki:
"This is for the, the government of Saudi Arabia to determine the path forward on their future leadership. I will say that the President has been clear, and we've been clear by our actions that we're going to recalibrate the relationship, including ensuring that engagement happens counterpart to counterpart."

In-Town Pool Report 7 - Syria quotes from Psaki 
More complete quotes from Press Sec Jen Psaki when asked about Syria >>>
On Syria strike:
"The president is sending an unambiguous message that he's going to act to protect Americans, and when threats are posed, he has the right to take an action at the time, and in the manner of his choosing. He also is going to take those actions in a manner that's deliberative, and that has the objective of de escalating activity in both Syria and Iraq.
On how Syrian strike influences reopening talks with Iran"So the status of that at this point in time, remains that the United States is open to having these diplomatic conversations ...right now the Europeans have issued an invitation. And we're waiting to hear back."
Asked about the legal authority for Syria strike:
"As a matter of domestic law, the president took this action pursuant to his article two authority to defend U.S. personnel, the targets were chosen to...correspond to the recent attacks on facilities, and to deter the risk of additional attacks over the coming weeks. As a matter of international law, United States acted pursuant to it's right to self defense as reflected in Article 50-1 of the UN Charter. the strikes were both necessary to address the threat and proportionate to the prior attacks.
Said national security team conducted a legal "review" in advance.
Asked about Biden's redline:
"I've been doing this long enough not to set new red lines on behalf of the President of the United States and commander in chief, but what I can reiterate for you is that this...It included consultation with coalition partners. And again, it sends an unambiguous message about the President's commitment to protecting American and coalition personnel."
Asked about what went into POTUS' decision making:
"I will say that it was important to the president to ensure that there was a proper Intel assessment and to take the time to do that and ensure there was work done to identify the right targets. And that's why it's been a couple of days since the initial attack, but in terms of additional color I would send you to the Department of Defense or the State Department."
Does POTUS think Assad should go?
Said POTUS has "long said" that "there needs to be a diplomatic solution."

In-Town Pool Report 8 - More Psaki quotes on Domestic issues 
Asked about Biden's role as "consoler-in chief" on Texas trip: 
Psaki said last Friday in call w/ Acting FEMA administrator Biden asked when it was appropriate to visit Texas because "he likes to see the details and likes to see things in person, and he wants to see how the public is engaging and have those conversations and that's important to him, as in terms of his governing style. It's important to him to hear directly from people on what their needs are."
Has parliamentarian ruling caused Biden to 'rethink' views on fillibuster? 
"the President continues to believe that a package that will bring necessary relief to the American people, that will get shots in the arms of Americans, that will reopen schools, that will get direct checks to people, that is supported by 70% or more of the American public, including the majority of Republicans, should garner Republican support, and we're still working for them."
On describing facilities housing migrant youth: 
"I would describe it as a shelter. I would describe it as a place where we keep kids who are under the age of 18, and taking a treacherous journey into this country, safe.
Says it's a place "where they can get access to education, mental health services, health services. There are no good choices here. The only other options are to send kids back, which is what the prior administration did...So this is the best choice we found we had to open the facility because of the impact of COVID."
