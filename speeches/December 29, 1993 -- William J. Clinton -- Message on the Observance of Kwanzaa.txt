    I take great pleasure in extending warm greetings to all who are observing the festival of Kwanzaa during this holiday season.
While Kwanzaa has only been celebrated for a quarter century in our country, it has grown steadily each year, inviting more people to embrace their African heritage. Today, millions of people of African descent gather together with loved ones to enjoy this special holiday based on the rich cultural traditions of Africa.
At a time when we are seeking ways to revitalize our neighborhoods and empower those who have been powerless for too long, Kwanzaa encourages us to rebuild and gives us the opportunity to celebrate the strengths of the African American community. The seven principles of Kwanzaa—unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith—provide young people with the pride, direction, and inner strength to work for a brighter future.
On each of the seven days, from Umoja to Imani, I wish all those who are commemorating Kwanzaa a wonderful holiday season of hope and joy.
