    Memorandum for the Secretary of Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Transportation
During my campaign, I pledged an urban and regional policy based on mutual trust, mutual respect and mutual commitment between State and local governments on the one hand and the federal government on the other. Although we do not have as yet a national urban and regional policy, the first step toward achieving that goal must be coordination among federal departments and agencies.
I would like you to form a working policy group on urban and regional development. The purpose of the group will be to conduct a comprehensive review of all federal programs which impact on urban and regional areas; to seek perspectives of state and local officials concerning the role of the federal government in urban and regional development; and to submit appropriate administrative and legislative recommendations.
Under Executive Order 11297, Pat Harris has the responsibility to convene such a group and will do so shortly. I want to emphasize that development of an urban and regional policy should be a joint project with full participation by each of your departments, as well as from other Federal agencies where appropriate. This is a high priority for my Administration, and I have asked Jack Watson and Stu Eizenstat to facilitate and support your collective efforts in every way possible.
I look forward to receiving a preliminary report on your progress and findings by early summer.
JIMMY CARTER
