    President Bush. Yesterday was an incredibly sad day for a lot of families in London. It's my honor, Ambassador, to come and represent our great country in extending our condolences to the people of Great Britain. To those who suffer loss of life, we pray for God's blessings. For those who are injured, we pray for fast healing. The British people are steadfast and strong. Long we've admired the great spirit of theâ€”of Londoners and the people of Great Britain. Once again that great strength of character is coming through.
Thank you, Ambassador, for letting me come by.
Ambassador David Manning of the United Kingdom. Well, Mr. President, could I just say thank you very much, sir, for coming straight here from the airplane after the summit at the G-8. It's enormously good of you to come here. The gesture is hugely appreciated. And can I say to you that we have had the most wonderful gestures of support from the Americans over the last 36 hours. We're very grateful for that. It's a huge source of comfort, and thank you so much for coming today.
President Bush. Yes, sir.
