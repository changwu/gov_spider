    Jim Towey is a dedicated public servant who has served as a vital member of my administration for more than 4 years. Under his leadership, the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives has applied the compassion of America to help solve some of our most challenging problems. His office has held 23 conferences around the country, assisting tens of thousands among America's armies of compassion. Eleven Federal departments and agencies now have Centers for Faith-Based and Community Initiatives that are building upon and expanding their good works in neighborhoods across the country.
Throughout his life, Jim has worked for Democrats and Republicans as an advocate for those in need. He served as Mother Teresa's legal counsel for many years. His work on behalf of the poor and the sick has improved lives. I admire Jim for his compassion, his faith, and his sense of humor. He is a man of great integrity, and I thank him for his service. Laura and I wish Jim, Mary, and the Towey family all the best.
