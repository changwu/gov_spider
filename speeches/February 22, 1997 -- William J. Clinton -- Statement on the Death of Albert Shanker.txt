    Hillary and I were deeply saddened today to learn of the passing of Albert Shanker. Al spent his life in pursuit of one of the noblest of causes, the improvement of our public schools. Since 1964, he led educational organizations, first as the president of the United Federation of Teachers in New York and for 22 years as the president of the American Federation of Teachers. He challenged the country's teachers and schools to provide our children with the very best education possible and made a crusade out of the need for educational standards. He believed, as I do, that children should not go through school without learning the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Eadie, and his family tonight.
