    The White House reaffirms its commitment to Charitable Choice as signed into law by President Clinton in 1996, 1998 and 2000 and as currently constituted in faith-based legislation passed by the House Judiciary Committee. The House legislation maintains the current civil rights protections under Charitable Choice. These protections ensure that religious organizations have the right to hire individuals who share their religious faith. They also ensure that such organizations comply with civil rights laws.
The White House will not pursue the OMB regulation proposed by the Salvation Army and reported today.
