    The United States welcomes the peace agreement negotiated and signed by the Afghan government and representatives of Hizb-e Islami Gulbuddin (HIG). We applaud both parties for seeking a peaceful resolution through political dialogue and negotiation, and we commend the agreement as an important demonstration of the Afghan government's commitment to restoring peace and stability in Afghanistan. These steps toward seeking a peaceful resolution to decades of conflict can only benefit the people of Afghanistan. The United States continues to support an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned peace process in which armed groups cease violence, break ties with international terrorist groups, and accept the Constitution, including protections for women and minorities.
