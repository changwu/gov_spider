    The United States Embassy in Quito, Ecuador, has confirmed that Ecuadoran President Leon Febres-Cordero is being held hostage by elements of the Ecuadoran Air Force. One of the pillars of this administration's foreign policy is to support democratic governments and democratic processes in Latin America.
The administration is deeply disturbed by the developments that threaten constitutional and democratic rule in Ecuador. We strongly urge that the democratically elected President of Ecuador be immediately released and unconditionally allowed to resume his constitutional duties.
