    The action of the Senate Finance Committee today moves health care reform another step closer to final passage.
Chairman Moynihan has worked diligently to make sure his committee produced a bill to debate on the Senate floor. His commitment to universal coverage has been clear throughout this process, and I look forward to his continued leadership as we move toward guaranteed health coverage for every American.
I remain firmly committed to guaranteed health coverage for every American that can never be taken away. We must achieve universal coverage if we are to reform our health care system and assure hard-working, middle class Americans that they will have health care when they need it. I am confident that we will achieve the goal of guaranteed coverage for everyone this year, and I look forward to the debate in the full House and Senate.
