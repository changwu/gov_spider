Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
I congratulate you and your people upon Uganda's independence. The government and the people of the United States wish Uganda a prosperous future as a sovereign nation.
The principle of self-determination in Africa has in Uganda proved once more its truth and strength. This principle inspired our own people in their struggle for independence, and we therefore feel a special kinship and pride in welcoming Uganda to the community of free nations.
A common devotion to the United Nations Charter will strongly bind our nations in the imperative task of building a just and peaceful world. Uganda's independence strengthens the forces working toward this goal.
Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[The Honorable A. Milton Obote, Prime Minister of Uganda, Kampala]
