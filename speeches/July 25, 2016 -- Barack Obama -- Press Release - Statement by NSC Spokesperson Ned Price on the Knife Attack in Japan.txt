    The United States offers our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of those killed in the heinous attack today in Sagamihara, Japan. We also pray for the speedy recovery of the dozens of individuals who were wounded. There is never any excuse for such violence, but the fact that this attack occurred at a facility for persons with disabilities makes it all the more repugnant and senseless. The thoughts of the American people are with our Japanese friends as they mourn the lives lost.
