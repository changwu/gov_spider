    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Young (R) Alaska)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 5389, but will seek amendments in the Senate to delete section 8, which would unnecessarily impose burdensome and recurring reporting requirements on the Secretaries of Defense and the Interior regarding all military withdrawals in the State of Alaska.
