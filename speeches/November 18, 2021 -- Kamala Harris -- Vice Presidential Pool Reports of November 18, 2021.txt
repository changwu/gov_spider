Foreign Pool Report #6: Harris-AMLO Quotes
VPOTUS' quotes:
"This meeting is a continuation of an ongoing conversation that you and I have had fueled by friendship, fueled by partnership, fueled by the longstanding relationship between Mexico and the United States and in recognition of all the work that we will do currently and that we pledge to do together in the future."
"The conversation that we have had range in subject. I have enjoyed always the conversation that you and I have about history and the critical figures in history both in Mexico and the United States who have worked together. But our conversation also extends to economic prosperity for both of our nations, the issue of our mutual concern about migration and what we will do as partners to address, in particular, the root causes of migration, and also what we can do in issues of technology and the exploration of space. All of these issues have been the subject of our discussions previously and will be ongoing."
VPOTUS thanked President López Obrador for the "warmed reception" that US Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar -present in the meeting- have been given.
President López Obrador's quotes:
President López Obrador said that he agrees with VP Harris and called Ambassador Salazar "a very good" ambassador. He made a historical comparison with the US Ambassador that was appointed under the Roosevelt administration because it helped "strengthen the relationship between both countries".
The president highlighted "the importance of economic cooperation, investment in Central America". "There is a plan by the US Government to assist Central America, which we very much celebrate. If economic integration in North America gets strengthened, the migration flow will need to be put in order, and there will be labor opportunities to grow in North America and produce in North America what we consume, so that we don't have to depend on imports."
"We applaud that President Biden sent to Contress an initiative to regularize migrants. I hope lawmakers from both parties support it, because it is fair."
VPOTUS and President López Obrador did not take any questions. As always, please check quotes against transcript.
