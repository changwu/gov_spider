    Harun Fazul's death is a another huge setback to al Qaeda and its extremist allies, and provides a measure of justice to so many who lost loved ones because of the actions of this terrorist. We commend the efforts of the Somali government forces, whose actions against Fazul struck a significant blow against those in the region seeking to carry out terrorist attacks.
