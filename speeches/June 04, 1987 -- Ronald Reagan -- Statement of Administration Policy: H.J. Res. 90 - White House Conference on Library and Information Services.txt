    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Ford (D) MI and 168 others)
The administration supports the goals of a conference on libraries and information services, but opposes H.J. Res. 90 because White House sponsorship of another such conference is neither necessary nor desirable. Professional associations, corporate sponsors, civic groups, state and local governments, and other interested parties can organize and provide the resources for a national conference.
