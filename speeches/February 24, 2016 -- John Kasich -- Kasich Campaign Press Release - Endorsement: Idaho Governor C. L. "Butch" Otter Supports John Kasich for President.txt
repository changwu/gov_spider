    Today Idaho Governor C. L. "Butch" Otter endorsed Governor John Kasich for President and joined the Kasich for America leadership team as a national co-chair.
Otter became Idaho's 32nd governor in 2007 and was reelected to his third consecutive term in 2014. He previously served as Idaho Lieutenant Governor and represented the state's 1st Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives. The Idaho native also gained military experience in the Idaho Army National Guard's Cavalry and left his mark on the private sector as the president of Simplot International, an agribusiness corporation. InsideGov, a nonpartisan government research site, has ranked Otter as America's most conservative governor.
Said Otter, "There's simply no substitute for executive experience. Gov. Kasich has proven himself to be a leader who can effectively balance a budget, open the door to job creation and bring people together to find solutions. His record of results is unmatched by any other candidate, and it is time for Republicans to coalesce around his vision for our nation. I look forward to spreading his message of optimism and strength here in Idaho."
Said Kasich, "As a fellow sitting governor, Butch Otter knows what it takes to be an executive and make tough decisions. I'm grateful for his support and confidence in our campaign as we continue to expand our ground operations in Idaho."
