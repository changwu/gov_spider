    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Metzenbaum (D) Ohio and 23 others)
The Administration opposes S. 2527, or any legislation mandating that employers give advance notice of plant closings and/or mass layoffs. If any mandatory notice legislation is presented to the President, his senior advisers would recommend disapproval.
Mandatory notice legislation would seriously impair the ability of U.S. businesses to adjust to rapidly changing economic conditions and compete. This would hurt workers by causing the loss of jobs.
The Administration encourages companies to voluntarily give workers and communities as much advance warning as possible when a layoff or closing becomes necessary.
