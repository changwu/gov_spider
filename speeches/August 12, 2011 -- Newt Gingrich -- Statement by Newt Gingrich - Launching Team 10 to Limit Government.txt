    Today, we're launching a new project called Team 10.
"10" as in the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, which states simply: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.
We as citizens have no more powerful tool than the 10th Amendment in our effort to shift power out of Washington and back home to the people.
We must just choose to enforce it - and that's where Team 10 comes in.
Led by tea party and 912 Project leaders from around the country, Team 10 is about asking you, and every other American, for your ideas on how to enforce the 10th Amendment and limit government in Washington.
Through voting, online and in-person events, and just talking with each other, the best of these ideas will eventually become a "10th Amendment Enforcement Act."
And if I become the Republican nominee, this "10th Amendment Enforcement Act" that you and I work to create will be included in a new Contract with America.
You can get started now by visiting Newt.org/Team10, and submitting your idea for limiting government. Or, just read and vote on the ideas of others.
Our Constitution begins "We the People." It's not "We the Politicians" or "We the Bureaucrats." America is exceptional because we believe sovereignty begins with the individual. We loan power to the government, not the other way around.
Team 10 is about reasserting this basic principle, and creating smaller government by working together and being bigger citizens.
We hope that you'll be a part of this effort by visiting Newt.org/Team10 and getting started today.

- Newt
