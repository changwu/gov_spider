    To the Congress of the United States:
Throughout this century, energy has played a prominent role in American progress. The rise of the great industrial enterprises, the ascendence of the automobile, the emergence of environmental awareness, and the advent of the truly global economy all relate to the way that society produces and uses energy. As we face the opportunities and challenges of the next century, energy will continue to exert a powerful influence on our Nation's prosperity, security, and environment.
Energy policies that promote efficiency, domestic energy production, scientific and technological advances, and American exports help sustain a strong domestic economy. The need to protect the environment motivates our continual search for more innovative, economic, and clean ways to produce and use energy. And although oil crises have receded into memory, their potential for harming our economy and national security remains.
Our Administration has actively pursued a national energy policy since January 1993. We have engaged in an active dialogue with thousands of individuals, companies, and organizations. Informed by that dialogue, we have committed the resources of the Department of Energy and other agencies to ensure that our policy benefits energy consumers, producers, the environment, and the average citizen.
This report to the Congress, required by section 801 of the Department of Energy Organization Act, highlights our Nation's energy policy. The report underscores our commitment to implement a sustainable energy strategyâ€”one that meets the needs of today while expanding the opportunities for America's future. By implementing a sustainable strategy, our energy policy will provide clean and secure energy for a competitive economy into the 21st century.
