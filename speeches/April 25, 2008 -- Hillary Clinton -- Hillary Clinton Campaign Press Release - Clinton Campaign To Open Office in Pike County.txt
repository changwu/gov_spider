    Demonstrating its continued momentum across the Blue Grass State, the Clinton campaign announced it will open an office in Pike County. The campaign, which plans to open additional offices in eastern Kentucky, will host an open house on Monday, April 28th at 6:00 p.m.
"Opening an office in Pike is just another example of the grassroots excitement about Hillary's campaign that we're seeing across Kentucky," said State Chair Jerry Lundergan. "Supporters and volunteers from across the state are coming together to help elect Hillary. We have a lot of work ahead of us in the next few weeks, but opening an office in Pike puts us one step closer to victory on May 20th."
"Throughout the state, people are eager to get involved in Hillary's historic candidacy because they know she has the ability to turn around our economy and rebuild the middle class," said State Director Jonathan Hurst. "Opening an office in Pike will build on the momentum from President Clinton's visit a few weeks ago and help Hillary carry the Bluegrass State."
