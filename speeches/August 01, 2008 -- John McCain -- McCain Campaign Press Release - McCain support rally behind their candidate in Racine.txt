With his town hall appearance here Thursday, John McCain seemed to cement the support of those who came in inclined to vote for him.
That was the recurring message from those who shared their opinions after the Memorial Hall event.
John Pettinger, 41, of Racine called himself a McCain supporter going in to the event. "I was more or less impressed," he said. The videos about McCain that showed before the live event were effective, he said.
"I do think he dodged a few of the questions, no doubt about it," Pettinger said.
However, he said McCain "has a real genuineness that I suspected he had, and now I know he has."
Ron Ganim, 61, of the Chicago area, voiced the same thought. "I thought he came across as a really genuine person," he said. "Very honest and forthright."
Ganim also said he thought McCain was articulate. "I was actually a little concerned about that," he said, but thought the candidate handled the town hall part well.
He said he likes Democratic candidate Barack Obama "as a person," but said McCain is "the real McCoy."
Justin Emerson, 18 of Manteno, Ill., also found McCain personable. "I learned a lot. It swayed me more his way," he said.
Emerson also embraced McCain's call for off-shore drilling and nuclear power.
"My dad is in the nuclear industry," he said. "Energy is really important for our country to succeed."
Renee Boyle, 38, of Twin Lakes said, "His focus on education was important to me. I was interested in what he said about cars and giving people $5,000 to purchase more economical, fuel-friendly cars."
David Ricchio of Racine said he was "very impressed. All of his comments are things I would support. I was particularly impressed with his attitude of '˜America first.'"
Ricchio especially liked McCain's stances on reducing spending and pork-barrel spending.
"He did an excellent job because there were some weird people in the group there obviously with their own agendas that were negative," Ricchio said. "McCain handled it in a positive and inspiring way."
"He's got a patch on his skin, he's 71 or 72," he said. "He's more charismatic in person. I don't know how he's going to address that when Obama's such a charismatic guy. I don't know how to make people see him how we did."
Seeing McCain in person was enough to get Lindsey Pohlman, 22, of McHenry, Ill., to sign up as a McCain volunteer on her way out of Memorial Hall.
"I think people of our age will vote for Obama because it's cool," she said. "... I really don't care if people my age vote for Obama — as long as they have a reason. I don't want to hear that it's just because he's young or a good speaker.
"I think it's important to have an opinion and to know what you're talking about," Pohlman added.
She said she thinks that Obama's campaign has generated enthusiasm among young voters — but that there is also now a counter-response developing among young people in McCain's favor.
Cindy Celmer, 49, of Racine said she came in a McCain supporter, "but not big supporter." Now she's more likely to vote for him.
"My family's been in the military, and he's been there."
