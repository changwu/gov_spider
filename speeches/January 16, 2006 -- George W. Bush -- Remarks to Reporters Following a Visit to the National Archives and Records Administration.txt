    It seems fitting on Martin Luther King Day that I come and look at the Emancipation Proclamation in its original form. Abraham Lincoln recognized that all men are created equal. Martin Luther King lived on that admonition to call our country to a higher calling, and today we celebrate the life of an American who called Americans to account when we didn't live up to our ideals.
Allen, thanks for having me. I would strongly recommend our fellow citizens come to this house of archives, a house that archives a lot of our important documents. It's really an amazing place; it's really fascinating. I appreciate you and your staffâ€”thanking you.
All right, thank you all. See you later today.
