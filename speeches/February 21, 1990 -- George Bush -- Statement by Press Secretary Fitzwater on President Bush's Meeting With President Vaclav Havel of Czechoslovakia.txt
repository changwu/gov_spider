    The President and President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia met for approximately 45 minutes today in the Oval Office. This was a continuation of their discussions yesterday. They talked at some length about the future of Europe and agreed to stay in close touch at this time of rapid change. Both expressed their support for President Gorbachev's reforms and his encouragement of peaceful change in Eastern Europe, and both agreed that the presence of American troops is a factor for stability and security in Europe. Although it was anticipated that economic issues would be discussed, most of the conversation focused on political and East-West issues.
