    Mitt Romney issued the following statement on the National Labor Relations Board officials' disturbing comments about U.S. jobs:
"President Obama has allowed the National Labor Relations Board to run roughshod over America's job creators. Recently released emails from NLRB officials, including General Counsel Lafe Solomon, reveal a disturbing and cavalier attitude about job losses that are a direct result of NLRB policies. If President Obama is serious about getting America back to work 'right now,' he should start by immediately dismissing Mr. Solomon and sending a message throughout his Administration that our country's jobs crisis isn't a laughing matter."
