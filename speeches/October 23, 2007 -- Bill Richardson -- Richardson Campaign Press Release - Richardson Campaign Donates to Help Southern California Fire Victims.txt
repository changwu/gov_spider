    Will contribute $10,000 to Red Cross to assist in relief efforts
LOS ANGELES-- During a visit to the state today, Governor Bill Richardson's campaign announced it is donating $10,000 to the Red Cross to assist in relief efforts as a result of the wildfires in Southern California.
"These fires have been a tragedy for the entire state and my sympathy and concern goes out to the victims and their families," Richardson said. "We have offered the state of California the full assistance of New Mexico's resources and stand ready to help any way we can. In the meantime, I urge everyone to join us in contributing to the Red Cross, which is the quickest, most effective way to help those displaced by the fires. The Red Cross is on the front lines assisting and caring for the victims, as it always is in times of crisis."
"New Mexico has experienced the devastation and tragedy of huge wildfires and we know well the toll it takes on families and communities," added the Governor. "It will take time to recover and rebuild, and we want the people of California to know they are not alone."
