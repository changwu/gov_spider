    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Dr. Benjamin Spock. For half a century, Dr. Spock guided parents across the country and around the world in their most important jobâ€”raising their children. As a pediatrician, writer, and teacher, Dr. Spock offered sage advice and gentle support to generations of families, and he taught all of us the importance of respecting children. He was a tireless advocate, devoting himself to the cause of improving the lives of children. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family.
