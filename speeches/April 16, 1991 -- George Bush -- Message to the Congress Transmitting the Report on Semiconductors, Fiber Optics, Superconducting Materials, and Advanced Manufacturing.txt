    To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to the provisions of section 5141, 102 Stat. 1444, of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (Public Law 100 - 418) and Executive Order No. 12661, I transmit herewith the Report to the Congress on Federal Policies, Budgets, and Technical Activities in Semiconductors, Fiber Optics, Superconducting Materials, and Advanced Manufacturing.
This report focuses on Federal research and development (R&D) funding levels and policies for four technologies: semiconductors, fiber optics, superconducting materials, and advanced manufacturing. There is an additional discussion of organizational and management issues that affect innovation. The report makes clear that the Administration continues to support R&D in these technologies as well as in other high-technology areas consistent with U.S. technology policy. It highlights Administration views on the appropriate roles for the Government as well as the private sector in such areas as these four technologies.
