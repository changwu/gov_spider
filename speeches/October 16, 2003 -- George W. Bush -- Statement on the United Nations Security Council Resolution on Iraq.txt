    I welcome today's unanimous passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1511. The world has an opportunity—and a responsibility—to help the Iraqi people build a nation that is stable, secure, and free. This resolution will help marshal even more international support for the development of a new, democratic Iraq. I look forward to continuing to work with the United Nations to aid the transition in Iraq to self-government and help the Iraqi people rebuild their nation.
