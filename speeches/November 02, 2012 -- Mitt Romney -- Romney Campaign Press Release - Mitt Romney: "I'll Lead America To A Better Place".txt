    "I don't believe this is a moment when our big dreams will be satisfied with a small agenda. I'll lead America to a better place, where confidence in the future is assured, not questioned. This is not a time for America to settle. We're four days away from a fresh start, four days away from the first day of a new beginning." â€” Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "I don't believe this is a moment when our big dreams will be satisfied with a small agenda. I'll lead America to a better place, where confidence in the future is assured, not questioned. This is not a time for America to settle. We're four days away from a fresh start, four days away from the first day of a new beginning. My conviction that better days are ahead is not based on promises and hollow rhetoric but on solid plans and proven results and an unshakable faith in the American people and the American spirit. I believe in America. I believe in the American people. And if there's anyone worried that the last four years are the best we can do, if there is anyone who fears that the American dream is fading, if there is anyone who wonders whether better jobs and better paychecks are things of the past, I have a clear and unequivocal message: With the right leadership, America will come roaring back. The only thing that stands between us and some of the best years we've known is lack of leadership. And that's why we have elections, after all. This Tuesday is a moment to look into the future and imagine what we can do, to put the past four years behind us and start building a new future."
