    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Rep. Pelosi (D) California and 15 cosponsors)
The Administration supports Senate passage of H.R. 5140, the bipartisan economic growth compromise as passed by the House, without delay. This legislation meets the criteria set out by the Administration that an economic growth package be large enough to make a difference, immediate in its impact, broad-based, temporary, and based on tax relief rather than government spending programs. The Administration commends the House for taking swift, decisive bipartisan action to improve the Nation's near-term economic outlook by passing the compromise bill with such an overwhelming bipartisan majority.';
