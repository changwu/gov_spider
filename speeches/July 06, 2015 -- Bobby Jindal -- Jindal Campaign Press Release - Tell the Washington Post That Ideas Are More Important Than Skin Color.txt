    "it seems Jindal is American precisely because he believes in a constant effort to emulate and approximate "standard American-ness" — what many would say is actually white-ness or at least a very muted Indian-American-ness — whenever and however possible." -Janell Ross, The Washington Post

It has become increasingly clear that The Washington Post would rather judge Governor Jindal on the color of his skin, rather than the content of his character, his ideas, or his successful record as governor. That is sad.
Tell the Washington Post that ideas are more important than skin color.
