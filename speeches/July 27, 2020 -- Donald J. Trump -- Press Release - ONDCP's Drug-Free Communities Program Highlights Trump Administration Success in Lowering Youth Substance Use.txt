Today the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) released its 2020 Drug-Free Communities (DFC) report, highlighting data proving the program continues to result in the consistent reduction of youth substance use rates.
ONDCP released the Executive Summary and Annual Report for its DFC grant recipients, which work at the local level to prevent youth substance use, including prescription drugs, marijuana, tobacco, and alcohol.
"Stopping substance use disorders in America starts with educating our country's youth about their danger," ONDCP Director Jim Carroll stated. "Thanks to the dedication of President Trump and the proven efforts of our Drug-Free Communities grant recipients, our next generation is learning at an early age to make healthy choices, reject using illicit substances, and are being empowered by their communities to be leaders of today â€” youth in DFC funded communities are creating community change across the country, resulting in positive outcomes. ONDCP applauds the hundreds of coalitions committed to the safety of young Americans, and the record investments of the Trump Administration that continue to make their work possible."
Among the report's many highlights are the significant reductions in past 30-day substance use rates among youth living in areas served by DFC coalitions, including:

A 27 percent decline in prescription drug misuse among high school students.
A 45 percent decline in tobacco use among high school students.
A 46 percent decline in tobacco use among middle school students.
A 13 percent decline in marijuana use among middle school students.
A 22 percent decline in alcohol use among middle school students.
A 24 percent decline in alcohol use among high school students.
