    I congratulate Peter Diamond and Dale Mortensen on winning the Nobel Prize in Economics for their groundbreaking economic research that has applications in a wide range of areas, like unemployment and housing, where we need our best and brightest minds. I have nominated Peter to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to help bring his extraordinary expertise to our economic recovery. I hope he will be confirmed by the Senate as quickly as possible.
