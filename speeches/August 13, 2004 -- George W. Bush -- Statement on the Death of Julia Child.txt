    Julia Child enriched America with her optimism and enthusiasm for life. She worked with the Office of Strategic Services to protect freedom during World War II. She taught millions to enjoy cooking, and her legacy will continue through her books and videos. She was a pioneer in the early television age who made great strides for women. For her many contributions, she was honored in 2003 with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civil honor. Laura and I send our prayers and condolences to her family and friends.
