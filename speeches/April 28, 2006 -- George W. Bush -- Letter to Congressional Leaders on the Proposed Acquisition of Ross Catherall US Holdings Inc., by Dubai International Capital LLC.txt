I have made this decision under the authority vested in me as President by section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (the "Exon-Florio amendment"), 50 U.S.C. App. 2170, and on the basis of the recommendation from senior officials who make up the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.
The attached report, prepared by my Administration, is submitted consistent with subsection (g) of that amendment and is subject to the provisions of subsection (c) regarding confidentiality of information.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
