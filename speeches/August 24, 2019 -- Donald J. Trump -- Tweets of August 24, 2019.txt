'Face It You Probably Got A Tax Cut!' This was a New York Times headline and it is very true. If Republicans take back the House and keep the Senate and Presidency one of our first acts will be to approve a major middle income Tax Cut! Democrats only want to raise your taxes!Retweets: 22104Favorites: 82975
