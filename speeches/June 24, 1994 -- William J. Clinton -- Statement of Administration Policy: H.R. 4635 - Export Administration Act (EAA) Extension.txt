    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 6/27/94)(House)(Hamilton (D) Indiana)
The Administration supports the short-term extension of the EAA as proposed in H.R. 4635.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 4635 would affect receipts and direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is that its enactment would be revenue neutral. Final scoring of this legislation may differ from this estimate.
