    Former Undersecretary of Health for the Department of Veterans Affairs Dr. Michael Kussman, M.D., today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's speech to the American Legion:
"Our vets didn't hesitate to answer the call of duty when our country needed them. Now, we need to answer to their unique needs. As they return from the battlefield, they shouldn't have to join unemployment lines or worry about keeping a roof over their heads. Unfortunately, the economy under Barack Obama has stalled. We need a leader who will turn it around and look out for the best interests of those who risked all to defend our freedom and way of life."
