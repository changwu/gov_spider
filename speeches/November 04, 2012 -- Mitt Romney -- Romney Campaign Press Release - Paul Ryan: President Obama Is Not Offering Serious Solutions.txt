PAUL RYAN: "These are serious times. We need serious solutions, and that's not what we're getting from President Obama. That's the problem. The President came in with so much promise, with such great rhetoric. You know what he said four years ago? He said, if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare voters. You paint your opponent as someone people should run from if you don't have a record to run on. You make a big election about small things. That's what he said four years ago when he ran for president, and that's exactly what he has become now that he is president. And the reason is really pretty simple. He has a terrible record to run on. He can't run on his record. Twenty three million people are struggling for work. People like we grew up with in our hometowns who lost that great job that they had that paid them good wages with good benefits are in between jobs."
