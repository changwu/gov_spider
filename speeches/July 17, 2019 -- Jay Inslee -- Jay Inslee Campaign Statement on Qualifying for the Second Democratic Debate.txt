    Seattle â€“ Today, after the Democratic National Committee officially announced that Governor Jay Inslee has qualified for the July Democratic debate, Inslee for America Campaign Manager Aisling Kerins released the following statement.
"Governor Jay Inslee is looking forward to driving the discussion on climate change at the July Democratic Debate," said Kerins. "Our upstart campaign continues to build strong momentum around the mission to defeat climate change and a comprehensive plan for a national mobilization on climate action. Governor Inslee remains the only governor to reach the 65,000 grassroots donor mark, because of the movement he has built around the climate issue. Voters deserve more climate discussion than the failed first debate; and Jay Inslee will ensure that climate change is a central part of the discussion in Detroit."
