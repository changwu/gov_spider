    On behalf of all Americans, I welcome home the crew of the space shuttle Discovery from a safe and successful mission. Your courage and commitment to excellence have inspired us all, and a proud Nation sends its congratulations on a job well done. The men and women of NASA have dedicated themselves to putting our space program back on track and implementing our Nation's vision for human and robotic space exploration. America's space program is a source of great national pride, and this mission has been another important accomplishment in advancing space science, human space flight, and space exploration.
