    Iran's demands that restrictions on arms sales be lifted as part of the ongoing nuclear talks show just how far afield these negotiations have gone under President Obama's failed leadership. What started as an effort to dismantle Iran's nuclear program has turned into a disastrous plan that will immediately enrich the Ayatollahs in Tehran, expand their ability to support violence and chaos throughout the region, and leave them as a nuclear threshold state. Every new detail to leak out of the negotiating room makes the situation look more grim. President Obama should immediately suspend these talks. The United States should have a very clear message for Iran and the rest of the world: we will never lift sanctions or the arms embargo until Tehran abandons its nuclear weapons ambitions and support for terrorists.
