    Melania and I send our greetings to all those observing Kwanzaa. This annual celebration of African heritage, unity, and culture is a special opportunity for many to reflect on their shared ancestry and values. At this time, our Nation joins in honoring the important contributions of African Americans to the strength and success of the United States.
As families, friends, and communities gather this week to light the kinara, we join in sending our best wishes for good health and happiness in the New Year.
