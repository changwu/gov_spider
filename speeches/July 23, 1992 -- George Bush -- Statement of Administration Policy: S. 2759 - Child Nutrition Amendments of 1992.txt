    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 7/27/92)(House)(Leahy (D) VT and three others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of S. 2759. In particular, the Administration is pleased that S. 2759 includes its proposal to establish a breastfeeding promotion program.
However, the bill would continue to authorize a number of school districts to receive cash payments or commodity letters of credit in lieu of entitlement commodities for their school lunch programs. This needlessly extends demonstration projects that Were meant to be temporary and have not proven to be an improvement over the current system.
S. 2759 would result in an increase in direct spending of $1 million in FY 1994 and about $500,000 in all other fiscal years. Therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. This increase in direct spending should be offset in the bill.
