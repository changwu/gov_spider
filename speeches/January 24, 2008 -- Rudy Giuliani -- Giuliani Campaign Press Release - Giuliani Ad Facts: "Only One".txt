BACKGROUND:
GIULIANI FOUGHT FOR CONSERVATIVE JUDGES IN REAGAN ADMINISTRATION
Giuliani Was A Member Of The Department Of Justice Judicial Selection Working Group. The group reviewed vacant seats and judicial candidates for the federal courts. In addition, the group dealt with issues such as efforts to obtain names of qualified women candidates for judicial vacancies. (Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Rose, Memo To Department Of Justice Judicial Selection Working Group, 2/1/82; Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Rose, Memo To Department of Justice Judicial Selection Working Group, 4/12/82)
Former Reagan Administration Assistant Attorney General Ted Olson Said Reagan Appointed Judges Like Scalia "On The Recommendation Of Rudy." Olson: "The best indicator is when Rudy was a part of the federal system in the United States Department of Justice in the early 1980's in the Reagan administration. And the people that President Reagan appointed with…on the recommendation of Rudy, among others, were the people like Bob Bork and Justice Scalia, then Judge Scalia, and so forth." (Hugh Hewitt Show, 3/1/07)
Olson Said That Giuliani Made Sure Reagan's Judicial Nominees Respected The Constitution. Olson: "Rudy and I became very, very close, part of that process was the selection of persons to recommend to President Reagan to appoint to judicial positions, including the Supreme Court, the Federal Courts of Appeals, the Federal District Courts. And one of the things we did was concentrate on the character and integrity of the individuals that we wanted to appoint to the judiciary. People would respect the constitution, laws passed by Congress and the limited role of judges." (Ted Olson, Press Conference, Washington, D.C., 7/17/07)
Giuliani Attended Weekly Meetings Devoted To Judicial Selections And Nominations, Would Share His Views On Nominees. "Numerous senior officials who served with him confirm that in addition to daily senior-management meetings with the attorney general, which covered pending nominations, Giuliani attended the Tuesday meetings devoted to judicial selections and nominations. He would present his recommendations for U.S. Attorneys and Marshals but also offer his views on judges." (Jennifer Rubin, "Rudy As Prosecutor," National Review, 4/30/07)
Former Federal Prosecutor Randy Mastro: "Mayor Giuliani Has Said That He Wants To Appoint Judges Who Will Interpret The Law And Who Will Make Policy. He Had Experience Doing That As The Number Three Official In Ronald Reagan's Department." (Randy Mastro, Press Conference, Washington, D.C., 7/17/07)
AND PUSHED FOR PRESIDENT BUSH'S STRICT CONSTRUCTIONIST NOMINEES
Giuliani Called John Roberts "Remarkable Candidate" With "Superb Qualifications For The Supreme Court." GIULIANI: "[John Roberts is] a remarkable candidate. I mean, there is nothing in his background that doesn't say 'superb qualifications for the Supreme Court.' His education, his academic performance, the extraordinary fact that he's argued 39 times before the Supreme Court." (Fox News' "Hannity & Colmes," 7/20/05)
Giuliani Said Democrats Would "Really Lose Credibility" If They Forcefully Opposed Roberts' Nomination. GIULIANI: "[I] think, if they do an all-out opposition to John Roberts, they're going to really lose credibility, because he is precisely what they've been talking about, someone who is extremely well-qualified, someone who's – because he hasn't been on the court for a long time, someone whose opinions you don't really know completely, but you kind of get a sense of his general philosophy." (Fox News' "Hannity & Colmes," 7/20/05)
Giuliani "Joined A Group Of Former U.S. Attorneys In Backing" Alito's Nomination. "Rudy Giuliani, a potential 2008 White House contender, joined a group of former U.S. Attorneys in backing fellow Italian-American Alito for the high court. 'He's a decent human being possessing both the intellect and the temperament to serve on the highest court in the land. He'll make a terrific Supreme Court Justice,' said … Giuliani via spokeswoman Sunny Mindel." (Deborah Orin, "Here Come Da Grudge," New York Post, 1/10/06)

In Early 2001, Giuliani Argued For Tax Cuts As Best Insurance Against Recession. "As other prominent Republicans, most notably President Bush, have suggested, the mayor argued that cutting taxes would be the best insurance against a recession. 'Before I came into office there was no such thing as a tax reduction,' Giuliani said, adding that a reduced tax burden is 'one of the main reasons New York City is outperforming the rest of the country.'" (Ryan McKaig, "Giuliani's Last Budget: $39.3 Billion," The Bond Buyer, 1/26/01)

"He Also Voiced General Support For Republican Gov. George Pataki In His Battle With The State Legislature Over The Budget, Saying He Shares The Belief That Lower Taxes Stimulate Economic Growth.

Giuliani Turned Budget From Crisis By Slashing Spending. "Facing a deficit projected to grow to $2.3 billion because of spending increases built in to the city's budget, Giuliani balanced the books by slashing discretionary spending, by relentlessly pushing for productivity gains from city workers, and by selling city assets. … By the time Giuliani had finished, he'd cut enough city fat not only to offset the billions in automatic spending increases but even to reduce total city spending by $680 million – the first time in nearly a half century that the city's budget shrank from one year to the next."

BACKGROUND:
MAYOR GIULIANI FULLY SUPPORTS NATIONAL CATASTROPHE FUND
Giuliani Supports Catastrophe Fund As "Federal Backstop." "Giuliani supports one of the top priorities of Crist and other Florida leaders from both parties: creation of a national fund to help cover catastrophic loses from national disasters. The idea is to spread the risk and limit the liability of insurance companies so they can provide more affordable rates. 'You should have a federal backstop for once-in-a-century catastrophes, once-in-a-decade catastrophes, these horrible things that happen,' he said. He said beneficiaries and state and local governments need to absorb some risk. Noting New York's potential vulnerability to hurricanes and the West Coast's susceptibility to earthquakes, Giuliani said such a program would be good for other parts of the country as well as Florida." (Anthony Man, "Giuliani Visits Florida," South Florida Sun-Sentinel, 12/7/07)
Mayor Giuliani Fully Supports Creation Of National Catastrophic Insurance Fund. Mayor Giuliani: "Every community in America must be prepared for natural disasters and terrorist attacks, which is why I support the creation of a National Catastrophe Insurance Fund and why I have made ensuring that every community in America is prepared for terrorist attacks and natural disasters one of my 12 Commitments to the American People. … Right now, many people in states like Florida, California and Louisiana find it difficult to purchase insurance for catastrophic natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina. It's right for the government to play a role in seeing that fair, equitable and affordable private insurance markets are open for all our citizens." (Rudy Giuliani For President, Press Release, 1/10/08)
"Former New York Mayor And GOP Presidential Hopeful Rudy Giuliani Stopped In Tallahassee On [4/4/07], Vowing To Support A National Catastrophe Fund …" (Joe Follick and Lloyd Dunkelberger, "Parliamentarianism Clogs Clarity Quest," The [Lakeland, FL] Ledger, 4/8/07)

Giuliani Said He Thought National Catastrophic Insurance Was A "Very Good Idea." QUESTION: "Can you share your thoughts on a national catastrophic insurance program?" GIULIANI: "I just talked to your Governor about that. Talked to your Governor about it many times. He's explained it to me in great detail. The Attorney General, when he was a candidate, when I supported him, I think it is a very good idea. I think it's a very good idea not just for Florida, it's a very good idea for the whole country. We all need it. You need it for hurricanes, California needs it for earthquakes, somebody else needs it for tornadoes. New York needs it for ice storms and for hurricanes. During the time I was the mayor, my governor, Governor Pataki, had to deal with two really catastrophic ice storms in northern New York. We sent him some help, he did a great job of doing it, but we need that help. The parts of the country that think it only helps Florida, I think are missing all the other natural catastrophes and disasters and maybe they are not hurricanes, but they are all the other things I mentioned." (Mayor Giuliani, Remarks To Florida Legislators, Tallahassee, FL, 4/4/07)
NATIONAL CATASTROPHE FUND WILL REDUCE INSURANCE RATES

(Editorial, "Crist Lobbies Congress," [Fort Lauderdale] Sun-Sentinel, 2/28/07)
