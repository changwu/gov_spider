    Hillary Clinton today encouraged voters to visit her campaign website to report any and all voting irregularities. Voters can report problems at www.hillaryclinton.com/pollingproblems.
"I ask all Americans to contact my campaign if they have trouble voting," said Clinton. "My volunteers and staff will make a best effort to respond and contact election authorities when appropriate. Americans should not be denied the opportunity to vote because of election problems or irregularities. All Americans deserve to have their voices heard."
