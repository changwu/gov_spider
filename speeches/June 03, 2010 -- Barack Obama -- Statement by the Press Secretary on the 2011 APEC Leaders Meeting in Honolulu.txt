    The White House is pleased to announce today that the 2011 APEC Leaders’ Meeting will take place in Honolulu on November 12 and 13, 2011. The President looks forward to welcoming his fellow APEC economy leaders to the state where he was born and to showcasing Hawaii’s rich cultural heritage and hospitality. As the President mentioned in Singapore last year when he announced that Hawaii would host the APEC Leaders’ Meeting, the United States is a Pacific nation whose economic ties to the Asia-Pacific region are strong, enduring, and critical to the prosperity of the American people.
The United States will use the opportunity of chairing APEC in 2011 to highlight the vast potential the Asia-Pacific region holds for American companies and workers, to help shape the future of Asia-Pacific's regional architecture, and to promote APEC's core mission of spurring mutually beneficial regional economic integration.
