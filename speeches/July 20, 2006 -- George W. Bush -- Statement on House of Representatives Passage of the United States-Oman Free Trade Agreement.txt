    I am pleased the House has approved our free trade agreement with Oman. This agreement will advance America's national security by strengthening our bilateral relations with a strategic friend and ally in the Middle East region. The agreement will also level the playing field for U.S. workers and businesses and will support Oman's leaders as they seek to create long-term opportunities for the Omani people. I look forward to signing this legislation and to continuing our efforts to build a Middle East free trade area.
