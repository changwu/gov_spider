    To the Congress of the United States:
In transmitting this Sixth Annual Report of the National Endowment for the Humanities, I particularly commend to your attention the new programs begun by the Endowment during fiscal year 1971. These programs, created in order to broaden the uses of the humanities by the American public, include an experimental program on a statewide basis for informal adult education in the humanities and the Jefferson Lecture on the Humanities, a national series which will bring humanistic learning directly to bear on public affairs.
These new programs and the expansion of existing programs described in this report were made possible by the strong support in increased funding given by the Congress to the Endowment at my request. Both the executive and legislative branches have now recognized that the humanities---languages, history, philosophy, literature and ethics among others--are an essential tool for restoring contemporary problems and that the Endowment can eventually place this tool within the grasp of more Americans than ever before.
Federal support of the National Endowment for the Humanities has had the desired effect of stimulating private giving and private initiative. I am therefore happy to report that in fiscal year 1971 the Endowment received a total of 517 separate gifts, about four times the number received the previous year. These gifts or pledges, amounting to $2.5 million, made it possible for the Endowment for the second year in a row to draw the full amount of Federal matching funds appropriated for that purpose.
It is my pleasure, too, to note that the Humanities Endowment's Sixth Annual Report is printed on recycled paper as a part of this Federal Agency's effort to make use of the Nation's natural resources.
