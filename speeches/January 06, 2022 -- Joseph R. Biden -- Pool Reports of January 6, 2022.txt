WH Pool Report 1
Good morning from the White House.
It's a chilly 38 degrees, with a beautiful sunrise through partly cloudy skies.
Coming up: President Biden and Vice President Harris will travel to the U.S. Capitol to mark the one-year anniversary of the 1/6 Capitol riot.
They are scheduled to deliver remarks in Statuary Hall during the program that starts at 9 a.m. ET. Their speeches will be streamed here: https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/
ICYMI: The White House has passed along this excerpt from POTUS' prepared remarks...
And so at this moment we must decide what kind of nation we are going to be.
Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm?
Are we going to be a nation where we allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed will of the people?
Are we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of lies?
We cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation.
The way forward is to recognize the truth and to live by it.
Press Secretary Jen Psaki's press briefing is scheduled for 1 p.m. ET.

WH pool report #4 
POTUS and VPOTUS entered Statuary Hall at 9:07 a.m.
VP Harris will speak first.
A large, round black stage has been placed in the middle of Statuary Hall and stage lighting has been erected. Otherwise mostly sparse. Photo of before POTUS entrance available here: https://twitter.com/elizabethcrisp/status/1479091074538909702?s=21
Again, remarks will be streamed on the White House website.

WH pool report #5
VP remarks wrapped at 9:15 am
In addition to reflecting on 1/6, she noted efforts to pass voting rights legislation.
Harris introduced Biden then walked out of Statuary Hall (with security detail) as the President began his remarks.
Biden’s remarks now underway are being streamed on the White House website.

WH pool report #6
POTUS wrapped his speech at 9:41 a.m. and exited a very quiet statuary hall.
Biden didn't mention Trump by name but stingingly rebuked the former president during speech, noting during 1/6 Trump didn't respond "for hours" as crowd attacked the Capitol on 1/6 and Trump's continued claims about the election.
"He can't accept he lost." "He's not just a former president, he's a defeated former president … there is zero proof the election results were inaccurate."
Biden: "The way forward is to recognize the truth and live by it."
Please check with transcript or playback of video as pool is standing room only and it's a bit echo-y in Statuary Hall.
