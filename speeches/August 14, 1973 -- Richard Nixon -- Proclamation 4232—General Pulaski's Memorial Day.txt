  A Proclamation

On the eleventh day of October, 1973, the people of the United States will honor the 194th anniversary of the death of Casimir Pulaski, a dedicated patriot who fought selflessly and courageously for the cause of freedom both in Poland and America. It was on October 11, 1779 that Pulaski gave his life for the infant American nation, dying in an attempt to free the city of Savannah, Georgia.
Today, in remembrance of his heroic sacrifice, we pay grateful tribute to Casimir Pulaski. As we do, we also pay tribute to all other Americans of Polish ancestry who have contributed to the greatness of America. Their energies and their devotion have been instrumental in the building of our country from our earliest years down to the present day.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Thursday, October 11, 1973, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day, and I direct the appropriate officials to display the United States flag on that day on all Government buildings.
I also invite the people of America to set aside this day for appropriate ceremonies in honor of the memory of General Casimir Pulaski and his dedication to the defense of liberty.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-eighth.

RICHARD NIXON
