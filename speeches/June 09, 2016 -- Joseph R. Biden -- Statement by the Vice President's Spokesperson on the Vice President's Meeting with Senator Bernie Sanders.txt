    In a meeting today, Vice President Biden and Senator Sanders discussed the importance of what Senator Sanders' campaign has done to focus the conversation in this country on income inequality, the corrosive influence of big money in our campaigns and the need to reform our politics. The Vice President congratulated him on energizing so many new voters and bringing them into the Democratic Party. They discussed the need for the national conversation to continue to focus on the defining fight of our time: retaining and expanding access to the middle class, and the need for the Democratic Party to continue to embrace these new voters as we work toward victory in November.
