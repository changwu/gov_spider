    Shontel Brown's primary victory last night was an important step forward toward building a better Ohio and a better America. I was proud to endorse Shontel in her primary bid for reelection because she has been a strong leader in Congress and a partner in the work to cut costs and create jobs. She is focused on solutions that will matter most to middle class and working families, such as passing legislation like the bipartisan infrastructure law. I'm proud of Shontel and her demonstrated record of fighting for the people of Ohio, and I thank her for her continued work in service to the American people.
