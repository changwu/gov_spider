    Seven years ago, like a lot of young people, Brandon Lepow got into politics because he believed he could change his country for the better. And in his time on the campaign trail and in the White House, both as a traveling aide and as a spokesman, he was tireless in that effort: hard-working, cheerful, one of the most unfailingly kind and gracious people I've had the honor to know. He was someone that any American could be proud to have working on their behalf.
Last night we lost Brandon after a long battle with leukemia. It's a testament to his dedication to others that, over the past few months, more than 50 of his White House colleagues traveled to spend time with him and support his family as he underwent treatment in Texas. We all have heavy hearts today, and all of us, Michelle and I included, share our condolences and all our support with Brandon's family, his legion of friends, and his wonderful and courageous wife Theresa. Theirs is one of the great love stories. They, in many ways, kept the rest of us going. And Theresa will always be a part of our family.
To know Brandon Lepow was to know that he didn't need to get into politics to change the world, after all. He made his 32 years count. And those of us who knew him are better for it.
