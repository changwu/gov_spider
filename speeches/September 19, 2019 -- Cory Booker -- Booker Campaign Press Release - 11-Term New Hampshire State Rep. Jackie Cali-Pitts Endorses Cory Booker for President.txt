    Following another winning debate performance and electrifying convention speech, Booker earns field-leading 83rd NH endorsement
Manchester, NH â€” New Hampshire State Representative Jackie Cali-Pitts (Portsmouth), a 21-year legislator serving her 11th term and a leader on gun violence prevention and combating climate change, today announced her endorsement of Cory Booker for president.
"After watching Cory impress on the debate stage once again, I'm proud to endorse him for president," said State Rep. Jackie Cali-Pitts. "This election is about how we come together, heal our country after years of Trump's hatred and division, and make progress on the most pressing issues facing our country, such as gun violence and climate change. Cory has a proven record of achieving real results. That's why he is the best candidate to take on these challenges, heal our country and ensure justice and opportunity for everyone."
Cali-Pitts, who first took office in 1998, is a leader on gun violence prevention, climate change, education and a number of other issues important to working families in New Hampshire. Pitts has also served as a Portsmouth School Board moderator.
Cali-Pitts is the latest state elected official to back Booker in the 2020 primary. Booker has earned a total of 83 Granite State endorsements -- more than any other 2020 candidate -- including three state senators, 13 state representatives and the state's longest-serving mayor. On Friday, state Senator Martha Hennessey became the third state senator to endorse Booker, joining state Senators Jon Morgan (Brentwood) and David Watters (Dover).
