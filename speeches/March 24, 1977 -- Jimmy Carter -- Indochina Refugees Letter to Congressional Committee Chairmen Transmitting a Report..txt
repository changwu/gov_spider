    In accordance with the provisions of the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975, I am reporting to you on the status of refugees from Cambodia and South Vietnam.
As my report to you shows, we continue to make substantial progress in the resettlement and assimilation of the Indochina refugee into American life. This quarter as in the past quarter our attention has been focused particularly on the development of marketable job skills and English language proficiency for the resettled refugee. The refugees authorized under the expanded parole program have now all entered the United States and have been placed with sponsors. Soon the great majority of refugees will be entitled to apply for permanent resident alien status, the first step toward citizenship.
I want to thank the voluntary agencies, the public and private institutions, and the many individual families that have contributed so generously to this program. I am confident that with their assistance we will bring this humanitarian effort to a successful conclusion.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
