Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Subject: Certification for Major Narcotics Producing and Transit Countries
By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 490(b)(1)(A) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, ("the Act"), I hereby determine and certify that the following major drug producing and/or major drug transit countries/territories have cooperated fully with the United States, or taken adequate steps on their own, to achieve full compliance with the goals and objectives of the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances:
The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Cambodia, China, Dominican
Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Hong Kong, India, Jamaica,
Laos, Malaysia, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela, and Vietnam.
By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 490(b)(1)(B) of the Act, I hereby determine that it is in the vital national interests of the United States to certify the following countries:
Lebanon, Pakistan, and Paraguay.
Information on these countries, as required under section 490(b)(3) of the Act, is attached.
I have determined that the following major producing and/or major transit countries do not meet the standards set forth in section 490(b):
Afghanistan, Burma, Colombia, Iran, Nigeria, and Syria.
I have made these determinations, taking into account the factors set forth in section 490 of the Act and based on the information contained in the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report of 1996. Because the performance of these countries varies, I have attached an explanatory statement in each case.
You are hereby authorized and directed to report this determination to the Congress immediately and to publish it in the Federal Register.
William J. Clinton
