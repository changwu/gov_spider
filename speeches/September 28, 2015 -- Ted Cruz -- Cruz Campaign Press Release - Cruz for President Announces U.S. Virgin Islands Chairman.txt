    HOUSTON, Texas — Continuing to build the strongest national organization in the Republican presidential field, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, today announced Max Schanfarber will serve as U.S. Virgin Islands Campaign Chairman.
"I am proud to have the support of such a well-respected leader in the Virgin Islands," said Sen. Cruz. "Max is joining a tremendous national political organization that is second to none. His experience will help ensure we compete across the country and clinch the Republican nomination."
"Sen. Cruz promises to always speak the truth and I have found that is exactly what he does. His legal background makes him uniquely qualified to bring back the rule of law to our lawless executive branch of government," said Schanfarber.
Max Schanfarber was U.S. Virgin Islands Chairman for Ron Paul in 2012 and was elected Virgin Islands delegate to the 2012 Republican National Convention where he served on the Credentials Committee. He currently sits on the GOP Executive Committee for the Virgin Islands and also served as state coordinator for Campaign for Liberty. Outside of his political work, he is a boxing ringside photographer and webmaster for 340 Boxing. Max has lived in the Virgin Islands for more than 30 years, has been married 23 years, and has three children.
