Subject: Assignment of Reporting Functions Relating to the Information Sharing Environment
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, the reporting functions of the President under subsections (h) and (j) of section 1016 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-458), as amended by the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-53) (IRTPA), are hereby assigned to the Director of National Intelligence (Director). The Director shall consult the Secretaries of State, Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, and the Attorney General in performing such functions.
Heads of departments and agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, furnish to the Director information that the Director requests to perform such functions, in the format and on the schedule specified by the Director.
The Director shall perform such functions in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to withhold information the disclosure of which could impair foreign relations, national security, the deliberative processes of the Executive, and the performance of the Executive's constitutional duties.
Any reference in this memorandum to the provision of IRTPA shall be deemed to include references to any hereafter-enacted provision of law that is the same or substantially the same as such provision.
The Director is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
George W. Bush
