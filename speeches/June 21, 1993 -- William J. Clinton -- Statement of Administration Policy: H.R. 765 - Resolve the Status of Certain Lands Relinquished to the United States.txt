    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Dooley (D) CA and four others)
The Administration supports H.R. 765.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 765 could reduce collections that offset spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary PAYGO scoring estimate is zero.
