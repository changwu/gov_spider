    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question covering the period February 1, 1999, to March 31, 1999. The previous submission covered events during December 1998 and January 1999.
The United States remains actively engaged in efforts to promote a negotiated settlement to the Cyprus dispute, under U.N. auspices and on the basis of a bizonal, bicommunal, federal solution. Secretary Albright underscored the U.S. commitment to finding a comprehensive solution to Cypriot Foreign Minister Kassoulides during their February 17 meeting in Washington.
Our efforts also continued in the region. Special Cyprus Coordinator Thomas J. Miller traveled to Turkey, Cyprus, and Greece during March 8-13, and Ambassador Brill continued discussions with the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leadership on next steps. Ambassador Miller also discussed prospects for progress with counterparts in European Union capitals and in Moscow.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
