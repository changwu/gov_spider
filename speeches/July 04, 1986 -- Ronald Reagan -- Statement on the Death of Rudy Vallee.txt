    Rudy Vallee was an American institution. A talented and creative pioneer in music, he delighted us all with his trademark raccoon coat and megaphone. His presence on the American music scene will always be remembered, and no one who saw Rudy on stage will ever forget the special magic he brought to his audiences. He was a dedicated patriot who interrupted his career to serve in the U.S. Coast Guard, and it was appropriate that Rudy's last moments were spent watching the illumination of the Statue of Liberty.
The music of Rudy Vallee will be a part of American culture for generations to come. Nancy and I will miss him and extend our deep sympathy to Eleanor and their family.
