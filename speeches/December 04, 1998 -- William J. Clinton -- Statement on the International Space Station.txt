    America has taken a bold and exciting step toward a permanent U.S. presence in space with today's launch of the first U.S.-built component of the International Space Station. A passion for discovery and a sense of adventure—both deeply rooted American qualities—spur our determination to explore new frontiers in space and spark our can-do spirit of technological determination. All Americans join me in congratulating the thousands of men and women in our space program that are transforming the dream of an orbiting space station into a reality.
