    To the Congress of the United States:
Consistent with section 502(f) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the "Act"), I am writing to inform you of my intent to designate Algeria as a beneficiary developing country and to terminate the designation of Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Bahrain, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Slovakia as beneficiary developing countries for purposes of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).
I have considered the criteria set forth in sections 501 and 502 of the Act. In light of these criteria, I have determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits to Algeria. I have also determined that Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, and Bahrain have become "high income" countries, and I therefore terminate their designation as beneficiary developing countries effective January 1, 2006. Furthermore, consistent with the Act's prohibition on designation of European Union member states as beneficiary developing countries, I am terminating such designation for the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Slovakia when they become European Union member states.
