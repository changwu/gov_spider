Steven DennisAudience likes Kasich.
Robert Draper?Remember when Kasich had awful debates in October & November? Lots of obits then. Tonight's his strongest debate by far, in a field of four.
Manu RajuSo far, Kasich's best debate — staying out of the fray, giving substantive answers. No one attacks him. But will it matter?
Frank LuntzKasich is letting the game come to him. Rubio is forcing the conflict, and it's failing him.
Guy BensonGood answer from Kasich on accomplishments. #GOPDebate
Dana PerinoGood answer from Kasich about how to manage the budget
Jon WardKasich tone a huge breath of fresh air and crowd responds
Josh KraushaarCruz and Kasich winning this debate comfortably.
West Wing ReportsKasich remains the only adult in the room — good strategy to take the high road while Larry, Moe & Curly roll around in the mud
Emily FlitterKasich hits harder than Kelly by saying people want a leader who doesn't change positions because they want someone to depend on.
Frank LuntzThe longer this goes, the higher Kasich climbs and the lower Rubio sinks with my focus group.
Frank Luntz.@JohnKasich's ISIS response "cool, calm, deliberate, effective... take care of the job and come home" hit 89%.
Josh KraushaarThis is a more disciplined Kasich, focused squarely on his message of jobs and experience.
Ben JacobsBiggest applause line of the night may have just been John Kasich saying "I'm not biting"
Kelly O'Donnell.@JohnKasich touts his experience in Congress on the budget and governing...
Yasmin Aslam?Wow, @JohnKasich steps up. Clearly an adult is on the stage. #GOPDebate
MJ LeeKasich: "We're heading up north to the place – to my turf, OK? I will win Ohio."#GOPDebate
John HarwoodPreposterous juvenile stuff makes @johnkasich, who doesn't engage in it, look good
Frank LuntzWow, @JohnKasich is having his best debate of the 2016 campaign. His balanced budget response hit 87% with my #GOPDebate group.
Josh KraushaarAfter the first 30 mins of this debate, think Kasich is closer to winning Ohio than Rubio is to winning Florida.
Hugh HewittAnd @JohnKasich reminds everyone —again, rightly— "It's not a theory for me" re balanced budget. Locking up OH
Hugh HewittBest @JohnKasich answer of all the debates
John A Brooks?9:40pm @JohnKasich JohnKasich gets 2 freaking ?'s & does more with them in his 2 mins than all 3 others combined. #Presidential #GOPDebate
Erika Harold?Kasich makes a forceful case for budgetary experience. #GOPDebate
