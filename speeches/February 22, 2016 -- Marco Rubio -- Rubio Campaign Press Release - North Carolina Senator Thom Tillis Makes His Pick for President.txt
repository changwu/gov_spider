North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis has made his pick for president, and it's Marco:
I'm supporting @marcorubio for president because he has an unmatched ability to inspire and uplift the American people.

.@marcorubio represents a bright future for the GOP & America. He'll draw new people into the party, crucial in a swing state like NC.

Tillis has something in common with Marco: They both amassed conservative records as Speaker of their state houses before joining the Senate.He helped Republicans retake the U.S. Senate in 2014 by beating Democratic incumbent Kay Hagan.
He's a major addition to the team ahead of North Carolina's primary on March 15th. Welcome to Team Marco!
