    Chicago, IL -- Below is a Statement from Senator Barack Obama on the Terrorist Attack in Yemen
"I strongly condemn today's outrageous attack on the U.S. Embassy in Yemen. I honor the embassy guards who defended the compound, and my thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. While I am thankful that no American citizens were killed, I am deeply saddened by the loss of innocent lives.
"Over seven years after 9/11, this latest attack calls on us to redouble our efforts to root out and destroy al Qaeda and its affiliates across the globe. This attack demonstrates the grave terrorist threat that exists from North Africa to Southeast Asia and around the world. This threat is made more dangerous by the sanctuary that al Qaeda has in Pakistan, which has allowed the organization to regroup, retrain, and re-establish links with operatives and affiliated groups.
"We must do more to strengthen the military, police, and intelligence capability in nations like Yemen that are on the front lines in the fight against terrorism. We need a Shared Security Partnership Program to build the infrastructure to deliver effective counter-terrorism training, and to create a strong foundation for coordinated action against al Qaeda and its affiliates. This program will provide assistance with information sharing, training, operations, border security, anti-corruption programs, technology, and the targeting of terrorist financing.
"We must also build on the successful investments in securing our embassies that were made after the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. This attack reminds us that we are all grateful for the Americans - troops and civilians - serving our country in dangerous places around the world," said Senator Barack Obama.
