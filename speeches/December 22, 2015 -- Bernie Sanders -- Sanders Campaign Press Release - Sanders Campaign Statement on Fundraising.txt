"First, we have no idea if we will raise more money this quarter than the Clinton campaign. Probably not. What we do know is that we have received more than 2.3 million contributions averaging less than $30 apiece. This is greater than any candidate in history at this point in a White House campaign. We are very gratified by that outpouring of grassroots support from middle- class and working families in this country.
"Second, while we may or may not raise more money than the Clinton campaign, what is certain is that they will have more total money because they have established super PACs which are raising money from millionaires and billionaires.
"We do agree with Robby Mook when he says in his fundraising email that "this race is close." We started this campaign at 5 percent in the polls and have made huge progress in the last seven months. According to recent polls, we may be ahead today in New Hampshire and closing the gap in Iowa. We feel we have a good chance to win both states and we are working day and night to make that happen."
