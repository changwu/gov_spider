    The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of two dozen leading Massachusetts legislators and community leaders.
"We need a leader with Hillary's ability to end the war in Iraq, provide quality, affordable health care for every American and move us towards energy independence," said State Rep. Rachel Kaprielian, who represents Middlesex County.
"Hillary has been a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform and their families. From boosting survivor benefits to expanding health care access, Hillary has stood with us and I'm proud to stand with her," said State Rep. Harold Naughton, an Army Captain who has served in Iraq and represents Worcester County.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to bring about the real change this country needs," said State Rep. William Straus, who represents Bristol and Plymouth Counties.
"Our grassroots support across Massachusetts continues to grow, and I'm honored that these community leaders are joining our effort to change America," Clinton said.
Clinton has received strong support in Massachusetts, winning the endorsements of Congressmen Jim McGovern, Richard Neal, Stephen Lynch, and Barney Frank, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, State Auditor Joe DeNucci, State Senate President Therese Murray, House Speaker Salvatore DiMasi, Suffolk County Sheriff Andrea Cabral, Boston City Council President Maureen Feeney and 30 other Massachusetts state legislators. This group of leaders will help spread Hillary Clinton's message for change throughout their communities and also support her campaign's efforts in the key early state of New Hampshire.
