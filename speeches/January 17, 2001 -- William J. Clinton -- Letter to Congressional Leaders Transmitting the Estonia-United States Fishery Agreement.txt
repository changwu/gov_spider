    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an Agreement between the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Estonia extending the Agreement of June 1, 1992, Concerning Fisheries Off the Coasts of the United States, with annex, as extended (the 1992 Agreement). The present Agreement, which was effected by an exchange of notes at Tallinn on September 7 and September 12, 2000, extends the 1992 Agreement to June 30, 2003.
In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the Republic of Estonia, I urge that the Congress give favorable consideration to this Agreement at an early date.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
