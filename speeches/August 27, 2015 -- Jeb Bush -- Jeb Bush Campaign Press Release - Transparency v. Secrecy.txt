    With the release of his ebook, Governor Bush continues to show his genuine openness and transparency. The emails weren't written with an eye toward future office. They are the earliest form of "Jeb Unfiltered," highlighting the Governor's direct connection to the people he served. Nothing was off limits, and as you can see there were some that conveyed anger and frustration, others joy and accomplishment. Above all, he used his email to stay in touch with Floridians and what mattered most to them.

One can't help but contrast this to the elusive and evasive posture of Hillary Clinton in the wake of her secret email server scandal. Her email was secret and only discovered after she left office.

  While she dodges and hides, Governor Bush has consistently chosen the path of transparency. The contrast couldn't be clearer.
