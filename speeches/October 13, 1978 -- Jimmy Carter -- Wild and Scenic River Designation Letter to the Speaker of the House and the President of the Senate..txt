    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, I am pleased to transmit a proposal to designate a 50.4-mile segment of the Illinois River within the Siskiyou National Forest in Oregon as an element of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.
This recommendation is based on a careful study by the Secretary of Agriculture and reflects the involvement of a broad spectrum of concerned government and private organizations at the national, State and local levels. Designation of this segment of the Illinois River will protect its free-flowing character and preserve its outstanding scenic and recreational values. It will also complement the adjoining Rogue Wild and Scenic River.
I, therefore, strongly concur with the Secretary's recommendation to preserve the unique and irreplaceable natural values of the Illinois River through its designation as a Wild and Scenic River, and I urge speedy Congressional approval.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
