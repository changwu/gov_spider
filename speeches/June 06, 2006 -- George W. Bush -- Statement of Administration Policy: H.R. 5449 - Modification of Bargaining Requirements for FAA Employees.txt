    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. LaTourette (R) Ohio)
The Administration strongly opposes any changes to the current impasse resolution process and therefore strongly opposes H.R. 5449. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has conducted good faith negotiations with the collective bargaining representatives of air traffic controllers over a nine-month period and in strict accordance with clear statutory procedures. Having been considered by Congress for the full 60 days provided by law, the revised terms and conditions of employment for air traffic controllers are now in effect. Changing the "ground rules" after the fact raises serious legal questions. Moreover, any legislative intervention now could increase the pay of Federal workers who are already on average the highest-paid in Government, increase pressure on the deficit, and displace funding for modernization of the air traffic control system. In addition to these concerns with the bill's effects on the current impasse resolution process, the Administration has serious concerns with H.R. 5449 sending future FAA wage disputes to binding arbitration at the Federal Service Impasses Panel. Accordingly, if a bill such as H.R. 5449 that changes or negates the impasse resolution process or the revised terms and conditions of employment were presented to the President, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.
