    As we wait to receive the final results of the Russian elections, and as our Nation prepares to celebrate our own freedom and independence, I want to recognize the historic significance of what we have seen in Russia today.
From Vladivostok to Kaliningrad, tens of millions of Russians returned to the polls to complete the process of selecting their President. The Russian people can take real pride in this extraordinary achievement. After centuries of imperial rule and decades of Communist oppression, they have asserted their right to have a voice in the decisions that affect their lives. This election process shows just how far Russia's political reform has come over the last 5 years.
The American people can take pride as well in our steady support for Russia's democratic reform. As the results are counted, we will shortly learn the choice of the Russian people. But one thing is clear: Today was a triumph for democracy in Russia.
