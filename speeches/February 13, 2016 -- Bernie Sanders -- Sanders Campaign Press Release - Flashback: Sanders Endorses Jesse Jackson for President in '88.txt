    RENO, Nev. â€” Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign released a new video today featuring the then-mayor of Burlington endorsing Rev. Jesse Jackson for president in 1988.
"Tonight many of us are going to give our support to a candidate for president who has done more than any other candidate in living memory to bring together the disenfranchised, the hungry, the poor, the workers who are being thrown out of their decent-paying jobs and the farmers who are being thrown off of their land," Sanders said as he began his speech in support of Jackson.
Jackson would go on to win the Vermont caucuses in 1988, one of the more than 10 nominating contests he won that year. Sanders also endorsed Jackson in 1984.
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to place for nomination this evening the name of one of the great leaders of our time and a man who has waged the most courageous and exciting political campaigns in the modern history of this nation," Sanders said at the conclusion of his nominating speech. "I place for nomination, with a great deal of personal pride, the name of Jesse Jackson."
