    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Nelson (D) Florida and 18 others)
The Administration does not object to House passage of H.R. 5229, but will seek two amendments in the Senate.
The first amendment would delete section 7, and related parts of sections 6 and 8, which establishes a National Remote-Sensing Committee to advise the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Department of Commerce, and other agencies on remote-sensing research and development. Existing committees currently carry out the functions contemplated for the proposed Committee. The second amendment would amend section 5, which concerns the Secretary of Commerce's authority to dispose of the capital assets (e.g., spacecraft and ground support equipment), to ensure that the Government's interest, as well as the contractor's ability to continue a commercial activity, is taken into consideration during disposal of such assets.
