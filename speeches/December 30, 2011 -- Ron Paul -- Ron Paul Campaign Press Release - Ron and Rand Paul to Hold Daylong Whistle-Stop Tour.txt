    Historic instance of a U.S. Senator campaigning for his father, a U.S. Congressman, in run-up to the consequential 2012 Iowa Caucus
ANKENY, Iowa — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul and his son U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) will conduct a daylong whistle-stop tour to energize Iowa caucus goers on the day prior to the first-in-nation voting contest.
On Monday, January 2nd the 12-term Congressman from Texas and the junior Senator from the Commonwealth of Kentucky will make five stops — ones in Polk, Scott, Linn, Black Hawk, and Cerro Gordo counties. In addition, Senator Paul on his own will kick off the day by appearing live in-studio with WHO Radio's Jan Mickelson.
"In the run-up to the Iowa Straw Poll we were privileged to witness the historic occurrence of a sitting U.S. Senator campaigning for his father, a sitting member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Now, we are seeing Senator Paul support his father on the eve of the pivotal Iowa Caucus where we are hopeful that Ron Paul achieves a strong top-three finish," said Ron Paul 2012 Iowa Chairman Drew Ivers.
