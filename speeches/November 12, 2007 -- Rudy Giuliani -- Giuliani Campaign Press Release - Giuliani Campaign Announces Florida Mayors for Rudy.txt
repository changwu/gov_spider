    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced the Florida Mayors for Rudy, a coalition of current and former mayors from across the state supporting Mayor Giuliani. Together, they will work to grow Rudy's grassroots support in Florida.
"Rudy is the only candidate prepared to help our communities succeed at all levels, from reforming the way the federal government does business to encouraging local growth," said Juan Carlos Bermudez, Mayor of Doral.
"As Mayors, we admire what Rudy did while leading New York City, and we know he's the only one who can bring similar results to the White House," said Jack McDonald, Mayor of Palm Beach.
Today's announcement of the Florida Mayors for Rudy comes as former New York City Deputy Mayors Randy Mastro and Bob Harding hosted a "Rudy Gets Results" roundtable discussion with members of the Florida campaign team. Today's event was one in a series of campaign stops being held across the country by former Giuliani Administration officials to continue sharing Rudy's record of real accomplishments as Mayor of New York City.
