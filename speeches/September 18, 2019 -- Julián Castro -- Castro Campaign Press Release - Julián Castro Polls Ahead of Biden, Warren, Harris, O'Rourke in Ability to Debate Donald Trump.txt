    New Univision poll highlights growing confidence in Secretary Castro's ability to defeat Donald Trump
SAN ANTONIO, TX (September 18, 2019) – In a new Univision poll released Wednesday, former U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary under President Obama and San Antonio Mayor, Julián Castro, was a top choice for voters in taking on Donald Trump during a general election debate. Secretary Castro also remained a top four candidate in overall vote choice, jumping four percentage points from the June Univision poll.
Following three standout debate performances, voters found that Secretary Castro was better poised than nearly every Democratic candidate to debate Donald Trump in a general election.
In overall vote choice, Secretary Castro was a top four candidate for respondents at 13%. Secretary Castro polled at 9% in overall vote choice in Univision's poll from June, highlighting his growing support with Latinx voters.
Additionally, following Secretary Castro's exchange on health care with Vice President Biden in the September debate, 64% of respondents said that "It was a debate and Castro was right to point out inconsistencies in Biden's plans to hold him accountable."
