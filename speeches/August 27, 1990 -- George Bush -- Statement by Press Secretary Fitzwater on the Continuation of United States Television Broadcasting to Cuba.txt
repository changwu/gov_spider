    The President signed on Sunday, August 26, a Presidential determination that the tests of TV Marti have demonstrated that television broadcasting to Cuba is feasible and will not cause objectionable interference with the broadcasts of domestic television licensees. Our international telecommunications commitments have been observed throughout the test period.
The President has determined that TV Marti broadcasts will continue in a manner which is consistent with our international obligations. TV Marti is an integral part of U.S. policy to provide free access to information for people who are denied that right. We regret the Cuban regime's decision to attempt to deny the free flow of information by jamming. But we recall the experience of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty in which the broadcasts were jammed for years, yet people were able to listen.
