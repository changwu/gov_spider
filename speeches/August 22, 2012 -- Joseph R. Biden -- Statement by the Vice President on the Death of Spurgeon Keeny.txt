    I was saddened to hear about the recent passing of Spurgeon M. Keeny, Jr. A distinguished nuclear arms control expert who held top positions at the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and in the White House during five administrations, Spurgeon devoted much of his career to stopping and reversing the U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms race. His tireless efforts laid the foundation upon which Washington and Moscow continue to reduce the threat of nuclear conflict. My thoughts and prayers are with Spurgeon's family.
