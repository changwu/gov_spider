    Laura and I are saddened by the death of Chairwoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones.
As a proud lifelong resident of Ohio's 11th District, she devoted her career to serving her community at both the State and national levels. She was an effective legislator who was dedicated to helping small businesses, improving local schools, expanding job opportunities for Ohioans, and ensuring that more of them have access to health care. After making history as the first African American woman elected to Congress from Ohio, the Congresswoman worked to expand the rights of all Americans. Our Nation is grateful for her service.
Our thoughts and prayers are with her son Mervyn Leroy Jones II and the rest of her family.
