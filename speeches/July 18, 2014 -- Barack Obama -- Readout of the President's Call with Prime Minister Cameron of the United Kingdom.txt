    President Obama spoke today with Prime Minister Cameron of the United Kingdom. The two discussed the shoot-down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 and agreed that an independent, full, credible, and unimpeded international investigation must begin immediately. They also agreed that all countries should do their utmost to ensure the Russian-supported separatists grant secure access to the site of the incident. The two leaders discussed the recent steps taken by the United States and the European Union to increase the costs to Russia, given its failure to take the concrete steps needed to de-escalate the situation, and reiterated the need to take further action if Russia continues to fail to take these steps.
The President and Prime Minister also discussed the situation in Gaza, agreeing that Israel has the right to take action to defend itself from unceasing terror attacks by rockets and through tunnels. They agreed on the need for a ceasefire as soon as possible, noting shared concern about the risk of further escalation and the loss of more innocent life. They also conferred about the P5+1 talks with Iran and agreed that efforts must be continued to negotiate a comprehensive agreement which assures Iran's nuclear activities are only for peaceful purposes.
