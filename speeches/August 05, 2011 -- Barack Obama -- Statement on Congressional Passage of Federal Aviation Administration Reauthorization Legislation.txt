    I'm pleased that Congress has passed an agreement which will allow tens of thousands of people to return to their jobs, rebuilding runways and working on construction projects all over America, while removing the uncertainty hanging over the jobs of thousands of hard-working FAA employees. This impasse was an unnecessary strain on local economies across the country at a time when we can't allow politics to get in the way of our economic recovery. So I'm glad that this stalemate has finally been resolved.
