    The President called Prime Minster Brown today at approximately 3:00pm. In a call that lasted about 10 minutes, the President congratulated the Prime Minister on his speech to Congress and expressed his appreciation for a very productive visit. The President also thanked the Prime Minister for the gifts he presented to him: a pen holder carved from the timbers of the HMS Gannet, which was a sister ship of the HMS Resolute, and first edition biography of Winston Churchill. The President noted that the pen set is being displayed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office and the books are in the President's personal study adjoining the Oval Office. The President and the Prime Minister discussed that the First Lady and Mrs. Brown had a warm and personal visit, as well. The President closed the conversation by stating that he looked forward to seeing the Prime Minister in London in early April.
