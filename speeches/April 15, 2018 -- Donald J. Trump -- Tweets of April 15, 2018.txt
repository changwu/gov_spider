Unbelievably James Comey states that Polls where Crooked Hillary was leading were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe. In other words he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win and he wanted a job. Slimeball!Retweets: 27603Favorites: 106702

The big questions in Comey's badly reviewed book aren't answered like how come he gave up Classified Information (jail) why did he lie to Congress (jail) why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn't they TAKE it) why the phony memos McCabe's $700000 & more?Retweets: 27729Favorites: 101235

Comey throws AG Lynch 'under the bus!' Why can't we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch? Was she promised a Supreme Court seat or AG in order to lay off Hillary. No golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)!Retweets: 26569Favorites: 102051

The Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out with such precision that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term 'Mission Accomplished.' I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term it should be brought back. Use often!Retweets: 24048Favorites: 115575

I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His 'memos' are self serving and FAKE!Retweets: 22395Favorites: 102330

Attorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past. I have many (too many!) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices and even homes are going to be raided with everything including their phones and computers taken. All lawyers are deflated and concerned!Retweets: 24019Favorites: 103035

Slippery James Comey a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!) will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history by far!Retweets: 22407Favorites: 99162

Just hit 50% in the Rasmussen Poll much higher than President Obama at same point. With all of the phony stories and Fake News it's hard to believe! Thank you America we are doing Great Things.Retweets: 29754Favorites: 141548
