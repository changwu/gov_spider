Today, Newt 2012 launched the "Romney Record" Facebook timeline to highlight Governor Romney's long history of being a liberal, out-of-touch Republican.

The Romney Record Timeline features "highlights" such as Mitt Romney's 2009 oped in USA Today in which he recommends an individual mandate for health insurance on the national level, endorsing radical leftist Rocky Anderson, breaking his promise not to raise taxes as Governor, and rejecting the Contract with America.
It also features recent out of touch "hits" from Romney such as his comment that he "does not care about the poor" and his classic $10,000 attempted bet with Governor Perry.
"Governor Romney has a long history as a liberal Massachusetts Republican who is out of touch with the concerns of the working conservative base of the Republican Party.Â  And now voters can track his liberal and out-of-touch record on Facebook," said Newt 2012 Communications Director Joe DeSantis.
