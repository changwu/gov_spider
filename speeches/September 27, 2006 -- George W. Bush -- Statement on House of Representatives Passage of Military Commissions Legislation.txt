    Earlier this month, I discussed with the American people a CIA program that has proven to be one of our most effective tools in the war on terror. Under this program, suspected terrorists have been detained and questioned about threats against our country. Because a Supreme Court decision put the future of this program in question, I asked Congress to provide legislation to save this important tool.
Today the House passed legislation that would allow this vital program to continue and help keep our country safe. The "Military Commissions Act of 2006" addresses the Supreme Court's ruling regarding the application of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and clarifies the standards for U.S. personnel who detain and question unlawful enemy combatants. The act also creates a comprehensive statutory structure for military commissions so that we can prosecute suspected terrorists.
I appreciate the House's commitment to strengthening our national security. I urge the Senate to act quickly to get a bill to my desk before Congress adjourns.
