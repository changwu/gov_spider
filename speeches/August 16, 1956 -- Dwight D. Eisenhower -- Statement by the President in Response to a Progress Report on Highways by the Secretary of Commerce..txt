    I HAVE RECEIVED a progress report on highways from Sinclair Weeks, Secretary of Commerce.
I am pleased to learn that general programming of Interstate System projects since the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 became law now exceeds $800 million.
The States have already been authorized to proceed with advertising for bids on Interstate System projects costing over $36 million since the new highway legislation was approved on June 29.
One State, Missouri, has already awarded contracts totaling nearly $4 million for Interstate System improvements, utilizing both old and new funds available.
I am gratified to observe the initial speed with which this important program is developing. I am hopeful that the States will continue to move swiftly in advancing final project applications for construction. Prompt State action will help alleviate the great deficiencies in our highway systems and will convert the Federal fund authorizations into usable roads at the earliest possible time.
