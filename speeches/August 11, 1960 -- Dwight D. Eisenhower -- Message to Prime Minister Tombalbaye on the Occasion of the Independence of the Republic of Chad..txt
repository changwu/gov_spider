    Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
On the occasion of the independence of the Republic of Chad, I extend in my own name and on behalf of the United States most cordial greetings and felicitations to you and the people of Chad.
The accession to independence of the Republic of Chad is a source of great satisfaction to the United States especially since it was achieved in friendly cooperation with France.
The development of democratic traditions under your leadership at the Crossroads of Africa is encouraging for the future of Chad.
On this historic day, the Government and people of the United States look forward to close and friendly relations with the Government and people of Chad.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
