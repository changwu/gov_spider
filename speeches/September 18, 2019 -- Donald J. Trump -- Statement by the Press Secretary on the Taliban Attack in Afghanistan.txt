    The United States strongly condemns the Taliban's cowardly attacks against the Afghan people. Today's bombing of the election rally in Parwan province killed nearly 30 Afghan civilians, including women and children, while the suicide attack in Kabul near the Afghan Ministry of Defense and U.S. Embassy compound killed more than 20 Afghans. The President has made clear that he will not negotiate a peace agreement while the Taliban continues such attacks.
