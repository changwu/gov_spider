The President will veto H.R. 125 or any other legislation repealing the ban on assault weapons.
The current ban on assault weapons does not affect hunting or sporting firearms. It is a sensible anti-crime measure that protects our Nation's citizens and law enforcement officers from violent criminals who, for too long, have had access to ever-increasing firepower. Repealing the ban against these weapons would weaken efforts to reduce violent crime and would expose law enforcement officers and the public to greater violence from criminals armed with high-powered, military-style weaponry.
