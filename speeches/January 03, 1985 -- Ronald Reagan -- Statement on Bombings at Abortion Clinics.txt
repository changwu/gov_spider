    During the past few months there has been a series of bombings at abortion clinics throughout the country. I condemn, in the strongest terms, those individuals who perpetrate these and all such violent, anarchist activities. As President of the United States, I will do all in my power to assure that the guilty are brought to justice. Therefore, I will request the Attorney General to see that all Federal agencies with jurisdiction pursue the investigation vigorously.
