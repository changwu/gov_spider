    To Don Tucker
I wish to express to you my sincere and deep felt appreciation for your willingness to serve in my Administration as a member and Vice Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board.
Nevertheless, I understand the reasons which you have given for your request that I now withdraw your nomination for this position. I will honor your request.
I have complete confidence in your competence and integrity, and regret that our nation will be deprived of your good services.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
