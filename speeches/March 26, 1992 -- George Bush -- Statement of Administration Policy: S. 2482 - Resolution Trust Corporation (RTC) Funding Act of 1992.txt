    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Riegle (D) MI)
The Administration strongly supports prompt passage of S. 2482, which would provide the RTC with the funds it needs to protect depositors and continue the resolution of failed thrifts. The Administration would prefer that its full request of $55 billion be provided to ensure the completion of the process of resolving failed institutions.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
Full funding of the deposit insurance guarantee is exempt from pay-as-you-go under the provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). The provision requiring continuation of health insurance coverage is not exempt under OBRA but is not scored because it is subject to future appropriations action.
