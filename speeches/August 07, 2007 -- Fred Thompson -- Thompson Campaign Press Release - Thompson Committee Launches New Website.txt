    Nashville, Tenn. -- The Fred Thompson testing the waters committee announced that it launched an upgrade and redesign of its website www.imwithfred.com today.
The website will allow Americans to show their support for a potential Fred Thompson presidential bid as he continues to travel the country.
The Friends of Fred Thompson committee has been a leader in using interactive tools to communicate with a fast-growing list of friends and supporters. The new website will build on those tools to create a community of Americans who share Thompson's vision for America.
The newly revised action center creates more tools for web visitors to show their support for Thompsonâ€”tools such as organizing local community events, voter registration information, and ways to share information with friends and supporters.
The website also has a "FredCast" section that will let visitors experience Thompson's public events and messages. In "Principles," supporters will be able to hear Thompson speak on a range of issues that make up the core principles that are the foundation of our country.
Thompson is enjoying a broad base of support all across the country. This website will allow even more Americans to learn about his experience and his values and sign up to join this dynamic and groundbreaking effort to urge Thompson to run for president.
