This week, I had the great pleasure of having my kids join me on the campaign trail. I hadn't seen them in a while, and it was great to have them alongside me.
But the most important part was that it reminded me once again what's at stake here in New Hampshire, in less than 72 hours: We are literally deciding what kind of country we will be like when they're my age, what kind of country they'll be able to raise their families in.
That's why I'm asking you for your vote: If you vote for me, we will unite this party.
We will grow the conservative movement, we will defeat Hillary Clinton, and we will leave our children what our parents left us: the single greatest nation in the history of mankind.
