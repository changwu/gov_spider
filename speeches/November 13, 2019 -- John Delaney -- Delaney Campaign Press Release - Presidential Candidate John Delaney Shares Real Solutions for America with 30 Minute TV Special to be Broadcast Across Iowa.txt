    DES MOINES, IA — On the eve of Delaney's 40th trip to Iowa as a candidate for President, the Delaney campaign has purchased 30-minute program blocks on TV stations from Davenport to Sioux City for Delaney's 'Real Solutions' TV special. The 30-minute program was filmed at Delaney's home in Maryland, as well as segments in Iowa and New Hampshire and will broadcast across Iowa on Sunday, November 17th.
"Our campaign hasn't ever been about sound bites, so we're excited to be the first this cycle to offer a long-form program that goes in-depth with solutions and not just empty promises. When Iowans have the time to listen to my personal story and message they learn that I have real solutions to health care, the climate crisis, bringing jobs to rural Iowa and more so I encourage folks to tune in and learn more about our unifying message which is based on facts – not slogans or catchphrases," said John Delaney.
The TV special premieres in Iowa and will be broadcast statewide on November 17th. Additional broadcasts will run until the caucuses. Program times will be listed at johndelaney.com/solutions with digital and traditional media promoting the schedule.
The participating Iowa television stations on Nov 17th are KTVO Ottumwa, WQAD Quad Cities, Rochester KTTC, Sioux City KCAU, Omaha KETV, Cedar Rapids KWWL, and Des Moines WHO.
Delaney returns to Iowa November 20th and 21st to continue his Heartland StartUp Tour. On November 20th, Delaney will be speaking with the Youth Entrepreneur Workshop in Burlington, followed the next day by a town hall at Nationwide Insurance in Des Moines and a visit to the Wind Turbine Tech training facility at Iowa Lakes Community College in Estherville. Delaney will finish the trip with an invitation-only '40th Trip Party' at Fox Brewing in West Des Moines.
