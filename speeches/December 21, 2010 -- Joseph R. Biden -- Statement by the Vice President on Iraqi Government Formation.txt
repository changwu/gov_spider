    Today, Iraq's political leaders delivered what Iraq's people deserved and expected: an inclusive, national partnership government that reflects the results of Iraq's elections.
I especially want to congratulate Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Iraqiyya leader Ayad Allawi and Kurdistan Regional Government President Massoud Barzani for the hard work and wise leadership that has brought Iraq to this promising moment.
There are many challenges ahead, but I am convinced Iraq is up to them. The United States stands ready to help and to strengthen even more the important partnership we have built.
