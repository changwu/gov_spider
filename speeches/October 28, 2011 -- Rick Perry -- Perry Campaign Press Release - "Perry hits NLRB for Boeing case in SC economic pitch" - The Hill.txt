    Earlier this week, Gov. Rick Perry unveiled his plan to Cut, Balance and Grow, his second major policy rollout that will help get America working again.
He announced Cut, Balance and Grow in South Carolina, where the Obama Administration's National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has waged devastating war on jobs. Gov. Perry highlighted parts of his plan that would reverse Obama's job-killing policies:
Rick Perry targeted the National Labor Relations Board on Tuesday as he unveiled his economic plan in South Carolina.
The NLRB has filed a complaint against Boeing for launching a new plant in Charleston, S.C. It accuses the airplane manufacturer of locating in South Carolina instead of near its existing facilities in Seattle in retaliation for strikes by union members in Washington.
The issue has become a rallying point for Republicans, particularly in South Carolina, and Perry joined the GOP chorus of opposition in his speech in Greenville, S.C.
"When federal agencies like the NLRB are dictating to companies where they can create jobs and where they cannot, they have overstepped their bounds and undermined our free-market system," he said in remarks prepared for delivery at the ISO Poly Films company in Greenville.
"On my first day in office, I will freeze all pending federal regulations and immediately begin a review of all new regulations since January of 2008," Perry continued.
Perry called his economic plan, which includes a 20 percent flat tax, a "Cut, Balance and Grow" plan.
A big part of the five-part plan is limited regulations.
"The federal nanny state's heavy-handed regulations are keeping our economy in the ditch," Perry said Tuesday. "It is time to review and scrap regulations that harm jobs and growth."
