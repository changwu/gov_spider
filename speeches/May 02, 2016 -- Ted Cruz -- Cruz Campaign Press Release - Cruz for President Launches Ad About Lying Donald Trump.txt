    HOUSTON, Texas - Today, the Cruz for President campaign launched a new ad, "Lying," that will air in Indiana. The ad corrects the lie Donald Trump has been using: Cruz voted against TPA, is fighting to stop TPP, and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill. In contrast, Donald Trump has a substantial judgment against him for hiring illegal aliens and still brings in hundreds of foreign workers to replace Americans.


"Lying"
TV :30
CRUZ: I'm Ted Cruz and I approve this message.
ANNOUNCER: Donald Trump is lying about Ted Cruz. Cruz voted against TPA and is fighting to stop TPP.
Cruz stopped the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, while Trump funded the Gang of Eight with fifty thousand dollars in campaign contributions.
Trump also had a one-million-dollar judgment against him for hiring illegals.
And Trump still brings in hundreds of foreign workers to replace Americans.
What a phony.
