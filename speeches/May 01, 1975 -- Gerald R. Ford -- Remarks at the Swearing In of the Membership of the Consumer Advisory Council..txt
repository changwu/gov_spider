    Mrs. Knauer, members of and prospective members of the consumer advisory group:
Let me congratulate you, Virginia, and those that have worked with you and to wish the new members well in their responsibilities, which I think are very important, as we continue the efforts that have been made, hopefully to expand them, to make sure, to make positive that the consumer is given the maximum protection by all agencies of the Federal Government.
There is, of course, in my opinion, two very critical areas where the consumer needs help: one, price; and two, quality. And quality, of course, covers a very wide range.
I have asked Mrs. Knauer, with the help of this advisory group, to work with all departments of the Federal Government. Each department, with her help and assistance, will have within it a very important responsibility--that of helping the consumer. She, of course, can get from this distinguished group the kind of advice that is needed and necessary in order to make the Government's operation a successful one from the point of view of the consumer.
I have great faith in Mrs. Knauer. I believe this advisory group will contribute significantly.
And so, it's a privilege and a pleasure for me at this time to ask Mr. Ratchford to come forth and swear in the five new members of the Consumer Advisory Council.
Mr. Ratchford.
