    In a CNBC interview that aired today, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy warned that a failure to raise the debt ceiling could result in a BIG hit to U.S. consumer confidence and confidence in businesses â€” hurting the financial bottom line of middle-class families.

Jassy added that the debt ceiling issue comes after the U.S. government has "had to spend at unprecedented levels to keep our citizens safe" amid the coronavirus pandemic.
