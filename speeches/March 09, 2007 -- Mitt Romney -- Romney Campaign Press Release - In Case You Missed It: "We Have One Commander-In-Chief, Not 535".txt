LAURA INGRAHAM: "Nancy Pelosi and David Obey and other Democrats were up on Capitol Hill yesterday, Governor Romney, and they were attempting to lay out their plan for Iraq and it involves 180-day time periods with a need to show progress by a certain date. And by the end of it, it seemed like all of them were confused but the one thing is clear is that they want most of the troops out by sometime in the spring of '08. Your reaction?"
GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: "Well, there's no question we all want to see our troops home as soon as we can possibly have them home. But we have to recognize that if we bring them home too quickly or in a way which leads to a collapse of the country or perhaps the Iranians grabbing the Shia south or Al-Qaeda playing a dominating role among the Sunnis or a Kurdish population destabilizing the border with Turkey, you could then end up with a regional conflict which would cause Americans to somehow have to get involved again â€“ this time at a much more ugly situation with more casualties.
"And so the right course is to allow our national military to be managed by a Commander-in-Chief. And we have one Commander-in-Chief, not 535. And Nancy Pelosi's effort to link spending which is necessary for our citizens to the management of the war is really a very unsatisfactory course. I mean frankly she's trying to exploit the needs of our citizens to allow herself to be insinuated into the conduct of the war. And that is not the right course for managing the war."
