Talks with China continue in a very congenial manner - there is absolutely no need to rush - as Tariffs are NOW being paid to the United States by China of 25% on 250 Billion Dollars worth of goods & products. These massive payments go directly to the Treasury of the U.S.......Retweets: 2637Favorites: 10037

....The process has begun to place additional Tariffs at 25% on the remaining 325 Billion Dollars. The U.S. only sells China approximately 100 Billion Dollars of goods & products a very big imbalance.

Tariffs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind. Also much easier & quicker to do. Our Farmers will do better faster and starving nations can now be helped. Waivers on some products will be granted or go to new source!Retweets: 1747Favorites: 7112
