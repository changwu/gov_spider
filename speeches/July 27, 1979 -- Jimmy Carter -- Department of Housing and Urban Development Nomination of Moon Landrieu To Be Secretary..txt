    The President will nominate Moon Landrieu, former mayor of New Orleans, as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
The President said, "Mayor Landrieu enjoys a national reputation as a progressive mayor and strong administrator, as well as a respected and effective spokesman for local government. His service at the Department of Housing and Urban Development will be a contribution to this administration and to the country. He enjoys my full confidence and support, and I am confident that he will build upon the outstanding record of Secretary Harris."
