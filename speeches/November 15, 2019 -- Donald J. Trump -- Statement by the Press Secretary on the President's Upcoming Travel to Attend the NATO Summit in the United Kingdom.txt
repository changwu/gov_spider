    President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will travel to the United Kingdom from December 2 to 4, 2019, to attend the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Leaders Meeting and a reception hosted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. Seventy years after its founding, NATO remains the most successful Alliance in history, guaranteeing the security, prosperity, and freedom of its members. President Trump looks forward to meeting with the other NATO Heads of State and government to review the Alliance's unprecedented progress on burden-sharing, including adding more than $100 billion in new defense spending since 2016. The President will also emphasize the need for the NATO Alliance to ensure its readiness for the threats of tomorrow, including those emanating from cyberspace, those affecting our critical infrastructure and telecommunications networks, and those posed by terrorism.
