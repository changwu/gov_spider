Rob Finnerty: Senator, you've been really vocal about the Fend Off Fentanyl Act, to get people off Fentanyl. I just want to know what you make of the fact that cocaine was found at the White House six days later in one of the most secure buildings in the country. We still apparently have no idea who brought it in there. What do you make of that?
Tim Scott: Well, I heard that they were going to conclude their investigation sometime soon. I have to say this, Rob, you have to start an investigation to conclude an investigation. Here's what we know today about the people's house, not Biden's White House, but our house today, it is not secure. You cannot have substance – What if it was anthrax? The security risk associated with not being able to find where the cocaine comes from is a problem. Think about the judgment that we're seeing out of the White House, whether it was during Pride month, topless women parading around the White House. And now cocaine sitting around and think about the most important quality that binds it all together, the lack of leadership. This president reminds us of the dereliction of duty that we see everyday, whether it is our southern border, whether it's the White House and cocaine, whether it's with China, whether it's crime in the middle of our streets, whether it's inflation that we can't afford. This president lacks leadership.
