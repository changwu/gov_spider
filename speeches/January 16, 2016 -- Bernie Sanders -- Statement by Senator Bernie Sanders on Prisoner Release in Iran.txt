    BURLINGTON, Vt. â€” U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday welcomed news reports that Iran had freed four dual-nationality U.S. and Iranian prisoners.
"This good news shows that diplomacy can work even in this volatile region of the world," Sanders said.
U.S. officials reportedly had signaled that a prisoner deal would be separate from Saturday's expected "implementation" of a nuclear agreement with Iran.
