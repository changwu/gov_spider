    Today I have signed into law H.R. 2647, the "Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2002."
The Act provides Fiscal Year 2002 appropriations for the Congress, the Congressional Budget Office, the Architect of the Capitol, the General Accounting Office, the Government Printing Office, and the Library of Congress.
My Administration appreciates that the Congress has worked expeditiously during this difficult and trying time in our Nation's history to consider the Fiscal Year 2002 appropriations bills. Now, through a renewed sense of bipartisanship, the Congress and the Administration must work together to ensure the timely enactment of the remaining bills.
GEORGE W. BUSH
The White House, November 12, 2001.
