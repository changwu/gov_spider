March 12, 2016
As Marco's supporters show up in force to vote on Vote Early Day in Florida, he's been barnstorming the state ahead of Tuesday's primary.
On Saturday, supporters crammed into a barbeque restaurant in New Port Richey, outside of Tampa:

In Lakeland, a stop-in at a coffee shop drew another packed house:

Marco also stopped at the Oxford Exchange in Tampa, an iconic local coffee shop.
If you can spot it, a portrait of President Reagan was hanging above Marco as he gave his remarks!

Marco is going to continue working hard to make sure that voters know he is the only choice in Florida on March 15th to defeat Donald Trump.
Florida awards all 99 of its delegates to whoever wins on Tuesday, so every single vote counts!
