    In my radio address last week, I asked the Attorney General to recommend what constitutional steps I could take to ensure that guns are kept away from our children's schools. The Attorney General has responded to my request, and next week I will submit legislation to Congress that will put the gun-free school zones act on firm constitutional ground. This legislation is the most straightforward option available and must be acted on immediately. I am determined to keep guns away from schools and am committed to working with the Congress to make our schools safe havens where young people can learn and grow free from harm.
