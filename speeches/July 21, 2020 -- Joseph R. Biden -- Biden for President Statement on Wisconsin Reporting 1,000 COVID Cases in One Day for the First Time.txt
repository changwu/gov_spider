    Today, more than 1,000 new daily COVID-19 cases were reported for the first time in Wisconsin -- the highest daily record for confirmed cases. Biden for President Wisconsin State Director Danielle Melfi released the following statement:
"Today's grim record is yet another tragic reminder of Donald Trump's failure to mount a coherent response to this pandemic and to protect the people of Wisconsin. At nearly every turn, Trump and Republicans in the Wisconsin state legislature have undermined the advice of public health officials and Governor Evers' efforts to keep people safe -- and we're all paying the price. Wisconsinites deserve a leader in the Oval Office with the experience and empathy to steer us out of this crisis and help us build back better -- that's Joe Biden."
