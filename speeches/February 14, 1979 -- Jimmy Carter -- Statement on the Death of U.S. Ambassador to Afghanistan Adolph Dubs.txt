    I am shocked and saddened by the murder of Ambassador Adolph Dubs in Kabul this morning. The act of brutality which took his life has deprived our Nation of one of its most able public servants.
Throughout his distinguished career in the Foreign Service, Ambassador Dubs took on difficult and challenging jobs, performing them with exemplary dedication and skill. He died as he lived—in the service of his country—and the manner of his death redoubles our dedication to the struggle against the kind of senseless violence which took his life. My thoughts and prayers are with the family of Ambassador Dubs.
