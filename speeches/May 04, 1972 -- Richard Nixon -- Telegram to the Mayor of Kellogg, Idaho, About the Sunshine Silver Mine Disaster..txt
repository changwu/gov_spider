    THE TRAGIC loss of life that resulted from the fire at the Sunshine Mine profoundly touched the hearts of all Americans. On their behalf, I want to extend my deepest sympathy to the families struck by this disaster.
I have directed both the Secretary of the Interior and the Office of Emergency Preparedness to keep me closely informed on the recovery work in the area, and to insure that the full spectrum of Federal assistance is made available to the people of your community. I join all those who pray that God may give your community the special strength to persevere through this difficult time.
