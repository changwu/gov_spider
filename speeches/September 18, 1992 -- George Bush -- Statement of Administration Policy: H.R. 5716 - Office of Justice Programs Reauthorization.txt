    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 9/21/92)(House)(Schumer (D) New York and Hughes (D) New Jersey)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 5716 but will seek Senate amendments to:

Reorganize the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) as proposed by the Administration's OJP reauthorization bill. The reforms contained in the Administration's bill will improve coordination of criminal justice efforts. They will also remove the Bureau of Justice Statistics from OJP and give it an independent status similar to that of other Federal statistical agencies.
Reauthorize OJP for four years. H.R. 5716 only reauthorizes OJP for two years.
