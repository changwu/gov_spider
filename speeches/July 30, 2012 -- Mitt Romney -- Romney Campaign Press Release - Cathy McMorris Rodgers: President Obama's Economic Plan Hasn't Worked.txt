    Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers today made the following statement on President Obama's claim that his economic policies have "worked":
"While President Obama continues pushing for job-killing policies — including higher taxes, massive deficit spending and more regulations on small-business owners — incomes have fallen, energy costs have risen and the unemployment rate has remained above 8 percent for 41 months in a row. The anemic 1.5 percent GDP growth reported last week only further underscores the fact that the President's economic plan hasn't worked. Middle-class Americans will continue to struggle unless we replace Barack Obama with Mitt Romney, who has a proven record of private-sector job creation and whose policies will put Americans back to work and build a stronger middle class."
