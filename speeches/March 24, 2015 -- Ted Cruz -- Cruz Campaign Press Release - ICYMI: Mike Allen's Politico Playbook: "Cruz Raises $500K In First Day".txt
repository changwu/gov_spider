    LAUNCH FAR EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS
"A little bird tells Playbook that Senator Cruz raised $500,000 in his first day – 60% from major donors, including last night's New York fundraiser, and 40% online. His savvy launch far exceeded expectations, and surprised Republicans of all stripes — even rival campaigns." – Mike Allen, Politico Playbook
CRUZ STRONGER THAN THE LAST TWO IOWA WINNERS
"But Cruz's 25-min. speech with no notes was impressive. One well-wired Republican called us out of the blue to say that he had been paying no attention to Cruz, but suddenly realized how much stronger he is than the last two Republican winners of Iowa – Santorum and Huckabee. By going first, Cruz commanded the stage in a way that he never would have otherwise. Top Republicans – even ones who treat him like he has leprosy — predict that he'll be one of the last candidates standing." – Mike Allen, Politico Playbook
