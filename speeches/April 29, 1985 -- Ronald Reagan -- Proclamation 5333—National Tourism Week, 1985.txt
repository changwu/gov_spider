  A Proclamation

Travel has long been recommended as a way to broaden the mind and refresh the spirit. But in previous ages, travel was often hazardous and difficult. The rewards of a romantic adventure could sometimes be more than overbalanced by the dangers a traveler might encounter along the way.
Today, the travel and tourism sector of our economy constitutes the second largest retail industry in the United States. The benefits of travel remain as enticing as ever, but the hazards and dangers have largely disappeared. Americans who want to travel abroad can experience the tremendous diversity of the world's cultures on group excursions or on individually designed tours.
Many Americans, however, are choosing to remain near home and explore the natural beauties and historic monuments of our own Nation. And many citizens of foreign lands are joining them in discovering that America's rich history and scenic wonders make it an excellent place to take a vacation.
The Congress, by Public Law 98-424 of September 25, 1984, has designated the week beginning May 19, 1985, as "National Tourism Week" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 19, 1985, as National Tourism Week. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and ninth.

RONALD REAGAN
