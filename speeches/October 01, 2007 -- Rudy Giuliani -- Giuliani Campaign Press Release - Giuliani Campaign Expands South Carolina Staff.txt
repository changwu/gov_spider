    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced additions to its South Carolina campaign. Team Rudy adds Regional Field Directors Sarah Bjorkman and Tim O'Toole to its field staff.
Bjorkman will focus on organizing the Lowcountry, while O'Toole will be working in the Upstate. They join other field staff working to build a strong grassroots network in communities across the state, grow the volunteer base and communicate Mayor Giuliani's optimistic message to the voters of South Carolina.
"Mayor Giuliani's message of conservative-driven leadership and results-oriented accountability is resonating with South Carolinians," said Ryan Meerstein, Giuliani's South Carolina Executive Director. "We're happy to have Sarah and Tim join our hard-working and dedicated team in South Carolina."
Today's announcement is the first of several upcoming South Carolina staff additions.
