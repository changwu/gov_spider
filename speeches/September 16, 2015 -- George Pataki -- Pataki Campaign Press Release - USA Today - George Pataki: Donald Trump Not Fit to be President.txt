George Will recently wrote that Trump is "an affront to anyone devoted to…making conservatism intellectually respectable and politically palatable."
None other than Abraham Lincoln noted that if the Know-Nothings ever took power, the Declaration of Independence would have to be amended to say that all men are created equal "except negroes, and foreigners, and Catholics." Donald Trump is rehashing that fear of foreigners again. He is appealing to the worst in Americans, instead of the best.
Trump's ideas are about Trump alone — about him and his future reality show ratings, not about conservative principles. His half-baked plan to send police into small businesses, farms and homes around America to forcibly deport millions, including millions of American citizens born here, here is an invitation to a government so large that it would and should scare all true conservatives. Deporting over 11 million people in America would result in a massive, intrusive police state.
Trump's proposal to end birthright citizenship is equally distasteful. The answer to illegal immigration is to secure our border, deport criminals and control our visa program not make innocent babies and children criminals.
