    To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to submit to the Congress the Twenty-Fifth Annual Report of the National Science Foundation, covering fiscal year 1975.
Science and Technology have dramatically benefited our Nation and the world. During the NSF's first 25 years of operation, research supported by the National Science Foundation--particularly basic research in universities--has contributed much to our Nation's progress in science and technology. I expect the Foundation to continue this valuable contribution.
As this Annual Report shows, the programs of the National Science Foundation in 1975 addressed both the important search for new scientific knowledge and its use in solving society's pressing problems. Also, these programs continued to assist in meeting the Nation's need to train tomorrow's scientists and engineers. I commend this report to your attention.
My 1977 Budget now before the Congress recognizes the important role played by the National Science Foundation and assigns high priority to increases in Federal support of basic research. I urge Congressional approval of the proposed budget increases in the National Science Foundation.
