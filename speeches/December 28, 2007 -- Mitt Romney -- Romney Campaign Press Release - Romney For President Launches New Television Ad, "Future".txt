Boston, MA – Today, Romney for President launched its newest television ad, "Future." The ad highlights the choice Republicans will have to make when it comes to strengthening our country. Senator McCain opposed strengthening our economy through lower taxes. He has pushed legislation allowing every illegal immigrant to stay in the United States. Governor Romney took a different course. He cut taxes and spending in Massachusetts. He has consistently opposed amnesty for illegal immigrants. On election day, Republicans will have a choice between two very different records and visions for our future.
The ad will begin airing today as part of the campaign's rotation in New Hampshire. Script and viewing links are below.
