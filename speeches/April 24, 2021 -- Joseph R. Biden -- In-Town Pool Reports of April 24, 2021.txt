In town pool report #1 -- good morning
Good morning to all on a glorious, sunny morning from the White House. I'll be your print pooler for this morning's departure. President Biden and first lady Jill Biden are scheduled to depart the White House from the Ellipse for Wilmington at 10:10am. Pool has been called to gather at the stakeout location at 9:40am.
Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions for me.

In town pool report #2
The motorcade pulled up to the Ellipse at 10:07am. POTUS and FLOTUS got out of the car about a minute later and walked to Marine One without stopping to talk to reporters, who were staged a good distance away. A few aides walked behind them — your pooler could not identify the travelers. Marine One lifted off for JBA at 10:13am.
Handing off to travel pool.
