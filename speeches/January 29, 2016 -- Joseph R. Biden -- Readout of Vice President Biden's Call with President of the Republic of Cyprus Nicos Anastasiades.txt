    Vice President Biden called President of the Republic of Cyprus Nicos Anastasiades today to follow up on their meeting on the margins of the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this month. The Vice President briefed President Anastasiades on his positive discussions with Turkish officials on finding a settlement to reunify Cyprus as a bizonal, bicommunal federation. President Anastasiades updated the Vice President on the tripartite meeting in Nicosia yesterday between Greek, Cypriot, and Israeli leaders, which the leaders agreed was a positive step for regional cooperation and security. Vice President Biden and President Anastasiades agreed on the importance of achieving a Cyprus settlement, and the Vice President pledged continued U.S. support to help both sides reach a successful agreement.
