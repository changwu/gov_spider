    Q. Mr. President, are there any conditions that would be met that you would be able to end the U.S. embargo on Cuba?
The President. We've had the press conference. [Laughter]
I support the Torricelli bill, as you know. I did when it was passed, and I still do. But I said before, I could just reiterate what I said again: We all hope that there will come a time when democracy and an open economy will come to Cuba. And it will be a cause of enormous celebration in this country when it happens.
