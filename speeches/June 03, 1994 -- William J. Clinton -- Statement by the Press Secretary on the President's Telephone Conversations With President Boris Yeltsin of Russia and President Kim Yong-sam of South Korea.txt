    President Clinton spoke separately today with President Yeltsin and President Kim Yong-sam of the Republic of Korea, who is currently in Moscow. The topic of both calls was the current situation in North Korea.
President Clinton told President Yeltsin that following the IAEA's report to the United Nations that the continuity of safeguards had been broken, the United States is pursuing the issue of sanctions in the United Nations Security Council. They discussed President Yeltsin's proposal that an international forum on the Korean situation be convened. President Clinton said that such a meeting might be appropriate at some point while underscoring the need first to return the North Korean nuclear issue to the United Nations Security Council. The two agreed to remain in close contact as the issue develops.
In the conversation with President Kim, both Presidents agreed that the next step is to pursue the issue of sanctions in the United Nations Security Council. President Clinton reaffirmed the United States desire for a diplomatic resolution of this issue but emphasized the United States commitment to the security of the Republic of Korea. They, too, agreed to work closely together in addressing the issue.
