  A Proclamation

Throughout our Nation's history, individual Americans have voluntarily joined together to meet important needs in their communities. This generosity, this willingness to work together toward a common goal, is a hallmark of the American character.
Today, private voluntary associations across the country make substantial contributions to our Nation's will-being in areas such as health care and social services, education and the arts, economic development, and environmental protection. Many of these associations are community foundations -- charitable organizations formed to attract and distribute endowment funds.
Directed by volunteers, community foundations provide effective leadership in communities throughout the United States, often supplementing or assisting in the coordination of public programs and other private services. They are one of the fastest growing forms of philanthropy in the United States.
In grateful recognition of our Nation's charitable organizations and the concerned individuals who donate their time, talent, and material resources to them, the Congress, by HOuse Joint Resolution 425, has designated the week of November 12 through 18, 1989, as "Community Foundation Week" and has requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.
Now, Therefore, I, George Bush, President of the United States of American, do hereby proclaim the week of November 12 through November 18, 1989, as Community Foundation Week. I call upon the people of the United States to observe the week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord ninetheen hundred and eighty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of American the two hundred and fourteenth.

GEORGE BUSH
