    DES MOINES, IA â€” Today, Wednesday, January 22 at 8:30 PM CT, Senator Amy Klobuchar will host a statewide tele-town hall with Iowans to discuss her 100 day plan to get our country back on the path to progress with an ambitious, optimistic agenda.
Amy isn't running to be president for half of America -- she's running to be president for all of America. She has the experience and record to prove she can win and deliver real results. She has passed more than 100 bills into law as lead Democrat despite gridlock in Washington, including more than 40 bills under President Trump's administration.
Amy Klobuchar is the only candidate to qualify for the February debate who has visited all of Iowa's 99 counties. This week, she earned endorsements from three additional sitting Iowa legislators, bringing her total to 16 -- more than any other candidate in the field.
NOTE: Schedule subject to change based on U.S. Senate schedule.
