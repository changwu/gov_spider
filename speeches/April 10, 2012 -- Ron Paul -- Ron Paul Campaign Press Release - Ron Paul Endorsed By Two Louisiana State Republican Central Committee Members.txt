BATON ROUGE, Louisiana — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul was endorsed today by Louisiana State Republican Central Committee members Paul Goppelt of Ascension Parish and Wallace Lucas of Jefferson Parish.
In making their endorsements public, Messrs. Goppelt and Lucas issued the following statements:
"For too long, traditional Americans like me have misunderstood Ron Paul and what he stands for. America's problem is the government.  America's solution is liberty.  Once you understand everything that means, Ron Paul becomes the biblical and moral choice for president," said Paul Goppelt, an Ascension Parish GOP Central Committeeman.
"I believe Ron Paul is a true champion of the Constitution, and the only authentic conservative running for President. He will be a strong voice for all Americans as he moves to restore the institutions that make America the great nation it is. Dr. Paul's ideas about lowering the corporate tax rate and reducing the government workforce are steps in the right direction," said Jefferson Parish GOP Central Committee member Wallace Lucas.
"Join me and others, as I endorse and support Ron Paul for President," Mr. Lucas concluded.
Jefferson Parish is the largest metropolitan area in the state of Louisiana with a population of over 400,000. Ascension Parish, the fastest growing parish in the state, is part of the Baton Rouge Metropolitan Statistical Area.
Providing a strong boost to Ron Paul's Louisiana state organization, such endorsements present Ron Paul as the conservative alternative to Mitt Romney. They also demonstrate that the 12-term Congressman from Texas has the only campaign organization capable of maintaining a 50-state competition with the moderate-establishment Romney.
