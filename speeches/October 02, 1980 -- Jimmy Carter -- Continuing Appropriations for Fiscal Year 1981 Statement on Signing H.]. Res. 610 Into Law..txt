    I am pleased that the Congress acted on the continuing resolution for 1981 in time to avoid disruption in Government activities at the start of this fiscal year. I urge the Congress to pass the remaining regular appropriations bills promptly upon its return next month.
While I signed the continuing resolution yesterday, I think it is important to make clear my concerns about several of its provisions:
1. The funding levels in the resolution do not in all cases represent the levels I will be supporting in the regular appropriation bills.
2. A provision in the resolution prevents the Secretary of Education from adopting or enforcing required guidelines under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for services to students of limited English language proficiency before June 1981. I believe it is inappropriate for the Congress to interpose itself between the courts and a Cabinet officer on this matter.
3. The resolution prohibits programs that would prevent voluntary prayer and meditation in public schools. No such programs exist, nor are any planned. This issue has been dealt with adequately by the Supreme Court. Raising this issue in the appropriation process is therefore unnecessary and misleading.
