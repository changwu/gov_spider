    President Carter and a group of his senior advisers had discussions this morning with the Kenyan delegation headed by Vice President Daniel arap Moi. They discussed the situation in the Horn of Africa and Kenyan-U.S. relations. President Carter reaffirmed the U.S. Government's longstanding policy of close support for Kenya and assured the Kenyans that the United States will continue to supply Kenya with economic and military assistance. Both countries share a deep concern for the conflicts which have developed in the Horn of Africa. Measures which could be taken to bring the conflict to an end were discussed, and it was found that Kenyan and American perceptions of the fundamental problems of the area are very similar.
