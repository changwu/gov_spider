VP Travel Pool #1 JBA Takeoff 
Hello all,
Good morning! I have the honor of being your print pooler for the Vice President's trip to Poland and Romania.
The Vice President's motorcade arrived at Joint Base Andrews at 7:38 am. She stepped out of her vehicle holding what appeared to be an iPhone and wired Apple headphones.
She waved to the press while holding an umbrella and boarded Air Force Two at 7:39 a.m. the Vice President also came to the back of the plane for about a 5 minute OTR.
And we're off. We've got a ETA of roughly 3:55 PM.
I'll be in touch,
