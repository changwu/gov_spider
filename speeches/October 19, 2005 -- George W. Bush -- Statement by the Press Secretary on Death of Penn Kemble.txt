    President Bush expressed his deep regret over the death last weekend of Penn Kemble. Mr. Kemble dedicated his life to the struggle for democracy and human rights, both during the Cold War and after it. In his service as Deputy Director and Acting Director of the U.S. Information Agency and on the Board for International Broadcasting, in his work with Secretary of State Powell regarding Sudan, and in his years at Freedom House, he was a leading American voice for the advancement of freedom in the world. As a member of the Board of Directors of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs and as a founder of the Coalition for a Democratic Majority, he promoted a strongly bipartisan approach to national security issues. The President sends his condolences to Mr. Kemble's widow and to his family.
