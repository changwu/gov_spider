    Tonight, Biden for President will air two new national ads during the 73rd Primetime Emmy Awards that feature a mother from Wisconsin and highlights how Donald Trump's failed leadership during the pandemic has left our schools closed and upended the lives of working families.
Because of Trump's inability to lead the country through the ongoing crises, the ads depict what everyday life has become for many, including Margaret, a stay-at-home mother of four from Wausau, Wisconsin â€” "a full-time mom, and a full-time teacher," as she describes in one of the ads.
Margaret is featured in "Homeschool," a 0:60 spot that will premiere in the run up to the show on E!, as well as "Moving Again," a 0:30 spot that will air during the full program on ABC.
"What's been really hard for us and many families is that there's just no end in sight. A lack of plan from the federal level has boiled all the way down now to the shoulders of households across the country," Margaret explains in "Homeschool." "It just feels like a cost that never had to happen. I want to know that we have a president who has a plan during COVID for education, and after COVID, so we can get normal life back on track," she says.
Since the onset of the public health crisis in March, Joe Biden has demonstrated leaders and outlined robust policies to beat COVID-19, build back our economy better, and safely reopen our nation's schools.
As part of Biden for President's ongoing paid media program, it spent $65 million last week across broadcast and digital. The campaign's ads remain active in a total of ten states, including Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Nebraska, and Minnesota.
