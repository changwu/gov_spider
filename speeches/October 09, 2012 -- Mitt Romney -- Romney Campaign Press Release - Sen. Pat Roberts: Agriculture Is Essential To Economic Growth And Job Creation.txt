    Kansas Senator Pat Roberts, Ranking Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's vision for a vibrant rural America:
"America's agriculture sector plays a critical role both in ensuring Americans have a safe and affordable food supply and in supporting economic growth and job creation. Mitt Romney recognizes that farmers and ranchers are the backbone of our country, and his policies clearly reflect his belief that they should have the freedom and certainty to grow and succeed â€” not be burdened with heavy-handed regulations and taxes like those President Obama's Administration has pushed over the last four years. Rural America clearly cannot afford four more years of President Obama. Governor Romney has a clear vision and plan to deliver the real recovery we need to get America back on track, and I am proud to support him."
