    I have today signed the Instrument of Ratification of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to which the Senate gave its advice and consent on March 13, 1969.
This Government is thus completing the process of ratifying a major international agreement designed to make our world a safer home for all mankind.
The negotiation and ratification of this treaty spans the administrations of three Presidents and reflects our country's dedication to the cause of peace.
It is my earnest hope that ratification of the treaty by the necessary number of additional states will soon occur so that it may enter into force at an early time.
This administration seeks equitable and meaningful agreements to limit armaments and to resolve the dangerous conflicts that threaten peace and security. In this act of ratification today, this commitment is demonstrated anew.
