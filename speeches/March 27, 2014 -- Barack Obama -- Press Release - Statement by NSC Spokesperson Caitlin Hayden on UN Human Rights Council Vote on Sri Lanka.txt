    The United States welcomes today's passage of the UN Human Rights Council resolution on "promoting reconciliation, accountability, and human rights in Sri Lanka, " which calls on the Government of Sri Lanka to take meaningful action to ensure justice, accountability, and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans. We agree with the resolution's request for the Office of the High Commissioner to investigate alleged serious violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes by both parties to the conflict and to monitor the human rights situation in Sri Lanka, which has continued to deteriorate. Today's resolution sends a message of concern about the present human rights situation in Sri Lanka and the denial of universal rights, and it underscores the importance of fundamental freedoms that must be respected in order to build a future in which all of Sri Lanka's people can achieve their aspirations. Today's vote also sends a clear message that the international community is committed to working with the Government of Sri Lanka to promote greater peace, stability, and prosperity for all of the people of Sri Lanka.
