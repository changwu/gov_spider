    63,277 People Gave In 24 Hours; 58 Percent Were New Donors
In the 24 hours after the second Democratic primary debate began, Senator Kamala Harris' campaign raised more than $2 million online from 63,277 people. Of those who gave, 58 percent were new contributors to the campaign. This was the campaign's best online fundraising day yet.
"We have momentum," said Harris' communications director, Lily Adams. "After her dominant debate performance, where she proved she is the candidate best suited to prosecute the case against four more years of Donald Trump, supporters across this country are fueling our campaign because they saw her empathy, her passion, and her direct focus on the issues that keep people up at night."
During this 24-hour period, the average online contribution was $30, and Harris' campaign quadrupled their share of donations from the first four early states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.
Harris has been broadly praised for her debate win, with commentators saying she "owned the stage and the night," "put into practice the skills she's honed as a prosecutor and as a senator," and "came off as presidential."
