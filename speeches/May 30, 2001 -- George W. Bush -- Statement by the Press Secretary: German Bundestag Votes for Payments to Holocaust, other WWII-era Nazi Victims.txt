    The United States welcomes the German Bundestag's vote today which makes possible payments to some one million victims of the Nazi era. The victims of slave and forced labor and other injustices will receive payments totaling approximately $5 billion from a German foundation. President Bush congratulates the German government and German business for their responsible actions in setting up the foundation, and applauds Chancellor Schroeder for his leadership on this issue, ensuring some measure of justice for these victims.
