    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Metzenbaum (D) OH and 7 others)
The Administration recognizee that changes in nutrition labeling are needed. However, the Administration opposes S. 1425 because it is overly prescriptive and unnecessary in light of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) current efforts in' this area. The FDA has moved quickly to Implement nutrition labeling reforms as demonstrated by the proposed rules published in the July 19, 1990, Federal Register. Final regulations will be developed after considering the public comments submitted on these proposals. The FDA has already committed significant time and resources to the reform of nutrition labeling. The pursuit of legislative reform concurrent with regulatory reform is needlessly duplicative.
