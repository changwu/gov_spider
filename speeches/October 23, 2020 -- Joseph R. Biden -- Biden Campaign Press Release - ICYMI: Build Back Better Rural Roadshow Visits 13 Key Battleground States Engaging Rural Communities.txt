    This week, Biden for President wrapped up the Build Back Better Rural Roadshow after a two-week tour of stops in 13 key battleground states, including Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.
The tour made virtual and in-person stops in rural communities to meet rural voters where they are and bring more rural Americans into the campaign with less than two weeks to go. On the tour, rural community leaders and stakeholders, along with top campaign surrogates, discussed how a Biden-Harris administration would build rural communities back better and fight for rural Americans. Speakers at each stop outlined Joe Biden's understanding that opportunity is key to retaining rural jobs for future generations. The campaign also listened to rural community members to hear about what issues are top of mind in this election, including better hospitals and health care, reliable broadband internet, clean energy, and access to federal resources.
Now, the Rural Americans for Biden coalition is building off the momentum from the Roadshow, mobilizing rural Americans to get out and vote and engage with friends and family to make sure they vote too and join the movement to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
