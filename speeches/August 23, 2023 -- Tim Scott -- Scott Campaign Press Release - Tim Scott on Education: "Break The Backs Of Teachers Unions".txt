Martha MacCallum: Senator Scott, faith is on decline in this country, you talked about it a little bit before tonight. So, is there a role for a President of the United States, in changing that? What would you do to change that?
Tim Scott: Well, our nation was founded upon the Judeo-Christian values that have made this the greatest nation on God's green earth. I'm a big believer in Ephesians 3:20, that God is able to do exceedingly, abundantly, above all that we ask or imagine. Our responsibility should be to model the behavior we want others to follow. On education, the only way we change education in this nation, is to break the backs of the teachers unions. They are standing in the door house of our kids, locking them into failing schools, and locking them out of the greatest future they can have.
