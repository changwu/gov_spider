    In the time since I became President, the Congress and I, working together closely, have embarked upon a course that will revitalize the intelligence capabilities of this nation, ensuring that in the coming decades we will have the vital information about our adversaries needed to safeguard American interests at home and around the globe. The intelligence authorization act for the fiscal year now coming to a close constituted the first step in our rebuilding program. The Intelligence Identities Protection Act, which became law in June, was an important second step which ensured that those who arrogate to themselves the right to frustrate legitimate intelligence activities approved by the President and the Congress will be brought to justice. Now, I am pleased to take the next step in our intelligence revitalization program by approving the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1983.
This year's intelligence authorization act authorizes the appropriations necessary to continue improving our intelligence capabilities both quantitatively and qualitatively. The American people can be confident that their hard-earned tax dollars invested now in our intelligence capabilities will pay rich dividends to the Nation in the decades ahead.
