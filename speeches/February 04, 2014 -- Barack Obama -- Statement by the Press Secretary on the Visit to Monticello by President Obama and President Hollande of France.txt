    Since the time of our founding fathers, the United States and France have been allies and friends. To mark this historic partnership, President Obama and President Hollande of France will tour Monticello on Monday, February 10, as part of the State Visit. As the residence of Thomas Jefferson, one of the United States' earliest envoys to France, Monticello reflects Jefferson's affection for the people of France, the long-standing relations between our two democracies, and the shared values we hold dear: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. President Obama looks forward to sharing this piece of our shared history with President Hollande.
