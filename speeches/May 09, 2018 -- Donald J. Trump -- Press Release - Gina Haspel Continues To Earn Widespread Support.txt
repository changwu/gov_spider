SEN. TOM COTTON AT FOX NEWS: Gina Haspel Has Spent Her Life Defending Our Country. She's an Excellent Choice for CIA
"Gina Haspel has spent her life defending our country. Her experience makes her a prime choice to lead the CIA at this dangerous time. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I've worked with her during her time as deputy CIA chief and can attest to her professionalism, her work ethic, and – most important of all – her character. It's perhaps not as well known that the reason Haspel joined the CIA was that her first choice for a college, West Point, wasn't accepting female candidates at the time. It would be a real loss for America if her country rejected her services yet again."

Now is not the time to play political theater with an important national security agency."
NATIONAL SECURITY INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW LESTER MUNSON AT REAL CLEAR DEFENSE: The CIA Needs Gina Haspel
"The President trusts Haspel to carry out the job as CIA Director, and it would be an easy transition into the role that she is already fulfilling in the interim. Confirming Haspel to lead the CIA would also send the right message to the intelligence community, which knows her well as a career CIA officer. Gina understands the agency as well as anyone and is ready to execute the job of Director – her career and experience speak volumes."
COLUMNIST MASEENA ZIEGLER IN FORBES: Gina Haspel Is 'The' Director for CIA Right Now
"Haspel doesn't fall apart in a crisis. She is much respected and liked by foreign allies, and across the board at the CIA, according to people who worked with her ... I'm told there is widespread agreement on Haspel's qualification for the role across the aisle, behind closed doors, but this cuts no ice with Senate Democrats who seem determined to make a point on principle based entirely on one small period in her career."
