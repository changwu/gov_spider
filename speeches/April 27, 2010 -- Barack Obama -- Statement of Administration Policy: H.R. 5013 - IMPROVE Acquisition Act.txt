(House Rules)
(Rep. Andrews, D-New Jersey, and 9 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 5013, the Implementing Management for Performance and Related Reforms to Obtain Value in Every (IMPROVE) Acquisition Act of 2010. The Administration commends the bipartisan efforts by the House Armed Services Committee Panel on Defense Acquisition Reform to improve and reform the defense acquisition system, and is pleased that the panel's key findings and recommendations are incorporated in H.R. 5013. Further, the Administration agrees with the sponsors of H.R. 5013 that the defense acquisition process needs improvement in the areas of acquisition system management, requirements identification and control, financial management, fostering the highest quality acquisition workforce, and promoting and strengthening excellence in the Department of Defense acquisition system and the U.S. industrial base.
The Administration is committed to addressing the issues outlined in this legislation, as well as in P.L. 111-23 (Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act), so that improvements in the acquisition system serve and support the Nation's warfighters and reduce cost growth in defense acquisition programs. The Administration wants to make certain that the U.S. Government is a good steward of the taxpayers' dollars, which is why it is pleased that the bill includes authorities to make sure that Federal contractors are also responsibly meeting their obligations as taxpayers. The Administration believes H.R. 5013 will help it meet those objectives and looks forward to working with the Congress to refine this legislation as it continues to move through the legislative process.
