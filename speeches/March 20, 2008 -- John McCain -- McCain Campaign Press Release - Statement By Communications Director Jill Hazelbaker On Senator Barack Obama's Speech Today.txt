    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today released the following statement by Communications Director Jill Hazelbaker on Senator Barack Obama's speech today:
"Today Senator Obama once again displayed how fundamentally wrong he is on the central issues facing America's future: our economy and national security.
"On the economy, Senator Obama offers the tired tax and spend ideas of the past. He promises higher taxes on middle class families at a time when they're hurting the most, and massive spending increases and big government programs sure to stifle the economic growth that produces jobs for hardworking Americans.
"On national security, Senator Obama would rather rehash the past than look forward with resolve to address fundamental challenges and opportunities we have today to secure our future. He has embraced an irresponsible policy of withdrawing our troops from Iraq without regard for the conditions on the ground, the advice of our military commanders or the consequences of failure, which his own top advisor called unrealistic.
"This election provides the American people with a clear choice, and we look forward to the debate on these issues should Senator Obama secure his Party's nomination."
