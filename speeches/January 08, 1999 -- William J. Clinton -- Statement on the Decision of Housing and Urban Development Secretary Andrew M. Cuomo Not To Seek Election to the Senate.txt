    Earlier today Secretary Cuomo announced that he would not run for the United States Senate. I told Secretary Cuomo that I would support his decision either way, but on a personal level, I am glad that he is staying to build on HUD's new empowerment agenda. New Yorkers should be proud of the job he is doing. Andrew believes that his job at HUD is not finished. Therefore, he has chosen to continue his public service at the Department, and I applaud his decision.
