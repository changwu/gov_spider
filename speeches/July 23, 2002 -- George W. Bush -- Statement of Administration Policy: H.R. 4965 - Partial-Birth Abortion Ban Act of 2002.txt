    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)
(Rep. Chabot (R) OH and 152 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly supports enactment of H.R. 4965, which would ban a certain type of late-term procedure commonly known as "partial-birth abortion," except in cases where the life of the mother is endangered.
Partial-birth abortion is a procedure that is not accepted by the medical community and that 30 States have attempted to ban. The Administration believes that enactment of H.R. 4965 is morally imperative and constitutionally permissible to prohibit this very abhorrent form of abortion.
