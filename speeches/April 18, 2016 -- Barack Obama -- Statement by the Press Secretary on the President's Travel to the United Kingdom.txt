    As part of the President's upcoming travel to the United Kingdom, First Lady Michelle Obama will join President Obama for a private lunch hosted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh at Windsor Castle on April 22. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry will host the President and First Lady for a private dinner at Kensington Palace that evening.
As previously announced, the President's visit will also include a bilateral meeting and joint press conference with Prime Minister David Cameron at Number 10 Downing Street. The visit will allow the President to coordinate on today's most pressing international challenges with one of our closest allies and to offer his gratitude to the British Government and people for their stalwart partnership with his Administration and the American people throughout his Presidency.
