    In a new letter, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, led by Dayton, OH, Mayor Nan Whaley, announced their support for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework.
The letter, signed by more than 369 bipartisan mayors from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, makes clear that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework would make our economy more sustainable, resilient and just.
Mayors are on the frontlines of our nation's infrastructure, seeing first-hand how critical investments – like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework includes – can transform our nation's communities.
