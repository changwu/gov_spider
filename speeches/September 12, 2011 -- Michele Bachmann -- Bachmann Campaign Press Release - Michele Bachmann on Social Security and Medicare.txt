    Michele Bachmann Calls for an End to Scaring Seniors
Social Security and Medicare provide a safety net to millions of Americans. This is a system that many Americans have paid into their whole life. America needs to keep its promise to senior citizens.
Congresswoman Michele Bachmann recently told an interviewer, "I love senior citizens. I care about them. My mom is 80 years old. My dad is 87. And I know right now we have trouble. This is at a time when Medicare is grossly short on money coming in, because we know that nine years from now, that possible trust fund for Medicare could be flat broke."

Obamacare only makes things worse by taking $500 billion out of Medicare, and the President's so-called Payroll Tax Holiday has accelerated the insolvency of Social Security, requiring additional funds from general revenue to cover current benefits for seniors.
There are those in Washington who overlook not only these programs' efficiency problems, but also the fact they will bankrupt the United States if reforms are not put in place. Unfortunately, many Americans have been unduly frightened by scare talk about alleged attempts to potentially eliminate these programs. Michele understands the concerns of seniors who have been frightened into thinking that their Social Security could be taken away. As President, she will ensure that any reform to Social Security or Medicare will only affect those 55 and younger, and she will work to find a way to ease the next generation into a program that is solvent, fiscally responsible, and empowering to the individual. Michele has also pledged to protect Medicare by repealing Obamacare.
