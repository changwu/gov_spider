    "I deplore and condemn the Hamas rocket attacks on southern Israel, including the city of Ashkelon. Israel has the right to defend its citizens.
"I regret the civilian loss of life and casualties on both sides that this provocative action has caused.
"I call on Hamas to stop this irresponsible aggression immediately, which would enable Israeli and Palestinian civilians to return to normal life.
"The rockets fired from Gaza by Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists are aimed not only at the people of southern Israel; they are aimed at the heart of Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. I regret the Palestinian Authority's decision to suspend the talks.
"The Bush Administration should have been taking a much more active role in bringing international pressure on Hamas to stop its attacks."
