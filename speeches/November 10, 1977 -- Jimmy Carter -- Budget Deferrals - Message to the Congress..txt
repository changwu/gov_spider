    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report four new deferrals totalling $908.6 million in budget authority. The deferrals affect the Departments of Defense and Energy, the National Science Foundation, and the Emergency refugee and migration assistance fund.
In addition, I am reporting revisions to five deferrals previously transmitted. Three of these revisions change the agency name and related identifiers of the deferrals from the abolished Energy Research and Development Administration to the new Department of Energy. The amount deferred for the Department of Energy's Plenum Fill experiment has also been increased by $0.8 million. In addition, two supplementary reports for deferrals in the Office of the Secretary of the Treasury report an increase of $26.3 million in the amount deferred.
The details of each deferral are contained in the attached reports.
