Power Line's Scott Johnson: "Romney says we won't help wage earner to attack wage payer. Built a small business. Some companies he invested in created jobs -- has been there in the real world." (Scott Johnson, "Scoring Tonight's GOP Candidates' Forum," Power Line Blog, http://www.powerlineblog.com/, Posted 1/6/08)
- Johnson: "Romney responds by speaking up for application of rule of law in this area. Recalls McCain's past support for 'amnesty' and notes that amnesty doesn't work. McCain's response is tired, evasive, irritable. We need a "real solution.'" (Scott Johnson, "Scoring Tonight's GOP Candidates' Forum," Power Line Blog, http://www.powerlineblog.com/, Posted 1/6/08)
- Johnson: "Romney wins this [immigration] round hands down." (Scott Johnson, "Scoring Tonight's GOP Candidates' Forum," Power Line Blog, http://www.powerlineblog.com/, Posted 1/6/08)
- Johnson: "I score this [negative advertising] round for Romney and am calling the event for Romney." (Scott Johnson, "Scoring Tonight's GOP Candidates' Forum," Power Line Blog, http://www.powerlineblog.com/, Posted 1/6/08)
- Johnson: "Taxes: Romney hits a triple." (Scott Johnson, "Scoring Tonight's GOP Candidates' Forum," Power Line Blog, http://www.powerlineblog.com/, Posted 1/6/08)
- Johnson: "Huckabee defends his record on taxes. Romney opens his response with a question to Huckabee; Huckabee avoids answering directly. Romney nails him. Huckabee is whining. Huckabee pleads compulsion on taxes. Apparently he doesn't want to claim credit for his record after all."(Scott Johnson, "Scoring Tonight's GOP Candidates' Forum," Power Line Blog, http://www.powerlineblog.com/, Posted 1/6/08)

National Review's Mark Hemingway: "Romney's command of policy detail is impressive, and shining brightly tonight." (Mark Hemingway, "Romney's Command Of Policy Detail," National Review's The Corner, http://corner.nationalreview.com, Posted 1/6/08)

National Review's Kathryn Jean Lopez: "I think it is Thompson and Romney who are on tonight." (Kathryn Jean Lopez, "I Don't Think It's McCain And Romney," National Review's The Corner, http://corner.nationalreview.com, Posted 1/6/08)
- Lopez: "He's letting Romney be Romney – the confident, forward-looking candidate with a conservative temperament he is – it was those qualities that first made me pay attention to him when he was in the statehouse. I think he's being himself tonight. We saw him be himself during the religion speech. And we're seeing it tonight." (Kathryn Jean Lopez, "Re: Mitt," National Review's The Corner, http://corner.nationalreview.com, Posted 1/6/08)
- Lopez: "This Mitt is the Mitt we have to see everyday from hereon out. It took a while for him to be unleashed but I don't think it's too late by any stretch. Let Mitt be Mitt and Mitt might win." (Kathryn Jean Lopez, "Re: Mitt," National Review's The Corner, http://corner.nationalreview.com, Posted 1/6/08)
- Lopez: "Romney is smart to emphasize his executive skills. He's talked about his private and public experience. It's an important skill set and competency isn't exactly overflowing in Washington right now. He also does it by being forward looking, not just giving a laundry list of what he's done." (Kathryn Jean Lopez, "Biography Is A Big Thing," National Review's The Corner, http://corner.nationalreview.com/, Posted 1/6/08)
- Lopez: "The fighter is out in him tonight. No one is going to call him a wimp tonight, that's for sure. He's taken initiative, from minute one. And he's turned the tone of his campaign around."
