    I am very pleased to see the Senate moving ahead in a strong bipartisan manner on approval of the reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE Act. This vital program provides primary care to hundreds of thousands of Americans living with HIV and AIDS. As I said in a letter to Majority Leader Dole and Speaker Gingrich, it is imperative that we move quickly to approve this important legislation. Senator Kassebaum deserves high praise for her important leadership on this issue and, in particular, her work to protect the lives of newborn infants from HIV.
