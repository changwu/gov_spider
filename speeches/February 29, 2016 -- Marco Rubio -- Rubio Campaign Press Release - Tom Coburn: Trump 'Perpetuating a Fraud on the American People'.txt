He says America is at a crossroads:
At a time when our republic, and the Republican Party, is at a crossroads I have no doubt that the right choice for America is Marco Rubio. America desperately needs a president who will appeal to people's highest aspirations rather than their deepest fears; a president who will model servant leadership rather than self-promotion; and a president who will cast a vision and unite the country instead of denigrating dissenters as second-class citizens. Marco would be such a president. I urge voters in Oklahoma and across the country to take a stand for freedom and stand with Marco on Tuesday and throughout this campaign.
Senator Coburn also went after Donald Trump in no uncertain terms. This is a devastating critique of Trump's con man candidacy:
Donald Trump's campaign is a fabrication. He is perpetuating a fraud on the American people. His empty promises, bullying and bloviating rhetoric will only deepen the frustration and disillusionment that gave rise to his campaign. He simply lacks the character, skills and policy knowledge to turn his grandiose promises into reality.
Put simply, Donald Trump has no plan to make America great again. He is a populist without portfolio.
It's truly a time for choosing, and Senator Coburn is right — we must aspire for America to be better, not give in to our fears.
