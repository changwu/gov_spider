    President Bush this morning received his daily intelligence briefing, including an update on the status of events in China. The situation remains uncertain. Both sides have exercised restraint, and we urge that restraint to continue. The United States stands for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, and President Bush commented yesterday on the inexorable march of democracy in China. The demonstrations of the last few days indicate that the hunger for change remains strong. We remain hopeful that a dialog between the Government and the students is possible.
