A VICTORIOUS campaign against the problems of recession and inflation requires individual discipline and ingenuity as well as the total mobilization of America's greatest resources--the brains, the skills, and the will power of our people. In this fight, it is vital that all Federal civilian and military personnel become actively involved in cost reduction and energy conservation efforts.
Each of you can make a personal contribution by submitting constructive ideas and working cooperatively to eliminate waste, improve equipment, streamline operations or make more productive use of time, facilities and energy resources. I have established a special cost reduction campaign within the framework of the Federal government awards program to encourage cost saving suggestions.
During the remainder of Calendar Year 1975, I will take special note of outstanding contributions of civilian and military personnel. I have asked to be informed of all suggestions, inventions and scientific and other contributions which result in first year measurable benefits to the Government of $5,000 or more so that I may add my personal thanks and congratulations in addition to the cash awards available to participants.
I strongly urge each of you to seek economies and other improvements within the Government while providing high quality services to the public. By working together, I am confident that Federal spending can be reduced and products and services improved.
