    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-265; 16 USC 1801), I transmit herewith a governing international fishery agreement between the United States and the People's Republic of Bulgaria, signed at Washington on September 22, 1983.
This agreement is one of a series to be renegotiated in accordance with that legislation. I urge that the Congress give favorable consideration to this agreement at an early date.
