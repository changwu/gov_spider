Some color from the drive:
A small smattering of onlookers waved and filmed the motorcade as it pulled out of Oceana, and again as we pulled within 2 miles of the destination. Your poolers spotted one sign, reading "Trump 2024: Make the Liberals Cry Again," in the neighborhood adjoining the rec center
Pool van 3 also snagged a great view of the
Mount Trashmore Park roughly two-thirds of the way through the ride, which if you haven't seen it, is certainly something:

Travel pool #9 — photo line & room color
The president is currently taking part in a photoline ahead of his remarks (participants below).
Pool was situated in the media filing center in the Kempsville gym around 2:40pm.
It's a big room, but it's very full (photos to come) — the White House estimated some 600 people were in attendance, with a significant number standing along the perimeter and behind the seated crowd. Typical campaign-style music is playing while the crowd chatters eagerly.
A sampling of the playlist (so far)...
Kool & the Gang — Celebration
Junior Senior — Move Your Feet
Pharrell — Happy
Stevie Wonder — Sir Duke
The Wanted — Glad You Came
