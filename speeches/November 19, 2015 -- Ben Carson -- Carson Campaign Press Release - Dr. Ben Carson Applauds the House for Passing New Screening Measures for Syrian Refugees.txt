    Alexandria, Va. - November 19, 2015 - Today, Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and GOP presidential candidate, applauded the U.S. House of Representatives for approving stricter screening requirements for refugees from Syria seeking to settle in the United States.
"The Paris terrorist attacks have demonstrated that terrorists will pose as refugees to enter our land," said Dr. Carson. "We must do our utmost to thwart the terrorists' ambitions."
"The security of the American people, not politics, should be our number one priority," added Dr. Carson. "The bipartisan vote in the House today is a very good step in the right direction.
In September, President Barack Obama pledged that the U.S. would accept an additional 45,000 new refugees, mostly from Syria, in 2016-2017. Earlier this week, Dr. Carson sent letters to congressional leaders urging them to terminate all public funding for any ongoing federal programs that seek to resettle refugees or migrants from Syria into the United States.
