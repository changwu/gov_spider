    Potential Supreme Court Nominee
Q. Mr. President, excuse the interruption, sir, but could you give us some feel for what you'll he looking for in a replacement for Justice White?
The President. I already said that in Washington. 1 used to teach constitutional law, and I think that there are few decisions the President makes which are more weighty, more significant, or can have a greater impact on more Americans than an appointment to the Supreme Court. And I'm going to try to pick a person that has a fine mind, good judgment, wide experience in the law and in the problems of real people, and someone with a big heart.
