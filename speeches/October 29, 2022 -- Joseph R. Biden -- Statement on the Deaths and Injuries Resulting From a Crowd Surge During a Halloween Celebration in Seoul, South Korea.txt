    Jill and I send our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones in Seoul. We grieve with the people of the Republic of Korea and send our best wishes for a quick recovery to all those who were injured. The alliance between our two countries has never been more vibrant or more vital, and the ties between our people are stronger than ever. The United States stands with the Republic of Korea during this tragic time.
