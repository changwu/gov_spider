    Presidential Determination No. 94â€“19
Memorandum for the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chair of the Board of Directors of the United States Enrichment Corporation
Subject: Authorization to Make an Advance Payment for the Purchase of Highly Enriched Uranium from Russia
On February 18, 1993, the Government of the United States and the Government of the Russian Federation entered into an agreement to arrange the safe and prompt disposition for peaceful purposes of highly enriched uranium extracted from nuclear weapons as a result of the reduction of nuclear weapons in accordance with existing agreements in the area of arms control and disarmament. On January 14, 1994, the United States Enrichment Corporation, as Executive Agent of the United States, entered into the initial implementing contract pursuant to the February 18, 1993, agreement for the purchase of low-enriched uranium derived from highly enriched uranium extracted from nuclear weapons.
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Constitution and section 3324(b) (2) of title 31 of the United States Code, and having decided that an advance of public money is necessary to carry out both the duties of the disbursing official promptly and faithfully and the obligation of the United States Government pursuant to the initial implementing contract executed on January 14, 1994, I authorize an advance of public money to be made to the disbursing official for the purpose of providing payment to the Government of the Russian Federation or its designated agent, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the initial implementing contract.
The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
William J. Clinton
