Verona, PA - Republican Presidential Candidate Rick Santorum released a new television advertisement today which will begin airing immediately and statewide in Nevada and Colorado. The ad, entitled, "Deal" outlines why we need a clear, bold contrast with Barack Obama this fall, not a nominee who blurs the lines.
Watch "Deal"


 
Script of "Deal"
Voice Over:
On the other sides of these cards are the picture of three politicians. 
Here's some clues as to who they are.
All three supported radical cap and trade legislation that would destroy American jobs and drive up energy costs. 
All three supported giving illegal aliens some form of amnesty.
All three sported the government health mandates which take away our freedom and is the core of Obamacare.
And all three of these politician's supported the Wall Street bailouts that was a slap in the face to the Tea Party.
Who are these three Cap and Trade lovin, bailout supporting, soft of immigration, big government mandating politicians?  ....Now you know.
Rick Santorum for President, he doesn't just talk a good conservative game, he lives it. 
Rick Santorum: 
I'm Rick Santorum and I approve this message
