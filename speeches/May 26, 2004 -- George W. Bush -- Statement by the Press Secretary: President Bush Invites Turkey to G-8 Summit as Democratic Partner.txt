    President Bush has invited Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan to meet with leaders of G-8 countries and regional partners from the broader Middle East on June 9, 2004, in Sea Island, Georgia.
He looks forward to a discussion of how the G-8 can support political, economic, and social freedom in the broader Middle East and North Africa, and to Turkey's contribution to this effort. Turkey's participation in specific programs to advance key reforms in this region, especially on democracy, will foster collaboration among G-8 and EU countries, Turkey, and regional partners.
