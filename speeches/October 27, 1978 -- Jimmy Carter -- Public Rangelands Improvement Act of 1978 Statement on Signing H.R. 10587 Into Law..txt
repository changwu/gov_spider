    I have signed into law H.R. 10587, the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978.
This act builds on previous legislation, most recently the comprehensive Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, to improve the management of the public rangelands. It clarifies several legal authorities, thereby helping resolve some of the conflicting demands that have hampered effective management of these lands. It should also increase cooperation between the Federal Government and those who use the public rangelands.
H.R. 10587 will further the national policy of a sound and balanced approach to the Federal management of the public lands. Those lands are increasingly important because of their energy, agricultural, environmental, and recreational resources. After generations of disagreement, all those interested in the public lands are beginning to find better ways of balancing the wide range of demands that press on these vital resources.
In particular, the bill recognizes the historical importance of the public rangelands to the western livestock grazing industry and provides a basis for an improved grazing program in the future.
While I had hoped that the Congress would adopt the recommendations of the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to require Federal grazing fees to be set at fair market value, the fee provisions in H.R. 10587 will bring fees more into line with rates charged on comparable private grazing lands.
I have approved the Public Rangelands Improvement Act because I believe it will lead to improved Federal management of our Nation's public land resources.
