    This administration has committed itself to a historic effort to advance the health of the American people--and of peoples in other lands. The 89th Congress is providing farsighted legislation that will enable us to move forward in many areas:
--In the care of our young people and our older citizens,
--In the acceleration of research aimed at combating heart disease, cancer, stroke and other diseases which take such a tragic toll in disability and death,
--In meeting our national need for more physicians, more nurses, more professional and technical personnel in all of the health fields, and for more hospitals and other health facilities so that the benefits of our research and the skills and dedication of our professional people can be made more readily available to all who need them.
At this time in our history it is essential that the Public Health Service be led by a man of high intellectual capacity with a proven gift of leadership. This is a combination found in few candidates. I am convinced that Dr. Stewart is such a man. He is young, imaginative, energetic, devoted to his profession and dedicated to the great work which this Government is determined to carry out for the betterment of all mankind.
