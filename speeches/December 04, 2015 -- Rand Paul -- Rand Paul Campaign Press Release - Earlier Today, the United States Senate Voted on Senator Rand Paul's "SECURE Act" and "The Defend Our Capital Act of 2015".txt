    WASHINGTON, D.C. - Earlier today, the United States Senate voted on Senator Rand Paul's "SECURE Act" and "The Defend Our Capital Act of 2015."
Amendment No. 2899, known as the Stop Extremists Coming Under Refugee Entry Act (SECURE Act), would havesuspended visa issuance for nations with a high risk of terrorism and imposed a waiting period for background checks on visa issuance from other countries. The amendment failed passage with a vote of 10-89.
The Defend Our Capital Act of 2015 was offered as an amendment to H.R.3761, Restoring American's Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015. The legislation would have removed existing restrictive firearm ownership laws in the District of Columbia, and mandated the issuance and granting of reciprocity for concealed weapons permits for both residents and non-residents.
The amendment which needed 60 to pass, was 54-45. Following the votes on both of these amendments, Sen. Paul issued the statement below:"There is a reason that most of America rightfully believes that politicians in Washington are out of touch. Tonight, we witnessed two common-sense pieces of legislation get defeated. Instead of standing up for enhanced American security, most of my colleagues chose to keep the status quo. Instead of standing up for the Second Amendment, some of my colleagues chose to keep in place restrictive gun control laws. I will keep fighting to bring much needed change to our legislative priorities and continue in my efforts to defeat the Washington machine."
