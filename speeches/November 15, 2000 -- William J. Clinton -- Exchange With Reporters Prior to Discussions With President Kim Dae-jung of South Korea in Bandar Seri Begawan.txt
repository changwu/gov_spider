    2000 Presidential Election
Q. Have any of the leaders asked you about the election results, sir?
President Clinton. Just briefly.
Q. Did they accept your explanation of what's going on?
President Clinton. No, they were just interested in it. I told them it would all be worked out. The process was underway.
Possible Visit to North Korea
Q. Mr. President, what exactly are you waiting for from the North Koreans, in terms of commitments on their missile program? What do you need to hear from them?
President Clinton. Well, we're working on a number of issues, of which the missile program is one. We're obviously trying to make as much progress as we can, and I'll make an appropriate decision about the trip sometime in the not too distant future.
Q. Sir, do you think it would be helpful to bring the South Koreans' President with you if you make a trip?
President Clinton. Well, I don'tâ€”he just went, and he deserves a lot of credit for doing it. I was actually quite thrilled, as I've told him several times, that the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to him for a lifetime of devotion to peace and human rights, and especially for the breakthrough he's achieved here.
So I think he's put this whole business on a different footing. Secretary Albright, as you know, had a very good trip to North Korea. So I think we're going to work together. We've always worked in partnership with South Korea, and we will continue to do so.
