The interview is well worth watching.  We've added it to our website above so you may watch it there and then please share it with your friends on twitter and facebook.
If you like what you hear and see, then also please make a donation in the amount you can afford to our campaign.  We are counting on your continued financial support as Jon Huntsman climbs in the polls by discussing his ideas for America's future.
Proud to stand with Jon Huntsman,
Matt David
Campaign Manager
