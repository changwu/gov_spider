Praise for Alejandro Mayorkas, Nominated for Secretary of DHS Sen. Gary Peters, Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs CommitteeOur nation faces persistent threats, both longstanding and new, including foreign and domestic terrorism, natural disasters, cyber-attacks, and now a pandemic. The Department of Homeland Security plays a critical role in addressing these threats and strengthening our national security, and it needs highly qualified, experienced and dedicated leaders, like Mr. Mayorkas – especially following years of chaos and mismanagement. I appreciate that President-Elect Biden chose to nominate a qualified candidate with extensive private and public sector security experience, including several senior positions at the Department of Homeland Security. I look forward to working with him as part of the confirmation process and finding common sense solutions to the serious threats facing our nation. [Press Release, 11/23/20]

Julián Castro, Former United States Secretary of Housing and Urban DevelopmentAlejandro Mayorkas is a historic and experienced choice to lead an agency in desperate need of reform.

Tom Ridge, Former Secretary of Homeland Security, 2003-2005 "DHS has been somewhat of a political piñata during this administration, so someone who has served as deputy secretary and overseen the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services portfolio will bring a level of confidence to staff and to Congress and will do a great job restoring morale to a much-beleaguered agency … He will hit the ground running." [Washington Post, 11/23/20]Andrea Flores, ACLU Deputy Director of PolicyI am thrilled that the first Latino, first immigrant, and the champion of DACA will be the new leader of DHS.
