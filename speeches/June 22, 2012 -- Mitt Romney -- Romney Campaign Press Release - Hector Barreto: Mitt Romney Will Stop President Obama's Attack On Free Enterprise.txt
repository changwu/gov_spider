    Hector Barreto, the Chairman of the Board of The Latino Coalition, made the following statement on President Obama's remarks at NALEO:
"The economic vibrancy of our nation's Hispanic community has been crushed by the burdensome regulations, uncompetitive tax code, and anti-business policies promulgated by the Obama Administration over the past three and a half years. We can no longer afford to watch our children's dreams slip away because of the failed economic agenda of this President. Governor Romney is dedicated to stopping President Obama's attack on free enterprise and removing bureaucratic red tape and barriers to job creation for small businesses."
