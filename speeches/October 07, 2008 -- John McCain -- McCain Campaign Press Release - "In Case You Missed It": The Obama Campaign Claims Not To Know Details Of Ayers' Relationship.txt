If you don't know somebody very well, do you participate in their book?" Robert Gibbs: "Look, I don't know all the details of this.

On Fox News This Morning, Obama Spokesman Bill Burton Says "No" Obama Did Not Write Anything About Ayers' Book 
Fox News' Megyn Kelly: "I want you give you the chance to set the record straight with the Obama campaign is concerned, because they want to know about this. They cite the fact is they served together on this board, the Woods Fund, which was a community group for several years. That Barack Obama chaired this group, the Annenberg Challenge, that Ayers founded. That Barack Obama wrote a blurb for Ayers' book. That they appeared together on several academic panels. That Barack Obama kicked off his political career in Ayers' Chicago home in 1995. These are the things they cite to us saying these two seem awfully chummy, why shouldn't we care?" 
Obama Spokesman Bill Burton: "Ok, well let me say a couple of things. You already know my point about the McCain campaign purposely trying to distract from the economy because they know they lose when they talk about it. But on the facts, since you asked, as The New York Times sent an investigative reporter to take a hard look at Barack Obama and Bill Ayers' path have some crossed over the course 15 years or so that Barack has been in Chicago. He did not launch his career from Bill Ayers' home. He did not write a blurb for Bill Ayer's book." 
Kelly: "He didn't?" 
Burton: "But instead -- No, he did not."
