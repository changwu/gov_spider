McLean, VA - More than half of Kentucky's Republican State Representatives endorsed Fred Thompson for President of the United States today, calling Fred Thompson the candidate most qualified to win the nomination and the general election in 2008.
Rep. James Comer said: "Senator Thompson has a history of being a strong proponent of conservative values and is a proven leader... Fred Thompson is the clear favorite among the electorate in my legislative district."
House Minority Floor leader, Jeff Hoover, said: "Kentuckians can rest assured that this is a man who shares our Kentucky values and will take them to Washington as he leads our nation in these turbulent times."
