    To the Senate of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit the Protocol Amending the High Seas Fisheries of the North Pacific Ocean between the United States, Canada, and Japan for Senate advice and consent to ratification. The Protocol, along with accompanying Agreed Minutes and Memoranda of Understanding, were signed in Tokyo on April 25, 1978.
The Protocol amends the existing International Convention for the High Seas Fisheries of the North Pacific Ocean. Under the Protocol salmon of United States origin will receive substantially greater protection than afforded under the existing International Convention for the High Seas Fisheries of the North Pacific Ocean signed on May 9, 1952. An amendment to the existing Convention, rather than sole reliance on the provisions of the Fishery Conservation and Management Act, is being sought in order to obtain the continuing benefits of the abstention principle established by the existing Convention, and to overcome the practical management and enforcement problems which .occur in areas of the high seas where United States origin salmon intermingle with salmon originating in other countries.
I transmit also for the information of the Senate the report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol and associated documents.
I urge the Senate to act favorably at an early date on this Protocol.
