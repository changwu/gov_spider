    
Mic-drop moments from the first Democratic debate.
Hillary took the stage last night for her first debate of the campaign primary—and she more than did us proud. Here are eight moments we loved (and apparently we weren't the only ones):
1. She made reproductive rights part of the conversation.

Hillary was the first candidate to confront Republican attacks on Planned Parenthood ? and the last.


  Let it be known that Hillary Clinton is the first person in this debate to bring up repro rights #ImWithHer #DemDebate— Meg Yee (@meghanyee) October 14, 2015

2. She refused to back down from a fight.

You don't spend decades fighting for American families without making a few enemies along the way ...


  okay @HillaryClinton just rattled off a fabulous list of enemies! #ImWithHer #DemDebate— Jimmy williams (@Jimmyspolitics) October 14, 2015


  Best enemies list: HRC #ImWithHer— Jennifer Cunningham (@JCSKDK) October 14, 2015

3. She took on the gun lobby.

Thoughts and prayers aren't enough. We need to act on gun violence.

  "It's time the entire country stands up against the @NRA!" @HillaryClinton #DemDebate YES!!!— Lynn Margherita (@lemnosalt) October 14, 2015

4. She laid out the facts.

Can't argue with that.

5. When she shut it down in one word.

Because sometimes ?no? is a complete sentence.


  Hillary was like straight "NO" ???????????????????? #DemsDebate #ImWithHer #ITrustHillary— Kiki (@Kiki1788) October 14, 2015


  ?Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond??

?No.?

Oh hell yeah. #ImWithHer #DemDebate— Evan Sutton (@suttnutz) October 14, 2015

6. She agreed with Bernie Sanders.

Americans want to talk about issues, not emails.


  Oh my gosh. An adult debate focused on the ISSUES. No name-calling! It can be done!!

7. She shared her M.O.

That's something we can all get behind.

8. She fired back at the boys' club.

One of these things is not like the others ?
