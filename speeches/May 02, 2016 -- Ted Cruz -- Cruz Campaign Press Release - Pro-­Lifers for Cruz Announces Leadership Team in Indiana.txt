    HOUSTON, Texas - Today, Ted Cruz announced a strong team of Pro­-Lifers for Cruz leaders in the state of Indiana who are actively recruiting people who support life across the Hoosier state. These leadership team members join the more than 23,000 Pro­-Lifers for Cruz nationwide who have joined the coalition and stood up for life in support of Ted Cruz.
"I am heartened by these pro-­life leaders from Indiana who are coalescing behind our campaign. These are leaders on the front lines in the fight to protect the sanctity of life and they have my greatest admiration for their grit and determination," said Cruz. "Life is a gift from God. It is our most basic right. Without life, there is no liberty. I am proud to have defended life for my entire career. If I am elected President, I will continue this fight from the White House and defend the dignity of life at every opportunity. I feel energized by the large number of people who have joined us here in Indiana and across the country in this coalition and look forward to working with them to protect and defend the sanctity of life."
