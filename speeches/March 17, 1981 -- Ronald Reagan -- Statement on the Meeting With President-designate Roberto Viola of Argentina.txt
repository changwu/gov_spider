    I am glad to have had this chance to meet and talk with President-designate Viola on the eve of his inauguration as President of Argentina. We have had a good discussion on bilateral and multilateral issues of concern to our respective countries. I look forward to efforts by both governments to further improve our relations, and I have extended to General Viola my best wishes for his tenure as President.
