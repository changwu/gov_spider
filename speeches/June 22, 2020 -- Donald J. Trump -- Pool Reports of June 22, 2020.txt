In-town pool report #1 
Greetings from a sunny and muggy morning at the White House.
President Trump has no public events today on the schedule. He is slated to have a 1 pm lunch with the Vice President, which is closed press. This morning, the President has been tweeting about mail-in ballots and John Bolton.
Your pooler's temperature was not checked coming into the White House today. The tent at the north gate entrance where White House medical staff had been taking temperatures and asking about symptoms has been removed. Your pooler did submit to a COVID-19 nasal swab test in lower press, in case the 13-person protective press pool is unexpectedly called in to a room with the President during the course of the day. (So far, there is no sign that may happen.) As usual, I was told, "No news is good news," and I won't hear about the result unless I am positive for the virus.
Note that the White House added a 1 pm press briefing with Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, according to the updated guidance sent out his morning.

In-town pool report #2 - statement on temperature checks at the White House 
Your pooler asked why the temperature check procedures had changed at the White House.
In response, here's a statement from Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere:
"In conjunction with Washington, D.C. entering Phase Two today, the White House is scaling back complex-wide temperature checks. In addition to social distancing, hand sanitizer, regular deep cleaning of all work spaces, and voluntary facial coverings, every staff member and guest in close proximity to the president and vice president is still being temperature checked, asked symptom histories, and tested for COVID-19."
