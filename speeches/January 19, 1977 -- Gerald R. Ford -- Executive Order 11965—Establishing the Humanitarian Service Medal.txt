    By virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States of America, and as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, it is hereby ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. There is hereby established a Humanitarian Service Medal with accompanying ribbons and appurtenances for award by the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of Transportation with regard to the Coast Guard when not operating as a Service in the Navy. Individuals eligible for the medal are members of the Armed Forces of the United States (including Reserve Components) who, subsequent to April 1, 1975, distinguished themselves by meritorious participation in a military act or operation of a humanitarian nature. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation for the Coast Guard will determine types of acts or operations that warrant award of the medal.
SEC. 2. The Humanitarian Service Medal and ribbons and appurtenances thereto shall be of appropriate design approved by the Secretary of Defense and shall be awarded by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation for the Coast Guard under uniform regulations, as prescribed by the Secretary of Defense. The regulations shall place the Humanitarian Service Medal in an order of precedence immediately after the Vietnam Service Medal.
SEC. 3. No more than one Humanitarian Service Medal shall be awarded to any one person, but for each subsequent participation in a humanitarian act or operation justifying such an award, a suitable device may be awarded to be worn with that medal as prescribed by appropriate regulations of the Military Departments.
SEC. 4. The Humanitarian Service Medal or device may be awarded posthumously, and when so awarded, may be presented to such representative of the deceased as may be deemed appropriate by the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of Transportation.
