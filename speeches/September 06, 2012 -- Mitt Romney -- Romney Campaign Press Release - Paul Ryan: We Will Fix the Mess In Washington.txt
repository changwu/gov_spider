PAUL RYAN: "So here is our commitment. We are not going to duck the tough issues and kick the can down the road. We are going to lead and fix this mess in Washington. And we are not going to spend the next four years blaming people from the last four years. We're going to take responsibility and get the job done, reach across the aisle and fix this problem, get people back to work, create jobs, growth."
