    AUSTIN â€” Gov. Rick Perry today released the following statement on South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley's call to remove the Confederate flag from the capitol grounds:
"The decision to remove the Confederate flag needs to be made by the people of South Carolina, and Gov. Haley's leadership today honors the people of Charleston, and the families of the victims of last week's horrific hate crime.
Removing the flag is an act of healing and unity, that allows us to find a shared purpose based on the values that unify us. May God continue to be with the families of the victims in Charleston, and the great people of South Carolina."
