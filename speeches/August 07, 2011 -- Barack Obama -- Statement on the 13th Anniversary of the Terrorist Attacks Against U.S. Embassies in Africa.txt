    Today marks the 13th anniversary of Al Qaida's terrorist attacks against the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The United States joins with the people and Government of Kenya, where 218 people lost their lives and over 5,000 were injured, and Tanzania, where the attack killed 11 people and wounded at least 85 others, to remember and reflect on those who were injured and the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives.
These attacks in East Africa stand as testament to Al Qaida's commitment to use unspeakable violence to kill innocent men, women, and children, regardless of their religion, race, or nationality. The death of Harun Fazul, the architect of these terrible acts, on June 11, 2011, was an important blow to Al Qaida and its ability to threaten so many innocents around the region. Today the remembrance of these tragic attacks spurs us to continue to work closely with our allies in East Africa and around the world to bring terrorists to justice and to redouble our efforts to prevent these attacks in the future. We join with our friends and allies in advancing peace and security for Americans, Kenyans, Tanzanians, and all people in building a world that is worthy of the legacy of the victims of these bombings. And as we extend our hearts and prayers to the families of those killed, we pledge that they will not be forgotten.
