  A Proclamation

Americans increasingly look to the water for recreation and relaxation, and this year approximately one-quarter of them will enjoy boating in one of its many and varied forms.
It is of paramount importance that those involved in recreational boating recognize that observance of proper safety practices is essential to the enjoyment of boating. In order to protect their families and friends, all persons who use our waters should be courteous and well-versed in safety rules and the techniques of safe boating operation.
Since learning the fundamentals of safe boating adds to the pleasure of boating, participants should take advantage of the many boating courses offered by Federal and State agencies and private organizations.
In addition, all persons should wear a personal flotation device while on the water. Seventy-five percent of those who died in boating accidents last year might have been saved had they worn these devices.
In recognition of the need for boating safety, the Congress enacted the joint resolution of June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 161) as amended, requesting that the President proclaim annually a National Safe Boating Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning June 5, 1983, as National Safe Boating Week.
I also invite the Governors of the States, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, and the Mayor of the District of Columbia to provide for the observance of this week.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 25th. day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.

RONALD REAGAN
