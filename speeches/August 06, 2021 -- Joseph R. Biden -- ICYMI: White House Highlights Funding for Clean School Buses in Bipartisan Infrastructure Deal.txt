    Today, Axios highlighted provisions in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal to invest in producing thousands of clean school buses, as part of President Biden's commitment to manufacturing zero-emission vehicles in the United States and addressing the climate crisis.
The legislation includes $5.625 billion for electric and low-emission school buses, "with at least 50% of that funding going toward zero-emission school buses. The funding is set to produce around 12,000 new electric school buses, all made in the U.S., as part of the President's domestic manufacturing push to "Buy American" products.
National climate adviser Gina McCarthy told Axios: "These buses will be made here in America and create good paying union jobs all while making sure our students breathe cleaner air."
Yesterday, President Biden announced steps his Administration is taking to drive the electric vehicle future forward in America, reduce our emissions, and help tackle the climate crisis. His plan will strengthen American leadership in clean cars and trucks by accelerating innovation and manufacturing in the autos, bolstering the domestic supply chain, and growing jobs.
