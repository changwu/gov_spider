    FELLOW Americans and peace-loving men and women everywhere today mount the death of one of the greatest architects of peace in our time: Dr. Ralph Bunche.
Present at the founding of the United Nations and engaged since its inception in its most delicate and demanding missions, Dr. Bunche never relented in his persistence to advance the cause of brotherhood and cooperation among men and nations.
America is deeply proud of this distinguished son and profoundly saddened by his death. But we are also strengthened by the inexhaustible measure of dedication and creative action that spans his splendid career.
His calm and wise counsel will be sorely missed in the chambers of the United Nations. His role in the effort to bring peace to the Congo and the Middle East will be widely remembered for many years to come.
For the credit he brought to our Nation and for the service he gave to all mankind, let each of us pause in tribute to this great man.
