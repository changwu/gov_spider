    Former Ambassador Robert H. Tuttle is announcing his endorsement of Hillary Clinton today. Tuttle served President Reagan as an Assistant to the President, and as Reagan's Director of Presidential Personnel. During the administration of George W. Bush, Tuttle represented the United States as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom:
"The Republican nominee for President has no government experience and has done nothing in his career to demonstrate that he is competent to be President. He has made repeated misstatements and inaccurate statements. He has insulted minorities, women, a war hero and Gold Star parents. He is unqualified and unfit to be President. "I have never voted for a Democrat but I will vote for Secretary Clinton."
Tuttle is the latest Republican leader to step forward, put party ahead of country in this election, and endorse Hillary Clinton for President. He joins other Republican and Independent voters who simply cannot vote for Donald Trump because he is unfit and unqualified to be our President and Commander in Chief and who recognize Hillary Clinton's experience and commitment to work together to build our economy and protect our security.
Together for America will work to build the coalition of Republicans and Independents who are supporting Clinton and help amplify their voices to Republican and Independent voters. As more Republicans and Independents endorsers step forward, the list will continue to grow. Additional Republicans and Independents can get involved in this effort at togetherforamerica.com.
