    New Hampshire State Senate Majority Leader and Romney for President supporter Jeb Bradley made the following statement on President Obama's visit to New Hampshire:
"Three years ago, candidate Obama came to New Hampshire and promised that he would turn around our country's economy. Three years later, it is clear that President Obama has failed to deliver on the promises he made to Granite Staters. Our country cannot afford to continue on the same failed path that he is leading us. Mitt Romney has the proven record as a successful businessman needed to lead our country in a new direction. That is why New Hampshire voters will support him next November."
