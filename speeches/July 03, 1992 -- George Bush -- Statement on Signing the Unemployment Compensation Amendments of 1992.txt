    Today I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 5260, the "Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1992." This legislation would extend the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program to March of next year. Without this extension, the EUC program would expire on July 4th.
Unemployment has a profound effect on people's lives. The extension of the EUC program is consistent with my strong and sustained commitment to providing needed assistance to the unemployed and their families while the economy recovers. These benefits will provide critical support to unemployed Americans until they can find jobs. I am pleased that the Administration and the Congress worked together successfully in the last few days to enact this important extension of benefits.
I call on the Congress to move rapidly on my economic growth package, with hopefully the same bipartisan spirit of cooperation. Enactment of these reforms and incentives is essential to creating the jobs that all Americans want. Action on them is long overdue. I urge the Congress now to turn to this unfinished business and to quickly enact my program for economic growth and job creation to ensure a strong, sustained recovery and long-term economic prosperity for our Nation.
