    THE BOULDER DAM construction will proceed as rapidly as possible. The determination of the points of law raised by the State of Arizona will be expedited so far as the Government is concerned, and in the meantime, I am in hopes that the States may be able to get together and compose their difficulties. They are not so far apart as to make such a settlement at all infeasible.
