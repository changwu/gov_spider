    I want to convey my sincere gratitude to the Senate for confirming Julien X. Neals as a judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and Regina M. Rodriguez as a judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, both with bipartisan support.
I was honored to include both of them in the very first nominations I made to the Federal Bench, and they embody the professional excellence and devotion to the rule of law and our Constitution that the American people expect of Federal judges. They are both highly qualified, and they represent the diversity that is one of the ultimate strengths of our Nation, in all branches of government, including the judiciary.
Other nominees are awaiting confirmation who also have bipartisan support, and I hope they will be rapidly confirmed as well.
I am also thankful that we are on track to have confirmed the most judges by July of the first year of a President's first term in over 50 years. I look forward to continuing to make nominations at an historic pace and working closely with the Senate on many more confirmations.
