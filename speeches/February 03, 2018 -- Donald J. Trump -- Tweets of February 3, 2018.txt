Rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49% a far better number than I had in winning the Election and higher than certain 'sacred cows.' Other Trump polls are way up also. So why does the media refuse to write this? Oh well someday!Retweets: 34992Favorites: 156630

This memo totally vindicates 'Trump' in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!Retweets: 39282Favorites: 141909
