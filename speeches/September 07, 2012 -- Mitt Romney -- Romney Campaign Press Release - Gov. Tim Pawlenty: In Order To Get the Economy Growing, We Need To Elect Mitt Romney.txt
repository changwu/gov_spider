    Former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty today made the following statement on the August unemployment report: 
"With unemployment unacceptably high for a 43rd month in a row, today's jobless numbers confirm that President Obama's imaginary recovery isn't working – especially for the millions and millions of Americans still struggling for work. Equally concerning, our national debt broke the $16 trillion barrier this week and we learned that some 47 million Americans are living on food stamps. Clearly, our country is not better off today than four years ago. It's time to get jobs and the economy growing again – which means it's time to get new leadership in the White House by electing Mitt Romney."
