    The United States condemns in the strongest possible terms today's terrorist attack in the heart of Istanbul's central tourist district, which appears to have targeted Turkish police forces. Our thoughts and prayers go out to those killed and injured, and to their loved ones. This horrific act is only the most recent of many terrorist attacks against Turkey. The United States stands together with Turkey, a NATO Ally and valued partner, as we confront many challenges in the region.
