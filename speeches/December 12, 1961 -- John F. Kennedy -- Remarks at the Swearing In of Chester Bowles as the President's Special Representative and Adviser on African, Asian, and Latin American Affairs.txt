    I WANT to state what a pleasure it is to have Mr. Bowles accept this position of responsibility. As has already been announced, he's going to bear special burdens in the areas of Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, that very vital section of our globe upon which so many pressures and forces now press and beat and move.
He is going to accompany me on our trip this weekend to Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and Colombia in his first days in this office, and then on other occasions will be traveling himself, and with me, and with others of the administration who have special competence in these vital matters.
So I want to say, Ambassador, you've had a long career of public service, but I can think of no job that you've had which carries with it so many responsibilities and burdens. And I think that the members of the Department of State and the members of the White House--and certainly Mr. Rusk, and speaking for myself personally, will count very heavily upon your counsel and experience in the coming days.
So we're glad to have you here.
