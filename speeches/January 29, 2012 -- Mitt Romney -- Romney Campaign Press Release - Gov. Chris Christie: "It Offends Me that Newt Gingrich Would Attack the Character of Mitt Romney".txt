    New Jersey Governor Chris Christie today made the following statement on Newt Gingrich's comments about Mitt Romney's character:
"I know Mitt Romney. I know the kind of father he is, grandfather he is, and husband he is. I have seen Mitt Romney with his kids, and even with my own. Mitt Romney is man of impeccable character. Even though I am not the one being attacked, it offends me that Newt Gingrich would attack the character of Mitt Romney. If Americans are looking for a leader with character, there is no better choice than Mitt Romney."
