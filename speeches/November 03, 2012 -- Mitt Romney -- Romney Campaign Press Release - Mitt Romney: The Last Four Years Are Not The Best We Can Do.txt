MITT ROMNEY: "We have got to lead America to a better place. Now is there anyone that is worried that the last four years are the best we can do? Is there anyone who fears that the American dream is fading away? Is there anyone who wonders whether better jobs and better incomes are slipping from our grasp? I have a clear and unequivocal message and that is America is about to come roaring back. You've seen the differences between President Obama and myself in those debates we had, which I liked very much by the way. He says it has to stay this way. I say it can't stay this way. He's offering excuses. I've got a plan. I want to go to work. He wants to settle. Look, Americans don't settle. We aspire, we reach, we dream, we achieve. And so on November 6th, we're going to come together all across the country for a better future and on November 7th we're going to go to work."
