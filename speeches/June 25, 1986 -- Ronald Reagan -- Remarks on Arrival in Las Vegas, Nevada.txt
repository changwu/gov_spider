    Well, thank you all very much for a very warm greeting. And I happen to have a hunch that a great many of you are out here because you are supporters of a fellow named Jim Santini. And, therefore, all I'll say to you is thank you again for this greeting, which I'm sharing with him and his lovely wife. And I think now maybe you'd like to have Jim Santini say hello to you. And I'll let him do that if you promise me that you'll send him right out of Nevada come November and send him to Washington, DC.
