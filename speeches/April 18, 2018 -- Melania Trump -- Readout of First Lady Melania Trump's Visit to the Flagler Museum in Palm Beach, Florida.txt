    First Lady Melania Trump and Mrs. Akie Abe visited the Flagler Museum in Palm Beach, Florida this morning. Upon arrival, Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Abe were met by Executive Director Erin Manning, and William Matthews, a trustee of the museum. Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Abe toured the lower level of Whitehall, Henry Morrison's original Gilded-Age mansion. Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Abe made stops inside the Drawing Room, Dining Room, West Room, and Grand Ballroom.
Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Abe visited the Flagler Kenan Pavilion where they boarded Henry Morrison's private railcar, Railcar No. 91.
The tour ended in the music room with a performance of the "Anvil Chorus" from the opera Il Trovatore, by Giuseppe Verdi played on Whitehall's 1,249-pipe Odell organ.
"I enjoyed showing Mrs. Abe a timeless part of Florida's history," said Mrs. Trump. "Thank you to the welcoming staff of the Flagler Museum for having us, and for continuing to share Whitehall's historic influence."
