  A Proclamation

Among the most precious gifts a child can receive is a good education. Historically, the primary responsibility for educating our youth has rested with parents. State and local educators stand to assist parents in achieving educational goals. The cooperative effort between parents and educators is the irreplaceable ingredient for American education.
In a free society, we are fortunate to have the right to oversee our children's education. The success of our educational system depends upon the exercise of this right by parents. It is thus fitting that mothers and fathers throughout the Nation should be encouraged to be involved with their local schools and to participate in supportive activities.
It is appropriate that the theme of this year's American Education Week is "American Education and You: Partners in Our Children's Future." Increased teamwork between school, home, church or synagogue, and the community cannot help but add to the quality of our children's education.
As a Nation, we are dedicated to excellence in education. It means a better life for our children as individuals, and it further secures the liberty which we cherish. As James Madison said, "Knowledge will forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives."
Now, Therefore, L Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning November 15, 1981, as American Education Week.
I invite all Americans to form education partnerships in shaping our children's future.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 29th day of Oct., in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightyone, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.

RONALD REAGAN
