    Q. How was your visit, Mr. President?
The President. Just wonderful. You can't be in the presence of someone like that without feeling better about the world.
Q. What do you think about the tax plan?
The President. Well, I can't talk about that now.
Q. What did you talk about with Mother Teresa?
The President. Her work, what she's doing. And just as I said, really, here is someone who's so optimistic about all of us, mankind, and what she's trying to do is very inspiring.
Q. What impressed you most about her, sir?
The President. I guess she's just the soul of kindness and great humility, because in all of her work and all that she's done, she expresses thanks for having had the opportunity to do it.
Q. Thank you, sir.
