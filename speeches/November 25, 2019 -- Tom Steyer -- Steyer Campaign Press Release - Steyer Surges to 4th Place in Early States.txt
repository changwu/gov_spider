    Steyer is now polling ahead of Buttigeg, Yang, Harris, and Klobuchar

(SAN FRANCISCO, November 25, 2019) — Following a strong performance at his second DNC debate, Tom Steyer surged to 4th place in the early states. According to new data released by Morning Consult, Steyer is now polling at 9% in the early states, the highest he's ever polled in this weekly survey. This also represents a 3 point bump from November 4th when Tom polled at 6%, showing clear momentum for the campaign in the states that will have the critical first say in this election.
Heather Hargreaves, Campaign Manager
"Our campaign continues to grow in the polls because the early states critical to deciding our nominee are responding to Tom's vision for our country and see him as the best candidate to beat Donald Trump. As an outsider, Tom knows our system isn't working for real people, and he's the only candidate in this race talking about the bold reforms America needs: term limits to break the corporate stranglehold of Congress, and declaring a national emergency on climate to grow our economy and provide millions of good-paying union jobs. Voters respect Tom's experience of building an international business from scratch, and know that he is the democrat best positioned to go head-to-head with Donald Trump on the economy and expose him for what he is – a fraud and a failure."
