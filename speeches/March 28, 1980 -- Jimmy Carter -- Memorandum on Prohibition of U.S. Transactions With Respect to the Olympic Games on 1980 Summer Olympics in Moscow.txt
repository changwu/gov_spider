    Memorandum for the Secretary of CommerceSubject: Prohibiting Transactions with respect to the 1980 Summer Olympic Games in Moscow
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and statutes of the United States, including the Export Administration Act of 1979, 50 U.S.C.A. app. sec. 2401 et seq., and for the purpose of carrying out my decision against any United States participation in or aid to the 1980 Summer Olympic Games in Moscow, I hereby direct the Secretary of Commerce, by appropriate regulations and to the extent he deems appropriate to carry out the purposes of this directive, to prohibit the export to the U.S.S.R. directly or indirectly of any goods or technology by any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States which are in connection with such Games, and to prohibit payments or transactions which are in any way related to arrangements involving or requiring such exports, where such payments or transactions could provide financial support for such Games. I am taking this action in the foreign policy interests of the United States, and I hereby determine in accordance with the Export Administration Act of 1979 that the absence of the export controls imposed by this Order would be detrimental to the foreign policy interests of the United States and that reasonable efforts have been made to achieve the purposes of such controls through alternative means.
All powers and authorities conferred upon me by the Export Administration Act of 1979 to impose foreign policy controls are hereby delegated to the Secretary of Commerce or any person, agency or instrumentality designated by him to carry out the purposes of this directive.
In carrying out his functions and responsibilities under this Order, the Secretary of Commerce shall consult, as appropriate, with other government agencies and private persons.
