    President Carter has accepted invitations from Prime Minister Begin and President Sadat and will depart Washington on Wednesday afternoon for Egypt and Israel.
The President will arrive in Egypt on Thursday afternoon for talks with President Sadat. He will then fly to Israel on Saturday evening for talks with Prime Minister Begin.
The talks will focus on the peace process, regional security, and bilateral issues.
As he stated last Tuesday, the President believes that we must not allow the prospects for peace which seemed so bright last September to continue to dim and perhaps to vanish. If we do, the judgment of history and of our children will rightly condemn us.
