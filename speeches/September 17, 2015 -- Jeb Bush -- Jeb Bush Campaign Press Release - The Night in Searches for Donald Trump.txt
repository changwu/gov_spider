    It wasn't a very good night for the Donald. Some even called it "low-energy." At one point of the debate, he was quiet for an entire 37 minutes.
But throughout all that, what voters Googled told the real story, so we thought we would tell that with Donald's night in searches.
It started with bankruptcy. Americans were a little surprised to hear that Donald has filed for bankruptcy not once, not twice, but four times.
And then it really picked up steam...
All told, voters turned to Google to learn more, spiking search traffic for terms like "Trump" and "bankruptcy" over 1,350%.
But it didn't stop there. Then the debate turned to Jeb, and when he shut down the Donald's plans for casinos in Florida.
After Donald was misleading on stage about the fact that he unsuccessfully tried to buy Jeb's support for gambling in Florida, debate viewers Googled to find the truth. Voters soon saw that Jeb was right, and Donald was wrong.
Traffic was off the charts â€” up 1,850%.
Are Americans starting to get to know the real Donald Trump? Google says yes.
