    The President. Thanks for coming. Welcome. We're glad you're here. This is Laura; I'm George W. [Laughter] We hope you've had some fun here. I hope nobody pinched Rudolph on the nose. [Laughter] No, nobody did. That's good—Rudolph is happy about that too. [Laughter]
We welcome the students from Stratford Landing Elementary School in Alexandria and Glen Haven Elementary School in Silver Spring. We're glad you all are here. We want to welcome your teachers and your parents. Thanks for coming. We're glad you're at the White House.
I particularly want to welcome those of you here who have got a mom or dad serving our country in the United States military. I know it's hard when they're away; this has got to be a difficult time for you. But we really want you to know that they're doing important work. They're not only protecting the country, but they're helping other boys and girls live in freedom like we do here in the United States, and that's important. So one message I want to give you is, we're really proud of your mom or dad, and you tell them thanks—thanks on behalf of a grateful nation.
And now I get to introduce somebody I'm grateful for, and that's the First Lady of the United States, Laura Bush.
