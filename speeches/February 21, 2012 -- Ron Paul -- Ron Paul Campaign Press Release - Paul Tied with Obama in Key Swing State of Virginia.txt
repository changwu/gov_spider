LAKE JACKSON, Texas — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul ties incumbent President Barack Obama and does well among independent voters in a general election matchup in the key swing state of Virginia, according to a new poll.
Paul ties Obama at 43 percent of combined Republicans, Democrats, and Independents, and the 12-term Congressman from Texas bests the sitting President decisively among the latter category. Among independent voters, Paul leads Obama by 12 percent in the general election, garnering 47 to 35 percent. Paul also does slightly better than his rivals among Virginia's traditionally-conservative Democrats, with 6 percent preferring Paul over Obama in the general election.
"For Republicans to have a serious chance of defeating Obama come November, they should have the organization, fundraising, and stamina required for a protracted 50-state campaign. Ron Paul has that, and he also has broad appeal. Proof of that is in Virginia, where Ron Paul is only one of two choices in the primary and where Republicans, Independents, and conservative Southern Democrats will play a big role in selecting who our next President will be," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Manager John Tate.
In the Commonwealth's Republican Primary slated for March 6th — Super Tuesday — only Paul and Romney will appear on the ballot due to other GOP candidates' failure to comply with ballot-access requirements.
Christopher Newport University conducted the poll of 1018 registered Virginia voters over February 4-13, 2012. The margin of error for the whole sample is +/- 3.1 percent.
