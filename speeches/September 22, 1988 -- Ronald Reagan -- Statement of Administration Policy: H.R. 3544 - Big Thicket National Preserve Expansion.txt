    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Wilson (D) Texas)
The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3544 as premature, pending completion of a review of the proposal to add 14,000 acres to the Big Thicket National Preserve. Absent information on the national significance of this property, and other options for adjusting the Preserve's boundaries, the estimated $28 million acquisition cost cannot be justified.
