    Dole/Kemp Deputy Press Secretary Christina Martin released following statement today on the new Clinton/Gore attack ad:
"If Bill Clinton had any shame left when he woke up this morning, he threw it away with this latest attack ad. It is a moral outrage that this ad made it off the drawing board, let alone onto the air.
"Bob Dole has always fought for families, he's always worked to protect the defenseless, and he has always been one of America's greatest advocates for the young, the sick, and the needy. To imply that Bob Dole would let a child die without her parents at her side shows a moral hysteria so outrageous, so grossly offensive, that it defies description. No wonder more than 50% of Americans have a hard time believing Bill Clinton.
"An apology might not make up for an ad this nasty and spiteful, but it would be a good first step in moving our political dialogue back onto a higher level '
