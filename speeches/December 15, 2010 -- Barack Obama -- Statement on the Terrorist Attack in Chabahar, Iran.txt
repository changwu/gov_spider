    I strongly condemn the outrageous terrorist attack on a mosque in Chabahar, Iran. The murder of innocent civilians in their place of worship during Ashura is a despicable offense, and those who carried it out must be held accountable. This is a disgraceful and cowardly act.
This and other similar acts of terrorism recognize no religious, political, or national boundaries. The United States condemns all acts of terrorism wherever they occur.
The United States stands with the families and loved ones of those killed and injured and with the Iranian people in the face of this injustice.
Together, the people of the world must condemn and oppose all forms of terrorism and support the universal right of human beings to live free from fear and senseless violence.
