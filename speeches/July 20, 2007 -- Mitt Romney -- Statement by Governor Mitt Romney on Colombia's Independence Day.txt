Boston, MA – Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement today regarding Colombia's Independence Day:
"On the 197th anniversary of Colombia's independence, we honor the many contributions that Colombian-Americans have made to our country in business, trade, culture and values. We also express our abiding solidarity with the Colombian people, who are fighting to secure their country's future from leftist guerrillas and narco-terrorists who have thrived on terror, violence and corruption for too many years.
"A safe and prosperous Western Hemisphere requires a strong and democratic Colombia. The United States must continue to provide strong support for Colombia's efforts to combat the ruthless narco-terrorists that operate there. Our partnership with Colombia contributes to our security and our quality of life – sowing stability in a critical region and helping keep deadly drugs off our streets. We can and must consolidate the gains we have made in Colombia by strengthening the economic ties between our countries. The U.S. Congress must treat this vital ally with the respect Colombia deserves and move forward now with the free trade agreement.
"Colombia's future also depends on governments in the region joining forces against the terrorists in our neighborhood. In order to build a freer and more prosperous hemisphere, we must insist that all governments cooperate to deny safe haven to guerrilla groups and terrorists who seek to destabilize our democratic way of life and threaten our future."
