    In my State of the Union Address, I said that delay would mean the death of campaign finance reform, and I called on the Congress to act by July 4, 1997. Passage of effective finance reform must be a priority for this Congress, but we will succeed only if citizens all across the country make clear to elected officials that change is urgent and that public support is broad and deep. Project Independence can help break the logjam that has blocked reform for so long. By building support for the McCain-Feingold and Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform bills, Project Independence will give citizens a voice as we work to reform our politics and renew our democracy.
