    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Kennedy (D) MA and 24 others)
The Administration strongly supports S. 636.
Scoring for Purposes of Pay-As-You-Go
S. 636 could affect both direct spending and receipts; therefore it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The Office of Management and Budget's preliminary estimate is that the net pay-as-you-go effect of the bill is zero.
