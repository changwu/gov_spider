Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement on Veterans Day:
"Today, we honor the men and women who have served our country in the Armed Forces. Every American is grateful for the very extraordinary acts these men and women have performed so that we may continue to enjoy freedom and liberty at home.
"On this day, we also must recommit ourselves to honoring their service when they return home. Every wounded veteran, fallen soldier and grieving family paid the price for our freedom and our security. All they require is the care they and their families need. We are indebted to them for their service and that debt needs to be paid without delay or inefficiency.
"In Massachusetts, Republicans and Democrats were able to work together to expand benefits for our state's veterans. In Washington, we must do the same. This is one issue where party identification does not matter. Our men and women are serving in far away places, and they should always be confident that their government stands behind them. On this Veterans Day, let us make a commitment to our military men and women, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, and mothers and fathers truly worthy of the 21st century."
