    Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following comment in reaction to several states potentially moving to change their primary election dates.
Senator Santorum said, "Anyone who's watched the debates realizes that even as Republicans, there are many issues we don't agree on - but there are two things we all should agree on: Barack Obama has to go and Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina should remain first in the presidential primary process.
These early states have the deserved reputation of testing candidates and ensuring the emergence of the strongest Republican presidential nominee. The Republican Parties in the early states can count on my support to help maintain their vital role in the process. And I ask the other Republican candidates to have the courage to join me in supporting the early states."
