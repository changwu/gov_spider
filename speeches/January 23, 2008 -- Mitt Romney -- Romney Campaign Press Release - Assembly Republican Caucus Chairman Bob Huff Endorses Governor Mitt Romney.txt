Boston, MA â€“ Today, California Assembly Republican Caucus Chairman Bob Huff announced his endorsement of Governor Mitt Romney. He joins previously announced California Romney for President Team Members Tony Strickland, Republican Leader Dick Ackerman, Congressman McKeon, Congressman Campbell, Congressman Herger, and Congressman Rohrabacher.
"Chairman Huff and I both believe that we must keep taxes low, cut wasteful government spending and reverse the current housing crisis facing families in California and throughout the country," said Governor Romney. "I am optimistic we can keep our economy strong and ensure a prosperous future for our children and grandchildren. I look forward to working with Chairman Huff to implement my optimistic vision as President."
Upon the announcement, Chairman Huff said, "There is one candidate with the experience and determination to strengthen our economy and promote job growth in California and across the country and that is Governor Mitt Romney. Throughout his time in the private sector, at the 2002 Winter Olympics and as Governor, he led using fiscally conservative principles, and he will do the same as President. Governor Romney will bring real conservative change to Washington, and I encourage others to join me in supporting his candidacy."
