    I welcome the agreement signed by the Foreign Ministers of Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in New York today normalizing their relations. The agreement is very much in the interest of both nations and will significantly strengthen regional stability while aiding our efforts to negotiate a wider peace in the Balkans.
Both Prime Minister Papandreou and President Gligorov deserve congratulations for demonstrating the courage and determination needed to reach an agreement that was fair to both sides. I hope both governments will now proceed to establish friendly and enduring bilateral relations while taking steps to resolve their remaining differences, including over the name issue.
I also wish to thank U.N. Special Representative Cyrus Vance and U.S. Special Envoy Matthew Nimetz for their tireless efforts in helping to mediate the dispute.
In view of the significant progress represented by this agreement, I wrote to President Gligorov earlier in the week inviting his government to establish diplomatic relations with the United States. I am pleased to announce that I have received his positive response and can confirm that diplomatic relations now exist between our two countries.
I look forward to meeting with the negotiators and representatives of the two countries tomorrow to congratulate them personally on this important achievement.
