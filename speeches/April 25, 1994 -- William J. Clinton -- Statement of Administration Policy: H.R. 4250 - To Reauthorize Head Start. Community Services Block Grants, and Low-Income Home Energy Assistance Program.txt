    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Martinez (D) CA and 7 others)
The Administration strongly supports the reauthorization of the Head Start program contained in H.R. 4250. The Administration appreciates the strong bipartisan cooperation that has facilitated the development and consideration of this reauthorization.
In addition, the Administration appreciates the committee members' bipartisan work on the reauthorization of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and the Community Services Block Grant program. The bill's funding levels for LIHEAP are higher, however, than those proposed in the President's Fiscal Year 1995 Budget, and the Administration will continue to work with Congress on a bipartisan basis to resolve this issue.
