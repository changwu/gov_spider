    OPERATOR: You're connected, ma'am.
MRS. OBAMA: Hello, this is the First Lady, Michelle Obama. How may I help you?
MRS. HARRIS: Hi, I have my daughter right here. She'd like to speak to you.
MRS. OBAMA: I would love to speak to her. Is her name Summer?
MRS. HARRIS: It sure is.
MRS. OBAMA: Okay, I'm ready for Summer.
MRS. HARRIS: Here she is.
SUMMER: Hello.
MRS. OBAMA: Hi, Summer? Is this Summer?
SUMMER: Can you tell me where Santa is?
MRS. OBAMA: I can. Right now, I am looking at the tracker and I can see a dot on the satellite screen. It says that Santa, right now, is flying over Finland. So right now --
SUMMER: Wow.
MRS. OBAMA: Yeah, he is over Finland. And I can see a glowing light, and it looks like, from the satellite, that he's got all nine reindeer with him, and it looks like his sleigh is pretty full. It looks like a full sleigh of toys. So I hope you've been good this year. Summer, have you been?
SUMMER: Yeah.
MRS. OBAMA: What are some of the things you want from Santa?
SUMMER: A Clawdeen Monster High Doll.
MRS. OBAMA: Uh-huh. Sounds exciting.
SUMMER: With a pair of shoes.
MRS. OBAMA: With the shoes? Excellent. Well, it looks like Santa has got a lot of toys ready for good little boys and girls, so -- but Santa only comes to your house after he knows you're asleep. So no matter where he is in the world, you've got to be asleep, okay?
SUMMER: Okay.
MRS. OBAMA: I know it's an exciting night, but you've got to settle in, cuddle up, and in the morning, Santa will arrive, okay?
SUMMER: Uh-huh.
MRS. OBAMA: All right. Well, merry Christmas, Summer. Thanks for calling.
SUMMER: Thank you, First Lady.
MRS. OBAMA: Okay. Bye-bye, sweetie.
SUMMER: Bye.
OPERATOR: Okay. Hi, ma'am.
MRS. OBAMA: Yes.
OPERATOR: We have Owen and Kaelyn Brayden on the line. I'm going to patch them through.
MRS. OBAMA: Okay, sounds good.
OPERATOR: Thank you.
MRS. OBAMA: Hello?
MRS. BRAYDEN: Hi, is this Mrs. Obama?
MRS. OBAMA: Yes, it is. This is Mrs. Obama. How may I help you?
MRS. BRAYDEN: Well, we were just calling to see where Santa is at right now.
MRS. OBAMA: Oh, well, let me check the tracker, because -- do I have some callers on the line who are interested in finding out where Santa is?
MRS. BRAYDEN: You do.
MRS. OBAMA: Who's there?
MRS. BRAYDEN: (Inaudible.)
MRS. OBAMA: Oh, my goodness. Have they been good all year?
MRS. BRAYDEN: They have this year.
MRS. OBAMA: That's excellent. Well, it looks like, from the tracker, that -- I see a little dot flashing, and it looks like Santa is just flying over Estonia.
MRS. BRAYDEN: Oh, okay. Well, my kids wanted to ask you a question; so did my brother, if you don't mind.
MRS. OBAMA: Sure.
MRS. BRAYDEN: Well, thank you.
KAELYN: Hi, Mrs. Obama.
MRS. OBAMA: How are you, sweetie?
KAELYN: I'm good. How are you?
MRS. OBAMA: Good. What's your question?
KAELYN: I would like to know, how many fireplaces do you guys have in the White House?
MRS. OBAMA: Oh, gosh, that's a very good question, and I should know. There's almost a fireplace in every single room, and there are dozens and dozens of rooms.
KAELYN: Oh, my gosh. That's really cool.
MRS. OBAMA: But the fireplace that we -- that Santa usually comes down in our -- in the White House is in the Yellow Oval Room. Yeah, that's where we put our Santa tree. And he usually comes down that one, and that's where Malia and Sasha get their gifts. What about you? Where's your Christmas tree?
KAELYN: It's in our family room or our living room.
MRS. OBAMA: That's exciting. Isn't this, like, the best night of the whole year?
KAELYN: Yeah, I'm really excited. (Laughter.) If you don't mind, my little brother would like to ask you one more question.
MRS. OBAMA: Sure.
KAELYN: Okay, have a merry Christmas.
MRS. OBAMA: Okay, you, too.
OWEN: Hi, Mrs. Obama.
MRS. OBAMA: Hi, sweetie. How are you?
OWEN: Good. How about you?
MRS. OBAMA: I'm doing great. Just excited that it's Christmas Eve. Aren't you?
OWEN: Yes, so am I. I was wondering, when will Santa be in Abbottstown, Pennsylvania?
MRS. OBAMA: He kind of moves -- right now, he's over Estonia. But generally, he can hop all across the globe at any time, because he doesn't get to your house until you're asleep, and kids go to sleep at different times. So right now he's in Estonia, according to the NORAD tracker. But he will be at your house as soon as every child in the house is asleep.
OWEN: Okay.
MRS. OBAMA: Yeah, so you want to make sure you get to bed early, and the sooner you go to sleep, the sooner he'll be there.
MR. BRAYDEN: Well, thank you for the advice. What do you want for Christmas this year from Santa?
MRS. OBAMA: Who, me?
MR. BRAYDEN: Yeah.
MRS. OBAMA: Oh, my goodness. I have what I wanted for Christmas: the President is here with us, and we're all together as a family. I think we were all praying and praying, and asking Santa, and the Tooth Fairy, and every fairy that they could think of -- that's what Malia and Sasha were doing -- that he would be able to be with us on Christmas.
MR. BRAYDEN: So cool. How nice to talk to you, Mrs. Obama. We really appreciate it.
MRS. OBAMA: Thanks so much. You all have a merry, merry Christmas.
MR. BRAYDEN: You, too. Have a great Christmas, Mrs. Obama.
MRS. OBAMA: Okay, we will. Bye-bye.
KAELYN AND OWEN: Bye.
OPERATOR: Hello, ma'am, I'm going to connect you with Victoria, Tenabrie, and Victor.
MRS. OBAMA: Okay, sounds good. Hello, this is the First Lady. Who's on the line, and how may I help you?
MRS. BATTLE: Say, "Victoria."
VICTORIA: Victoria.
MRS. OBAMA: Is it Victoria? Are there some other kids on the line as well?
MRS. BATTLE: Tenabrie, Victor --
MRS. OBAMA: Sounds great. How are you guys doing on Christmas Eve?
VICTORIA: We're doing good.
MRS. OBAMA: Are you excited?
VICTORIA, TENABRIE AND VICTOR: Yes.
MRS. OBAMA: So, we've got a house full of excited kids over here. (Laughter.) How can I help you? Are you looking for Santa?
VICTORIA, TENABRIE AND VICTOR: Yes.
MRS. OBAMA: All right, let me look on the radar tracker. So, okay, I've spotted a little dot, flashing dot that is over -- right now, Santa's sleigh is over the country of Latvia. And he's delivering toys there. It looks like he's got all nine reindeer with him. And it looks like that sleigh is pretty full -- yep, that's what the experts here are saying. We're getting a close-up shot, and it looks like he's got a lot of toys in his sleigh. Pretty exciting, huh?
VICTORIA, TENABRIE AND VICTOR: Yeah.
MRS. OBAMA: So, he's out there -- he's out there working hard; his busiest night of the year. So right now he's delivering toys to the good little boys and girls in Latvia. Have you guys been good this year?
VICTORIA, TENABRIE AND VICTOR: Yes.
MRS. OBAMA: Yeah? What are some of the things you want for Christmas?
VICTORIA: I want an iPad.
MRS. OBAMA: You want an iPad? What else?
TENABRIE: An Xbox.
MRS. OBAMA: Xbox -- (laugter.) Sounds good. Sounds very exciting. Isn't this the best night of the year?
VICTORIA, TENABRIE AND VICTOR: Yes.
MRS. OBAMA: Yeah. Well, we're very excited. And I know -- it sounds like you guys have been good kids, right?
MRS. BATTLE: Mrs. Obama?
MRS. OBAMA: Yes?
MRS. BATTLE: Victoria has a question for you, please.
MRS. OBAMA: Absolutely.
VICTORIA: Is Rudolph on the -- with the reindeers?
MRS. OBAMA: It looks like the -- because there's a little flashing light on this tracker, and the experts think that it is probably Rudolph who's leading the sleigh this year. So he's out there. (Laughter.)
MRS. BATTLE: Good to hear. We called earlier, and he was over China.
MRS. OBAMA: Oh, well, he's moving fast. But now he just passed -- he comes to your house after you've gone to sleep. So he can pop all over the world, so as soon as you guys are asleep he'll be in your neighborhood, okay?
VICTORIA: Okay.
MRS. BATTLE: We're going to bed early tonight.
MRS. OBAMA: That sounds like a great idea. I think we're going to have an early bedtime, too.
MRS. BATTLE: Well, thank you for taking the time to --
MRS. OBAMA: Oh, this is one of the best things I get to do every year. You all have a very merry Christmas, okay?
VICTORIA, TENABRIE AND VICTOR: You, too.
MRS. OBAMA: All right.
MRS. BATTLE: Merry Christmas.
MRS. OBAMA: Bye-bye.
OPERATOR: Ma'am, we're connecting you to Jared Smith, from Wichita, Kansas. And his mother just wanted to let you know that he is special needs.
MRS. OBAMA: Okay, absolutely.
OPERATOR: All right, and here you go.
MRS. OBAMA: Hello, this is Mrs. Obama. How can I help you?
MRS. SMITH: Hi, my name is Annie Smith, and my son, Jared Smith, he's special needs, and I'm sure he'd like to talk to you. And he wants to know where Santa is.
MRS. OBAMA: Absolutely, I would love to talk to him.
MRS. SMITH: All right, here he is.
MRS. OBAMA: Okay. Hi, Jared?
JARED: Hi.
MRS. OBAMA: This is the First Lady, Michelle Obama. How are you?
JARED: Good.
MRS. OBAMA: Are you looking for Santa?
JARED: Yeah.
MRS. OBAMA: Let me take a look at the satellite tracker. I'm here with all of the experts; they've got all this special equipment. Wait a second, I see a flashing light -- I see one, and it looks like -- yep, yep, the light is Santa. They're closing in on it, and they see his sleigh. There are nine reindeer pulling it, and it looks like it's full of toys. He's over the country of Lithuania right now. Wow, he's all the way in Lithuania. But he's moving pretty fast -- lightning speed. But this super-special equipment here can track him at any speed; they can track missiles and satellites, and they can track Santa as well.
So he's out there, working hard. Are you ready for him to come to your house?
JARED: Yeah, ready to come to my house.
MRS. OBAMA: Okay. Well, he only comes after you've gone to sleep, okay?
JARED: Yeah.
MRS. OBAMA: All right. I know you've been very good this year, right?
JARED: Yeah.
MRS. OBAMA: Yeah, well, then he's going to come -- he's going to come. He's got your name on the list. Okay?
JARED: Yeah.
MRS. OBAMA: Well, thanks so much for calling, Jared. I know you're going to have a merry Christmas, okay?
JARED: Okay.
MRS. OBAMA: All right. Take care, sweetie.
JARED: I will.
MRS. OBAMA: Okay, bye-bye.

MRS. OBAMA: You, too. Take care.
MRS. SMITH: All right. Thank you very much. Bye-bye.
MRS. OBAMA: Bye-bye.

MRS. OBAMA: Hi. Taylor, Logan, are you there? This is the First Lady, Michelle Obama. How can I help you?
TAYLOR: I see you watching TV.

TAYLOR: Uh-huh.
MRS. OBAMA: Yeah? Have you been good this year?
TAYLOR: Uh-huh.
MRS. OBAMA: Yeah? Tell me one of the best things you've done this year.

TAYLOR: Mm-hmm.
MRS. OBAMA: Okay, I'm going to look at the satellite. They have a lot of cool machines here that track Santa. Oh, look -- oh, I can see a dot. I can see a dot. It's Santa -- it's definitely Santa. And he's over the country of Belarus. He's all the way on the other side of the planet, but Santa is fast, and he can get to any house in seconds. And he's going to come to your house after you've gone to bed, okay?
TAYLOR: Uh-huh.
MRS. OBAMA: All right. You've got to make sure you're fast asleep though. Are you going to leave Santa some cookies and milk -- maybe some vegetables for the reindeer?
TAYLOR: Uh-huh.
MRS. OBAMA: All right, awesome. Well, you keep being a good boy, okay? Keep helping your mom out, all right?

But I can see from the Santa tracker that he's got his sleigh full of toys, and -- oh! He's got all nine reindeer pulling the sleigh. He looks very busy. But they are -- they're out and about. Santa is delivering toys as we speak. Have you been a -- have you guys been good boys and girls this year?

SAMANTHA: What?
MRS. OBAMA: Before Santa comes to your house you have to be fast asleep, okay?
SAMANTHA: No, I'm always asleep. I always snore.
MRS. OBAMA: All right, that's good. That's great. Well, if you do the same thing he's going to be there in the morning when you wake up, and it's going to be great!
SAMANTHA: Yeah, but can I say something?
MRS. OBAMA: Yes, please.
SAMANTHA: Once, when I was downstairs, I ran up the stairs and then I turned on the light and I saw Santa.
MRS. OBAMA: Did you see Santa? What did Santa say when you saw him?
MRS. HANDRIZAN: What did he say?
SAMANTHA: He said, merry Christmas, and put me to bed. (Laughter.)
MRS. OBAMA: Well, you are a lucky little person, because not many people get to see Santa delivering toys.
SAMANTHA: And I didn't even get to see (inaudible). (Laughter.)

MRS. OBAMA: Six? Wow, you're a big girl this year, huh?
BELLA: Yeah.
MRS. OBAMA: Yeah. Well, you want to know where Santa is right now?
BELLA: Yeah.
MRS. OBAMA: I'm looking at the radar screen, and it looks like -- oh, Bella, this is so cool. I can see Santa. They're closing in on him. He's in the sky. He's got a sleigh full of toys, and right now he's over the country of Romania. And it looks like -- oh, Bella, it looks like Rudolph is pulling the sleigh! Oh, my goodness, this is so exciting.

BELLA: Yeah.
MRS. OBAMA: Anywhere he is in the world, the minute you close your eyes and you're fast asleep, he pops to your house and delivers toys. So you've got to make sure to get a good night's sleep tonight, okay?
BELLA: Mm-hmm -- that might not work so well.
MRS. OBAMA: Why, is it -- it gets a little tough going to sleep when you're so excited?
BELLA: Yeah.
MRS. OBAMA: Well, even if you get a moment's sleep, Santa knows. Because when I was little, I used to have a hard time going to sleep on Christmas Eve, too. It was just too exciting. But you know what you do, is you just close your eyes, and think good thoughts, and count to 100 really slowly -- sometimes you just fall asleep. You want to try that tonight?
BELLA: Yeah.
MRS. OBAMA: Okay. Well, you have a very merry Christmas, sweetie, okay?

And it looks like, if we pull closer in -- I'm going to ask the guys to pull closer in -- it does -- it is Santa. It is Santa, and he has nine reindeer pulling his sleigh, and there's also a flashing light -- they believe that that light is Rudolph. He is pulling. He's leading the sleigh. Santa is looking very happy. He is over the country of Turkey right now.
MRS. CASELLA: Wow. He's on his way!
