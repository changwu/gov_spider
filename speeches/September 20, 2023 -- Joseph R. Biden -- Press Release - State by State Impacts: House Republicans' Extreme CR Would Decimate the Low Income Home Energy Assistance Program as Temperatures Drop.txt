    With less than two weeks before the end of the fiscal year, extreme House Republicans are playing partisan games with peoples' lives and marching our country toward a government shutdown that would have damaging impacts all across the country.
Instead of working in a bipartisan manner to keep the government open and address emergency needs for the American people, House Republicans introduced a continuing resolution this week that makes an 8%, across-the-board cut to programs that millions of hardworking Americans count on—violating the bipartisan budget deal the President and Congress agreed to earlier this year. On top of these indiscriminate cuts, their continuing resolution makes even deeper cuts to several other key programs, including the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)—which families depend on to heat their homes during the winter. With colder weather approaching, House Republicans' extreme CR would cut LIHEAP by over 60%.
Here is what House Republicans' draconian over 60% cut to LIHEAP would look like across all 50 states and the District of Columbia:
