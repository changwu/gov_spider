    Hillary Clinton released the following statement after the United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers and Allied Workers endorsed her campaign for President. The Roofers and Waterproofers join American Federation of Teachers, the Machinists Union, and the Bricklayers Union and the Plumbers and Pipefitters in backing Clinton.
"I am honored to receive the endorsement of the brothers and sisters of the United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers and Allied Workers.
"The Roofers and Waterproofers Union has helped build the mighty American middle class for decades, creating good-paying jobs and careers and protecting workers' rights across the country. They have stood strong against repeated broadsides from Republicans and their corporate allies, who have sought to roll back the hard-won progress we've achieved for American workers and families.
"I have always stood with organized labor, and I will stand with the Roofers and Waterproofers Union as President. I will fight every day to protect and expand workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively, to retire with security and dignity after years of hard work, and to maintain prevailing wage and labor standards. I'm proud that the Roofers and Waterproofers Union will join me in fighting to make America work for people again."
