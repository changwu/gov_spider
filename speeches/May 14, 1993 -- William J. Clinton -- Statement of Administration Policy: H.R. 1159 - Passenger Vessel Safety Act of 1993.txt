    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 5/17/93)(House Rules)(Tauzin (D) Louisiana and 3 others)
The Administration supports H.R. 1159.
Pay-As-You-Go Scoring
H.R. 1159 would increase receipts; therefore it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990.
OMB's preliminary scoring estimates of this bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If H.R. 1159 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within 5 days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending and receipts will be reported to Congress at the end of the Congressional session, as required by OBRA.
