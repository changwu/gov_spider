    Dear Mr. Speaker:
In order to ensure the most effective counter-proliferation capabilities of the United States and respond effectively to the ongoing threat of terrorist activity, I am notifying the Congress of my intent to transfer $10 million from funds provided in Public Law 107-38, the 2001 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Acts on the United States, to the Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction (the "Commission").
These funds are necessary to support the essential activities of the Commission in assessing the capabilities and challenges of the intelligence community regarding the threat of weapons of mass destruction.
The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
