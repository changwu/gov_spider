    Today I am signing into law S. 2890, a bill to establish the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site in Topeka, Kansas, redesignate the Fort Jefferson National Monument as the Dry Tortugas National Park, and provide for studies of the New River in West Virginia and Boston Harbor Islands in Massachusetts.
Although I have signed S. 2890, I will withhold my approval of H.R. 5021, the "New River Wild and Scenic Study Act of 1992," and H.R. 5061, a bill concerning the "Dry Tortugas National Park," because S. 2890 contains the identical provisions of both H.R. 5021 and H.R. 5061.
George Bush
The White House,
October 26, 1992.
