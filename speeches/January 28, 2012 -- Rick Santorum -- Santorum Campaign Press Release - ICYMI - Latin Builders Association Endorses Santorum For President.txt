Sarasota, FL - The Rick Santorum for President campaign is proud to receive the endorsement of the Latin Builders Association.
Rick Santorum said: "I am thrilled to receive the Latin Builders Association's endorsement. It's such an honor, and it further shows the breadth and depth of the support coalescing behind our campaign.  The LBA understands that the current business and regulatory climate created by the Obama Administration is untenable. We need a President who understands that regulations should not be a barrier to business, but a guidepost if we hope to rebuild our economy. As President, I am committed to doing just that to improve the climate for businesses to flourish once again and make America the place where all from around the world envy and strive to come and succeed."
Established in 1971, The Latin Builders Association® (LBA) is the largest Hispanic construction association in the United States. The association, a non-profit organization that encompasses a vast array of individuals and companies related to South Florida's vibrant construction industry, embodies the interests of builders, developers, contractors, architects, engineers, plumbers, electricians and tradesmen. We strive to provide a vital forum for discussion, networking, training/development, and representation at local and state level.
