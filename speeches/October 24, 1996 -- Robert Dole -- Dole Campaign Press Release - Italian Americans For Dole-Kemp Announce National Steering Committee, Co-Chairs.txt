    WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The Dole/Kemp'96 campaign today announced its leadership for the National Italian Americans for Dole/Kemp '96 coalition. The national coalition is chaired by Frank D. Stella, Chairman of F.D. Stella Products, incorporated in Detroit, Michigan.
In announcing the coalition, Stella noted the achievements and diversity of these outstanding Italian Americans from business, industry, sports, entertainment, and government. The coalition will help to carry the Dole/Kemp '96 message to Italian Americans nationwide.
"I am proud to present to you these distinguished Italian American leaders who join with me today in support of the Dole/Kemp ticket. These individuals work hard each and every day in making their communities a better place. They share Bob Dole and Jack Kemp's commitment of a 15% tax cut for working Americans, a strong work ethic, love of family, and love of country. We welcome Italian Americans in every community to our team and hope you will work with us to elect these two great leaders to the highest offices in the United States." Stella said.
