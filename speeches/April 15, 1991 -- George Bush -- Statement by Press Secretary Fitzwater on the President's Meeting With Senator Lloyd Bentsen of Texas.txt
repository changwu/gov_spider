    President Bush had lunch today with Senator Lloyd Bentsen in the West Wing of the White House. The President and the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee discussed Fast Track legislation and related trade issues. "Senator Bentsen has been a strong and steadfast leader in the Senate on the Fast Track legislation," President Bush said. "He is one of our most knowledgeable leaders on trade matters, and his support is crucial as we pursue the Fast Track legislation."
As the world's largest trader, the United States has an enormous stake in the future of the global trading system. Exports have become a vital source of strength to the U.S. economy. In 1990, the nearly 8.5-percent growth in U.S. exports accounted for 88 percent of U.S. economic growth.
In order to sustain the expansion of exports and consequent growth, we must continue our efforts to open world markets. We must maintain our active leadership role. Without an extension of Fast Track, those efforts are futile.
