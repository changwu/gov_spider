"No one is better equipped to repair the damage of the last seven years and repair our standing in the world."
Kulongoski was elected Governor in 2002 and reelected again in 2006, after spending nearly 35 years in public service. As Governor, Kulongoski has focused on education and economic growth, expanding opportunities for working class residents to attend college and obtain the necessary workforce skills, thus creating tens of thousands of new jobs. He continues to push for more investment in education as well as quality, affordable health care, especially for children, and to make Oregon the leader in promoting a healthy economy fueled by green, alternative energy sources. A Marine Corps veteran, no Governor has spent more time addressing the needs of enlisted and National Guard soldiers and veterans.
Gov. Kulongoski began his career as a labor lawyer, helping author the landmark Oregon Public Employee Collective Bargaining Act. Since then, he has served in leading roles across all three branches of state government, including: State Representative, State Senator, Insurance Commissioner, Attorney General and Associate Justice on the Oregon Supreme Court.
"Ted has devoted his life to serving the people of Oregon with integrity and distinction," Clinton said. "I'm honored to have the support of such a fantastic champion for working people, and I'm delighted that he will lead our efforts in Oregon."
