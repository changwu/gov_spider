    The President. [Inaudible]â€”the Prime Minister came to Austin to visit me when I was the Governor of Texas, along with then-Ambassador, now the Foreign Minister. We had a wonderful visit then, and I'm looking forward to a great exchange now. We had a good visit in the car coming here. And I'm so grateful for his hospitality to this most spectacular and beautiful country. It's really beautiful.
