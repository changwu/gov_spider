    Jim Gilmore is a close friend and valuable ally. He answered my call to lead the Republican Party through a challenging and dynamic election. He has done so with fervor and conviction. He has advanced our principles of limited but active government and promoted compassionate priorities that strengthen American families, keep Americans safe, and encourage individual responsibility.
There are few who embody public service the way that Jim Gilmore does, serving as Governor of Virginia, chairman of a national commission on terrorism, and leader of the national Republican Party all in the same year.
There is no greater priority on this Earth than one's family, and I respect and understand the decision Governor Gilmore has made. I wish him the best of luck in all his future endeavors and will continue to seek his wise counsel as a friend and confidante.
