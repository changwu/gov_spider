    Gathers Over 15K Signatures; Announces Full Delegate Slate
Springfield, IL â€“After gathering over 15,000 signatures through an all-volunteer effort, the Clinton Campaign officially filed paperwork today to place native daughter Hillary Clinton's name on Illinois' presidential primary ballot. The campaign also filed its full slate of 119 delegate and alternate candidates who have pledged to support Hillary if they are elected to attend the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and the experience to deliver the change America needs," said national Campaign Co-Chair and Chicago businessman J.B. Pritzker. "She's ready to lead this country from her first day in the White House."
"I am so proud to support Hillary's effort to make history," said childhood friend Betsy Ebeling of Arlington Heights. "Hillary will draw support from every corner of this state."
"I am grateful to all my friends in Illinois for their help in putting me on the ballot in my home state," said Clinton, who grew up in Park Ridge and graduated from Maine South High School in 1965. "I intend to compete everywhere, but I'm thrilled to have such a strong organization in Illinois."
The Clinton Campaign gathered over 15,000 signatures through an organized, statewide volunteer field operation to put Hillary on the ballot. Illinois law requires a minimum of 3,000 signatures and a maximum of 5,000 signatures to qualify. The Illinois Democratic presidential primary is scheduled for February 5, 2008.
The Clinton Campaign also filed its slate of 100 convention delegates and 19 alternates today, representing a broad cross-section of Illinois residents of every background and region across the state.
