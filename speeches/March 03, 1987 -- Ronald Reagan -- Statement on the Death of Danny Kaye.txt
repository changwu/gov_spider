    A comedian, actor, singer, and conductor, Danny Kaye delighted millions the world over with his special talent for making us laugh. His numerous credits on Broadway, on the screen, and on television were all characterized by his devotion to his craft. Even though he was just acting, his genuine love for people came through. Children, especially, felt his warmth and humanity, and he enjoyed a special bond with his young audiences. Danny Kaye could light up a room just by smiling. He shared his talent with the world, and by so doing, made it a better place. He will be missed, and Nancy joins me in extending our deep sympathy to his family.
