    On May 30, 1992, by Executive Order No. 12808, President Bush declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro, blocking all property and interests in property of those Governments. The President took additional measures to prohibit trade and other transactions with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) by Executive Orders Nos. 12810, 12831, and 12846, issued on June 5, 1992, January 15, 1993, and April 25, 1993, respectively. Because the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) has continued its actions and policies in support of groups seizing and attempting to seize territory in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina by force and violence, the national emergency declared on May 30, 1992, and the measures adopted pursuant thereto to deal with that emergency, must continuein effect beyond May 30, 1994. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).
This notice shall be published in theFederal Register and transmitted to the Congress.
