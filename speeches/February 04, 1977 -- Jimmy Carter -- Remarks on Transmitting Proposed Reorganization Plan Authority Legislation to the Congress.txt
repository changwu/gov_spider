    I am looking forward to my first full-scale press conference on Tuesday.
Today, I just have a brief statement to make about a subject that is of importance to me, to the Congress, to the entire Government, and to the people of this country.
I have submitted to the Congress a message--which is available to the people of our Nation to examine--calling for authorization for myself, as President, to reorganize the executive branch of Government. This is a commitment that I made in hundreds of speeches around the country during the 2-year campaign. It was one of the major reasons that I was elected. It requests the same sort of reorganization authority granted to every President from Franklin Roosevelt, in the early thirties, through the administration of Richard Nixon.
If given this authority, I will move aggressively but also carefully, work closely with Congress, and make changes that will be of benefit to all of us in administering the affairs of the people of this country.
I will answer other questions about this and other subjects when I see you Tuesday.
