    My dear Mon:
It is with the deepest regret that I yield to your request to withdraw my nomination of you to be Chairman of the National Security Resources Board. Like you, I am convinced that had your name been permitted to go before the whole Senate, the nomination would have been confirmed.
I want you to know that my faith in you is undiminished. From experience, I know the qualities of integrity, industry and high intelligence that you would have brought to the position for which I selected you. It is unfortunate in the public interest that the Committee charged with considering your nomination saw fit to lay it aside. For the reasons you so compellingly state, I have no choice now but to withdraw the nomination.
With deep appreciation of the fine spirit which prompted your request, I am, as always, with affectionate regards,
Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
