    This administration is committed to opening markets for high-quality goods and services produced by competitive American workers. That was the goal of NAFTA, the GATT negotiations, the APEC conference, the U.S.-Japan framework talks, and a number of other steps my administration has taken. Today I have signed an Executive order reinstituting Super 301. This action will help us reach our objective: open markets that will create better jobs and increase wages at home and abroad.
