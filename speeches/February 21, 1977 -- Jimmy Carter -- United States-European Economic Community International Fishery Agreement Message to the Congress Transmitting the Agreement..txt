    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (P.L. 94-265; 16 U.S.C. 1801), I transmit herewith a governing international fishery agreement between the United States and the European Economic Community, signed at Washington on February 15, 1977.
This Agreement is significant because it is one of a series to be negotiated in accordance with that legislation. I urge that the Congress give favorable consideration to this Agreement at an early date. Since 60 calendar days of continuous session as required by the legislation are not available before March 1, 1977, I strongly recommend that the Congress consider amendment of the "Fishery Conservation Zone Transition Act" in order to incorporate this Agreement within its overall provisions.
