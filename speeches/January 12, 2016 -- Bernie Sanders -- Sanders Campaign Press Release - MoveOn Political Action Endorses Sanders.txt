    BURLINGTON, Vt. – U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday welcomed the endorsement of MoveOn.org Political Action. Sanders won an overwhelming 78.6 percent of the 340,665 votes cast by members, a record number of votes and the largest margin of victory in a presidential endorsement in MoveOn history.
"I'm proud to have MoveOn and its community of millions of members join our people-powered campaign," Sanders said. "MoveOn has spent more than 17 years bringing people together to fight for progressive change and stand up against big money interests. MoveOn's fight to give the American people a voice in our political system was reflected in the group's internal democratic process. I'm humbled by their support and welcome MoveOn's members to the political revolution."
"This is a massive vote in favor of Bernie Sanders, showing that grassroots progressives across the country are excited and inspired by his message and track record of standing up to big money and corporate interests to reclaim our democracy for the American people," said Ilya Sheyman, MoveOn.org political action executive director. "MoveOn members are feeling the Bern. We will mobilize aggressively to add our collective people power to the growing movement behind the Sanders campaign."
MoveOn will mobilize its millions of members in support of Sanders, focusing initially on turning out its 43,000 members in Iowa and 30,000 in New Hampshire.
