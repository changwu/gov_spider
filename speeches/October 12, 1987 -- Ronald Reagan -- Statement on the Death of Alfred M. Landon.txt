    Alf Landon exemplified the very best in public service. He deeply loved his country, and he was motivated by a genuine desire to help his fellow man. As Governor of his beloved Kansas, he brought a commonsense wisdom to the statehouse and earned the respect and affection of political friends and foes. As the Republican nominee for President, he spoke passionately and articulately on behalf of the principles on which our nation was founded.
Governor Landon was a true elder statesman, whose expectations and views were sought and valued by many of us in public life. Until his last days he took a great interest in world affairs and was never too busy to share his thoughts. It was a special comfort to me to know he was just a phone call away.
Nancy and I have very warm memories of our friend Alf Landon and recall with special fondness our visit to his home last month. Though Alf is no longer with us, his work continues through his daughter, Senator Nancy Kassebaum. To the entire Landon family we extend our deepest sympathy and prayers.
