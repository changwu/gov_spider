Boston, MA – Today, Nevada Republican Leader State Assemblywoman Heidi Gansert announced her support for Mitt Romney for President. Assemblywoman Gansert joins Governor Kenny Guinn and former Congresswoman Barbara Vucanovich in supporting Governor Romney.
In announcing her endorsement, Assemblywoman Gansert said, "Governor Romney has a proven record of accomplishment in business, the non-profit world, and in government. Reno voters know that Washington is broken and we can't fix it by sending the same people back. Washington needs change – and change can start in Nevada by sending Governor Mitt Romney to the White House."
Making today's announcement, Governor Romney said, "I thank Assemblywoman Gansert for her support. This election is about change. For too long Washington insiders have made promises, but they haven't delivered. I think we need someone from outside Washington to go in and fix it. I want to go to Washington to cut taxes, end wasteful spending, stop illegal immigration, and strengthen our military and our families. I look forward to working with Assemblywoman Gansert to earn the support of as many Nevada voters as possible."
