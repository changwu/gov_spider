    Today is the fourth anniversary of the start of the Iraq War. Those who have fallen have paid the ultimate price on our behalf and we continue to honor them and their families.
It has become painfully clear over the last few weeks that we are doing a woefully inadequate job of taking care of our wounded. It is imperative that we improve our efforts on behalf of these troops immediately. A nation at war has a solemn obligation to do all it can for those who serve it on the battlefield.
Four years ago, the Bush Administration launched a pre-emptive war in Iraq. Tragically, it misjudged the number of troops needed, miscalculated the cost, and mismanaged the mission. As a result, our nation now finds itself policing a sectarian conflict, our options are much more limited and it seems we're likely to have troops in Iraq for longer than any of us would like.
The President is calling for patience. But Mr. President, the American people's patience has worn thin. It is time to change the course in Iraq so that we can start bringing our troops home.
I am fighting to cap the number of troops in Iraq in order to stop the President's escalation and have proposed a phased redeployment of our troops so we can begin bringing them home. I've introduced comprehensive legislation that, if followed, would provide a roadmap out of Iraq.
I hope that George Bush ends this war. But make no mistake -- if he doesn't, as President, I will.
