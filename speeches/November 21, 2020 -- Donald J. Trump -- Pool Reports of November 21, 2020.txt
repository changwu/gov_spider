 Pool report 1 
?All you need for a perfect late-fall Saturday -- a passed Covid test, blue skies, a little teleconference for the president with his G20 buddies and, now, in the motorcade heading for wherever the First Duffer might go on a Saturday. Motorcade left White House at 9:47. He was wearing a white ball cap and red jacket.
There has been no readout for the pool yet on the call with the G20 that was on his schedule for 8 a.m.
One random White House note: workers on cranes were affixing Christmas wreaths to the Windows while we waited for the president.

 Pool report 2 
?Arrived at Trump National Golf Club at 10:29. Uneventful drive. One man with a large Biden banner as the motorcade crossed the Potomac. A smaller crowd outside the entrance to the club than was the case last weekend. Some trump flags and a sign wanting Four More Years. Another sign: President Trump, Need a Fourth?
Not so supportive were other signs: "trump haikutrump will not be hereto murder our grandchildren.This makes me happy"
Also sign with the drawing of a piece of toast. "Face it. You're Toast"
Pool is holding at lucia's.

 Intown pool report 3 
?Motorcade departed course at 2:08.
The Biden and anti-Trump people had left. The handful of Trump supporters had grown slightly and added five American flags. When a woman drove past them with a sign that said "Mask Up," they booed her.
They were more appreciative of the red jeep with the AME RUN license plates with a Latinos For Trump banner and an American flag. The jeep repeatedly cruised up and down Lowe's Island Blvd.
One woman jogging on the sidewalk paused, lowered her mask ad asked the pool, "They do know he lost, don't they?" She seemed to sincerely want an answer.
