    I am pleased to see that momentum for tobacco legislation is now building in the House of Representatives. The bipartisan comprehensive legislation proposed by Representatives Hansen, Meehan, and Waxman now has over 90 cosponsors committed to reducing youth smoking. This is a good, tough bill. It reaffirms the FDA's full authority over tobacco and includes strong restrictions on advertising and marketing of tobacco products to young people. It contains important protections against exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and tough company-specific surcharges to encourage companies to reduce youth smoking. I look forward to working with Representatives Hansen, Meehan, Waxman and all of their House colleagues to improve this bill in order to protect farmers and farming communities. With this change, I would be pleased to sign this bill. I call upon the House of Representatives to take it up and get down to the serious business of reducing youth smoking in this country.
