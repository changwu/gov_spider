    Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole today donated his September Congressional pension -- a total of $6,650 -- to the National Hispanic Scholarship Fund (NHSF).
The NHSF is a nonprofit organization devoted to helping Hispanic students attend college. In its 21 year history, the NHSF has awarded almost $25 million in scholarships to more than 25,000 students. In 1994, the NHSF gave out more than $3 million in scholarships to 2,531 students at two- and four-year colleges. The NHSF was recently honored by Worth magazine as the most efficient nonprofit organization for spending only 5% of its budget on administrative costs.
Dole donated his August congressional pension check to Sarah's Circle, a local nonprofit organization in Washington, D.C.
