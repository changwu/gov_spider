Travel pool report 5 - pool notes
While pool continues to wait for POTUS in the vans ... some media have asked your pooler if Potus will go to the Miami rally this afternoon featuring Juan Guaido, whom the US recognizes as Venezuela's head of state. I have asked Stephanie, no answer yet. But as time marches on, it's looking increasingly unlikely. Also, rain clouds are building up, and it's sprinkling.
Also: The third annual "Trumpettes" gala to honor President Trump is at Mar-a-Lago tonite. Roseanne Barr is the headliner, acc to the Palm Beach Post.

Travel pool report 10 - Trudeau readout 
>From Judd Deere, deputy White House press secretary:
Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump spoke with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada. The two leaders discussed the historic United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, as well as United States and Canadian efforts to monitor, contain, and mitigate the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus. The leaders also agreed on the need for the People's Republic of China to release the two arbitrarily detained Canadian citizens.
