    Memorandum for the Secretary of Commerce
In my Environmental Message of August 2, 1979, I recognized the special protection that we accord coastal resources such as wetlands and barrier islands through the federal/state partnership established by the Coastal Zone Management Act. It is important to develop effective management organizations for dealing with coastal zone issues so that responsible planning and sound decisions can be made on resource protection and development proposals. I also recognized the fact that our experience in implementing the Coastal Zone Management Act has revealed areas where improvements can be made in identified aspects of federal programs which at times conflict with those of the Coastal Zone Management Act. I stressed the need for a systematic review of all federal programs significantly affecting coastal resources to help assure consistency among federal efforts in achieving the objectives of the Coastal Zone Management Act.
Therefore, I am directing you to conduct a systematic review of all federal programs significantly affecting coastal resources and to evaluate and identify: (1) any conflicts in the policies and objectives of existing programs, particularly conflicts with CZMA goals; (2) whether these programs are being implemented in a consistent and coordinated fashion; and (3) if any program contributes to uneconomical or environmentally unsound development activities affecting critical natural systems. The federal agencies, coastal states, local governments, the private sector, scientists and citizen groups should be asked to participate in the review process.
The review shall be completed within one year, in order to provide the basis for specific recommendations to improve implementation of the Coastal Zone Management Act, to improve federal agency administration of programs and procedures affecting the coastal zone, and to develop any additional legislation to achieve our national coastal management goals.
Please give this assignment your immediate attention.
