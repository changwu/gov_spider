    Named Co-chair of Sen. Cruz's Texas Leadership Team
HOUSTON, Texas — Today, the Cruz for President campaign announced the endorsement of Texas Railroad Commission Chairman David Porter, who will serve as a co-chair to Sen. Cruz's Texas Leadership Team. A CPA from Midland, Texas, Chairman Porter has been a free market conservative voice on the state's governing body over the oil and gas industry.
"Senator Cruz is a leader on energy issues, and I've enjoyed working with him on policies that will make America energy independent and create meaningful jobs in this country," said Chairman Porter. "He's a principled conservative who has my full support for the GOP nomination and as our next President."
Senator Cruz stated, "David Porter is a solid conservative who has served Texas well by fighting for common-sense energy policies. He's been an ally in our fight against Obama reckless policies, I'm honored to have his endorsement, and I look forward to having his help as we work to undo the damage done by this administration in our ability to provide energy and create jobs."
Commissioner Porter was elected statewide to the Texas Railroad Commission on November 2, 2010.
