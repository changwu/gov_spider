    Q. Mr. President, have you heard anything about Saddam Hussein being assassinated?
The President. I only saw a wire service report. And they have no confirmation of that at all.
Q. Is the U.S. ready to turn up the heat on Iraq again, Mr. President?
The President. We want Iraq to comply with the United Nations resolution. And we are insisting that they comply with the U.N. resolution. But I know nothing about the other at all.
