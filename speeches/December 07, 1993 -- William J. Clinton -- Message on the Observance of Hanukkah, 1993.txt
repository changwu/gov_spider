    I am pleased to send my warmest greetings to all who are celebrating Hanukkah.
The Festival of Lights, a joyous holiday that commemorates a miracle, is a fitting time to give thanks for the blessings of the past year. One of those great blessings was the historic handshake between the Prime Minister of Israel and the Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization—something that surely would have seemed a miracle just a short time ago. Hanukkah serves as a reminder that faith and perseverance can sustain us against the most difficult odds.
We live in a world weary of violence and determined to take steps to advance the cause of peace. We live in a nation that has made a renewed commitment to improving our communities and using our rich ethnic heritage to unite us, rather than to divide us. The strong beliefs and confidence that brought victory to the Maccabees and eight days of light to the Temple can guide us as we face the momentous challenges of our times. The eternal lesson of Hanukkah—that faith gives us the strength to work miracles and find light in times of darkness—inspires all of us to strive toward a brighter future.
In this holiday season, let us rededicate ourselves to creating a more peaceful world for all.
BILL CLINTON
