    Thank you very much, Bob.
The opportunity to come to Ann Arbor on this occasion reminds me of another ceremony with many similarities. When you are invited as the husband of the wife who is to christen a ship, where all of the function is in the hands of the wife who is about to break the bottle of champagne before the launching, the husband is totally useless, and he is just there. That is about it. [Laughter]
Well, I am delighted to be here, obviously, to see Betty get this degree. It is a great honor for her and richly deserved. But it is also a great honor to me and to the rest of the family that Betty is being so recognized.
It is like coming back home, for me, to Ann Arbor. I don't think I spent any more enjoyable 4 years in my life than I did here on this campus.
I look over here and see Bob Briggs.1 I learned something about budgeting from you, Bob. We tried to use those good practices in the Federal Government-not with all success, I might add. But it is delightful to be here, and I thank you for honoring Betty, and we are deeply grateful as a family.
Thank you very much.
