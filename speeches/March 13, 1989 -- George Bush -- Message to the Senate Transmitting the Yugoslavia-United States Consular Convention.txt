    To the Senate of the United States:
I am transmitting, for the Senate's advice and consent to ratification, the Consular Convention between the United States of America and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia signed at Belgrade June 6, 1988. I am also transmitting, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
The signing of this Convention is a significant step in the process of improving and broadening the relationship between the United States and Yugoslavia. Consular relations between the two countries are not the subject of a modern bilateral agreement. This Convention will establish firm obligations on such matters as the notification of consular officers of the arrest and detention of their citizens and permission for consular officers to visit their citizens who are under detention and to protect the rights and interests of their nationals and juridical persons.
The people of the United States and Yugoslavia enjoy a long tradition of friendship. I welcome the opportunity through this Consular Convention to improve further relations between our two countries. I urge the Senate to give the Convention its prompt and favorable consideration.
George Bush
The White House,
March 13, 1989.
