    Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal today made the following statement on the disappointing GDP report:
"Today's report of weak GDP growth is yet another consequence of the Obama administration's continued unwillingness to take the actions necessary to jumpstart growth. Given his disastrous track record in managing the economy, it's no surprise President Obama is doing everything possible to dodge the subject. But declining to meet with his Jobs Council is self-defeating. Americans expect leadership from their president. That's not what we're getting."
