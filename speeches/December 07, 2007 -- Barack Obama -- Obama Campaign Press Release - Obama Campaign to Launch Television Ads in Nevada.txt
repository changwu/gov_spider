SCRIPT - "Take It Back"
-----------------------------
OBAMA V/O: I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message.
OBAMA SYNC: I know that I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington. But, I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change.
ANNCR V/O: In the Senate, Barack Obama challenged both parties to pass tough new ethics rules and rein in the power of lobbyists.
And he's leading by example, refusing contributions from PACs and Washington lobbyists who have too much power today.
OBAMA SYNC: They think they own this government. But we're here today to take it back.
