    ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced the Maryland Statewide Leadership Team. This team of Maryland leaders will help organize the campaign's grassroots efforts across the state and will communicate John McCain's message of greater national security, a stronger economy and meaningful government reform.
Each of Maryland's 24 counties and five regions will have designated chairmen at the local and regional level to serve as the points of contact for local volunteers and supporters in each county and region.
John McCain's Statewide Honorary Chair, former Maryland Governor, Robert L. Ehrlich, Jr. said, "John McCain is a leader who the people of Maryland can believe in. He understands the issues important to Maryland voters. John McCain believes that lowering taxes is the best way to create jobs here in Maryland, while Barack Obama believes tax hikes are the solution to our economic problems. Barack Obama also opposes nuclear power and additional drilling, while John McCain believes those opportunities have to be a part of a comprehensive energy solution."
"We need John McCain as our next commander in chief to win the war on terror. He has the experience, judgment and character to lead this nation forward. John McCain has put his country first above his own interests his whole life. We are proud to support John McCain and will work hard to help him to victory in November," Ehrlich concluded.
