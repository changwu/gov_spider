    As we look forward to honoring Human Rights Day this Saturday, December 10, I once again call for the release of the hundreds of political prisoners in Cuba who remain in detention following the July 11, 2021, protests. In the face of oppression, these protestors bravely exercised their fundamental freedoms, including the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. The United States stands with the Cuban people as they stand up for their human rights and a say in the future of Cuba. We will continue to advocate for the release of all who were imprisoned in this brutal crackdown and continue holding accountable Cuban officials responsible for violence against peaceful protests.
