    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Metzenbaum (D) OH and 35 others)
The administration opposes S. 79, which would unnecessarily duplicate current Federal efforts regarding the evaluation and notification of workers of hazards in the workplace. S. 79 is likely to result in substantial litigation and in Federal and private sector tort liability. This legislation would impose enormous costs on employers, consumers, workers, and the Federal Government. If presented to the President in its current form, the President's Senior Advisers would recommend disapproval.
