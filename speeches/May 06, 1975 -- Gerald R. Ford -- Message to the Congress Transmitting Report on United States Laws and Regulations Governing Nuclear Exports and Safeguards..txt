    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with Section 14 of Public Law 93-500, the "Export Administration Amendments of 1974", I am forwarding to the Congress a report on U.S. laws and regulations governing nuclear exports and on domestic and international safeguards. This report considers the effectiveness of such laws and safeguards in preventing the diversion of nuclear capabilities to nonpeaceful purposes.
I have concluded that current laws provide ample authority to control the export and reexport of nuclear-related material, equipment and technology. Nevertheless, existing policies and regulations are constantly being reexamined and changed as appropriate. Domestic safeguards are under continuing review for the purpose of making them even more effective. The international safeguard system will detect and thus help to deter efforts to divert such materials by other nations.
As the volume of material and the nature of facilities grow in the world, commensurate increases and improvements in the international safeguarding system will be needed. The United States is encouraging the strengthening of international safeguards by aiding and supporting IAEA safeguard development efforts. It is also seeking to enhance physical security through the adoption of an international convention. The U.S. is taking the lead in advocating in-depth physical protection measures necessary to preclude terrorist groups from capturing such material or conducting sabotage activities.
I wish to assure Congress that the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons or the acquisition of nuclear explosive materials for possible nonpeaceful uses is a priority concern in my Administration. Whatever efforts are needed to allow the U.S. and other countries to enjoy the benefits of nuclear power, without fear, will be taken by the Government of the United States.
