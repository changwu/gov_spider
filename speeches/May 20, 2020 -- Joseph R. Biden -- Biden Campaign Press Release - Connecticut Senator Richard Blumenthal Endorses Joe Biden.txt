    Today, Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President:
"Joe Biden is the steady hand our country desperately needs. I first came to know Joe through his son, Beau, when we were both serving as our state's Attorneys General. Beau was a smart, strategic fighter who always looked out for the little guy - qualities he inherited from his dad. Joe and I became closer in the aftermath of the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School. In the days, weeks, months and years since, Joe has been an unwavering ally in the fight for stronger measures to stop gun violence - a champion who understands the tragedy of loss as much as he knows the policy of prevention. America deserves to have someone in the White House with the experience and temperament to lead. That person is Joe Biden."
Biden has earned support from more than 130 U.S. Representatives and 25 U.S. Senators. Biden for President has previously announced more than 3,000 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.
