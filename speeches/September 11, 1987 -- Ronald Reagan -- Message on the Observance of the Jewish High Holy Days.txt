    Each year at this time, the Jewish community prepares for the High Holy Days-Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. This period of deep reflection is marked by prayer, repentance, and the giving of charity.
These Days of Awe begin and end with the blowing of the shofar, the ram's horn, whose blasts fill the heart and the mind with their many meanings. The shofar was sounded as Moses ascended Mt. Sinai to receive from the Lord the tablets containing the Ten Commandments, the moral foundation stones of Western Civilization. It was heard again as the Children of Israel entered the Promised Land. And the sound of the shofar and the shout of the people brought down the walls of Jericho.
As Jews the world over come together as one to pray for forgiveness and the blessing of the Almighty in the year to come, Nancy and I join in those prayers for a world of peace. We hope that the great values upon which Judaism is based will be more fully reflected in all of our lives and that we will move closer to that day when "Nations shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall men learn war anymore."
We are pleased to extend our best wishes to all Jewish people in the United States, in Israel, and around the globe as you celebrate the beginning of the year 5748. L'Shanah Tova, may you be inscribed in the Book of Life for a happy and healthy year.
