    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Biaggi (D) New York and Studds (D) Massachusetts)
The administration opposes enactment of H.R. 82, as passed by the House, because it (1) could impose unnecessary economic burdens on municipalities disposing of sewage sludge within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone and (2) would appear to extend Jones Act requirements generally to the Exclusive Economic Zone. H.R. 82 may also be viewed as violating the spirit of understandings with Canada in connection with the negotiation'of the Free Trade Agreement, and give impetus to similar protective legislation by our trading partners.
