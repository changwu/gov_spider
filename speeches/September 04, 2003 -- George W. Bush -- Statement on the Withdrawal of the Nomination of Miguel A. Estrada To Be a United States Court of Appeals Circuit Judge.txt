    It is with regret that, at the request of Miguel Estrada, I have today withdrawn his nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. I understand and respect his decision and wish Mr. Estrada and his family the best.
Mr. Estrada received disgraceful treatment at the hands of 45 United States Senators during the more than 2 years his nomination was pending. Despite his superb qualifications and the wide bipartisan support for his nomination, these Democrat Senators repeatedly blocked an up-or-down vote that would have led to Mr. Estrada's confirmation. The treatment of this fine man is an unfortunate chapter in the Senate's history.
