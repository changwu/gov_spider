    Since Weds. Debate, Inslee Received More Than 28,000 Contributions and over $500,000
Seattle, WA â€“ Inslee for America announced Monday that the campaign has over 110,000 unique donors, bolstered by a surge in momentum after last week's debate. The campaign has received over 28,000 contributions since Inslee's standout performance at Wednesday night's Democratic debate, and has raised over $500,000 since Wednesday night. Inslee's campaign is only 20,000 unique donors away from meeting the DNC's donor threshold for the September debate.
"The more voters learn about Jay Inslee and his climate message, the more they like," said Inslee for America Campaign Manager Aisling Kerins. "This campaign is building momentum at the right time, with more than 110,000 Democrats donating to support Jay Inslee's clear message of defeating climate change. Last week's debate was a turning point in our campaign. Ever since the debate, we have seen a sustained surge of financial support and online engagement. We went into last week's debate with limited name recognition, and came out with the momentum we need to propel Gov. Inslee onto the debate stage in September."
During Wednesday's debate, Governor Inslee's remarks made up 50% of all climate-related discussion in the debate. Inslee was repeatedly referenced by other candidates as the race's leader on climate. Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker both praised Inslee's vision on climate change.
It is clear that without Inslee on the debate stage, climate change will not get the attention or in-depth discussion it deserves. The campaign's momentum since the debate is a sign that voters understand the importance of making climate change the next president's top priority, and that they view Jay Inslee as the candidate who can defeat climate change.
