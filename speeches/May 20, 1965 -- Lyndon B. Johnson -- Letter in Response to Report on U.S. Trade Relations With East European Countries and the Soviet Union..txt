    Dear Mr. Miller:
I wish to thank you and the other members of the Special Committee for the time, effort and careful thought you have devoted to preparing your excellent Report on U.S. Trade Relations with East European Countries and the Soviet Union. The Report provides a searching and balanced analysis of a complex and important subject. It will be of great help to me and to the Congress, and to all interested citizens, in making up our minds about how best to use peaceful trade to help build bridges between ourselves and the USSR and Eastern Europe.
I have asked appropriate members of the government to review the Report, and to recommend to me what steps we should take in the light of the Committee's recommendations.
I congratulate you on a difficult job well done. You have rendered a signal public service.
Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Mr. J. Irwin Miller, Chairman of the Board, Cummins Engine Company, Inc., Columbus, Indiana]
