    The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee announced today that actress Bo Derek is endorsing Rudy Giuliani for President. Derek, a native of California, will aid the campaign's efforts in the state.
"Rudy Giuliani is a problem solver with common sense leadership who made a tremendous and positive difference as Mayor of New York, impacting peoples' lives for the better," said Derek. "Like many Americans, I was impressed with Rudy's strong leadership and calm resolve in the wake of the September 11 attacks. I truly believe that Rudy is the only Republican candidate that can win this election because he has the experience this country needs in these difficult times."
Derek supported President George H.W. Bush in his presidential campaigns in 1988 and 1992. She also campaigned for President George W. Bush during his successful presidential bids in 2000 and 2004. Derek also appeared at the Republican National Convention in 2004 in New York and at the 2000 convention in Philadelphia.
Derek serves as Special Envoy of the Secretary of State on Wildlife Trafficking and as Honorary Chairperson for the Veterans Administration National Rehabilitation Special Events for Disabled Veterans.
