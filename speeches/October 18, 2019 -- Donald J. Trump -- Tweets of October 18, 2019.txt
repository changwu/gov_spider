Tonight we forcefully condemn the blatant corruption of the Democrat Party the Fake News Media and the rogue bureaucrats of the Deep State. The only message these radicals will understand is a crushing defeat on November 3 2020! #KAG2020 https://t.co/QW1Rk99O4bRetweets: 22994Favorites: 77958

Just spoke to President @RTErdogan of Turkey. He told me there was minor sniper and mortar fire that was quickly eliminated. He very much wants the ceasefire or pause to work. Likewise the Kurds want it and the ultimate solution to happen. Too bad there wasn't.....Retweets: 16519Favorites: 68128

.....this thinking years ago. Instead it was always held together with very weak bandaids & in an artificial manner. There is good will on both sides & a really good chance for success. The U.S. has secured the Oil & the ISIS Fighters are double secured by Kurds & Turkey....Retweets: 11918Favorites: 51925

....I have just been notified that some European Nations are now willing for the first time to take the ISIS Fighters that came from their nations. This is good news but should have been done after WE captured them. Anyway big progress being made!!!!Retweets: 14244Favorites: 58502
