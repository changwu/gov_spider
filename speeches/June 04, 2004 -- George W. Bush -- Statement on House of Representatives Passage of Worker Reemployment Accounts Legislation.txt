    I commend the House for passing the "Worker Reemployment Accounts Act," which establishes a pilot program for Personal Reemployment Accounts.
Personal Reemployment Accounts are an important reform in Federal job training, because workers decide how to use the funds to maximize their likelihood of securing a job. A Personal Reemployment Account gives unemployed Americans additional choices and flexibility to help them return to work more quickly. They can use funds from their account to pay for what they need most to help find a jobâ€”special training, childcare, transportation, relocation assistance, or a combination of these. Finally, there is a reemployment bonus that lets workers who return to work quickly keep any leftover funds from their account.
These innovative accounts that I proposed last year put decisionmaking and resources directly in the hands of individuals who need the most help getting back to work. I urge the Senate to pass this important legislation so that we can help every American who wants to work find a job.
