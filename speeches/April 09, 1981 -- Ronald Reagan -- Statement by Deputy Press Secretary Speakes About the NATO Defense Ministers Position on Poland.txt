    The President is very pleased by this strong expression of allied unity. It reflects the results of the full and extensive consultations which the administration has had with our European allies since January 20. The President, the Secretaries of State and Defense, and other senior administration officials have met frequently with European leaders both here and abroad. This series of talks has resulted in common understandings on the key problems facing the Alliance. The President is gratified that that sense of understanding has been made dramatically clear by the statement of the NATO Defense Ministers. He believes the statement has made a significant contribution to the prospects for world peace.
