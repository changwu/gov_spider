    I am pleased that United Airlines and its pilots have reached an agreement at the bargaining table. I commend union and management for working together to resolve their differences in a way that will benefit the traveling public. I am also encouraged that over the last week the aviation industry met with Secretary Slater and pledged to work with my administration to address the service related issues and the long-term outlook for quality customer service.
