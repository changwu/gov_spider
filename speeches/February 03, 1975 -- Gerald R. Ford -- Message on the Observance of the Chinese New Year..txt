    ON THE occasion of the Chinese New Year, Mrs. Ford and I extend our very best wishes to our fellow citizens of Chinese ancestry. We welcome this opportunity to give recognition of the many ways in which Chinese Americans enrich our way of life.
This occasion focuses on your achievements and provides your fellow citizens with a better appreciation for the vast cultural traditions which the Chinese people have given to mankind.
May the Year of the Hare bring each of you happiness and fulfillment, and may it also bring greater prosperity and progress to our nation.
GERALD R. FORD
