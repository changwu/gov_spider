    Mitt Romney today made the following statement on Chen Guangcheng:
"I am heartened and relieved that Chen Guangcheng and his family are on their way to the United States and out of China. I commend the U.S. diplomats and officials who worked to ensure that the Chinese government followed through on its commitments. This episode underscores the need for the United States to forthrightly stand up for the human rights of the Chinese people."
