"Nothing will change until we elect candidates who reject Wall Street money," the narrator says.
To rein in Wall Street, Sanders has proposed a plan to break up big banks and regulate financial institutions that is backed by 170 economists and financial experts.
The ad, set to air in New York, details the corrupt political and economic system that firms like Goldman Sachs have cultivated. "It's the art of the steal and it's hiding in plain site. The ultra-rich employ an army of lobbyists to write tax policy to avoid paying their fair share," the ad begins. "It's a part of the corrupt political system that keeps in place a rigged economy where Wall Street buys off elections and stops meaningful oversight."
