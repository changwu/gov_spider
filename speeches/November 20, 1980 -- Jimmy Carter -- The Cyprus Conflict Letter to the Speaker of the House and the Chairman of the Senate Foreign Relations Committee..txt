    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman: )
In accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-384, I am submitting the following report on progress made during the past 60 days toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus problem.
As was noted in my last report, intercommunal talks between representatives of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots resumed on August 9 under the aegis of United Nations Special Representative Ambassador Hugo Gobbi. Systematic substantive examination of the essential problems dividing the communities began on September 16. The parties have been examining the following general subjects, on the basis of one topic each meeting:
(A) Resettlement of Varosha under United Nations auspices;
(B) Promotion of goodwill, mutual confidence and normal conditions;
(C) Constitutional problems;
(D) Territorial divisions.
Meetings were held on September 24, October 1, 8, 15, and 31 and November 5 and 12. We are encouraged by the fact that the negotiators at these sessions have engaged in serious examinations of their differences and are seeking mutually acceptable solutions. The negotiating atmosphere between the parties has remained congenial.
I am hopeful that the good start achieved by these meetings will develop into sustained negotiations leading to a comprehensive solution. Serious, sustained talks provide the best opportunity for reaching a just and lasting settlement of the issues that face Cyprus.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
