    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, I am transmitting the District of Columbia Government's 1993 budget request and 1992 budget supplemental request.
The District of Columbia Government has submitted two alternative 1993 budget requests. The first alternative is for $3,311 million in 1993 and includes a Federal payment of $656 million, the amount authorized and requested by the D.C. Mayor and City Council. The second alternative is for $3,286 million and includes a Federal payment of $631 million, which is the amount contained in the 1993 Federal budget. My transmittal of this District budget, as required by law, does not represent an endorsement of the contents.
As the Congress considers the District's 1993 budget, I urge continuation of the policy enacted in the District's appropriations laws for fiscal years 1989 - 1992 of prohibiting the use of both Federal and local funds for abortions, except when the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.
