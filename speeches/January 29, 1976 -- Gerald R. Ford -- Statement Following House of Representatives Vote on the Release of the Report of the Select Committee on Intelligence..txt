    I AM pleased that the House of Representatives has taken proper and responsible action to safeguard classified foreign intelligence information.
This action indicates that a large majority of House Members shares my concern that our legitimate classified national security information be denied to our enemies and potential enemies.
Today's vote shows the House Members recognize that the American people want a strong and effective foreign intelligence capability.
As President, I have a constitutional responsibility to protect national security information. Today's House vote demonstrates that it also takes seriously its responsibility to protect national security secrets.
