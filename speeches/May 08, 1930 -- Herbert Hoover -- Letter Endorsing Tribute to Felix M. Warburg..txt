Dear Mr. Rosenberg :
The plan to honor our friend, Felix M. Warburg, is gratifying to me. For many years I have observed his eager and effective work for the welfare of those near and far in need of aid. Especially familiar am I with his leadership of the great projects to bring physical and economic relief and spiritual hope to his Jewish kinsmen across the seas, the victims of war and famine and pestilence.
It is unthinkable that this work should be permitted to end unfinished. What has been accomplished in rescuing and rebuilding human lives is an historic achievement in human engineering. It is characteristic of Mr. Warburg that he should not rest while there still remains the need of helpfulness from America.
It is fitting then that his fellow-townsmen should unite in paying tribute to him by supporting these humanitarian causes with which he has so long been identified. I am glad to join in the expression of esteem and affection for him.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
