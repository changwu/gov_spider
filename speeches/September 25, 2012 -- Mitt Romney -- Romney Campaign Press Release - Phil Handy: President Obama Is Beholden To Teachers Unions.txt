    Phil Handy, Higher Education Co-Chair of Governor Romney's Education Policy Advisory Group, today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's plan to reform education: Â 
"Any plan to grow our economy must include reforming our education system. Education shapes the future of our children, and it shapes the future of our country. President Obama can't reform our failing education system because he is beholden to the teachers unions. A key plank of Mitt Romney's Plan for a Stronger Middle Class involves reforming our educational system. That means giving all students access and a choice to go to better schools. It means rewarding good teachers. It means putting our kids above the unions. President Obama has failed to do that, but it will be a top priority of a Mitt Romney administration."
