    America is back to work. Over the last 4 weeks, fewer Americans filed initial claims for unemployment insurance than at any time in our Nation's recorded history. Our economy added 7.9 million jobs since I took office, more jobs created on average per month than under any other President in history. That's millions of families with a little more breathing room and the dignity a job provides. This historic job growth is a direct result of the American Rescue Plan, which funded our vaccination strategy, reopened schools, and helped grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out. While we have more work to do to combat Putin's price hike and lower costs for families, today's data demonstrate that America is on the move again and the economy is uniquely well positioned to overcome the global challenges brought on by the pandemic and Putin's war of choice.
