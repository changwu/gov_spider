    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Brown (D) OH and 25 cosponsors)
The Administration supports efforts to allow Taiwan to participate in the work of international organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO). To that end, the Administration supports any modality or arrangement acceptable to the membership of the WHO or other international organizations to allow for Taiwan's participation. The Administration has engaged extensively with Taiwan to promote and cooperate on public health issues and has suggested means to promote Taiwan's participation in WHO. However, consistent with our "one China" policy, we do not support Taiwan's membership in international organizations that require statehood for membership, such as the UN and the WHO.
The Administration opposes H.R. 1794, which would require the Secretary of State to submit a report to Congress on Administration efforts to more actively support Taiwan's participation in these organizations, particularly the WHO. This legislated requirement is unnecessary, would be counterproductive to Taiwan's efforts, and could reduce the flexibility of the various parties involved and make it more difficult for Taiwan to participate meaningfully in these organizations. The Administration would be prepared to brief Congress as requested on our ongoing efforts with respect to Taiwan's participation in international organizations.
