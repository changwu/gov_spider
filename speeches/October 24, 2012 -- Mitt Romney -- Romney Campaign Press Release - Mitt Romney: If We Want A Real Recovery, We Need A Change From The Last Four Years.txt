The President said he was a president of change. But in fact he's become a president of status quo. And the policies of the President are a continuation of what we have seen over the last four years." — Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "If you want a real recovery, and I can tell by your response the answer is yes to that, if you want a real recovery, we're going to have to have a real change. The President said he was a president of change. But in fact he's become a president of status quo. And the policies of the President are a continuation of what we have seen over the last four years. He calls his campaign slogan forward. I think forewarned is a better term. The President said that he can't change Washington from the inside, he can only change it from the outside. Well, we're going to give him that chance, you see. Paul and I by finding good Democrats and good Independents and Republicans are going to work to change Washington from the inside, and the different course that we will take from what the President would take is pretty stark in comparison. There is no question but if the President is reelected, you're going to see at the end of four years about $20 trillion in debt. If Paul and I are elected and we will be elected by you, then we're actually going to pull back federal spending, and we are going to cap it at 20% of the economy, and we are going to finally get America on track to a balanced budget."
