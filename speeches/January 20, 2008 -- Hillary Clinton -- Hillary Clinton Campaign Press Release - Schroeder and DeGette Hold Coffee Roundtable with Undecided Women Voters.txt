    (Denver, CO) - Congresswoman Diana DeGette (D-CO) and former Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder (D-CO) held a coffee roundtable with undecided women voters at Common Grounds Coffee in Highlands today.
A group of about 15 women sipped coffee and tea while sharing stories about the personal impact the declining economy, broken health care system, and the war in Iraq have had on their lives and on their community.
Congresswoman Diana DeGette and former Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder discussed why they believe Hillary should be the next President of the United States.
"If you want to know what kind of change Hillary Clinton will bring as President, just look at what she has already done," said former Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder. "She is the leader with the strength and experience to turn our country around and deliver a new beginning for America."
"Hillary Clinton is a strong leader who has proven her ability to deliver the change she talks about. She has the vision and the experience to bring America together to find real solutions to the tough challenges we face," said Congresswoman Diana DeGette.
The coffee roundtable was the latest in a series of events for women interested in learning more about Hillary Clinton.
