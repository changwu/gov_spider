Boston, MA - Governor Mitt Romney today announced that Arizona State Representative Rich Crandall has endorsed his campaign for President of the United States. Representative Crandall will help Governor Romney in his campaign for our nation's highest office.
"Every week we are gaining more support in Arizona, and I am very proud to welcome Representative Crandall to our team," Governor Romney said. "He will play a critical role in our grassroots effort and will help communicate the need for real, conservative change in Washington.
Representative Crandall said, "Governor Romney succeeded in the private sector. He succeeded in turning around the 2002 Winter Olympics and he succeeded fighting for conservative principles in the bluest of states. His leadership is exactly what we need to change Washington."
Last week, approximately 500 Arizona voters signed up to support Governor Romney's campaign. The new supporters were recruited by Governor Romney's Arizona campaign team as part of the national "Sign Up America!" program which resulted in 30,000 new supporters nationwide in 24 hours.
Governor Romney has announced Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio as his Honorary Arizona Chairman earlier this year. Arizona State Senator Chuck Gray and Arizona State Representative Mark Anderson are serving as Governor Romney's Arizona Co-Chairmen.
