(House Rules)
(Rep. Rogers, R-Kentucky)
The Administration strongly opposes the House amendments to Senate-passed H.J. Res. 59, making continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2014, and for other purposes. The Senate acted in a responsible manner on a short-term funding measure to maintain Government functions and avoid a damaging Government shutdown. Rather than taking up that legislation, the House proposes amendments that advance a narrow ideological agenda and threaten the Nationâ€™s economy. By including extraneous measures that have no place in a government funding bill and that the President and Senate already made clear are unacceptable, House Republicans are pushing the Government toward shutdown.
If the President was presented with H.J. Res 59, as amended by these amendments, he would veto the bill.
The House of Representatives should pass the Senate-passed H.J. Res 59. The Senate continuing resolution provides a short-term bridge to allow critical Government functions to operate without interruption. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on appropriations legislation for the remainder of the fiscal year that replaces sequestration and preserves funding for critical national priorities, protects national security, and makes investments to spur economic growth and job creation for years to come.
