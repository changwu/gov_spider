Patti Solis Doyle is making history in a business where it is rare for females to lead major campaigns, and where minorities in key positions are even harder to find. According to Hispanic Business Magazine and HispanicBusiness.com, "Ms. Solis Doyle's role as Hillary Clinton's campaign manager is making her one of the most watched political lever-pullers out there..."
It's an honor for me to be named among the most influential Latinos in the United States," said Solis Doyle. "Our country is in desperate need for a change, and Hillary Clinton is by far the candidate with the strength and experience necessary to bring about that change. As her longtime friend and advisor, I know first-hand the depth of Hillary's commitment to make a better future for our children and our families." she added.
"I have relied on Patti's advice and counsel for the past sixteen years, and I don't know what I'd do without her," said Hillary Clinton. "Her story is really the American story --that it doesn't matter where you were born or what family you were born into -- if you work hard and take responsibility, you can build a better life for your children."
Patti Solis Doyle has been a close advisor to Hillary Clinton since former President Clinton's successful 1992 presidential bid. The Washington Post has described her as "first among equals in Clinton's inner circle."
