    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(SENT 7/23/93)(House)(Lipinski (D) Illinois and 4 others)
The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1964.
The Administration will seek a Senate amendment to authorize the full $300 million requested in the FY 1994 Budget for the Ready Reserve Force (RRF). This is the minimum amount necessary to maintain this fleet of military useful cargo vessels at an acceptable rate of readiness. H.R. 1964 authorizes only $246 million for the RRF, reallocating $54 million to fund new Title XI loan guarantee commitments, a program for which the Administration is requesting no new funding for FY 1994.
