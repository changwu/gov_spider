    Today I am signing H.J. Res. 129, passed overwhelmingly by both the Senate and House of Representatives, which rescinds the proposed pay increase for Members of Congress, executive branch officials, and our Federal judges. I recognize this legislation has been a source of considerable public controversy with much concern about the process by which this pay increase was considered. I applaud the Members of Congress in both the House and the Senate for taking their recorded votes on this measure. The American people deserve to have had this issue openly discussed, debated, and voted upon.
I believe that some level of pay increase is in order, and I will be working with the House and Senate leadership to develop proposals to achieve that end. I would also like to express my special concern about the level of compensation for members of our Federal Judiciary.
