    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House) and SENT to Senate 10/3/92 (Conyers (D) Michigan and Horton (R) New York)
The Administration supports enactment of the amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 3161 that it understands will be proposed by-Congressman Conyers. The amendment includes many of the Administration's proposals and addresses previously expressed concerns regarding the bill.
Provisions that are especially important to the Administration's support for the amendment include those that:

—   Allow the Government to take greater advantage of the commercial marketplace by using commercial products instead of products designed especially for Government use.
—   Allow civilian agencies to streamline acquisitions by giving them authorities comparable to those already exercised by the Defense Department.
—   Reduce regulatory and paperwork burdens by increasing the threshold at which certified cost and pricing data are required.
—   Increase the efficiency of agency procurement programs by raising the small purchase threshold.
—   Authorize pilot programs for testing alternative and innovative procurement procedures that would further streamline the procurement process.
—   Make advisory, rather than mandatory, General Accounting Office determinations that an Executive branch agency should pay a protestor's attorney and other costs. This is necessary to cure the constitutional defect challenged in United States v. Instruments. S.A..
