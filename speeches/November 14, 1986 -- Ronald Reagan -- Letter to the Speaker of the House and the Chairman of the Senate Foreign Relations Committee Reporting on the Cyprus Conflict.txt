    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with Public Law 95-384, I am submitting to you a bimonthly report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question.
The United Nations Secretary General met on September 16 with Mr. Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader, and on September 26 with President Kyprianou. The Secretary General reviewed the Cyprus situation with the leaders of the two Cypriot communities and explored with them ways to carry forward his good offices mission.
The Turkish Cypriot side has accepted the Secretary General's draft framework agreement and taken the position that the Greek Cypriot side should also do so. The Greek Cypriot side has not accepted the document and, instead, has taken the position that priority should be given to discussion of withdrawal of Turkish troops and settlers, international guarantees, and the "three freedoms."
United Nations Under Secretary General Goulding is visiting Cyprus this month to follow up on the Secretary General's discussions with the two Cypriot leaders. He will also be visiting Ankara and Athens.
Secretary Shultz met with President Kyprianou on September 23 in New York. State Department officials met with Mr. Denktash during his September visit to the United States. In those meetings, American officials reiterated support for the Secretary General's good offices mission and urged the Cypriot leaders to cooperate with his continuing efforts.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
