    During his time in the United States Congress, Bill Owens has been a forceful advocate for the people of New York. Bill has helped create jobs and economic opportunity for hardworking North Country families and farmers. And as a proud veteran of the U.S. Air Force, he has protected the interests of our men and women in uniform. Michelle and I thank Congressman Owens for his service, and we wish him, his wife Jane, and their three children the very best in the future.
