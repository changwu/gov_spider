  A Proclamation

Over fifty million Americans sew at home. Their efforts demonstrate the persistence, skill, and self-reliance which are so characteristic of this Nation. The home sewing industry generates over $3,500,000,000 annually for our economy and serves to introduce many younger Americans to activities which lead to careers in such fields as fashion, textile design, interior design and retail merchandising.
In recognition of the importance of home sewing to our economy, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 9,18, has designated September 1983 as "National Sewing Month."
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 1983 as National Sewing Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.

RONALD REAGAN
