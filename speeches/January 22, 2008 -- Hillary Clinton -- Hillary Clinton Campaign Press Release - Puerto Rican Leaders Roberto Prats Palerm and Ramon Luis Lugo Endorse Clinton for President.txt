    Today, Hillary Clinton received the endorsements of prominent Puerto Rican political figures, Democratic Committee Chair Roberto Prats Palerm, and Ramon Luis Lugo. The campaign named Prats Palerm Co-Chair of its National Hispanic Leadership Council and Luis Lugo as an adviser to the campaign in Puerto Rico.
"As First Lady, Hillary championed the Children's Health Insurance Program which today provides healthcare to more than 20,000 thousand children in Puerto Rico," said Prats Palerm. "She would work tirelessly to provide a better life for all our children and families, as she has for 35 years."
In 2004, Prats ran as a candidate for Puerto Rico's Resident Commissioner in the United States for the Popular Democratic Party. He was a member of the Puerto Rico Senate, where he chaired the Government and Public Safety Committee from 2001 to 2004. He also previously served as Federal Affairs Coordinator for then San Juan Mayor Sila Calderon; and worked for then Governor Rafael Hernandez Colon.
Luis Lugo is a leading government affairs consultant in Puerto Rico and has been a key strategist in several Popular Democratic Party campaigns.
"I'm honored to have such strong support in Puerto Rico", Clinton said.
