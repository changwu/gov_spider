    Montana Governor Steve Bullock is the only candidate who's spent his career tackling the root cause of Washington's inaction on many issues. This includes dark money groups like the NRA that spend millions to stall progress to prevent gun violence.
As President, Governor Bullock will crack down on dark money, starting on Day One. Just like he did as Attorney General and as Governor, Bullock will make taking on the corrupting influence of Big Money the defining fight of his Presidency. 
Once we break the NRA's grip on Washington, we'll finally be able to enact common sense solutions — like passing a universal background check, cracking down on straw purchases, and banning assault weapons.
Governor Bullock's Record on Dark Money:

Passed one of the most progressive campaign finance disclosure laws in the country, setting a national standard for clean and fair elections.
Has been called the "biggest threat to Citizens United."
As Attorney General, brought the first challenge to Citizens United all the way to the US Supreme Court. 
Sued the Trump Administration over its new dark money loophole which removes transparency requirements for certain political organizations.
Signed an executive order requiring every business that bids on public contracts to disclose their political spending.
Prohibited foreign money from state elections by banning foreign nationals from direct or indirect contributions in Montana elections.
