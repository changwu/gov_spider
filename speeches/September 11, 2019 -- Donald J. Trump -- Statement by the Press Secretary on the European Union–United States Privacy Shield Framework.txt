    The Administration looks forward to hosting the third annual joint review of the European Unionâ€“United States Privacy Shield Framework in Washington, D.C., later this week. This third annual review will bring together key American and European stakeholders to discuss the functioning, value, and integrity of the Privacy Shield Program, which facilitates compliance with European data protection and privacy requirements in support of transatlantic commerce. Dozens of senior United States Government officials and seven Federal agencies will participate, reaffirming the strong commitment of the United States to protecting personal data and ensuring the ongoing success of the Privacy Shield Framework, which more than 5,000 companies have joined.
The Trump Administration's commitment to robust privacy protections for individuals has never been stronger. Mechanisms like Privacy Shield and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) System protect personal data while bridging the differences between national laws, helping to ensure the free flow of online information in support of global commerce and trade. Privacy Shield is at the foundation of the $7.1 trillion economic relationship between the United States and Europe, while the CBPR System supports $4.4 trillion in trade and investment between the United States and participating APEC economies like Mexico, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Australia, Chinese Taipei, and the Philippines.
The Administration will continue to expand the benefits of the CBPR System to more of our trading partners within and beyond the APEC region, while reinforcing its close partnership with the European Union to ensure the success of the Privacy Shield Framework.
