    Mitt Romney today announced the support of South Dakota Senator John Thune. Senator Thune will serve as a Co-Chair of Mitt Romney's National Advisory Council. "I am honored to have Senator Thune's support," said Mitt Romney. "On the issues that I have been fighting for in my campaign – creating a better business environment, lessening the regulatory burden, and ending Washington's spending addiction – Senator Thune has been a leading voice in the Senate. He will be a trusted adviser as I bring this message to voters, work to reverse President Obama's failed policies, and reform Washington." Announcing his support, Senator John Thune said, "The next election will be the most important in generations. We can choose to continue on the same path with four more years of President Obama's failed policies or we can choose a leader who has the needed experience to lead an economic recovery. Mitt Romney has shown throughout his life in the private sector, as leader of the Olympics, as governor, and in this campaign that he will not back down from difficult challenges. His plans to revitalize the private sector and restore our country's fiscal health are drawn from his 25 year career as a conservative businessman. Washington could use these commonsense principles at such a critical time." Background on Senator John Thune: Senator Thune Was Elected In 2004. He serves on the Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry, Budget, Commerce, Science & Transportation, and Finance Committees. Since 2009, Senator Thune has served as Chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee. Prior to his election, Thune was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.
