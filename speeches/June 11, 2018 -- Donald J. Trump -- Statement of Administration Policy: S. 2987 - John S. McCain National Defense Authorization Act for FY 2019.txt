    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Sen. Inhofe, R-OK)
The Administration appreciates the continued work of the Senate Armed Services Committee (Committee) on behalf of our national defense. The annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) is an essential step in securing the Nation and the Administration supports ultimate passage of an NDAA for the 57th consecutive year.
The Administration appreciates the bill's provisions that enable implementation of the National Security Strategy and the National Defense Strategy, both of which are guided by a return to principled realism for an era of great power competition. The bill's overall authorizations of base national defense funding and Overseas Contingency Operations funding are consistent with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and the President's Budget request for FY 2019.
Given the short timeframe between public release of the bill and Senate action, the Administration is not presenting detailed views at this time. The Administration looks forward to presenting its views on S.2987 in the near future and working with the Congress to address them.
