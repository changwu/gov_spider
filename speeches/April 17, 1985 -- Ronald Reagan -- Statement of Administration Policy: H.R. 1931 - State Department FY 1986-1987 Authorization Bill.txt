    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)(Rep. Mica (D) Florida and eight others)
The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 1931 only if it is amended to delete sections 108 and 120.
Section 108 would preclude voluntary agencies from receiving any refugee resettlement grants from the State Department if other law, sought by the Administration, to keep refugees off welfare for the first ninety days after arrival in the United States is enacted. This would have a disastrous result by effectively barring the State Department from rechanneling initial refugee support assistance through private voluntary agencies. Section 120 would establish a consular and passport services fund by earmarking receipts now credited to the miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury. Establishment of such an independent fund would weaken Executive and congressional oversight and controls over the allocation of approximately $200 million of annual expenditures, hamper both the President and Congress in their determinations of budget priorities, and unduly complicate the provisions of passport and consular services to the public.
