    The President. On this special day, we send our best wishes to you and your family, and especially to the families of our service men and women who are so many miles away from home this Christmas, doing America's work overseas, keeping the peace in the Persian Gulf, and bringing freedom and democracy to Haiti. We salute them as they make the world a safer place for all of us, for our children and for future generations.
Hillary Clinton. And we thank all of you who are giving your time today serving others, the police and fire and medical staffs on duty and all the mothers and fathers, friends and volunteers who are caring for loved ones and neighbors nearby. Thank you all for spreading good will and for showing what the true spirit of Christmas is all about.
The President. As 1994 comes to a close, we wish everyone the joy and peace of this blessed season and good health and happiness throughout the coming year. Enjoy the holiday.
Hillary Clinton. And have a Merry Christmas.
The President. And a Happy New Year.
