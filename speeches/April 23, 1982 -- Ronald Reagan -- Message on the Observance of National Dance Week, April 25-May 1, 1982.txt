    During National Dance Week, Nancy and I are delighted to join with America's dancers, choreographers, teachers, and dance lovers celebrating our nation's liveliest art.
This century has witnessed dramatic growth and innovation in the world of dance, with American choreographers and dancers playing a principal role in defining twentieth century dance around the globe.
Thanks in large measure to the generosity and initiative of individual citizens and corporations, American dance companies have flourished, providing opportunities for many new and talented young artists. These creative men and women have made the United States the dance capital of the world.
In its many variations—ballet, jazz, tap, folk, and modern—dance has become an integral part of America's cultural life, winning the highest accolades both here and abroad.
We ask all Americans to join with us in celebrating dance as a dynamic expression of the American spirit and an important part of our national heritage.
