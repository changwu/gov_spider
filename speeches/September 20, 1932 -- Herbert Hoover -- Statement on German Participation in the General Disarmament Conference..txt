    THE PRESIDENT said:
"With reference to press dispatches from Paris on the German arms question, the position of this Government is clear. The sole question in which this country is interested is in reducing armaments of the whole world, step by step. We are not a party to the Versailles Treaty and its limitation on German arms. That is solely a European question. The United States has already declared that it takes no part in that discussion. We are anxious that Germany shall continue to participate in the Arms Conference which has now such promise of progress for the entire world, and that she shall lend her aid in this great purpose."
