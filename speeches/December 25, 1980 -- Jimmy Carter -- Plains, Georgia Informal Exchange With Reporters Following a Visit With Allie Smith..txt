    THE PRESIDENT. We're sorry all of you can't be with your families. But we're going to go back to Washington tomorrow.
Q. Do you have any Christmas morning thoughts, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, we're very happy to be in a nation that's at peace, and where brotherly love prevails, and we're very glad to be with our family, at home in Plains. We'll be going back to Washington tomorrow so all of the press can be with your families.
Q. Tomorrow?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, tomorrow. Tomorrow afternoon.
Q. What did you get for Christmas?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I got a lot for Christmas. Shirts, books, tools.
Q. What did Mrs. Carter give you?
MRS. CARTER. Books. I gave him books and we gave him—the children and I gave him—[inaudible]—[a bicycle]—and he gave me a television set, because we don't have a television set. [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT. Good luck to all of you.
Q. You might be better off without it. [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT. Maybe so. I don't know.
Q. What do you plan to do for the rest of the day, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT. We're going to eat lunch around here with Rosalynn's folks and go down and see Billy and let Amy see her new school. That's about it.
Q. Do you have any pangs of regret vetoing that bill? The poor Ovesons aren't going to get their $50,000 on Christmas Eve? The bill you vetoed yesterday.
THE PRESIDENT. No pangs. [Laughter]
