Today, Rep. Darrell Issa, former chairman of the House Oversight Committee, responded to an erroneous media fact check trying to undermine Marco's leadership on undermining a critical part of ObamaCare:
Marco was the first to identify this bailout provision in ObamaCare, the first to introduce legislation to stop it, the one who rallied conservative groups and members of Congress, including me, to make it a priority, and the one who pushed then-Speaker Boehner to make it a priority in cromnibus negotiations.
Marco was essentially the general manager of the effort to stop the ObamaCare bailout that saved taxpayers $2.5 billion last year. He built the team of conservative groups and leaders, and he led them to success.
I read the attempt to rewrite history and laughed because it's such typical Washington insider smallball to argue about whose computer was actually used to write the words that made it into a bill, whose paper was it printed on, or who hit send on the final email.
The bottom line is that stopping the ObamaCare bailout of health insurers was Marco's idea. Marco set the agenda on this, got others to buy into his agenda, and make it part of theirs. This is the epitome of presidential leadership.
