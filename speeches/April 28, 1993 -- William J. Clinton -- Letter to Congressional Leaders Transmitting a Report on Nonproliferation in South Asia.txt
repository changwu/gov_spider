As required under section 620F(c) of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1993 (22 U.S.C. 2376(c)), I am transmitting a report entitled "Progress Toward Regional Nonproliferation in South Asia." The report is unclassified.
This is the first report required on this subject and reflects information available as of March 19, 1993. Events after March 18, 1993, will be included in the next report.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
