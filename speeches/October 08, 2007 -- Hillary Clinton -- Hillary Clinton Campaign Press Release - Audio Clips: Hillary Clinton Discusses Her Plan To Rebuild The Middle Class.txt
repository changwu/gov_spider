"I believe that middle class is the backbone of our economy, the key to real growth, and the guarantor of the American Dream. And to paraphrase an old saying, as America's middle class goes, so goes America. And so I judge the health of our economy very differently than this White House judges it. I ask whether our middle class is expanding and getting ahead. Are we on the road to a stronger, more prosperous middle class or not? The Administration has failed that test. My Administration will not."

"Today, I propose a new economic blueprint for the twenty-first century economy, a plan to create the new, good jobs essential to broad-based prosperity; to restore fairness to our economy; And to renew that basic bargain that if you work hard, you can get ahead; and we will put our fiscal house in order."

"We have to change our economic course just as we have to change course in Iraq, and change course when it comes to healthcare. When it comes to the economy, I believe I have the strength and experience to make that change -- to make our economy work again for middle class and for all Americans."

"The secret to America's past economic success is clear: Whenever the economy changed, we changed with it – and we mastered it. We innovated. We invested. We managed downturns – and overcame them. We generated wealth – and made sure that wealth was widely shared."
