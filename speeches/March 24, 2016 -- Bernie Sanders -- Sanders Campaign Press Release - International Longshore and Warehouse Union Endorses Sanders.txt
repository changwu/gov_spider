"It is an honor to receive an endorsement from the ILWU," Sanders said. "This campaign is building a movement of millions of Americans who are demanding that our economy works for everyone, not just the top 1 percent. The working men and women of the ILWU are a vital part of our movement which is spreading to every corner of our country."
"Bernie Sanders is the best candidate for America's working families," said ILWU International President Robert McEllrath. "Bernie is best on the issues that matter most to American workers: better trade agreements, support for unions, fair wages, tuition for students at public colleges, Medicare for all, fighting a corrupt campaign finance system and confronting the power of Wall Street that's making life harder for most Americans."
Democrats in Alaska, Hawaii and Washington will caucus on Saturday to decide how many of 142 pledged delegates each candidate will receive from the three states.
