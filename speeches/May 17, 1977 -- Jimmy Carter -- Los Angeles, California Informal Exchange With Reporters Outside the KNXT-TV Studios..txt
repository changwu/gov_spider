    REPORTER. Mr. President, what did you think?
THE PRESIDENT. I enjoyed it.
Q. Did you?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes.
Q. Did they ask good questions? It is not really much you could do much about, is it?

I was impressed by the large number of questions, for instance, about health care.
Q. Would you consider those as national?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I would consider it. We're just trying to probe around for different ways to---
Q. Do you think it would work on a national basis?
THE PRESIDENT. I would think so. I thought it worked well on the telephone call-in. But it helps me to have the questions because we read them over very carefully afterwards.

Q. Anything in particular that you took away from this today?
THE PRESIDENT. Just a feeling of closeness.
Q. They're not shy about asking tough questions, are they?
THE PRESIDENT. I noticed that.
Q. President Carter, do you plan any more of these? This is your second one now on radio and TV in a month and a half. Do you plan more?
THE PRESIDENT. I think so.
Q. Thank you, sir.
