    Chicago, IL -- "This week's ratification by the Serbian parliament of a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the European Union is an important step in Serbia's integration into the Euro-Atlantic community, further contributing to the prospect of stability and prosperity in the Balkans. The new government of President Tadic and Prime Minister Cvetkovic has again demonstrated the emphasis it puts on consolidating democracy in Serbia and developing the country's integration with Europe. A democratic Serbia that lives in peace with its neighbors, respects the rights of all its citizens, and defends the rule of law deserves the full support of Europe and the United States.
"Building a better future also requires honoring obligations from the past. President Tadic and Prime Minister Cvetkovic demonstrated their commitment to upholding principles of international law and cooperating with the West through the arrest of Radovan Karadzic within days of their government's formation. I have every hope and expectation that the remaining indictees will soon join him in The Hague, thereby bringing Serbia into full compliance with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
"Serbia and the United States have traditionally enjoyed warm relations as partners and allies. It is time for our countries to return to the shared values and mutual respect that served us well in the past."
