    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Rep. Foley (D) Washington and eight others)
The Administration opposes enactment of this bill, because postponing the wheat referendum up to 30 days after adjournment sine die of this session of Congress would make it impossible to provide wheat farmers with final information concerning the content of the 1986 wheat program soon enough to enable them to make informed planting decisions for the 1986 crop.
