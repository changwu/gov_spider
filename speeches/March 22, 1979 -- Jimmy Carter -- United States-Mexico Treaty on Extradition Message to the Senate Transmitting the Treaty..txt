    To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty of Extradition Between the United States of America and the United Mexican States, signed at Mexico City on May 4, 1978.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.
The Treaty is one of a series of modern extradition treaties being negotiated by the United States. It expands the list of extraditable offenses to include narcotics offenses, aircraft hijacking, bribery, and obstruction of justice, as well as many other offenses not now covered by our existing Extradition Treaty with Mexico. Upon entry into force, it will terminate and supersede the existing Extradition Treaty and Additional Conventions between the United States and Mexico.
This Treaty will make a significant contribution to international cooperation in law enforcement. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable considerations to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
