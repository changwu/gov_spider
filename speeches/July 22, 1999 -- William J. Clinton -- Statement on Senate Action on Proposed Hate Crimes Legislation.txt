    I am gratified that the Senate has unanimously passed the strong legislation I proposed to combat hate crimes.
All Americans deserve protection from hate crimes, and that requires us to stand together against intolerance, prejudice, and bigotry. The hate crimes prevention act gives power to those values and will help make our country more safe and secure.
Senate approval of this legislation gives it real momentum, and I call on the House of Representatives to meet its responsibility in combating violence that is fueled by hate. We have some distance to go before the hate crimes prevention act is the law of the land, but tonight's action by the Senate is a big step forward in the journey toward greater protection for all Americans.
