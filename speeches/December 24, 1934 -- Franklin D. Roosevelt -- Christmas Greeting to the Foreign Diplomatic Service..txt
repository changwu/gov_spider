    Toward the close of my second year in office, I send to you and to the members of the Foreign Service in the country of your residence, as well as to your family, personal and official, my cordial Christmas and New Year's greetings.
I want all of you to know that in spite of the distance which separates you from the National Capitol, you are often in my thoughts. We in the United States appreciate the service which all of you are giving to your country.
In a time of great difficulties in almost every part of the world, we are proud of the American Foreign Service. Once more I send you my warm greetings.
