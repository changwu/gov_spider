    Vice President Joe Biden spoke today with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk to congratulate the people of Ukraine on holding successful, orderly, democratic elections despite continuing disruptions of law and order by Russian proxies in the eastern part of the country and Russia's refusal to allow voting in Crimea. The two leaders also discussed the latest negotiations over the supply of gas to Ukraine following Russia's unilateral decision to halt supplies in June, as well as an expanded international financial support program for Ukraine as the new government pursues urgently needed reforms. Finally, the Vice President noted he is looking forward to discussing how the United States can further assist Ukraine during his visit to Kyiv next month.
