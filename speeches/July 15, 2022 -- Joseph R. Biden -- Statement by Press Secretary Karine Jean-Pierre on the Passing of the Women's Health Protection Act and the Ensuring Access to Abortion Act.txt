    This week, we've seen the deeply different approaches that Congressional Democrats and Congressional Republicans have for women's health. Today, House Democrats took an important step in passing the Women's Health Protection Act and Ensuring Access to Abortion Act. These bills would ensure women's access to essential health care services, regardless of where they live, and protect the bedrock right to cross state lines for medical care. A majority of Americans across the country support them. Every single Republican voted against the bill to codify women's right to choose and nearly every single House Republican voted against the right to travel. Senate Republicans blocked a similar bill that would make the right to travel to access medical care a law. It's extreme and it's out of touch.This week, we've seen the deeply different approaches that Congressional Democrats and Congressional Republicans have for women's health.
