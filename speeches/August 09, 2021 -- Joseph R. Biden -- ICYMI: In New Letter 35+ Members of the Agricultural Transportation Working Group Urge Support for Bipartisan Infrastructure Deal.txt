    In a new letter, key associations that represent a variety of agricultural and manufacturing industries urge strong support for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal.
Members of the Agricultural Transportation Working Group write:
"A comprehensive transportation infrastructure bill, while popular, has long been elusive. We urge enactment of this compromise between President Biden and a group of Senate Democrats and Republicans to increase infrastructure spending by $550 billion over five years. The farmers, ranchers, food and beverage manufacturers, processors, package suppliers, farm supply dealers, state departments of agriculture and agricultural product marketers that comprise our collective memberships support and sustain millions of American jobs, many in rural communities. Our members are dedicated to providing safe, abundant, affordable and sustainably produced human and animal food, fiber and agricultural products that benefit U.S. and global consumers. Modernizing America's transportation infrastructure has long been a priority of the ATWG and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act would deliver on this priority by investing an additional $110 billion in U.S. roads and bridges, $65 billion for broadband, and $17.3 billion for ports and inland waterways."
