    I want to thank you all for coming. I just had a discussion with fellow citizens in the Guard, Reserve, and active duty who have been in both Iraq and Afghanistan. I want to thank you for sharing your insights with me. Thank you for your service to the country.
I told these men and women that their service is necessary for the security of the United States of America and that they're serving in historic times. And one day, their children will be able to look back and say, "My dad or my mom went to Iraq and Afghanistan and helped a young country become a democracy, and therefore, the world is more peaceful for it."
One of the things I am going to do is I'm going to meet with the family members of these good people and express our country's gratitude for their service as well. A lot of times military families don't get proper thanks, and I can't wait to meet your loved ones and tell them firsthand that the country appreciates your service.
One thing I told these good folks is that this country stands with the people wearing our Nation's uniform. We're with you. We know the work is hard, but the work is necessary. And we're winning, and we're winning. And the world is going to be better off because of your courageous service, and I thank you for it.
Thanks for letting me come by and visit. I appreciate it.
