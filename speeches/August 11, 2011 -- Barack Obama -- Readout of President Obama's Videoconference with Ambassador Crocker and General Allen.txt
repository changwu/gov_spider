    President Obama and his national security team were briefed today by U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Ryan Crocker and Commander of NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) General John Allen about the situation in Afghanistan. The newly arrived team of U.S. leaders in Kabul underscored the continuing momentum of the coalition campaign, development of the Afghan National Security Forces, and support to the Afghan government as they transition to the lead in security. The President again reaffirmed his commitment to a political solution in Afghanistan and expressed support for the regional engagement agenda laid out by Secretary Clinton, to include a productive international meeting at Bonn in December 2011.
