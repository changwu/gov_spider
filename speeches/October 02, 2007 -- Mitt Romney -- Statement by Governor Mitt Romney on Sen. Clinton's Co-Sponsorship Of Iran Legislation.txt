Boston, MA – Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement regarding Senator Hillary Clinton's (D-NY) co-sponsorship of legislation prohibiting the use of funds for military operations in Iran:
"Yet again, Senator Clinton has broadcast weakness and divisiveness by tying the hands of our military as they confront an Iranian regime supporting terror and racing toward nuclear weapons capabilities that would enable genocide on an unprecedented scale. As General David Petraeus has testified, Iran is supporting Shia militia extremists and violence in Iraq that is taking the lives of American soldiers. America must stand united against these threats and Senator Clinton's actions are fundamentally irresponsible."
Background:
Yesterday, Senator Clinton Announced That She Would Co-Sponsor Legislation Prohibiting Funds For Military Operations In Iran. "Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that she is co-sponsoring legislation introduced by Senator Jim Webb (D-VA) that prohibits the use of funds for military operations against Iran without explicit Congressional authorization (S. 759). Senator Clinton – who has been at the forefront of calling on President Bush to seek authorization from Congress before taking military action against Iran – said today, 'In February, I took to the Senate floor to warn that President Bush needs Congressional Authorization before attacking Iran. Given recent reports about Administration military planning toward Iran and to ensure that Congress plays a proper role in the authorization of any potential military force, today I have added myself as a co-sponsor of a bill introduced by Senator Jim Webb which prohibits the use of funds for military action in Iran without authorization by Congress.'"
