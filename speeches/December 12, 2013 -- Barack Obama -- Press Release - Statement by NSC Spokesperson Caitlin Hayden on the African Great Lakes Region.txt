    The United States welcomes today's signing of declarations ending the M23 rebellion in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. For too long, the people of the African Great Lakes region have suffered as a result of conflict and instability. Today's signing moves us one step closer to bringing decades of violence to an end.
While we welcome this important progress, much work remains. M23 must be disarmed and demobilized. Those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity must be held to account. A regional dialogue around peace and security issues must now move forward to strengthen regional cooperation and resolve the underlying causes of conflict once and for all.
We commend the parties for reaching this accord, and Ugandan President Museveni for his role in bringing the Kampala Dialogue to a successful close. As the countries of the region work to usher in a new era of security and prosperity, the United States and the international community stand with them as partners for peace and for progress.
