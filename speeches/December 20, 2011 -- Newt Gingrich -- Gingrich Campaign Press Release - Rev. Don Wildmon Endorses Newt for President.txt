    Atlanta, GA - Rev. Donald E. Wildmon, founder and chairman of American Family Association and American Family Radio, announced his endorsement today of Newt Gingrich for President of the United States.
 
"Newt Gingrich recognizes the threat to our country posed by judges and lawyers imposing values upon the country inconsistent with our religious heritage, and has proposed constitutional steps to bring the courts back in balance under the constitution," Wildmon said today.
 
He added, "We need someone in the White House who can balance the budget and get the economy moving again.  Newt has done it before and I believe he can do it again.  I am proud to endorse Newt Gingrich for president."
 
Wildmon is the Founder and Chairman Emeritus of American Family Association (AFA) and American Family Radio (AFR).  AFA is recognized as "one of the largest and most effective pro-family organizations in the country." AFR has 190 radio stations in 20 states, six of which are in Iowa, including Burlington, Dubuque, Mason City, Ottumwa, Sioux City and Waverly. 
 
"Don Wildmon has been one of the most important leaders in the country in the battle to uphold our founding principles.  I am humbled and honored to have his endorsement," said Gingrich.
Wildmon lives in Tupelo, Mississippi, where AFA and AFR headquarters are located. He will stump for Newt Gingrich in Iowa in advance of the Iowa Caucus on January 3rd.
