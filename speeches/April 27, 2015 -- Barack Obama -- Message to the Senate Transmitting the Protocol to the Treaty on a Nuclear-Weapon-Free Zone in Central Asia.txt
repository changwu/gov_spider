    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to its ratification, the Protocol to the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia, signed at New York on May 6, 2014 (the "Protocol"). I also transmit for the information of the Senate the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia (the "Treaty") to which the Protocol relates, and the Department of State's Overview of the Protocol, which includes a detailed article-by-article analysis of both the Protocol and the Treaty.
Ratification of the Protocol is in the best interest of the United States, as it will enhance U.S. security by furthering our objective of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, strengthen our relations with the states and the people of Central Asia, demonstrate our commitment to the decision taken at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons that helped secure that Treaty's indefinite extension, and contribute significantly to the continued realization of the Central Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in all its aspects. As the Department of State's Overview of the Protocol explains, entry into force of the Protocol for the United States would require no changes in U.S. law, policy, or practice.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Protocol and give its advice and consent to its ratification, subject to the statements contained in the Department of State's Overview of the Protocol.
