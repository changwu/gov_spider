    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 Budget amendments for the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, State and Other International Programs, as well as the Corps of Engineers. Also included is an amendment to a Government-wide general provision. These amendments will not increase the overall discretionary budget authority in my FY 2013 Budget.
In addition, this transmittal contains FY 2013 amendments for the Legislative Branch. As a matter of comity and per tradition, these appropriations requests for the Legislative Branch are transmitted without change.
These amendments are necessary to reflect correctly policies assumed in the FY 2013 Budget. The details of these amendments are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
Barack Obama
