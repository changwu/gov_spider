    The President. August was a month of accomplishment here in Washington. Today I signed a supplemental which provided needed money for our military, money for the ongoing war on terror, and money for homeland security.
Next week I'm going to sign a trade promotion authority bill, which is very important for American workers. Today the statistics are out that show that the unemployment rate is holding steady. We've got a lot of work to do to make sure people can find work, and this trade bill is going to help a lot. It's going to help our ranchers. It's going to help our farmers. It's going to help people find jobs.
I signed a bill that says loud and clear that if you try to fudge the numbers, if you're a CEO of an American corporation and you don't tell the truth, you'll be held to account.
And when you look at these accomplishments and you couple them with the tax cuts, the education bill, the brownfields legislation, it goes to show what is possible when people in this town set aside politics and focus on doing what's right for the American people. It goes to show that when we put our partisanship aside, when people stop all the yelling and hollering and finger-pointing and say, "How can we help the American people," we can get a lot done in this town.
I pledge to the American people, I'll continue leading Washington by defusing all the ugly talk, by keeping big goals in mind, by always remembering we're here to represent the American people.
I hope you all have a fine weekend. I look forward to seeing you on Monday, and then I'll be signing that trade bill on Tuesday.
Thank you very much.
