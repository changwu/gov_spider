    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Dodd (D) CT and 2 others)
The Administration supports the purposes of the activities authorized by S. 1454 â€” respite care for disabled and seriously ill children and nursery care for abused and neglected children. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is currently operating temporary child care and crisis nurseries activities under the special authority which S. 1454 would extend. However, the Administration believes that extension of the special authority for these activities in S. 1454 is unnecessary. HHS has authority for these activities under section 426 of the Social Security Act (child welfare research and demonstration projects)* HHS will continue to fund these demonstration projects in FY 1990 under the section 426 authority. S. 1454 would also greatly increase the administrative and paperwork burdens imposed on the States.
