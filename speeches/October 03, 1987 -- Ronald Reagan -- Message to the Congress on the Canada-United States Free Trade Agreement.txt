    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with section 102(e)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended ("Act"), I hereby notify the Congress of my intention to enter into a trade agreement with the Government of Canada on January 2, 1988, contingent upon a successful completion of negotiations. On December 10, 1985, I provided written notice of such negotiations to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, as required by section 102(b)(4)(A)(ii)(I) of that Act.
In accordance with the procedures specified in the Act, I will submit any such agreement that I sign, together with implementing legislation and statements of administrative action, for Congressional approval in accordance with the fast track legislative procedures set forth in section 151 of the Act.
