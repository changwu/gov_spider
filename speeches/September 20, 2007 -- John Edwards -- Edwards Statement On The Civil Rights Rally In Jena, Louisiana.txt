    Chapel Hill, North Carolina â€“ Today, John Edwards issued the following statement about the rally in Jena, Louisiana:
"Today we are reminded where the true power in America lies. It's in places like Jena, Louisiana, where thousands of regular people of good conscience are standing up for the America we all believe in: an America where fairness, equality and opportunity are the birthright of every child.
