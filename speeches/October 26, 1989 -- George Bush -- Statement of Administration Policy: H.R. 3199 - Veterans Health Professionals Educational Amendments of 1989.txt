    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Smith (R) New Jersey and 55 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 3199. The Administration will seek an amendment in the Senate, however, to require that individuals receiving educational assistance from the Department of Veterans Affairs under H.R. 3199 maintain satisfactory participation in the Selected Reserve. Without such a requirement, H.R. 3199 would contribute little to relieving military medical manpower shortages.
