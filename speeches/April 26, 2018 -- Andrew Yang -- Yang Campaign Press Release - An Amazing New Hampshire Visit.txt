    THANK YOU, New Hampshire. New Hampshire showed why it votes first in the primaries embracing bold new solutions like Universal Basic Income.
Yang and team met with Democratic legislators, party Chairman Buckley, many news outlets and many locals.
America has a shortage of jobs. Many people are working extra hours for less. Big companies are pushing people into contract jobs paying their own expenses with no real employment.
We must transition to Human Capitalism and help Americans pay their bills.
Let's put Humanity First. The tour starts now.
