    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Congressman Henry Gonzalez.
Congressman Gonzalez was a trailblazer and a leader for all of Texas. From his election to the San Antonio city council and the Texas Senate to his successful career in Congress, Henry spent more than 40 years serving his State and his country. He was the first Hispanic to serve in the Texas State Senate in more than 100 years and the first Mexican-American elected from Texas to serve in Congress.
As chairman of the House Banking Committee, Congressman Gonzalez championed the issues of America's working families, fighting tirelessly for economic justice, civil rights, banking reform, and affordable housing. His work over the decades was recognized with countless honors and awards, including the 1994 John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage award. Henry will forever be remembered as a man of conviction and humility who devoted his life to lifting people up and building bridges of understanding.
Our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, Bertha, his children, and his family and friends.
