"U.S. Intelligence official overstated assessment of Russian efforts to help Trump." @FoxNews @GreggJarrett They supposedly told Crazy Bernie that Russia was looking at him, not me. This is all a big scam between Intel and the Democrats. They want Bernie OUT, & hate "Trump".Retweets: 18648Favorites: 70116

..It has been a scam right from the beginning with the illegally started Mueller Report, FISA, the leaking, lying & more. Schiff should not have access to Intelligence, he is a corrupt pol. "Amazing that they went to Bernie Sanders, but not to President Trump." @marthamaccallumRetweets: 12069Favorites: 45307

"Sotomayor accuses GOP appointed Justices of being biased in favor of Trump." @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews This is a terrible thing to say. Trying to "shame" some into voting her way? She never criticized Justice Ginsberg when she called me a "faker". Both should recuse themselves..Retweets: 24886Favorites: 93577

....on all Trump, or Trump related, matters! While "elections have consequences", I only ask for fairness, especially when it comes to decisions made by the United States Supreme Court!Retweets: 14024Favorites: 59593

Cryin' Chuck Schumer is complaining, for publicity purposes only, that I should be asking for more money than $2.5 Billion to prepare for Coronavirus. If I asked for more he would say it is too much. He didn't like my early travel closings. I was right. He is incompetent!Retweets: 28254Favorites: 124772

There has rarely been a juror so tainted as the forewoman in the Roger Stone case. Look at her background. She never revealed her hatred of "Trump" and Stone. She was totally biased, as is the judge. Roger wasn't even working on my campaign. Miscarriage of justice. Sad to watch!Retweets: 23934Favorites: 95881

That is because they cover your favorite President relatively well. @CNN & MSDNC are dying in the ratings! https://t.co/dhlZlbyg2NRetweets: 13075Favorites: 53010
