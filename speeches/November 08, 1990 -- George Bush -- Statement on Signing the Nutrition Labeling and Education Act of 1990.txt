    Today I am signing H.R. 3562, the "Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990." This legislation amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require nutrition labeling on certain foods and to regulate health claims about nutrients in foods.
This Act makes two significant changes in current law. First, it requires food manufacturers to include more nutrition information on their labels to assist consumers in selecting a healthful diet. Second, H.R. 3562 would prohibit food manufacturers from making health claims on their labels unless the claims are permitted by the Department of Health and Human Services.
I note that one provision of the Act requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to contract for a study of the effectiveness of the regulations implementing certain provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and to undertake regulatory action using the results of this study. As the Constitution requires, I understand this provision to reserve to the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to formulate the regulatory proposals required by this legislation, taking into consideration the recommendations of the contractor's study.
