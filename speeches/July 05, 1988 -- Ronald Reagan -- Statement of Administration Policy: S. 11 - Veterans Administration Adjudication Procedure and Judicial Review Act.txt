    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)(Cranston (D) CA and 31 others)
The Administration opposes enactment of S. 11 because the bill is unnecessary and would not be beneficial to veterans. The present system of appealing adjudication of claims for veteran benefits within the Veterans Administration is working efficiently and fairly, and has not resulted in injustice. In view of this record, the potential costs and burdens associated with judicial involvement in the day-to-day process of claims adjudication, as required by S. 11, are unjustified. In addition, S. 11 makes unnecessary changes to the structure and operations of the Board Of Veterans Appeals.
