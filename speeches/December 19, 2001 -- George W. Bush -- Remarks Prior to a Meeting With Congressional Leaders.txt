    Economic Stimulus Package
I am proud to report that members of both political parties and both bodies of Congress have come to an agreement as to how to stimulate our economy and how to take care of people in need, people who have lost their job.
I'm proud of the Members around this table for making the conscious decision to work together to answer some serious needs that face our country. A lot of people have lost their jobs and don't have health care, and the people around this table said, "I want to do something about it," and they proposed a very constructive, real plan.
A lot of people around this table understand that in the long term we've got to make sure our economy grows. And so we've provided stimulus to the economy, most of which affects middle-class America. The income tax rate reduction affects those making $27,000 to $65,000 a year, hardworking Americans who could use help coming into the holiday season.
I can't thank the chairman, the Speaker, the leaders around this table for recognizing that there's something more important than politics, and that's to do our jobs, to recognize we have a serious problem and address it and solve the problem.
This bill can pass both bodies. This bill will pass the House; it's got enough votes to pass the Senate. And therefore, I look forward to working with both bodies in any way I can to convince those who are reluctant to get a bill done that this makes sense for America, so we can leave for Christmas knowing full-well that we've done the people's business.
Again, congratulations to you all. I want to thank you for your work, thank you for your care for America. Thank you all.
