    President Obama spoke with President Karzai this morning via video teleconference. The two leaders spoke for approximately one hour and discussed a number of topics, including the impact of the death of Osama Bin Laden on the fight against terrorism and on regional dynamics, their shared commitment to Afghan-led reconciliation, progress on forging an enduring U.S.â€“Afghan strategic partnership, and transition to Afghan leadership for security. The President expressed his sorrow over tragic civilian casualties, most recently in Helmand province. Both leaders noted that the Taliban are responsible for the great majority of civilian losses, and agreed that every loss of civilian life is a tragedy and undermines our mission that focuses on protecting the population. The two leaders agreed to maintain their close consultations going forward.
