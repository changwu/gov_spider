    John Kasich Takes Presidential Campaign to Snapchat with Bacon Filter Ad
TIME - Sept. 2, 2015
Ohio Gov. John Kasich's presidential campaign is pioneering a new form of ad on Snapchat, wishing New Hampshire residents a good morning with a bacon-laced filter on the photo and video sharing app.
The ad, which features Kasich's campaign logo as strips of bacon, is the first Snapchat geofilter ever to be offered by a specific time-of-day, with users from the Granite State seeing the ad from 6 a.m. to noon Wednesday. It is also the first time a campaign has purchased a geofilter ad, the company confirmed. A similar ad by a group opposed to the Iran deal that was ran in Ohio received 2.6 million views last month.
The filter is the latest reflection both of Snapchat's growing penetration into political advertising, as well as Republican candidates' efforts to reach out to younger voters who have traditionally spurned the GOP and make up much of the company's user base.
