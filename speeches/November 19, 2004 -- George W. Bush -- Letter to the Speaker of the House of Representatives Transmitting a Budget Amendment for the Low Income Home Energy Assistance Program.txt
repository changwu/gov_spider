    Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2005 budget amendment for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program in the Department of Health and Human Services. I designate $300 million in requested contingency funding for this program as an emergency requirement.
The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
