    The President today announced that he will nominate Duane C. Sewell, of Livermore, Calif., to be Assistant Secretary of Energy for Defense Programs.
Sewell was born August 15, 1918, in Oakland, Calif. He graduated from the College of the Pacific in 1940 and did graduate work in physics at the University of California at Berkeley until his graduate education was interrupted by the war in 1941 and he began work the Manhattan Project.
Sewell returned to Berkeley after the war, and in 1950 became development coordinator for the MTA linear accelerator project involving the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory and the California Research and Development Corp. at Livermore. When the Livermore site of the Radiation Laboratory was founded in 1952, Sewell became a staff member of the director's office, later holding the title director of scientific operations.
Sewell was named associate director for support in 1959, and during the 1960's directed the efforts of more than half the laboratory's staff, those involved in scientific and engineering support. Since 1973 he has been deputy director of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.
