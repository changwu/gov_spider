    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)(Wolpe (D) Michigan and 234 others)
The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 2800, but will work in the Senate to lower the bill's appropriation authorizations, and to provide the Environmental Protection Agency greater flexibility with respect to the bill's data collection requirements.
