    Jane Sanders makes a swing through Wyoming to stump for her husband ahead of the April 9th caucuses.









Monday morning's stops included a meeting with the Northern Arapaho council members in Fremont County and a meet and greet in Lander, Wyoming at local favorite cafe "Lander Bake Shop." In the evening Ms. Sanders was joined by political activist Jim Hightower for an enthusiastic town hall discussion in Casper, Wyoming with over 100 people in attendance. Discussion covered local concerns such as the coal jobs loss crisis, heroin epidemic and women's health rights.
At one point a member of the audience joked that "every democrat in Casper was in the room."
