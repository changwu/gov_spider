Wilmington, DE (July 24, 2007) - Tomorrow, Wednesday July 25th, Dr. Jill Biden, wife of Sen. Joe Biden, will ride in Day 4 of the Des Moines Register's Annual Great Bike Ride Across Iowa. She will be joined by other members of the Biden family.
"I know everyone in Iowa is excited for RAGBRAI and I'm excited to join them" Dr. Biden said. "It will be wonderful to ride with them and my family through parts of northern Iowa."
The Register's Annual Great Bike Ride Across Iowa, or RAGBRAI, started as a challenge between two Des Moines Register writers in 1973. On its 35th year, RAGBRAI has grown to become one of the most popular bike rides in the world. The seven-day, 472-mile ride stretches across Iowa, beginning in Rock Rapids in Iowa's northwestern corner and ending in Bellevue, which sits along the Mississippi River. Over 10,000 riders are participating.
Dr. Biden and her family will meet with fellow bikers in Aplington and ride with them to the UNI Dome in Cedar Falls where she will attend a reception along with seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong and other riders. The Biden Bike Team will stop in Stout for refreshments. A detailed schedule is included below.
The Biden for President Campaign will be blogging from the race. Their dispatches from the road can be viewed at www.JoeBiden.com/Iowa.
