    Yesterday I signed a supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 6685, which will continue funding for numerous Federal agencies and programs which need the money on an urgent basis. While I do not believe this bill goes far enough to reduce spending, it does represent significant improvement over two previous proposals.
Since last April, I have vetoed two supplemental funding bills because appropriations were far too highâ€”H.R. 5922 and H.R. 6682. Both of these vetoes were sustained, and in the wake of these vetoes, the Congress went back to work and slimmed down spending plans. Altogether, this process of vetoes and reconsideration by the Congress has saved the taxpayers more than $3.6 billion.
While we still have a long way to go before reining in the budget monster, the restraint and compromise in this bill bring us one step closer to control. Under the circumstances, I consider this action a sound economic measure and a victory for the American taxpayer over runaway Federal spending.
