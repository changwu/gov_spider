    As a key piece of "Bidenomics," today's announcement means that roughly 80,000 qualifying families would see their child care copayments capped at 7% of their income and nearly 200,000 providers would start being paid on-time instead of retroactively
Today, Vice President Kamala Harris announced that the Biden-Harris Administration is taking transformative steps to lower child care costs for working families and support child care providers in communities across America. Responding to President Biden's historic Executive Order on care, the new actions strengthen the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) program, which supports 1.5 million children and their families.
"I strongly believe that when we lift up the economic status of families, we lift up the economic status of communities," said Vice President Harris. "Our entire economy and our entire nation benefits as a result."
The Vice President unveiled a proposed rule that would cap child care copayments for qualifying families at 7% of income, encourage states to waive copayments altogether for families at or below 150% of the federal poverty level (for example, a family of four making at or below $45,000), and make it easier for families to access the CCDBG program by encouraging states to accept online applications and making siblings of children who are enrolled presumptively eligible. It would also improve financial stability for child care providers by ensuring they are paid on-time instead of retroactively.
The announcement builds upon a core pillar of the "Bidenomics" agenda by lowering child care costs and improving the financial stability of providers so more parents can find care.
