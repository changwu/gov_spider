    Today, the Office of National Drug Control Policy's (ONDCP) United States Interdiction Coordinator (USIC) recognized exceptional performers from the interagency interdiction community. These annual awards recognize individuals and units which have demonstrated exceptional innovation, tactics, aggressiveness, and results in the effort to stem the flow of drugs into the United States.
"These award-winning interdiction teams are confronting the drug threats that challenge our nation on a daily basis and they are truly protecting us," said ONDCP Deputy Director James Carroll. "The awards recognize their innovation in the field that is increasing our effectiveness in confronting the drug traffickers who are poisoning our hard-hit communities. As we work to address an ever-evolving 21st century drug threat, we need the creativity and dynamism that they have demonstrated."

BACKGROUND: The ONDCP USIC Award Program was established in 2003 to recognize the superior performance of our front-line drug interdictors and those who support them. This program has evolved to recognize individuals and units (teams) across the interagency community who have excelled in the United States government's collective efforts to counter drug â€“related transnational organized crime. The award categories and selection criteria encompass the entire interdiction continuum.
