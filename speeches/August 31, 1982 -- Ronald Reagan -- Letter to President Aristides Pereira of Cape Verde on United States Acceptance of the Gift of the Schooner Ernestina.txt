    Dear Mr. President:
The gift of the schooner "Ernestina," restored so carefully by your Government and the ship's many friends, is deeply appreciated. Its presence in New England will be a reminder of the seafaring traditions and special ties that our peoples share.
On behalf of my fellow Americans, to whom you have so thoughtfully given the "Ernestina," let me thank you for an enduring symbol of private endeavor and of effective cooperation between our governments.
As you thoughtfully suggest, let it also be an example for larger cooperation and understanding among the peoples of the world.
Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
[His Excellency Aristides Pereira, President of the Republic of Cape Verde, Praia]
