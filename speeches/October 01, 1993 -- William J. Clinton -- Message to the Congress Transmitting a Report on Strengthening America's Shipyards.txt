    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the requirements of section 1031 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (Public Law 102-484), I transmit herewith a report entitled "Strengthening America's Shipyards: A Plan for Competing in the International Market."
The U.S. shipbuilding industry is unsurpassed in building the finest and most complex naval vessels in the world. Now that the Cold War has ended, these shipyards, like many other defense firms, face a new challengeâ€”translating their skills from the military to the commercial market. Individual shipyards already have begun to meet this challenge. The enclosed report describes steps that the Government is taking and will take to assist their efforts. I look forward to working with the Congress and the industry to ensure a successful transition to a competitive industry in a truly competitive marketplace.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
