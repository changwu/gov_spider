    "Michelle and I are deeply saddened by the tremendous loss of life caused by the earthquake in central China. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families, particularly those who have suffered the terrible loss of a child. I am confident that the Chinese people will respond with characteristic determination in providing relief to those who are suffering, and in helping the affected areas get back on their feet. I urge the American people and the international community to do all that we can to help China respond to this catastrophe."
