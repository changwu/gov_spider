    New Video Highlights the Lifesaving Impact of Governor Bullock's Delayed Entry to the Presidential Race
Helena, MT — Today, as the DNC finalizes who will appear on the June debate stage, Governor Bullock released a new video highlighting the lifesaving impact of his work to expand Medicaid in the final days of the 2019 legislative session.
The video features a Montana woman whose well-being depended on Governor Bullock's success in reauthorizing Medicaid expansion — a significant accomplishment that he achieved even with a nearly 60% Republican legislature and after Big Tobacco spent $26 million against the effort. Were it not for Governor Bullock's decision to delay his entry into the presidential race until mid-May, his Medicaid expansion efforts might not have been successful, and the one-in-ten Montanans who rely on it could have lost their healthcare entirely.
"If I had to choose between chasing 100,000 donors or getting healthcare for 100,000 Montanans — well, that's the easiest decision I'll ever have to make," said Governor Steve Bullock. "More than any other time in my life, our country needs a new leader who can win this election and move our nation forward. As I've done my entire career, that work begins by ridding our system of the corrupting influence of money in politics so we can ensure every American gets a fair shot at success. While 20 candidates are on the debate stage in Miami, I will be talking directly to voters about my record of passing progressive priorities in a state Trump won, the importance of winning the places we lost, and how we are going to beat Donald Trump once and for all."
In addition to expanding Medicaid to nearly 100,000 Montanans, in the final weeks of the legislative session Governor Bullock broke through partisan divisions to pass major investments in infrastructure and public education, ban foreign money from elections, and strengthen protections for Montana's Tribal communities.
