    Louis Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human Services, is an outstanding Cabinet officer who has forcefully and effectively spoken out for the public's health and welfare. His courage is exemplary. President Bush and Chief of Staff Sununu commend his work on behalf of health and social issues, including his leadership for civil rights. He is a role model for black and white youth in America who aspire to high achievement.
Congressman Fortney Stark's bigoted assault on the integrity and ability of Secretary Sullivan is an affront to the Congress and the Democratic Party. We trust the Democratic Party and its chairman, Ron Brown, will disassociate themselves from Congressman Stark's ill-tempered and shameful remarks.
