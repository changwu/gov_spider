    Tyre Nichols should have made it home to his family. Yet, once again, America mourns the life of a son and father brutally cut short at the hands of those sworn to protect and serve. The footage and images released tonight will forever be seared in our memories, and they open wounds that will never fully heal.
The persistent issue of police misconduct and use of excessive force in America must end now.
I join President Biden in his call for accountability and transparency. We must build trust—not fear—within our communities.
Congress must act with urgency and pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. To truly honor Tyre Nichols' memory, and the memory of so many others before him, we must demand that our justice system lives up to its name.
