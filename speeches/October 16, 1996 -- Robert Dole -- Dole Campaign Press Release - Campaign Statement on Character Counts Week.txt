    Dole/Kemp Deputy Press Secretary Christina Martin released the following statement today on Bill Clinton's presidential proclamation naming the week of October 13-19, 1996 as National Character Counts Week:
"Bill Clinton says Character Counts. Let's count along with Bill: 30 top officials investigated or resigned, 4 independent counsels named, 900 confidential FBI files procured, 7 innocent travel office staff fired, 3,000 travel office documents withheld, 1 drug memo hidden, $450,000 in illegal Indonesian contributions solicited, 3 pardons dangled, and $265 billion in new taxes forced on the American people. Finally, the character countdown: 20 days left until ethical leadership returns to the White House in the form of President Bob Dole."
