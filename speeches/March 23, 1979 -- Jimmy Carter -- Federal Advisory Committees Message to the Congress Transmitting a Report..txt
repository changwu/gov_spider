    To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the provisions of Section 6(c) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Public Law 92—463), I am transmitting the seventh annual report on the status of Federal advisory committees.
This report reflects further progress toward accomplishing the objectives I set in 1977: to assure that unnecessary committees are terminated, and new committees are established only when they are essential to meet the responsibilities of the government. At the end of 1978:
—The total number of committees was 816, 59 fewer than at the beginning of the year; and
—Since the beginning of 1977 the total number of committees has been reduced by 343 (from 1,159).
