    Hillary dominates Philadelphia focus group. "NYDIA HAN: The real take away is this. We now know who won the debate according to our focus group. Take a look.

NBC News' Chuck Todd – Obama ‘did not have a good night.' [MSNBC Post-Debate Analysis, 4/16/08]

NBC News' Chuck Todd—Obama's answer on Ayers and the flag ‘were simply weak.'

[NBC First Read, 4/16/08]

New York Times' Katharine Seeyle: Hillary's ‘in her element as she goes into details.' "She's becoming expansive, seemingly in her element as she goes into details; Mr. Obama does not look as thrilled to be still standing there." [New York Times, The Caucus, 4/16/08]
Talking Points Memo's Josh Marshall – Hillary ‘certainly seems more self-assured.' "She certainly seems more self-assured on the Iran question than Obama did.

Philadelphia Inquirer blog – ‘Obama is again less certain, and rambles a bit.' "Obama is again less certain, and rambles a bit when asked about the Washington D.C. gun ban.

NBC News' Matthew Berger – Obama ‘tried to have it both ways' with Israel. "Obama's answer on an Iranian attack on Israel tried to seem to have it both ways: highlight his support for Israel but not lock him into treating an attack on Israel like an attack on the U.S. But it may have looked more like a no because it wasn't a firm yes. Clinton's answer seemed more direct." [NBC First Read, 4/16/08]
