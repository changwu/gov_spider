    NO GROUP is more deserving of national recognition and gratitude than America's teachers.
By your selfless dedication to our sons and daughters in classrooms across the country, you help ensure a successful future by cultivating our most precious resources, and by strengthening the educational system which equips young Americans to become good citizens and leaders in their communities.
Teachers are among the most critically needed, yet least celebrated, members of our society. So it is most fitting that Teacher Remembrance Day provides us the opportunity to recognize the vital contributions you make to our legacy and lives throughout each school year.
I know that Americans everywhere join me in offering special congratulations to the admirable men and women who, with patience and perseverance, develop and direct the talents of America to their fullest potential.
Both individually and as members of a most noble, rewarding profession, you enrich our Nation more than any of us can ever say. And although there is no adequate measure for the daily good you do, I hope that you may always share the satisfaction and joy that accompany a lifetime of service to others.
