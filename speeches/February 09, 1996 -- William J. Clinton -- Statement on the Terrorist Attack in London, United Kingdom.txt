    All Americans join Hillary and me in our outrage at the bomb explosion today in London. I condemn in the strongest possible terms this cowardly action and hope those responsible are brought swiftly to justice. Our hearts and prayers go out to those injured in this terrible blast and to their families.
I am deeply concerned by reports that the Irish Republican Army has announced an end to the cease-fire. For a year and a half, the people of the United Kingdom and Ireland have enjoyed living in peace, free to go about their daily lives without the threat of the bomb and the bullet. As was clear during my visit to Northern Ireland last year, the people want peace. No one and no organization has the right to deny them that wish.
The terrorists who perpetrated today's attack cannot be allowed to derail the effort to bring peace to the people of Northern Irelandâ€”a peace they overwhelmingly support.
The United States stands ready to assist the two Governments in continuing their search for negotiations and peace. Today's action underscores the urgent need for all sides to join in the fight against terrorism and to press forward in that search.
