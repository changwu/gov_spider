    Ahead of her fourth trip to Iowa this week, Senator Gillibrand is proud to announce a new endorsement from Kirsten Anderson, a former Iowa Statehouse staffer who sued the state and won after being sexually harassed on the job.
"Kirsten Anderson is the definition of brave," said Senator Gillibrand. "Her story is a powerful reminder of the systematic changes that need to be made to protect women in the workplace, on college campuses, and in the military. Kirsten is a tireless advocate on this issue, and I'm so proud to earn her support and have her voice on the campaign trail in Iowa."
Senator Gillibrand and Kirsten Anderson will host a special endorsement event this Wednesday, April 17th at HoQ in Des Moines at 6:30 p.m. Senator Gillibrand will hold more than 10 public events during her three-day swing through the state this week, April 17-19, 2019.
