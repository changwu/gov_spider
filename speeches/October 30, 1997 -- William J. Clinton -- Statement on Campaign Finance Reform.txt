    I am very pleased that the Senate has agreed to schedule a vote on campaign finance reform. This will pave the way for the first up-or-down vote ever on the McCain-Feingold bill. At long last, we have an opportunity to give the American people the kind of elections they deserve. I want to commend the entire Democratic caucus and a few brave Republicans, whose steadfastness has now produced the first real opportunity to enact campaign finance reform.
