    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Revision)
(House Rules)(Vento (D) Minnesota and 86 others)
If H.R. 3964 is presented to the President, the Secretary of the Department of Interior, the Attorney General, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget would recommend that he veto the bill. This bill's limitation on the President's authority to remove the Director of the National Park Service, and the exemption from Presidential review of the Director's legislative and budgetary recommendations to Congress, represent an unwise and unconstitutional impairment of the unitary powers of the Executive branch.
