    Today the House of Representatives moved to extend benefits for Americans looking for work, and the President urges the Republican leadership in the Senate to end their obstruction of this critical aid. The attempts by the majority of Republicans in the Senate to play politics with this issue have not only put the livelihoods of thousands of American families at risk, but also has cut off an important source of revenue during our very fragile economic recovery. Getting the American people back to work is the President’s top economic priority, and that’s why we must do more to not only pass aid for state and local governments and tax cuts for businesses, but also to spur private sector job growth. The President will keep pressing Congress to fight for common-sense jobs legislation during this critical time for our economic recovery.
