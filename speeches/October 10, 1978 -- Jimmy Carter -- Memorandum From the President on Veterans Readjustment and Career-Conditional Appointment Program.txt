    Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
A major goal of this Administration has been to insure that employment opportunities for Veterans are concentrated on those areas where there is the most need-Vietnam-era and disabled Veterans.
As you are aware, since 1970, Federal agencies have had the authority to appoint certain Vietnam-era Veterans-generally with less than 14 years formal education and within one year after separation from active dutyâ€”to jobs at levels up through GS-5. In turn, these appointments can be converted to career-conditional positions. Administration supported legislation now pending in House-Senate conference would further extend and liberalize this authority by allowing appointments up to GS-7 and by removing the education limitation for disabled Veterans.
In 1974, the Congress charged the Civil Service Commission with responsibility for the evaluation of this program as it is implemented by your agencies. The Commission is mandated with obtaining, on at least a semi-annual basis, reports from Federal agencies with respect to their records on these Veterans' readjustment appointments and resulting conversions to career-conditional positions.
I am concerned with the wide disparity between agencies in the utilization of Veterans readjustment and resulting careerconditional conversion appointments. While some agencies have done a commendable job others have virtually ignored the Veterans readjustment and career-conditional appointment program. Access to Federal employment can be enhanced for Vietnam-era and disabled Veterans with fuller utilization of the Veterans readjustment appointment authority outlined in 38 U.S.C. section 2014.
I have directed the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission to contact each agency with a request for a specific plan of action to include goals and timetables for the implementation of the Veterans readjustment program. I expect your full cooperation on this matter.
