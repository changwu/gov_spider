VP pool report 1: holding for VP
Good afternoon from the EEOB. I'm on tap for your VP pool today for her event on root causes of migration. We are holding in a conference room adjacent to the Indian Treaty Room.
Below is some background and participants. There were also several fact sheets that went out.
The event is being live streamed on the White House website so I will only send color and any other relevant details I get.
Holler with questions.
On background from a White House official:Today, Vice President Harris announced additional efforts to address the root causes of migration from Northern Central America, including:

Additional commitments from the private sector, bringing the total amount coordinated through the Call-to-Action initiative to $4.2 billion.
The launch of Central America Forward, the next phase of the private-public partnership to address the root causes of migration.
An update from agencies on the implementation of the Root Causes Strategy.

At 2:00pm ET, the Vice President will speak to these commitments at a roundtable with U.S. government leaders and private sector representatives where they will also strategize on next steps. Her remarks will be livestreamed at whitehouse.gov/live.
Today's announcement builds on the Administration's work and Vice President's leadership to address the root causes of migration from Northern Central America (Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala).
The Vice President's work is about thinking long-term while our Administration simultaneously addresses the immediate challenge at the southwest border. Although these are long term efforts and trends fluctuate, over the last eighteen months there has been a decline on the number of individuals encountered at the southwest border from the countries encompassed in the Root Causes Strategy.
The $4.2 billion in commitments is creating economic opportunity for people in Northern Central America, including through jobs, access to the financial system, and connections to the digital economy

VP pool report 3: Remarks over, no questions answered
You saw it live. At the end, Harris ignored two shouted and clearly audible questions from CNN's Jasmine Wright about how the administration would get Congress to act on immigration reform and whether Biden would speak about it in his SOTU speech. She didn't even look up/in our direction as we were ushered out.
Harris spoke standing from a lectern in the corner, flanked by flags. Her seat with her seal was at the short end of the U-shaped table that was packed with attendees. TVs with the virtual attendees were on either side of the room.
During her remarks, the audience was attentive, I saw some occasional note-taking.
Harris returned to her seat to listen to Ajay Banga.
On background from a White House OfficialAdditional speaker is Ajay Banga, Co-Chair, PCA.
