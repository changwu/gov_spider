    Today I am proud to announce my intention to nominate General Philip Breedlove as the next Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and Commander of U.S. European Command. For over three decades, General Breedlove has served with distinction in assignments at all levels of the U.S. Air Force and around the globe, from Washington to Germany, Italy, Spain, and South Korea. As Commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe and the Commander of NATO's Allied Air Command, General Breedlove has established trust and deep relations with our NATO allies and partners, assets he will draw upon in taking on this important new role on behalf of the United States and the alliance.
If confirmed by the Senate, General Breedlove will replace Admiral Jim Stavridis as the Supreme Allied Commander in late Spring. Admiral Stavridis has played an absolutely essential role in strengthening the NATO alliance to meet the challenges of the 21st century, to include enhancing our collective capabilities and partnerships. I am grateful for his steadfast service on behalf of our country and NATO.
