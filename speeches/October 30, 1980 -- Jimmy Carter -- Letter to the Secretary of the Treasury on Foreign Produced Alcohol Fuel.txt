    To Secretary Bill Miller
Foreign produced alcohol should not benefit from the exemption granted to gasohol from the four cent a gallon gasoline tax. This exemption should be applied only to domestically produced alcohol fuel, to encourage the growth of our domestic industry.
I would like this corrected immediately by administrative means if possible, by legislation if necessary.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
