    The United States condemns the attack today in Kabul that killed three Americans working to provide health care to Afghans. Any such attack on civilians at a hospital is despicable and cowardly. We send our deepest condolences to the families of all those killed and injured.
The United States continues to strongly support those in Afghanistan who abhor this violence and are working to build a peaceful, prosperous future for themselves. We remain proud of all Americans serving in Afghanistan, working shoulder-to-shoulder with Afghan partners toward our shared goal of a sovereign, stable, secure, and democratic Afghanistan.
