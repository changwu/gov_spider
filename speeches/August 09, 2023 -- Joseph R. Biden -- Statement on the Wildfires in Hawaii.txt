    Jill and I send our deepest condolences to the families of those who lost loved ones in the wildfires in Maui, and our prayers are with those who have seen their homes, businesses, and communities destroyed. We are grateful to the brave firefighters and first responders who continue to run toward danger, putting themselves in harm's way to save lives.
I have ordered all available Federal assets on the islands to help with response. The Hawaiian National Guard has mobilized Chinook helicopters to help with fire suppression and search and rescue on the island of Maui. The U.S. Coast Guard and Navy 3d Fleet are supporting response and rescue efforts. The U.S. Marines are providing Black Hawk helicopters to fight the fires on the Big Island. The Department of Transportation is working with commercial airlines to evacuate tourists from Maui, and the Department of the Interior and the United States Department of Agriculture stand ready to support postfire recovery efforts.
I urge all residents to continue to follow evacuation orders, listen to the instructions of first responders and officials, and stay alert.
