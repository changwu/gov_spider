    Dear Mr. Chairman:
As you know, I am committed to an open and full review of the ICBM modernization issue. I am confident the review will provide the basis for development of consensus on ICBM modernization. To this end, I want to ensure nothing is done to prejudge the results of the review by favoring one or the other of the alternatives.
As I indicated in my February 17, 1989 letter regarding the ICBM modernization program, we have ensured obligations for the Rail Garrison program will not exceed $250 million before April 3, 1989. Since the national security strategy review will not be completed by that date and since the FY 1989 Authorization and Appropriations Acts allow release of additional ICBM modernization funds after February 15, 1989, I intend to release $120 million to the Rail Garrison program in April.
This will ensure the viability of the Rail Garrison program while not affecting the Small ICBM program, which can proceed without additional funds until the national security strategy review and amendments to the FY 1990/1991 budget are completed.
This obligation of additional funds for Rail Garrison must occur in order to prevent program disruption, substantial cost increases, or significant schedule delays.
This action keeps both programs viable and provides us the flexibility to proceed with the programs as deemed appropriate after completion of the strategy review.
Sincerely,
George Bush
