    We presume you’ve read today’s New York Post, which reveals email exchanges between your son Hunter and Vadym Pozharskyi, adviser to the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma.
What did you discuss with Pozharskyi in your meeting with him in 2015, as described in the emails?
What influence did your son Hunter exert over you to benefit Burisma, as requested in another email?
Do you still stand by your claim that you never discussed Hunter’s foreign business dealings?
