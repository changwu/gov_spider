    Dear Marvin:
In view of your desire expressed to me last month to return to your place on the Court of Claims, I regretfully accept your resignation. I understand that the Chief Justice of the Court is now anxious that you resume your judicial work as soon as possible.
Let me express my own appreciation, and also the thanks of the people of the United States for the hard, conscientious and efficient work you have done as War Food Administrator.
It was a most difficult assignment. The needs of our armed forces, of our Allies, and of our own civilian population called for the highest degree of competence in food production, management and distribution. It is to the everlasting credit of the War Food Administration that even after supplying the great demands made upon us from all over the world, the American people as a whole not only did not go hungry but actually enjoyed a better diet than in the days before the war.
It is an accomplishment of which you can be very proud.
With best wishes for continued success and happiness in your work,Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
