    Paul Ryan today released the following statement on the September unemployment report:  
"Today is a sad indictment of the diminished expectations under President Obama. Far too many Americans are still waiting for their chance in the Obama economy. For those able to find work this month, any job growth is welcome, but this number is once again well below what is needed for America to meet its economic potential. Two-thirds of those who found work took part-time jobs when they are actually seeking full-time ones.  We should not have to settle for this new normal. This is not what a real recovery looks like. We need a real recovery, and Mitt Romney has the detailed plan and leadership to provide it."
