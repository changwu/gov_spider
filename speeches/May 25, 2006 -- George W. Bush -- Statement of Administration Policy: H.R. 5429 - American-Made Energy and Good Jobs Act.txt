    STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House)
(Rep. Pombo (R) CA)
The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 5429, which will provide for the opening of a small portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to environmentally responsible oil and gas exploration and development. The Administration commends the House for acting on this important initiative to address the Nation's critical energy needs. Exploring for additional crude oil supplies in the United States will take pressure off the price of gasoline and ease the burden on America's families. Developing America's own secure domestic supplies of oil will help reduce our reliance on foreign oil. It is expected that the development of this small portion of ANWR will result in up to one million barrels per day of new domestic oil supply at peak production, a nearly 20 percent increase over our current domestic production of crude oil.
The Administration encourages the Senate to promptly consider this important legislation.
