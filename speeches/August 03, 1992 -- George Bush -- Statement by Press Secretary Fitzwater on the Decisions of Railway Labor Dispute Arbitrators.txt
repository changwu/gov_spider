    On July 30 and 31, 1992, the President received for his review the decisions of the arbitrators in three of the four remaining railway labor disputes that led to the nationwide shutdown of the Nation's railroads in late June. These decisions were rendered pursuant to the arbitration process the Congress established in legislation for resolving the disputes. The decisions become final and binding upon the parties unless the President disapproves them within 3 days following their receipt.
The President has decided that he will not disapprove any of the three decisions. The decisions submitted to the President were rendered in the arbitration of the dispute between the International Association of Machinists and the National Railway Carriers' Conference, the arbitration of the dispute between the International Association of Machinists and Amtrak, and the arbitration of the dispute between the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Amtrak.
The President is grateful to the arbitrators for their work in resolving these disputes.
