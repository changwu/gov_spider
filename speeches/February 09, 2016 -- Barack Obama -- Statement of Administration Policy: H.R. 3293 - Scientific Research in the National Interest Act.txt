(House Rules)
(Rep. Smith, R-TX, and 22 cosponsors)
The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 3293, the Scientific Research in the National Interest Act.
The scientific-peer-based, merit-review process that the National Science Foundation (NSF) has in place is widely regarded as the "gold standard" for funding scientific research. In the interest of transparency and accountability, moreover, the NSF publishes online the abstracts of every one of the more than 10,000 research grants it makes every year.
Contrary to its stated purpose, H.R. 3293 would add nothing to accountability in Federal funding for scientific research, while needlessly adding to bureaucratic burdens and overhead at the NSF. And, far from promoting the progress of science in the United States, it would replace the clarity of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 with confusing language that could cast a shadow over the value of basic research which, by its nature, will have outcomes with contributions to national interests other than the progress of science which cannot be predicted in advance.
If the President were presented with H.R. 3293, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.
