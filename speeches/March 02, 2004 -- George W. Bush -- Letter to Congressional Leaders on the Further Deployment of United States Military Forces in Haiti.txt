    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In my report to the Congress of February 25, 2004, I provided information on the deployment of combat-equipped U.S. Armed Forces to Haiti. I am providing this additional report, consistent with the War Powers Resolution, to help ensure that the Congress is kept fully informed on U.S. military activities in Haiti.
On February 29, 2004, approximately 200 additional U.S. combat-equipped, military personnel from the U.S. Joint Forces Command deployed to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to secure key facilities, to facilitate the continued repatriation of Haitian migrants, to help create conditions in the capital for the anticipated arrival of the Multinational Interim Force, to protect American citizens as may be required, and for other purposes consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1529 (2004). I anticipate additional combat-equipped military personnel will be deployed to Haiti until the situation in Haiti stabilizes. The forces that the United States deployed and continues to deploy will be part of the Multinational Interim Force.
The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1529 on February 29, 2004. It authorized the deployment of a Multinational Interim Force to contribute to a more secure and more stable environment in the Haitian capital and elsewhere, to facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance and the access of humanitarian aid workers to the Haitian people, and for other purposes.
It is anticipated U.S. forces will redeploy when the Multinational Interim Force has transitioned to a follow-on United Nations stabilization force.
I have taken this action pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
