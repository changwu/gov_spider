    Looking Back at Clinton's $2 Trillion Tax-and-Spend Shopping
Spree
CLINTON'S $ 2 TRILLION TAB -- A Record Only a Liberal Could Love
From FY 1993 to FY 1996, Bill Clinton proposed 484 new federal spending initiatives. The total price tag for Clinton's liberal spending and pork-barrel projects) whopping $ 2.016 trillion. Those programs would have cost every American family over $ 4,077 a year a total of $ 20,394 per family over five years. (Congressional Budget Office figures based on Clinton budget submissions)
CLINTONCARE --
Take 50 New Bureaucracies and Call Me in the Morning
Bill Clinton's attempt to nationalize the U.S. health care system -- 1/7th of the U.S. economy -- alone would have imposed 17 new taxes, created 50 new government bureaucracies, and added more than $ 1.5 trillion in new federal spending -- and an equivalent amount in new federal taxes. By its second year, the Clintons' socialized medicine scheme would have been larger than any other government program except Social Security and Medicare. (Senate Republican Policy Committee, 9/1 5/94)
THE CLINTON STIMULUS PACKAGE --
Enough Pork to Give You Trichinosis
In one of his first acts as President, Clinton proposed a $ 159 billion spending package to "stimulate" the economy. Among the pork- barrel projects in the Clinton plan were: a casino in Connecticut, an "Art Ark" in San Francisco, a bike path in Oregon, carousel renovations in Rhode Island, a shopping center in Indiana, an alpine slide in Puerto Rico, and an indoor baseball field in Alabama. (Reuters Business Report, 4/22/93; U.S. Senate Republican Policy Committee, 3/25/93; Time Magazine, 4/26/93; San Diego Union-Tribune, 4/11/93)
THE BABBITT RECREATION TAX --
Bikes, Hoots, and Birdseed Present a Tempting Target
Just a week ago, Clinton Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt endorsed a new "sales tax" on almost every piece of equipment used by campers, hikers, sportsmen, and outdoorsmen. Among the many targets of Babbitt's "recreation tax" were backpacks, cameras, motor-homes, canteens, film, mountain bikes, hiking boots, skis, scuba gear, binoculars, and birdseed. (Rocky Mountain New, 9/17/96; Associated Press, 9/17/96)
FUTURE CLINTON TAX INCREASES --
More, Larger, Broader, Higher Taxes
Despite his promises of "targeted" tax cuts, the Clinton plan for a second term includes another massive tax increase. The bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation projects that Clinton's tax proposals for a second term work out to a net new tax increase of $ 64 billion. The reason for the increase is that most of Clinton's tax cuts are temporary, while his tax increases are permanent. (Joint Committee on Taxation)
FUTURE CLINTON SPENDING PROPOSALS --
Building a Bigger Bureaucracy
Bill Clinton's FY 1997 budget and campaign promises include $ 379 billion in spending beyond that in the Dole-Kemp economic plan. For next year alone, Clinton has proposed almost 200 additional new spending initiatives. (Based on CBO estimates for Clinton budget with trigger and CBO estimates for Republican budget with adjustments to reflect details of Dole-Kemp economic plan.)
