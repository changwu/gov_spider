    HOUSTON, Texas — The first official campaign app for a presidential candidate to launch this cycle, the "Cruz Crew" app, which is available on the Apple and Android stores, has been downloaded more than 15,000 times in the three months since it was launched, making it the most popular campaign app of 2016.
"Cruz Crew" members get credit for a range of actions – inviting their friends, sharing campaign messages to social media, volunteering, RSVP'ing to events, and donating – which allows them to unlock unique and special activist badges once they reach certain levels. To date, Cruz Crew members have racked up more than 2.5 million "Action Points" for sending more than 100,000 invites and performing over 67,000 additional individual actions through the app, according to Chris Wilson, Director of Research and Analytics and head of digital strategy.
The Top 10 Cruz Crew activists were recently recognized on the campaign's official Facebook and Twitter account. For the last few weeks, Darrell Greenwald of California has reigned over the leader board, racking up more than 50,000 action points by, among other things, inviting over 2,200 of his friends to support Ted Cruz for President. He will be the first supporter to unlock the new "Patriot" badge in the next version of the app, which will also include groundbreaking new features that will continue to give the Cruz Crew the edge on digital activism.
