    Memorandum for the United States Trade Representative
Subject: Actions Concerning the Generalized System of Preferences
Pursuant to section 504 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the 1974 Act) (19 U.S.C. 2464), I am authorized and to modify the application of duty-free treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) currently being afforded to such beneficiary developing countries as a result of my determinations.
Pursuant to section 504 of the 1974 Act, after considering various requests for a waiver of the application of section 504(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2464((c)) with respect to certain eligible articles, I have determined that it is appropriate to modify the application of duty-free treatment under the GSP currently being afforded to certain articles and to certain beneficiary developing countries.
Specifically, pursuant to section 504(c)(3) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(c)(3)), I have determined that it is appropriate to waive the application of section 504(c) of the 1974 Act with respect to certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing countries. I have received the advice of the United States International Trade Commission on whether any industries in the United States are likely to be adversely affected by such waivers, and I have determined, based on that advice and on the considerations described in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2462(c)), that such waivers are in the national economic interest of the United States. The waivers of the application of section 504(c) of the 1974 Act apply to the eligible articles in the HTS subheadings and the beneficiary developing countries set opposite such HTS subheadings enumerated below.
