    Campaign Announces Grassroots Drive To Reach One Million Supporters; Millionth Supporter Will Hit Campaign Trail With Hillary
As Hillary galvanizes grassroots support across the country, her campaign announced the "One Million Making History" drive today to sign up Hillary's one millionth supporter.
Hillary's one millionth supporter and a current supporter will be given a chance to hit the campaign trail with Hillary, joining her and her staff for a whirlwind day of campaigning.
"Every letter of support you've sent, every dollar you've contributed, every friend you've recruited, every blog you've written, every house party you've attended, every petition you've signed, every time you've shown your support, every one of these actions is the heart and soul of my campaign," Clinton said.
Within 48 hours of launching her campaign, 100,000 people signed up to join Hillary's effort. Six months later, the campaign is closing in on one million supporters, with more than 981,000 signed up today.
Grassroots support for Hillary's historic candidacy is broad and deep. Supporters have joined Hillary's email list, filled out supporter cards at rallies, made donations, signed up to volunteer, joined Women for Hillary, added their names to online petitions and held hundreds of debate watch parties.
