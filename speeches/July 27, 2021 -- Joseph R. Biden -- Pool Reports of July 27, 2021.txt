WH pool report 13 -- color from ODNI building 
The ODNI building lives out in the Tysons neighborhood, and is decorated in a standard government office building fashion. Signs warning "MEDIA IN THE AREA" were arranged along our route up the stairs to the watch floor of the National Counterterrorism Watch Center.
The watch floor is arranged like a mission control room, with large video monitors on the walls, and digital clocks showing the 24-hour time in Los Angeles, DC, Zulu (UTC), Zurich, Pacific, Mountain, Central and Eastern zones.
There are dozens of desks, each with big Dell monitors, and a second level in the rear, accessible via a metal spiral staircase.
The auditorium was the ground floor, and had about 200 seats arranged in nine rows, some 20 seats per row, descending down to the stage.
The stage was arranged with a lectern, with a small presidential seal attached to the front. Teleprompters were arranged in front, left and right; behind it were 20 flags; one each from the 17 agencies with intelligence components, one for DHS. Directly behind the lectern was the US flag, and a dark flag labeled "United States Intelligence Community," with a compass rose beneath.
Some 120 ODNI staff were in the seats, skipping every other seat for social distancing.
Biden was accompanied by his national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines during his visit. When Haines introduced Biden for his remarks, she referred to the building as "Liberty Crossing."

He was asked a follow-up question, in which he again urged people to get vaccinated.
