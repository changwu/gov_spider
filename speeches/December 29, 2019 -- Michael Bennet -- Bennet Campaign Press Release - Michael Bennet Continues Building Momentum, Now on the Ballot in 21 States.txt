    DENVER — Bennet for America announced today that Michael Bennet is on the presidential primary ballot in 21 states. This represents states ranging the First in the Nation primary in New Hampshire up through the March 24th primary in Georgia.
Bennet — who worked in business and as the superintendent of the Denver Public Schools before joining the Senate — has focused his campaign on building opportunity for all Americans and restoring integrity to our government.
"As poll after poll has shown us, this race is wide open, and I'm in this for the long haul," said Bennet. "My campaign is focused on talking to voters where they are, in living rooms and coffee shops across the country, about what we need to do to build a better future for our kids. As the only candidate to win two races in a swing state, I know what it takes to win in tough places like Michigan and Arizona and what it's going to take to beat Donald Trump in 2020. I'm in this to win it."
