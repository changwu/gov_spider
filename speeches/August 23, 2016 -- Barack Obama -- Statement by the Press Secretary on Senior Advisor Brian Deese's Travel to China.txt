    Senior Advisor to the President Brian Deese is currently in Beijing to meet with senior Chinese officials, including Executive Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli and Special Representative for Climate Change Xie Zhenhua, in advance of President Obama's visit to China next month. They will consult on key international climate change issues, including the implementation of the Paris Agreement and our mutual efforts to secure an amendment to the Montreal Protocol and to adopt a market based measure to reduce emissions from international aviation. Over the past three years, the United States and China have adopted strong domestic measures, and partnered to galvanize global action, to combat climate change. These meetings are further evidence of the continuing bilateral engagement on this issue.
