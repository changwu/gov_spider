MITT ROMNEY: "You see, President Obama raised up the white flag of surrender again yesterday. He said you can't change Washington from the inside; you have to do it from the outside. We're going to give him that chance. He's going outside. Last time around -- last time around, his campaign slogan was 'Yes, we can.' I'm afraid it's changing now to, 'no, he can't.' And we're going to take back the White House. Washington is broken. Washington is broken. There's so much we need Washington to do. We have 23 million people out of work. Incomes have been declining for four years in a row. Eight percent unemployment for over -- how many, 43 months. Right here in Las Vegas and in Nevada you've seen housing prices bumping along the bottom, record numbers of foreclosures. These are tough times, yet we have a president who says he can't fix Washington. I can. I will lead. I'll get the job done."
