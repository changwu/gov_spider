FLOTUS Pool Report #3 - Denver, CO
10:10: Panel wraps up. First Lady heard from Democrat and Republican state lawmakers. Democrat state Sen. Jeff Bridges calls it an "opportunity to brag" about how the state used the federal money to invest in job training.
It ended with several students in the audience talking about how they benefited from the state Care Forward Colorado program, which was paid for with federal money. The program specifically helped community college students earn certificates for entry-level healthcare jobs.
First Lady interacted with questioners mostly with how President's programs played a role, praised bipartisan work evidenced by the discussion, and thanked health care workers and those pursuing those careers.
She exited the panel with a joke about lawmakers -- who have about a month left in the legislative session -- also needing to get to work as she heads to her next stop.
The legislative delegation in attendance, per the White House, follows. Many more lawmakers had been on the scene to greet the First Lady.
· Lieutenant Governor Dianne Primavera  · Colorado Assistant Minority Leader Rose Pugliese  · Colorado State Senator Janet Buckner  · Colorado State Senator Perry Will · Colorado State Senator Jeff Bridges  · Colorado Senate Minority Leader Paul Lundeen  · Colorado State Representative Matthew Martinez  · Colorado State Representative Don Wilson  · Colorado House Majority Leader Monica Duran  · Colorado Senate President Steve Fenberg  · Colorado Senate Majority Leader Dominick Moreno · Colorado House Minority Leader Mike Lynch · Colorado State Representative Rachel Zenzinger

FLOTUS Pool Report #4 - Denver, CO
By request, full quote from the First Lady regarding the NCAA championship. She said she was in attendance for the game yesterday.
"It was so exciting, wasn't it? It was such a great game. I'm old enough that I remember when we got title IX. We fought so hard, right? We fought so hard. And look at where women's sports have come today."
(Break for applause).
"Congratulations to both teams. I know we'll have the champions come to the White House, we always do. So, we hope LSU will come. But, you know, I'm going to tell Joe I think Iowa should come, too, because they played such a good game."
Biden then mentioned "sportsmanship" but the exact quote is inaudible over applause.
