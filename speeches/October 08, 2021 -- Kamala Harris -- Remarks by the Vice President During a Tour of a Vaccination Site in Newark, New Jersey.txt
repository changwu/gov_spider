    Q: Madam Vice President -- Madam Vice President, we're seeing now (inaudible) booster shots are outpacing people who are getting first doses. What does that say about --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Listen --
Q: What is the message --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Let me -- the message is this: Vaccines will save your life.
When you look at the people who are currently in hospitals, in ICU rooms, who are near death -- it breaks my heart -- I'm sure all of us -- when we see those videos of folks who are on what it turns out to be their deathbed, begging the people they know, "Please, get vaccinated."
And here's the thing: For any of us who have had that awful experience of holding the hand of somebody we love while they're in an ICU bed -- none of us should want to put anybody we love through that. And the way to do that is: Get vaccinated. It's free, it is cheap, and it will save your life, period.
And that's why I'm here. And to applaud the governor and Mayor Baraka, and the -- the executive of the county, and the congressmember for all the work that they have been doing here in New Jersey as a model of what we can do and continue to do around the country.
But we cannot give up. We have to be vigorous.
