WH Pool Report #5 - Lid and readout of faith leaders call
Have a good Friday night (safe and socially distanced at home of course).
Readout of the President's Call with Faith Leaders
Today, President Donald J. Trump spoke with leaders from multiple faiths and expressed his eagerness to get churches, synagogues, mosques and all houses of worship back open as soon possible. The President spent more than an hour speaking with them and the conversation included comments about the many ways President Trump has delivered on his promise to fight for the freedoms and values of religious Americans. The Faith leaders explained the innovative ways they have continued worshiping, ministering, and caring for their fellow Americans while also practicing social distancing, and they discussed their plans for the future as they follow the new guidelines announced yesterday. The President mentioned his memories as a young child attending Billy Graham's service at Yankee Stadium, and acknowledged that while he has enjoyed watching services online from the White House, he told the faith leaders it is important for people to soon be able to once again come together, pray, and worship.
The following faith leaders were expected to join the call:
