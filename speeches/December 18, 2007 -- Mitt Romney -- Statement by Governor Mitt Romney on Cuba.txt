Boston, MA â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney issued the following statement on Cuban dictator Fidel Castro's comments that he may not return to power in Cuba:
"Even if Fidel Castro does not return to power, Cuba's government remains the brutal regime that he founded nearly 49 years ago. Regardless of his newfound desire to not 'obstruct the path of younger people,' the fact remains that Cuba's youth are currently subject to constant surveillance, harassment and violence for demanding their freedom and are among the many political prisoners in Cuba today.
"CAMBIO is desperately needed in Cuba, not a succession of power to Raul Castro or the next generation of Castro cronies. Cuba's future should be shaped by its freedom-loving youth. We must maintain our current policy until the Castro regime is dismantled, all political prisoners are freed and a transition to free and fair elections takes place."
