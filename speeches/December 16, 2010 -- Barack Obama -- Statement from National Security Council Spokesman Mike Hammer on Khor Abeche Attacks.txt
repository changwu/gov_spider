    The United States is deeply concerned about reports that the Sudanese Armed Forces attacked and burnt the village of Khor Abeche in South Darfur. According to the United Nations, the attacks left many injured, some dead, and thousands displaced. The United States condemns this attack on civilians.
This attack comes at a time that we are also seeing increased evidence of support to militant proxies from the Governments of Sudan and Southern Sudan. All Sudanese leaders have a responsibility to protect civilian populations - to do otherwise is unacceptable. As the January 9, 2011 referendum on the status of Southern Sudan approaches and Sudanese leaders engage in discussions about their future relationship with the international community, the Governments of Sudan and Southern Sudan must accept this fundamental responsibility.
