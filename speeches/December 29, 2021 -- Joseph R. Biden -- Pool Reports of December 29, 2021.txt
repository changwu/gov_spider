Travel pool #2 — background on holiday Covid response
Per the White House:
Updates on the Biden Administration's COVID surge response activities happening throughout the holidays:

The Biden Administration has shipped 1 million gloves, 342,000 masks, respirators, and face shields, and 40,000 gowns for frontline health care workers in the past two weeks.


Staff, supplies, and resources are currently being deployed across the country. For example:




Arizona: On Christmas Eve, 20 FEMA paramedics began providing clinical support across the State, and next week, nearly 40 more medical personnel arrive to help administer treatments in Maricopa and Pima counties, as well as in Tribal communities.






Indiana: On Christmas Day, 23 military medical personnel started their mission at University Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis.






New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Washington, DC: On New Year's Day, a new Federally-run free testing site will open in New Jersey; more sites will open across the next several days in Philadelphia and Washington, DC.






New Mexico: On Monday, 15 medical personnel from the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps arrived to provide surge support in Indian Country. Today, we're sending 15 ventilators to the State, and next week, 12 Federal medical personnel will arrive to help get shots in arms.






New York: Last week, 60 FEMA medical personnel and 30 ambulances arrived to help transport patients to hospitals around the state and balance patient loads. And in New York City, the Administration has established nine Federally-run free testing sites, with three more sites opening on Sunday.






Wisconsin: On Friday, a 23-person military medical team is scheduled to start its support mission at Bellin Hospital in Green Bay.



To date, the Federal Government has helped more than 30 States and territories, and deployed over 2,100 Federal personnel and thousands of ventilators, ambulances, and other critical supplies. In addition, more than 13,000 National Guard members have been activated in 48 states to support vaccinations, testing, and clinical care. These deployments are fully paid for by the Federal Government — thanks to the President's actions.
