    Mitt Romney today announced the support of former Mayor Rudy Giuliani.Â 
"I'm very proud to earn the support of such a distinguished leader and public servant to our country," said Mitt Romney. "Rudy's successes in turning around New York City are well-known and his name is synonymous with leadership, uniting a city in the aftermath of the worst terrorist attack in our nation's history. I look forward to his help in the months ahead as I work to restore America's promise and reverse President Obama's failed policies."
"When I look at where we are as a nation and the challenges we face, I am convinced that Mitt Romney will provide a clear contrast to President Obama," said Rudy Giuliani. "Whether it was creating jobs in business, rescuing the Olympics, or turning around Massachusetts' $3 billion budget deficit, he has proved, time and again, that he excels at turning around difficult situations. He has also proposed a bold economic plan that will help families that have been crushed by President Obama's failed policies. With his plan to create more jobs, reduce our debt, and scale back the size of government, America will be back on the road to prosperity. I'm proud to support Mitt Romney and encourage all those who worry about our country's future to do the same."
