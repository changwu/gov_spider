This from Judd Deere:
Today, President Donald J. Trump spoke by telephone with leaders of American network service providers on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. President Trump thanked them and their staffs for their tireless work to keep Americans connected during this time of social distancing. While Americans are using the internet to work, learn, shop, and connect with loved ones at unprecedented rates, our free-market based networks remain strong, secure, and the envy of the world. The President thanked these leaders for not only rising to the increased demand, but extending services to all Americans at no additional cost and for waiving bills and late fees for those experiencing financial hardship. President Trump thanked network service providers for joining other industries like manufacturing, banking, technology, and healthcare to answer his call for an all-of-America response to this pandemic.
