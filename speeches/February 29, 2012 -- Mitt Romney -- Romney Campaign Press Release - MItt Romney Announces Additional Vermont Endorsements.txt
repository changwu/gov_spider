    Mitt Romney today announced additional endorsements in Vermont.
"My growing support in Vermont is a sign that my pro-growth message is resonating in the state," said Mitt Romney. "Voters in Vermont and across the country are tired of the broken promises from Washington. I spent my life outside Washington, working in the private sector, and know what it will take to turn around our economy. I look forward to working with these fine leaders from Vermont to defeat President Obama and bring change to the broken Washington system."
"Vermont voters are looking for someone to go to Washington, turn around our economy and fix the fiscal mess that Washington politicians have created," said former Lieutenant Governor Brian Dubie. "Mitt Romney is the one candidate with the track record and economic plan to do just that. With Mitt Romney as president, Vermont voters can be confident that we will have more jobs, smaller government and less debt."
