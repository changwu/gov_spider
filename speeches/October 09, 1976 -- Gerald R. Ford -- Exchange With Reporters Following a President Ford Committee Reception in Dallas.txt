    REPORTER. Hi, Mr. President. What kind of day has it been for you?
THE PRESIDENT. It has been a tremendous day in Texas. I don't think we could have had a better day. The response from literally thousands and thousands of people in Texas has been very, very encouraging--the State Fair, the football game, and the wonderful rally here. We are very, very encouraged about Texas, and we're delighted to be here.
Q. Mr. President, how do you assess your chances in Texas in November?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, we're an underdog, but I think we're going to surprise some people. Real nice to see you all.
REPORTER. Thank you very much.
