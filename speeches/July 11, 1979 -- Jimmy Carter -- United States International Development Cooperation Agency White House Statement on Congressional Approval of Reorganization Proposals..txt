    President Carter today expressed his appreciation for the approval given by the Congress of his proposals for reorganizing and strengthening the management of U.S. foreign economic development activities.
Noting that these proposals largely adopted suggestions of the late Senator Hubert Humphrey, the President said he wished to especially thank Chairmen Zablocki and Brooks of the responsible House committees and Chairmen Church and Ribicoff of the Senate committees for their leadership in achieving congressional support for the reorganization.
The President said the administration can now move ahead to establish the International Development Cooperation Agency (IDCA), the centerpiece of his plan to improve the programs and policies affecting the developing nations.
The principal components of the IDCA will be the Agency for International Development, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the proposed Institute for Scientific and Technological Cooperation. The President hopes the Congress soon will complete action to establish this Institute, which will help developing countries create and adapt technologies capable of reducing their enormous problems in such fields as health, food, and energy.
