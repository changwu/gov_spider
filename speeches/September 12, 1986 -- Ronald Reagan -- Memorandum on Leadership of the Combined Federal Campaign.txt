    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
The spirit of America was celebrated this summer at the Statue of Liberty celebration. Let us all take the opportunity provided by the 1986-1987 Combined Federal Campaign to demonstrate once again the American spirit of voluntary giving. As leaders in the Federal government, it is important that we take visible leadership roles in the Campaigns in our agencies.
It gives me great pleasure to announce that the Secretary of Labor, William E. Brock III, has agreed to serve as Chairman of the 1986-1987 Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area. I am asking that you support Secretary Brock by personally serving as Chairman of the Campaign in your agency and appointing a top official as your Vice Chairman. Please advise Secretary Brock of your willingness to serve and the name of the person you designate.
The single most important ingredient in making the Combined Federal Campaign a success is active involvement by top leadership. Consequently, your personal interest, visible support and participation are essential. Thousands of Federal employees participate, but many others remain on the sidelines. Make a special effort to encourage all of your employees, in the Washington area, elsewhere in the United States, and at their worldwide duty stations, to support the Campaign.
With your leadership, we can make this fall's campaign a resounding success.
RONALD REAGAN
