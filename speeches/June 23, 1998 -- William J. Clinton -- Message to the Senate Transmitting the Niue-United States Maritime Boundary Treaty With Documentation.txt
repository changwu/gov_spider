    To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, the Treaty Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Niue on the Delimitation of Maritime Boundary. The Treaty was signed in Wellington May 13, 1997. The report of the Department of State is enclosed for the information of the Senate.
The sole purpose of the Treaty is to establish a maritime boundary in the South Pacific Ocean between the United States territory of American Samoa and Niue. The 279-mile boundary runs in a general east-west direction, with the United States islands of American Samoa to the north, and Niue to the south. The boundary defines the limit within which the United States and Niue may exercise maritime jurisdiction, which includes fishery and other exclusive economic zone jurisdiction.
Niue is in free association with New Zealand. Although it is self-governing on internal matters, Niue conducts its foreign affairs in conjunction with New Zealand. Niue has declared, and does manage, its exclusive economic zone. Therefore, the United States requested, and received, confirmation from New Zealand that the Government of Niue had the requisite competence to enter into this agreement with the United States and to undertake the obligations contained therein.
I believe this Treaty to be fully in the interest of the United States. It reflects the tradition of cooperation and close ties with Niue in this region. This boundary was never disputed.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this Treaty and advice and consent to ratification.
