DOROTHY RODHAM: What I would like people to know about Hillary is what a good person she is.
She never was envious of anybody - she was helpful. And she's continued that with her adult life with helping other women.
She has empathy for other people's unfortunate circumstances. I've always admired that because it isn't always true of people.
I think she ought to be elected even if she weren't my daughter.
HILLARY CLINTON: I'm Hillary Clinton and I approved this message.
