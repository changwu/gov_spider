    Former Iowa Senate President and Ambassador Mary Kramer made the following statement on tonight's debate in Iowa:
"Mitt Romney showed again tonight that he has the conservative record and experience that Iowans and voters across the country are looking for in our nominee and president. Throughout this campaign and throughout his life, Mitt Romney has displayed the steadfast leadership needed to fix the economic mess that President Obama has created. Whether it is on creating jobs, the top concern facing our country, or keeping America strong overseas, Mitt Romney's record and policies stand head and shoulders above the rest of the field."
