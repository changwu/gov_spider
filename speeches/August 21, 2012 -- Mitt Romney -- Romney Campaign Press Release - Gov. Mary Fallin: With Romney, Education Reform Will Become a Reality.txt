    Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin today made the following statement on Mitt Romney's plan for education reform:
"Education is the key to entrepreneurship, innovation, and the American Dream.  Mitt Romney understands that our current system is failing too many children. He's committed to renovating America's education system, not merely reforming it. He knows that it needs more than a cosmetic do-over. It needs an overhaul that President Obama has been unwilling to deliver – one that puts students and parents ahead of administrators and unions. With Mitt Romney in the White House, real education reform will become a reality."
