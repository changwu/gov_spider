    I want to express my deep appreciation to the FBI, CIA, and the Departments of State, Justice, and Defense for their extraordinary work in bringing Mir Aimal Kansi to the United States. Kansi is believed to be responsible for the killing of two CIA employees and the wounding of three others in an attack on January 25, 1993. The men and women who participated in the effort to bring Kansi here showed great courage in carrying out this mission.
The success in apprehending Kansi demonstrates that we are determined to do what is necessary to track down terrorists and bring them to justice. The United States will not relent in the pursuit of those who use violence against Americans to advance their goalsâ€”no matter how long it takes, no matter where they hide.
Today our thoughts are also with the families of the victims. Although nothing can restore their loss, we hope that the prospect of justice in this case will bring them a measure of comfort.
