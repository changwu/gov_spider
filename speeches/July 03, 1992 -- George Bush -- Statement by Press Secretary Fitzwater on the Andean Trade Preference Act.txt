    President Bush today proclaimed Bolivia and Colombia to be beneficiary countries under the Andean Trade Preference Act of 1991 (ATPA). These are the first two countries to be designated under the ATPA.
The ATPA is designed to help encourage a transition from the production of illicit drugs to legitimate products in the Andean countries. Under the Act, beneficiary countries may export a wide range of products to the United States on a duty-free or preferential tariff basis.
The President's action helps fulfill a commitment he made at the 1990 Cartagena drug summit to improve access to the U.S. market for exports from Andean countries. It is one element of the Bush administration's war against international drug trafficking. The administration is continuing its review of the status of other potential beneficiaries, Peru and Ecuador.
