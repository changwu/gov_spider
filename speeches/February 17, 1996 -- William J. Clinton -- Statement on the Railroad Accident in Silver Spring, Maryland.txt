    Today all Americans extend our thoughts and prayers to the families of the people who died in the train crash last night. We are working hard to find out what caused this tragedy.
Several young men and women who died were Job Corps trainees, returning from a training center in West Virginiaâ€”taking a journey of personal responsibility. They were working hard to better themselves, and we salute their lives as we mourn their deaths.
