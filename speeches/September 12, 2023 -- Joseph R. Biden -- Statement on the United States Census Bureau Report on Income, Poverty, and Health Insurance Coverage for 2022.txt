    Today's Census report shows the dire consequences of congressional Republicans' refusal to extend the enhanced child tax credit, even as they advance costly corporate tax cuts. We cut child poverty by nearly half to record lows for all children in this Nation largely by expanding the child tax credit. Last year, congressional Republicans insisted on raising taxes on families with children. The rise reported today in child poverty is no accident; it is the result of a deliberate policy choice congressional Republicans made to block help for families with children while advancing massive tax cuts for the wealthiest and largest corporations. No child should grow up in poverty, and I will continue to fight to restore the expanded child tax credit to give tens of millions of families the tax relief and breathing room they deserve.
